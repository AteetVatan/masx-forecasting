    "text": "Ssu-ma Ch‘ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzu:\nSun Tzu Wu was a native of the Ch‘i State. His ART OF WAR brought him to the notice of Ho Lu, King of Wu. Ho Lu said to him: \"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your theory of managing soldiers to a slight test?\" Sun Tzu replied: \"You may.\" Ho Lu asked: \"May the test be applied to women?\" The answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to bring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, and placed one of the King’s favorite concubines at the head of each. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and addressed them thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front and back, right hand and left hand?\" The girls replied: Yes. Sun Tzu went on: \"When I say 'Eyes front,' you must look straight ahead. When I say 'Left turn,' you must face towards your left hand. When I say 'Right turn,' you must face towards your right hand. When I say 'About turn,' you must face right round towards your back.\" Again the girls assented. The words of command having been thus explained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the drill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \"Right turn.\" But the girls only burst out laughing.\nSun Tzu said: \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame.\" So he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \"Left turn,\" whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of laughter. Sun Tzu: \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders ARE clear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.\" So saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded. Now the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised pavilion; and when he saw that his favorite concubines were about to be executed, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following message: \"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to handle troops. If We are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and drink will lose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be beheaded.\" Sun Tzu replied: \"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to be the general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty which, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\" Accordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed the pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been done, the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went through all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left, marching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect accuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzu sent a messenger to the King saying: \"Your soldiers, Sire, are now properly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty’s inspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire; bid them go through fire and water, and they will not disobey.\" But the King replied: \"Let our general cease drilling and return to camp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\" Thereupon Sun Tzu said: \"The King is only fond of words, and cannot translate them into deeds.\" After that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzu was one who knew how to handle an army, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the Ch‘u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he put fear into the States of Ch‘i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad amongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzu shared in the might of the King.",

    "text": "About Sun Tzu himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien has to tell us in this chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant, Sun Pin... To return to the elder Sun Tzu. He is mentioned in two other passages of the SHIH CHI... From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the other... It is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch‘ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun Wu as an historical personage... It will not be necessary, therefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH‘UN CH‘IU...  The only new points in it worth noting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is called a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his ability. The following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: \"When sovereign and ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe.\" Assuming that this work is genuine..., we have here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu...\nLiu Hsiang...says...Teng Ming-shih informs us...\nAccording to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which...may be dismissed as chronolo- gical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them. An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is the short preface written by the Great Ts‘ao Ts‘ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzu. I shall give it in full:\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage... In military matters, the Sage’s rule is normally to keep the peace, and to move his forces only when occasion requires. He will not use armed force unless driven to it by necessity. Many books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work composed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all... In his treatment of deliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into practice the smaller details in which his work abounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the motive which has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.",

    "text": "One thing to be noticed...is the explicit statement that the 13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu... In the bibliographic section of the HAN SHU, there is an entry which has given rise to much discussion... It is evident that this cannot be merely the 13 chapters known to Ssu-ma Ch‘ien...  Between Ssu-ma Ch‘ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of Sun Tzu... There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of Ssu-ma Ch‘ien practically as we have them now... But as we go further back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO CHUAN...makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu... It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the SHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the following disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin...\nCh‘en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note: Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art... He also says: The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch‘i may be of genuine antiquity. It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch‘en Chen-sun, while rejecting the per- sonality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch‘ien’s history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the work which passes under his name...",

    "text": "…than that the acknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified with that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain conceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out by him… It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun Tzu’s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this necessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered experience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense military activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign. If he rose to be a general at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned. He was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s sudden collapse in the following year. Yueh’s attack at this critical juncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end, rather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at Tsuili. If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate which decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.",

    "section": "The Text of Sun Tzu",
    "text": "I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu’s text. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the \"13 chapters\" of which Ssu-ma Ch‘ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from discussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface: “During the Ch‘in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu’s ART OF WAR was in general use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write a commentary on it.” As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts‘ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T‘ang and Sung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep in. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief commentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T‘ien-pao published a work in 15 CHUAN entitled \"Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers.\" There was another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing-yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circulation. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field was one derived from Chi T‘ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that important work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which appears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU CHIN T‘U SHU CHI CH‘ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the \"Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch‘in dynasties\" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s first edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu, accidentally discovered a copy of Chi T‘ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the Hua-yin temple. Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, mentioned in the T‘UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the \"original edition (or text)\" – a rather misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity. Chi T‘ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older than the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T‘UNG TIEN, Tu Yu’s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T‘AI P‘ING YU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into fragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of different sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the T‘UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T‘ang dynasty, the value of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text.",

    "text": "march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the town of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch‘in army. The King of Chao ﬁrst consulted Lien P‘o on the advisability of attempting a relief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the intervening country too rugged and difﬁcult. His Majesty then turned to Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but ﬁnally said: \"We shall be like two rats ﬁghting in a whole–and the pluckier one will win!\" So he left the capital with his army, but had only gone a distance of 30 LI when he stopped and began throwing up entrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his fortiﬁcations, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence to the enemy. The Ch‘in general was overjoyed, and attributed his adversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the Han State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies had no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for two days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A crushing defeat followed for the Ch‘in forces, who were obliged to raise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.\n\n5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.\n\n6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach a ﬂying column for the purpose involves the sacriﬁce of its baggage and stores.\n\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.\n\n9. If you march ﬁfty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your ﬁrst division, and only half your force will reach the goal.\n\n10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive.\n\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage- train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.",

A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.\n\n30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:–this is the art of retaining self-possession.\n\n31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:–this is the art of husbanding one’s strength.\n\n32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and conﬁdent array:– this is the art of studying circumstances.\n\n33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.\n\n34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates ﬂight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.\n\n35. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.\n\n36.

    "text": "11. All armies prefer high ground to low... and sunny places to dark.\n12. If you are careful of your men... and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind... and this will spell victory.\n13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground.\n14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides.\n15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows... should be left with all possible speed and not approached.\n16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to approach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear.\n17. If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking...\n18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position...\n19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious for the other side to advance...\n20. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a bait.\n21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is advancing... The appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means that the enemy wants to make us suspicious...\n22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade... Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.\n23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry... When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping...\n24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance... Violent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that he will retreat.\n25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on the wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot...\n27. When there is much running about... and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come.\n28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food.\n30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst...\n31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied... Clamor by night betokens nervousness.\n33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general’s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary...\n34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food... and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death...\n35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in subdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\n36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources... too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress...\n37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence...\n38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce...\n39. If the enemy’s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection...\n40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply sufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made... What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements...\n41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them...\n42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless.\n43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline... This is a certain road to victory.\n44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\n45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed... the gain will be mutual...",

    "text": "1. Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground... (2) entangling ground... (3) temporizing ground... (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy...\n2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called ACCESSIBLE.\n3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies... Then you will be able to fight with advantage.\n4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called ENTANGLING.\n5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue.\n6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called TEMPORIZING ground...\n7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait... it will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus enticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come out, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n8. With regard to NARROW PASSES, if you can occupy them first, let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy...\n9. Should the army forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after him if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly garrisoned.\n10. With regard to PRECIPITOUS HEIGHTS, if you are beforehand with your adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there wait for him to come up...\n11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away...\n12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle... and fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n13. These six are the principles connected with Earth... The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them.\n14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5) disorganization; (6) rout.\n15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the FLIGHT of the former.\n16. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is INSUBORDINATION... When the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the result is COLLAPSE...\n17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on meeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is in a position to fight, the result is RUIN...\n18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are not clear and distinct... when there are no fixes duties assigned to officers and men... and the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is utter DISORGANIZATION.\n19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy’s strength, allows an inferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank, the result must be ROUT...\n20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully noted by the general who has attained a responsible post...\n21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally... but a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of victory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and distances, constitutes the test of a great general.\n22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into practice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practices them, will surely be defeated.\n23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler’s bidding...\n24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace... whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom...\n25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death...\n26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority felt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable, moreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to spoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose...\n27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory...\n28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory...\n29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory.\n30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss...\n31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete...",

Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens–all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy’s way. On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. On serious ground, gather in plunder.

When the enemy’s men were united, they managed to keep them in disorder. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when otherwise, they stopped still. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin by seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be amenable to your will.\" Rapidity is the essence of war: take advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected routes, and attack unguarded spots. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading force: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be the solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail against you. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with food. Carefully study the well-being of your men, and do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your strength.

For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps the right. Hence it is not enough to put one’s trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.

At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going.

The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied.

When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.

More than a hundred of Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely.\" [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story from.

Several of the commentators accept this as an alternative deﬁnition; but that it is not what Sun Tzu meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (ss. 21 sqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used with conspicuous success:\n(1) by T‘ien Tan in his defense of Chi-mo (see supra, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57); and by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P‘o was conducting a defensive campaign against Ch‘in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P‘o’s cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to avert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to the reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were already in Fan Chu’s pay.",

SURVIVING SPIES, ﬁnally, are those who bring back news from the en- emy’s camp. [This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a regu- lar part of the army. Tu Mu says: \"Your surviving spy must be a man of keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby exterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy.\" Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta‘hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: \"When he was governor of Eastern Ch‘in, Shen-wu of Ch‘i made a hostile move- ment upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T‘ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, hap- pening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of dis- cipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible information about the en- emy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was able to inﬂict a severe defeat on his adversary.\"]",

    "text": "14. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. [Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch‘en point out that the spy is privileged to enter even the general’s private sleeping-tent.] None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved. [Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be carried \"mouth-to-ear.\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander: \"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor should they know one another. When they propose anything very material, secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their ﬁdelity. Never communicate anything to them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. 2 ]\n15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity. [Mei Yao-ch‘en says: \"In order to use them, one must know fact from falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and double-dealing.\" Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more along the lines of \"intu- itive perception\" and \"practical intelligence.\" Tu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves: \"Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of character and the extent of their experi- ence and skill.\" But he continues: \"A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such.\" So that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the passage.\"]\n16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightfor- wardness. [Chang Yu says: \"When you have attracted them by substantial offers, you must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for you with all their might.\"]\n17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports. [Mei Yao-ch‘en says: \"Be on your guard against the possibility of spies going over to the service of the enemy.\"]\n18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business. [Cf. VI. ss. 9.]\n19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told.",

    "text": "20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to assassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by ﬁnding out the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp, [Literally \"visitors\", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to \"those whose duty it is to keep the general supplied with information,\" which naturally neces- sitates frequent interviews with him.] and door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must be commissioned to ascertain these. [As the ﬁrst step, no doubt towards ﬁnding out if any of these important functionaries can be won over by bribery.]\n21. The enemy’s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out, temp- ted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will become converted spies and available for our service.\n22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we are able to acquire and employ local and inward spies. [Tu Yu says: \"through conversion of the enemy’s spies we learn the en- emy’s condition.\" And Chang Yu says: \"We must tempt the converted spy into our service, because it is he that knows which of the local inhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the ofﬁcials are open to corruption.\"]\n23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy. [Chang Yu says, \"because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be deceived.\"]\n24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on ap- pointed occasions.\n25. The end and aim of spying in all its ﬁve varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the ﬁrst instance, from the converted spy. [As explained in ss. 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.] Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost lib- erality.",

Its name was changed to Yin by P‘an Keng in 1401. was due to I Chih [Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part in Ch‘eng T‘ang’s campaign against Chieh Kuei.] who had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty was due to Lu Ya [Lu Shang rose to high ofﬁce under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he af- terwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T‘ai Kung, a title be- stowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on war, erroneously identiﬁed with the LIU T‘AO.] who had served under the Yin.\n27. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. [Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \"Just as water, which carries a boat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so reliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the cause of utter destruction.\"] Spies are a most important element in water, because on them depends an army’s ability to move.
