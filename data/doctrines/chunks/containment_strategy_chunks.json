    "text": "INCOMING TELEGRAM 896. Moscow via War, Secretary of State, Washington. 511, February 22, 9 p.m. - Dated February 22, 1946, p.m. Answer to Dept's 284, Feb 3 involves questions so intricate, so delicate, so strange to our form of thought, and so important to analysis of our international environment that I cannot compress answers into single brief message without yielding to what I feel would be dangerous degree of over-simplification. I hope, therefore, Dept will bear with me if I submit in answer to this question five partial sub-topics of which will be roughly as follows:\n(one) Features of post-war Soviet outlook. (Two) Background of this outlook. (Three) Its projection in practical policy on official level. (Four) Its projection on unofficial level. (Five) Practical deductions from standpoint of US policy.\nI apologize in advance for this burdening of telegraphic channel; but questions involved are of such urgent importance, particularly in view of recent events, that our answers to them, if they deserve attention at all, seem to me to deserve it at once.\nHERE FOLLOWS PART ONE: BASIC FEATURES OF POST WAR SOVIET OUTLOOK, AS PUT FORWARD BY OFFICIAL PROPAGANDA MACHINE, ARE AS FOLLOWS:\n(A) USSR still lives in antagonistic \"capitalist encirclement\" with which in the long run there can be no permanent peaceful coexistence. As stated by Stalin in 1927 to a delegation of American workers: \"In course of further development of international revolution there will emerge two centers of world significance: a socialist center, drawing to itself the countries which incline toward socialism, and a capitalist center, drawing to itself the countries that incline toward capitalism. Battle between these two centers for command of world economy will decide fate of capitalism and of communism in entire world.\"\n(B) Capitalist world is beset with internal conflicts, inherent in nature of capitalist society. These conflicts are insoluble by means of peaceful compromise. Greatest of them is that between England and US.\n(C) Internal conflicts of capitalism inevitably generate wars. Wars thus generated may be of two kinds: intra-capitalist wars between two capitalist states; and wars of intervention against socialist world. Smart capitalists, vainly seeking escape from inner conflicts of capitalism, incline toward latter.\n(D) Intervention against USSR, while it would be disastrous to those who undertook it, would cause renewed delay in progress of Soviet socialism and must therefore be forestalled at all costs.\n(E) Conflicts between capitalist states, though likewise fraught with danger for USSR, nevertheless hold out great possibilities for advancement of socialist cause, particularly if USSR remains internally cohesive and ideologically monolithic and faithful to its present brilliant leadership.\n(F) It must be borne in mind that capitalist world is not all bad. In addition to hopelessly reactionary and bourgeois elements, it includes (one) certain wholly enlightened and positive elements united in acceptable communist parties and (two) certain other elements (now described for tactical reasons as progressive or democratic) whose reactions, aspirations and activities happen to be \"objectively\" favorable to interests of USSR. These last must be encouraged and utilized for Soviet purposes.\n(G) Among negative elements of bourgeois-capitalist society, most dangerous of all are those whom Lenin called false friends of the people, namely moderate-socialist or social-democratic leaders (in other words, non-communist left-wing). These are more dangerous than out-and-out reactionaries, for latter at least march under their true colors, whereas moderate left-wing leaders confuse people by employing devices of socialism to serve interests of reactionary capital.",

    "section": "Part Two: Background of Outlook",
    "text": "PART TWO: BACKGROUND OF OUTLOOK\nBefore examining ramifications of this party line in practice there are certain aspects of it to which I wish to draw attention.\nFirst, it does not represent natural outlook of Russian people. Latter are, by and large, friendly to outside world, eager for experience of it, eager to measure against it talents they are conscious of possessing, eager above all to live in peace and enjoy fruits of their own labor. Party line only represents thesis which official propaganda machine puts forward with great skill and persistence to a public often remarkably resistant in the stronghold of its innermost thoughts. But party line is binding for outlook and conduct of people who make up apparatus of power -- party, secret police and government -- and it is exclusively with these that we have to deal.\nSecond, please note that premises on which this party line is based are for most part simply not true. Experience has shown that peaceful and mutually profitable coexistence of capitalist and socialist states is entirely possible. Basic internal conflicts in advanced countries are no longer primarily those arising out of capitalist ownership of means of production, but are ones arising from advanced urbanism and industrialism as such, which Russia has thus far been spared not by socialism but only by her own backwardness. Internal rivalries of capitalism do not always generate wars; and not all wars are attributable to this cause. To speak of possibility of intervention against USSR today, after elimination of Germany and Japan and after example of recent war, is sheerest nonsense. If not provoked by force of intolerance and subversion capitalist world of today is quite capable of living at peace with itself and with Russia. Finally, no sane person has reason to doubt sincerity of moderate socialist leaders in western countries, nor is it fair to deny success of their efforts to improve conditions for working population whenever, as in Scandinavia, they have been given chance to show what they could do. Most certainly, success of these efforts has nothing to do with ultimate fate of capitalism.",

LT #C.. f .. - ·• have been =·· .. s- 151, February 22, 9 p.m. from Moscow via War...Anglo-American differences did not turn out to be major differences of Western world. Capitalist countries, other than those of Asia, showed no disposition to solve their differences by joining US crusade against USSR. Instead of imperialist war dissolving into civil war and revolution, USSR found itself obliged to fight side by side with capitalist powers for an avowed community of aims. Nevertheless, all these theses, however baseless and disproven, are being boldly put forward again today. What does this indicate? It indicates that Soviet party line is not based on any objective analysis of the situation beyond Russia's borders; that it has, indeed, little to do with conditions outside of Russia; that it arises mainly from basic inner-Russian necessities which existed before the recent war and exist today. At bottom of Kremlin's neurotic view of world affairs is traditional and instinctive Russian sense of insecurity. Originally, this was insecurity of a peaceful agricultural people trying to live on a vast exposed plain in neighborhood of fierce nomadic peoples. To this was added, as Russia came into contact with economically advanced West, fear of more competent, more powerful, more highly organized societies in that area. But this latter type of insecurity was one which afflicted rather Russian rulers than Russian people; for Russian rulers have invariably sensed that their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with political systems of Western countries. For this reason they have always feared foreign penetration, feared direct contact between Western world and their own, feared what would happen if Russians learned truth about world without or foreigners learned truth about world within. And they have learned...IRUSSIAU l..Q. 1 IU2. S.C. >.Tl cmd 5(D) CS CID Po?t. d Slow ....,, AUQ. LO.

It was no coincidence that Marxism, which had smouldered ineffectively for half a century in Western Europe, caught hold and blazed for the first time in Russia. Only in this land which had never known a friendly neighbor or indeed any tolerant equilibrium of separate powers, either internal or international, could a doctrine thrive which viewed economic conflicts or social conflicts as insoluble by peaceful means. After establishment of Bolshevist regime, Marxist dogma, rendered even more truculent and intolerant by Lenin's interpretation, became a perfect vehicle for sense of insecurity with which Bolsheviks, even more than previous Russian rulers, were afflicted. In this dogma, with its basic altruism of purpose, they found justification for their instinctive fear of outside world, for the dictatorship without which they did not know how to rule, for cruelties they did not dare not to inflict, for sacrifices they felt bound to demand. In the name of Marxism they sacrificed every single ethical value in their methods and tactics. Today they cannot dispense with it. It is the fig leaf of their moral and intellectual respectability. Without it they would stand before history, at best, as only the last of that long succession of cruel and unstable Russian rulers who have relentlessly forced country on to ever new heights of military power in order to guarantee external security of their internally weak regimes. This is why Soviet purposes must always be solemnly clothed in trappings of Marxism, and why no one should underrate importance of dogma in Soviet affairs.",

    "text": "Thus Soviet leaders are driven by necessities of their own past and present position to put forward a dogma which (1) views outside world as evil, hostile and menacing, but as bearing within itself germs of creeping disease and destined to be wracked with growing internal convulsions until it is given final coup de grace by rising power of socialism and yields to new and better world. This thesis provides justification for that increase of military and police power of Russian state, for that isolation of Russian population from outside world, and for that fluid and constant pressure to extend limits of Russian police power which are together the natural and instinctive urges of Russian rulers. Basically this is only the steady advance of uneasy Russian nationalism, a centuries old movement in which conceptions of offense and defense are inextricably confused. But in new guise of international Marxism, with its honeyed promises to a desperate and war torn outside world, it is more dangerous and insidious than ever before. It should not be thought from above that Soviet party line is necessarily disingenuous and insincere on part of all those who put it forward. Many of them are too ignorant of outside world and mentally too dependent to question self-hypnotism, and who have no difficulty making themselves believe what they find it comforting and convenient to believe. Finally we have the unsolved mystery as to who, if anyone, in this great land actually receives accurate and unbiased information about outside world. In atmosphere of oriental secretiveness and conspiracy which pervades this government, possibilities for distorting or poisoning sources and currents of information are infinite. The very disrespect of Russians for objective truth—indeed, their disbelief in its existence—leads them to view all stated facts as instruments for furtherance of one ulterior purpose or another. There is good reason to suspect that this government is actually a conspiracy within a conspiracy; and I for one am reluctant to believe that Stalin himself receives anything like an objective picture of outside world. Here there is ample scope for the type of subtle intrigue at which Russians are past masters. Inability of foreign governments to place their case squarely before Russian policy makers—extent to which they are delivered up in their relations with Russia to good graces of obscure and unknown advisors whom they never see and cannot influence—this to my mind is most disquieting feature of diplomacy in Moscow, and one which Western statesmen would do well to keep in mind if they would understand nature of difficulties encountered here.",

As long as UNO is considered here to serve this purpose, Soviets will remain with it. But if at any time they come to conclude that it is serving to embarrass or frustrate their claims for power expansion and if they see better prospects for pursuit of these aims along other lines, they will not hesitate to abandon UNO. This would imply, however, that they see themselves strong enough to split unity of other nations by their withdrawal, to render UNO ineffective as a threat to their aims or security, and to replace it with an international weapon more effective from their viewpoint. Thus Soviet attitude toward UNO will depend largely on loyalty of other nations to it, and on the degree of vigor, decisiveness, and cohesion with which those nations defend in UNO the peaceful and hopeful concept of international life which that organization represents to our way of thinking.",

The latter motive is not lacking, but for this Soviets prefer to rely on other channels than official trusteeship arrangements. Thus we may expect to find Soviets asking for admission everywhere to trusteeship or similar arrangements and using the levers thus acquired to weaken Western influence among such peoples.",

    "text": "The Soviet system exhibits elaborate and cunning methods for exerting influence in other countries, managed by individuals with unparalleled experience in underground tactics. It appears impervious to considerations of reality in its basic reactions. Unlike Western societies, which constantly test and reform their outlook, the Soviet system selectively draws from a vast collection of ideas, applying them to a pre-conceived worldview. This presents an immense challenge for diplomacy, requiring thorough care and strategic planning akin to wartime preparations. While daunting, this problem is solvable without resorting to general military conflict.\n\nSoviet power differs from Hitler's Germany in that it is neither messianic nor adventurist. It avoids unnecessary risks, is sensitive to the logic of force, and tends to withdraw when met with strong resistance. With sufficient force and clear intentions, direct confrontation can often be avoided.\n\nCompared to the Western world, the Soviets are weaker. Their success hinges on the cohesion, firmness, and vigor of the Western response. The Soviet system's internal stability remains unproven, particularly regarding the transfer of power. Lenin's death caused 15 years of internal turmoil, and Stalin's eventual departure will bring another test. Moreover, recent territorial expansions will strain the Soviet system, similar to the challenges faced by the Tsarist regime. The Russian people are emotionally distant from communist doctrines, with the party now serving primarily as a successful apparatus for dictatorial administration rather than a source of inspiration. The system's internal soundness and permanence are not guaranteed.",

Our approach to dealing with Russia should begin with understanding the nature of the Soviet movement.  This requires courageous, detached, and objective study without emotional provocation.  Secondly, public education about the realities of the Russian situation is crucial.  The government, with its superior experience and information, must lead this effort. Transparency about the challenges posed by the Soviet Union is necessary, even if seemingly unfavorable to US-Soviet relations.  Our stake in the Soviet Union is minimal, with little investment, trade, or cultural exchange to protect. Our primary interest lies in future hopes, and these are better served by an informed public and realistic dealings with the Soviets.\n\nThirdly, the health and vigor of our own society are paramount.  World communism thrives on societal weakness. Domestic and foreign policies intersect here. Addressing internal problems, improving self-confidence, discipline, morale, and community spirit are crucial diplomatic victories against Moscow.  Finally, we must present a more positive and constructive vision of the world we desire.  Simply advocating for similar political processes is insufficient.
