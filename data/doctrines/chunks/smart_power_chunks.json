    "text": "As the President’s chief advisor for foreign affairs, I am pleased to present the U.S. Department of State’s Agency Financial Report for fiscal year 2010. This report presents financial and performance information that reflects our dedication to achieving America’s foreign policy goals in a fiscally responsible manner and carrying out our mission to advance freedom for the benefit of the American people and the international community. We take seriously our duty to effectively invest taxpayer dollars for the long-term success of our nation and are committed to accountability to the American public. I began my tenure as Secretary of State by stressing the need to elevate diplomacy and development alongside defense. The challenges we face and the responses we need to meet those challenges are more complex than ever. During the past year, the Department increasingly has focused on how civilian power can meet the challenges of the 21st Century, including by collaborating with other nations and organizations to design and implement global and regional solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. We continue to see the rewards of this approach using the full range of tools or combination of tools at our disposal for each situation. Civilian power improves our relations with the people of countries throughout the world, protects our national security, and reinvigorates American leadership. We have repaired old alliances and forged new partnerships to solve common problems and achieve shared aspirations. We have strengthened institutions that provide incentives for cooperation, disincentives for sitting on the sidelines, and defenses against those who would undermine global progress. Also, we have championed the values that are at the core of the American character. Our commitment to strong corporate governance is unwavering. To that end, we continue to improve our financial management, and I am pleased to report we have received an unqualified opinion on our financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010. I am also pleased to provide an unqualified statement of assurance regarding the Department’s internal controls. This Agency Financial Report (AFR) is our principal publication and report to the President, Congress, and the American people on our leadership in financial management and on our management and stewardship of the public funds to which we have been entrusted. We worked with our Independent Auditor to ensure that the financial and summary performance data included in this Agency Financial Report are complete and reliable in accordance with the guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. I am proud to represent the Department’s thousands of employees, including both American and Foreign Service Nationals, who serve at more than 270 posts worldwide.",

    "text": "At the dawn of the 21st Century, the United States faces a broad and complex array of challenges to our national security, including ongoing wars and regional conflicts, the global economic crisis, terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, climate change, worldwide poverty, food insecurity, and pandemic disease. Military force may sometimes be necessary to protect our people and our interests but diplomacy and development are equally important in creating conditions for a peaceful, stable, and prosperous world. The 2010 National Security Strategy states, “We must balance and integrate all elements of American power and update our national security capacity for the 21st Century. We must maintain our military’s conventional superiority while enhancing its capacity to defeat asymmetric threats. Our diplomacy and development capabilities must be modernized and our civilian expeditionary capacity strengthened to support the full breadth of our priorities.” As part of a “Smart Power” approach, the Administration has reinvigorated U.S. foreign policy with robust diplomacy and strengthened our traditional alliances, built new partnerships, and elevated development to equal status with diplomacy and defense, recognizing that development is central to solving global problems. Smart Power for the Department and USAID translates into specific policy approaches in five areas. The Department and USAID will: Update and create vehicles for cooperation with our partners; Pursue principled engagement with those who disagree with us; Elevate development as a core pillar of American power; Integrate civilian and military action in conflict areas; and Leverage key sources of American power, including our economic strength and the power of our example. On September 22, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, the first of its kind by a U.S. administration. The directive charts a course for development, diplomacy, and defense to mutually reinforce and complement one another in an integrated comprehensive approach to national security. With Smart Power, diplomacy and development are indispensable in the forward defense of America’s interests in a world shaped by growing economic integration and fragmenting political power, by the rise of emerging powers and the persistent weakness of fragile states, by the potential of globalization and risks from transnational threats, and by the challenges of hunger, poverty, disease, and global climate change. The successful pursuit of diplomacy and development is essential to advancing our national security objectives: security, prosperity, respect for universal values, and a just and sustainable international order.",

    "text": "Diplomacy 3.0 is an ambitious multi-year hiring program that recognizes diplomacy as one of the three essential pillars of U.S. foreign policy: diplomacy, development, and defense. To return diplomacy to the forefront in achieving foreign policy goals, Secretary Clinton has a plan, dependent on continuing budget support, to increase the Department’s Foreign Service personnel by 25% by the year 2013 with a 13% increase in Civil Service over the same period. In FY 2010, for example, we hired 1,220 new Foreign Service employees which was 732 new hires above attrition. Overseas, we need more and better-trained Foreign Service personnel to work in critical fields like post-conflict stabilization and reconstruction and to address the many challenges posed by failed and failing states. Domestically, the Department needs more personnel as well, especially in those areas that directly support overseas posts and operations. Without more personnel, the Department cannot build a “training float,” i.e., sufficient personnel to both train and staff positions. This is especially important with regard to longer-term training, e.g., in critical languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Farsi, Hindi, and Urdu, that require one or two years. Meeting an expanding mission and properly staffing overseas posts, many of which are either difficult or dangerous, requires more personnel trained in the various skills demanded of “smart” diplomacy in the 21st Century. The Department is very focused on finding and attracting people who have the critical skills needed, and our outreach is targeted to a talented, diverse pool of candidates.",

The mission serves the needs of Americans traveling, working and studying abroad and supports Presidential and congressional delegations visiting the country. The passport process is often the only contact most U.S. citizens have with the State Department. The Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs operates 21 passport agencies, two passport processing centers, and two visa processing centers located throughout the United States and is assisted by 9,400 acceptance facilities nationwide. The Department plans to open new passport agencies in the following cities in FY 2011: St. Albans, Vermont; Buffalo, New York; El Paso, Texas; San Diego, California; and Atlanta, Georgia. Moreover, in FY 2010 the Department opened two consulates in Afghanistan — one in Herat and one in Mazar-e-Sharif — and converted a branch office in Almaty, Kazakhstan to a consulate general. The Department also operates several other types of offices around the world in support of our mission, including two foreign press centers, one reception center, five offices that provide logistics support for overseas operations, 20 security offices, and two financial service centers.  Additionally, the Department is now using a wide variety of technological tools to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. Many offices increasingly rely on digital videoconferences and websites to support their missions, including several social networking web tools such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and blog sites, which are leveraged to enable dialogue with broader audiences.",

They work together to achieve the goals and implement the initiatives of American foreign policy. The Foreign Service is a corps of more than 13,000 officers who are dedicated to representing America and to responding to the needs of American citizens living and traveling around the world. They are also America’s first line of defense in a complex and often dangerous world. A Foreign Service career is a way of life that requires uncommon commitment yet also offers unique rewards, opportunities, and, at times, hardships. Members of the Foreign Service are required to agree to worldwide availability, and thus may be sent to any embassy, consulate, or other diplomatic mission anywhere in the world, at any time, to serve the diplomatic needs of the United States. The Department’s Civil Service corps, totaling over 10,000 employees, provides continuity and expertise in accomplishing all aspects of our mission. Civil Service officers, most of whom are headquartered in Washington, D.C., are involved in virtually every policy and management area – from democracy and human rights to narcotics control, trade, and environmental issues. Civil Service employees also serve as the domestic counterpart to Foreign Service consular officers who issue passports and assist U.S. citizens overseas.",

At the close of FY 2010, the Department comprised 29,098 full-time employees. The Department has many hard-to-fill positions vacant overseas and faces an ongoing challenge of ensuring it has the right people, with the right skills, in the right places to accomplish priority tasks. The Department faces persistent shortages of staff with critical language skills despite the importance of foreign language proficiency in advancing U.S. foreign policy and economic interests overseas.

Increasing the profile of diplomacy and development, alongside defense, is smart — mainly because the cost of conflict is higher than ever before. Prevention, including greater attention to failed and failing States, is imperative. The U.S. Government recognizes the importance of preventing and deterring conflict by working with and through partners and allies as well as through better collaboration between defense and civilian agencies and organizations. We have come to realize that the global challenges and opportunities of the future will demand a greater scale, more resources, and more strategic focus for our diplomacy and development efforts as key partners alongside defense. “Unity of effort” is an overriding principle in the 3D framework. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah share the commitment to improve a whole-of-government approach to national security challenges. There is a heavy focus on how U.S. Government programs are aligned and on building whole-of-government policy responses to key themes as well as a more comprehensive look at the resources involved and available to support our programs and initiatives.\nThe Diplomacy, Development and Defense (3D) Planning Group was chartered to improve inter-departmental coordination of planning between the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and USAID. All three agencies recognize that their planning is strengthened by the inclusion of perspectives from other agencies with resulting plans reflecting a unity of the U.S. Government effort.",

The goal of this first-ever QDDR process is to guide the United States to agile, responsive, and effective institutions of diplomacy and development, including: transitioning from approaches no longer commensurate with current challenges; leveraging the full range of American policy tools and resources; measurably impacting global progress in security, prosperity, and well-being; preventing and responding to crises and conflict; and providing strong, flexible management platforms to support institutional objectives. The QDDR will set institutional priorities and provide strategic guidance as frameworks for the most efficient and effective allocation of resources. It will also, among other things, offer guidance on how the Department and USAID should update methodologies, deploy staff, add new tools and hone old ones, and exercise new or restored authorities.

New START The New START Treaty with Russia advances the goal of bolstering the nuclear nonproliferation regime through further reductions in deployed strategic nuclear warheads by both nations. New START’s verifiable reduction of deployed strategic nuclear warheads by the world’s two largest nuclear powers reflects the U.S. commitment to take concrete steps toward nuclear disarmament. Mutual, Verifiable Weapons Limits: Warheads Deployed on Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) and Counted for Deployed Heavy Bombers – 1,550 Deployed and Non-Deployed ICBM and SLBM Launchers and Heavy Bombers – 800 Deployed Strategic Ballistic Missiles and Heavy Bombers – 700 Nuclear Posture Review The Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) reduces the role of U.S. nuclear weapons, provides a strategy for a reduction in their number, and provides negative security assurances to non-nuclear weapons states that are party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and in compliance with their nuclear nonproliferation obligations. As the only legally binding agreement that provides a global barrier to the spread of nuclear weapons, the NPT is the cornerstone of the global nonproliferation regime. It enhances the security of every State as well as global and regional security. The inter-related, interdependent objectives of the NPT are to: Prevent nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism Reduce the role of nuclear weapons Maintain effective strategic deterrence and stability at lower nuclear force levels Strengthen reassurance of U.S. allies and partners Sustain a safe, secure, and effective nuclear arsenal Nuclear Security Summit The Nuclear Security Summit highlighted agreement among 47 governments on the critical importance of securing all vulnerable nuclear materials within four years to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists.",

Since November 2007, the Department has had a Performance Improvement Officer (PIO) who oversees and reviews for greater effectiveness the strategic plans, annual performance plans and reports, and the goals of the agency. Foreign and Civil Service managers at all levels use performance management best practices to assess and mitigate risks, benchmark program results, comply with legislative requirements, and adjust strategies in response to performance successes and shortcomings. While this report focuses on the Department’s performance results, both the Department and USAID work closely together — along with other U.S. Government agencies — to meet the global challenges of the 21st Century through short- and long-term planning and performance initiatives. Together, the Department and USAID practice an interagency, participatory whole-of-government approach that yields productive and long-lasting organizational reform. The agencies manage long-term performance through the State Department-USAID Joint Strategic Plan (JSP) and the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR). These initiatives build the framework for effective integration of diplomacy and development and institutionalize an ethic of review, analysis, and responsiveness within the agencies. At the mission level, strategic planning enables each country team to execute a coordinated delivery of program services that emphasizes one integrated U.S. Government effort.",

    "section": "Performance Measurement and Evaluation",
    "text": "Each year, the Department plans and organizes its foreign policy resources and efforts based on an annual assessment of progress toward achieving seven strategic goals. To measure progress towards these goals in FY 2010, an intra-agency working group selected performance indicators that best reflect U.S Government foreign policy priorities and major areas of investment. In FY 2009, the Department of State adopted a new set of criteria for developing and selecting performance indicators that represent its efforts. This shift to more “outcome-oriented” performance indicators resulted in a largely new set of indicators designed to provide information that is more meaningful to Congress, the President, and the American public, and more useful internally in supporting budget, policy, and planning decisions. To assess the FY 2010 results, program managers examined each indicator closely to determine whether it met a previously established target and considered how the results impact the achievement of the Department and USAID strategic goals. A rating was then assigned to each indicator based on the analysis.  The Department strengthened the connection between strategic planning, evaluation, and strategic priorities through the use of Country Operational Plans and Bureau Strategic and Resource Plans. The evaluations noted in these plans support the success of programs and initiatives linked to the Department’s strategic goals and High Priority Performance Goals (HPPGs). In FY 2010, the Department implemented a new policy to expand the use of rigorous evaluation and assessment. The new evaluation policy lays the groundwork for a coordinated and robust evaluation function in the Department and provides a framework for the ongoing and systematic analysis of programs and policies. The policy requires grant- and contract-funded programs/projects to be evaluated at least once during their life cycle and more closely integrates the Department’s strategic planning processes with evaluation planning.",

The conference, New Paradigms for Evaluating Diplomacy in the 21st Century, provided a forum for foreign affairs officials from the United States and abroad, including Denmark, Japan, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Belgium, to confer about the capacity of evaluation to affect change in foreign affairs. Panel discussions and workshops — on such topics as evaluating trade-capacity building and peace-building activities, interagency efforts to combat transnational crime, cultural diplomacy, gender and evaluation, and food insecurity — provided opportunities for a lively exchange of ideas on effective practices, methods, and approaches for examining the challenges that our nation and the world faces in the 21st Century. The Department’s conference serves as the starting point for an ongoing exploration and discussion of evaluating diplomacy as one of the pillars — with development and defense — of an effective foreign policy framework. In the next fiscal year, the Department will pursue full implementation of the new evaluation policy and the integration of evaluation as an inherent part of management and oversight of programs. This includes the establishment of guidelines and tools around evaluation scope, methods, resources, policies and procedures, independence, planning, and dissemination of public accountability results. Further, in consultation with program stakeholders, the Department will focus on strategically identifying evaluation priorities and planning and developing a body of evaluation work.",

    "text": "Climate change is one of the century’s greatest challenges, and promoting low-carbon, climate-resilient growth is one of the highest priorities of both our diplomacy and our development work. Under President Obama, the United States, through domestic and international action, has done more to combat climate change than ever before. In December 2009, aided by U.S. leadership, the international community took a meaningful and unprecedented step forward in international climate negotiations. The resulting Copenhagen Accord outlines key elements that are essential to a long-term solution to the climate change challenge: a recognition of the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius; actions by all major economies to mitigate climate change; transparency to see that those actions are taken; and financing and technology support to help the poorest and most vulnerable developing nations. To respond to the profound threat that global climate change poses to development, the United States has also launched a Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) to spur global greenhouse gas emission reductions in the energy and forests and land-use sectors and to promote climate change adaptation in vulnerable countries and communities. As part of this effort, the United States has committed to contributing our share of a sum approaching $30 billion over the 2010–2012 period, as called for in the Copenhagen Accord, for “fast-start” funding to assist developing countries address climate change. These funds include support for the Administration’s Copenhagen announcement that it would dedicate $1 billion for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) from 2010-2012. Complementing this significant increase in financial assistance, President Obama launched the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate (MEF), establishing an enhanced dialogue among 17 developed and developing economies, representing 80 percent of global emissions, to help support the multilateral negotiating process and devise new ways to advance the development and deployment of clean energy technologies. Experts from these countries have since developed action plans covering 10 key clean energy technologies, and ministers at the July 2010 Clean Energy Ministerial launched a suite of initiatives aimed at implementing these action plans.",

    "text": "In FY 2010, the United States coped with several urgent foreign policy challenges, including ongoing wars and regional conflicts, the global economic crisis, violent extremism, nuclear proliferation, climate change, global poverty and hunger, pandemic disease, and transnational criminal networks. In responding to these and other foreign policy challenges, the Department of State took significant steps in FY 2010 by implementing the President’s National Security Strategy in the following six ways. First, by engaging our closest allies who share our most fundamental values and interests and our commitment to solving common problems — from Europe and North America to East Asia and the Pacific. Second, by helping to develop the capacity of developing partners, inasmuch as development is central to advancing American interests — as central as diplomacy and defense. Third, by deepening engagement with emerging centers of influence such as China, India, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and Russia. Fourth, by reinvigorating America’s commitment to be an active transatlantic, transpacific and hemispheric leader. Fifth, by reengaging with global institutions and working to modernize them to meet the evolving challenges we face so that these institutions are flexible, inclusive, and complementary. Sixth, by upholding and defending the universal values that are enshrined in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights because today, everywhere, these principles are under threat. During the year, the Department of State worked with other U.S. Government and foreign government agencies to deliver relief aid to Haiti and coordinate the International Donors’ Conference Toward a New Future for Haiti. The Department also supported direct talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians. In Iraq, where the U.S. combat mission has ended, the Department worked with other U.S. Government agencies to transfer and transition to an unprecedented civilian-led partnership. The Department has also assisted in stepping up international pressure on Iran to negotiate seriously on its nuclear program. We also successfully concluded a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia in March 2010.",

In FY 2010, the Department of State continued to increase its analytical rigor in strategic planning and performance management by focusing on outcome-oriented performance measures that support its seven strategic goals and 39 strategic priorities. Although the Department and USAID share a joint strategic framework, this report highlights performance only for the Department of State. The following section includes a high-level discussion of the public benefits, key achievements, and selected key performance measures, including illustrative indicators, for each of the seven strategic goals. This information informs Congress, the public, and other stakeholders about the performance of the Department and its contributions to the efficiency and effectiveness of the U.S. Government. The Department’s Annual Performance Report (APR), to be issued in February 2011 as part of its Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ) in conjunction with the President’s Budget, will present more detailed analysis of performance results for FY 2010. Strategic Goal 1: Achieving Peace and Security Preserve international peace by preventing regional conflicts and transnational crime, combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, and supporting homeland security and security cooperation. Public Benefit. The United States faces a broad set of dangers that know no borders and that threaten our national security, including the grave danger of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) falling into the wrong hands, terrorism and violent extremism, transnational crime, and persistent conflict in geostrategic States with repercussions that are felt well beyond those States’ borders. The U.S. Government responds to these challenges using Smart Power – the deliberate and balanced application of the three pillars of U.S. foreign policy – diplomacy, development, and defense. In the U.S. Government’s efforts to build a safer and more secure world, our priorities include: seeking the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons by working to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our own national security strategy and through bilateral and multilateral arms control efforts; combating weapons of mass destruction through cooperative efforts with friends and allies; countering terrorism, including fighting transnational crime and reducing the potential for terrorists to acquire WMD; supporting stabilization operations activities, security sector reforms, and counternarcotics activities; sponsoring conflict mitigation and reconciliation; and ensuring homeland security.",

A consensus final document on substantive issues was achieved for the first time in ten years and consensus was reached on a plan of follow-on actions to strengthen each of the three pillars of the NPT — disarmament, nonproliferation, and access to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy — making this the first NPT Action Plan to cover all three pillars. The Secretary announced an initiative to broaden access to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, pledging $50 million over five years to the IAEA to expand efforts to broaden the use of nuclear energy for cancer treatment, food and water security, and the development of infrastructure for the safe, secure use of civil nuclear power.

UN Peacekeeping Missions in Near East Asia received an average rating of 3 out of 4 in FY 2010, surpassing the target of 2.5. The rating mirrors the score received in FY 2008 and FY 2009. The FY 2010 average rating for UN Peacekeeping Missions in Africa remained at FY 2009 levels, with a score of 2.3, slightly below the target of 2.5. This decline reflects the increasingly difficult security, political, and economic environment in many parts of Africa.

Through the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization, the Department is addressing the urgent need for formalized, collaborative, and institutionalized foreign policy tools to address the diverse stabilization needs of the global community. The U.S. Government can better influence key transitional moments in fragile states if it can deploy civilians early enough, as demonstrated in South Sudan. The Department is tracking civilian deployments, which increased over five fold in FY 2010 compared to FY 2009. The Department exceeded its target of 70 deployments per month in the fourth quarter of FY 2010, but did not meet the target for the full year.",

Bringing better health systems to people around the globe contributes to a more secure, stable, and prosperous world.  While progress has been made, urgent health challenges remain in the following priority areas: HIV/AIDS, child mortality, maternal mortality, tuberculosis, malaria, tropical diseases, unintended pregnancy, and undernourishment. U.S. Government programs strengthen local capacity in disease outbreak detection and response, delivery of health services and essential drugs and commodities, and support advances in health technology. PEPFAR is an essential component of the Department’s Smart Power approach. PEPFAR takes a comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in developing countries, working in close partnership with host country governments and national and international partners. Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment provides direct therapeutic benefits, increasing the length and quality of life and enabling individuals to resume normal activities and provide care for their families. ARVs reduce viral load, contributing to decreased rates of HIV/AIDS transmission. PEPFAR-supported treatment has helped save and extend millions of lives and avoid the orphaning of hundreds of thousands of children. The Global Fund is a global public/private partnership dedicated to attracting and disbursing additional resources to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in more than 140 countries. The Global Fund finances country-owned programs according to principles of performance-based funding. It represents a key opportunity for supporting country ownership, promoting sustainability, and leveraging additional financing from other donors to U.S. Government bilateral programs, and is critical to the achievement of our global health goals. The United States is the largest donor to the Global Fund, contributing $5.1 billion since 2001.",

    "text": "Strengthen world economic growth and protect the environment, while expanding opportunities for U.S. businesses and ensuring economic and energy security for the nation.\n\nPublic Benefit. Through its economic and commercial diplomacy, the State Department promotes U.S. business opportunities and negotiates to create favorable climates for U.S. business activities overseas. The Department leads efforts to open markets and promotes global economic partnerships which will lead to economic growth for the United States, its trading partners, and developing countries. The new global economic landscape presents a number of challenges. The world economy has become more multi-polar, including the “BRIC” economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China that seek greater influence in the international system. At the same time, however, these big economies and others suffer from significant poverty, food shortages, malnutrition, and gaping inequalities, all of which threaten social and political stability. The financial crisis has produced high levels of unemployment in many countries and has destroyed savings. Skepticism has grown about the benefits of globalization, open trade policies, and trade liberalization.\n\nTo meet these challenges, the Department is both devising and implementing policies to serve the economic, security, and foreign policy interests of the United States. The first priority of United States international economic policy is to address the concerns and aspirations of the American people. The President established the National Export Initiative (NEI) which sets the goal of doubling exports over the next five years — an increase that will support two million additional jobs in the United States. In support of this priority initiative, the Department advocates on behalf of American companies with other governments for fair treatment, transparency, and maximum opportunity in competitive global markets. Further, it helps U.S. companies pursuing foreign government procurement opportunities, such as the recently completed U.S.-Canada Agreement on Government Procurement guaranteeing U.S. firms access to markets worth tens of billions of dollars, and works with them in cases of commercial and investment disputes. The September 2010 report to the President on the NEI noted that U.S. exports during the first six months of this year were 18 percent higher than the same period in 2009.\n\nThe Department actively encourages open and market-oriented environments for U.S. exports and investment abroad through a wide range of bilateral and multilateral initiatives, outreach to advanced and emerging economies, and joint efforts with the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to conclude bilateral investment treaties that protect U.S. investors and create new investment opportunities. Currently, the Department is negotiating investment treaties with such key economies as China and India. Also, the Department increased its engagement with Turkey, Georgia, Indonesia, Russia, and Central Asia through new economic dialogues and in Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, with the goal of establishing a large free trade area in Asia. The Department is also advancing energy security by encouraging the diversification of energy supplies, taking measures against supply disruptions, and promoting clean energy technology. In addition, the Department strongly encourages transparent data on oil demand and elimination of economically-distorting fossil fuel subsidies. Supporting the growth and development aspirations of people in developing nations is another key priority of U.S. international economic policy. The ability of developing countries to achieve their goals will have an enormous impact on prospects for the future growth and openness of the global economy and the potential for American workers and companies to find expanding markets for their products. It will also profoundly affect global social and political stability and the depth and content of American friendships and alliances in key regions. An important developmental effort is the Administration’s new Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative. With one-sixth of the world’s population — over one billion people — suffering from chronic hunger, the United States has committed itself to working as part of a collaborative global effort to improve food security. This effort focuses on availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability of food. U.S. diplomatic efforts and foreign assistance remain important factors in helping sub-Saharan countries achieve their development goals. Sub-Saharan Africa needs increased private sector investment, both foreign and domestic, to achieve the sustained rates of economic growth necessary to reduce poverty on the continent. The region must significantly increase its ties to the global marketplace and the benefits that arise from trade. The Department is working with sub-Saharan countries on policies that promote growth in trade and foster Africa’s integration into the global marketplace.",

    "text": "Save lives, alleviate suffering, and minimize the economic costs of conflict, disasters, and displacement.\n\nPublic Benefit. The U. S. commitment to humanitarian response demonstrates America’s compassion for victims of natural disasters, armed conflict, forced migration, persecution, human rights violations, widespread health and food insecurity, and other threats. It requires urgent responses to emergencies, concerted efforts to address hunger and protracted crises, and planning to build the necessary capacity to prevent and mitigate the effects of conflict and disasters. The Department of State and USAID are the lead U.S. Government agencies that respond to complex humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters overseas. The United States provides substantial efforts and guidance, through international and nongovernmental organizations for worldwide humanitarian programs, to save lives and minimize suffering in the midst of crises, increase access to protection, promote shared responsibility, and coordinate funding and implementation strategies. The U.S. Government’s emergency response to population displacement and distress caused by natural and human-made disasters is tightly linked to all other foreign assistance goals, including the protection of civilian populations, programs to strengthen support for human rights, provision of health and basic education, and support for livelihoods of beneficiaries. Populations of concern to the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (PRM) exceeded 40 million worldwide in 2009, including over 15 million refugees and more than six million stateless persons as well as millions of conflict victims and vulnerable migrants. A range of factors suggest that future humanitarian needs will be dire: increases in the incidence of natural disasters (e.g., cyclones, drought, earthquakes) that lead to displacement; greater urbanization including among refugees and internally displaced people; and the impact of the global economic downturn on conflict- and disaster-affected communities. These factors are expected to contribute to the trend of growing humanitarian needs. Refugee resettlement is an important solution and tool of protection for some of the most vulnerable refugees and a form of burden-sharing that can help unlock protracted refugee situations. The United States provides protection and durable solutions through its long-standing tradition of welcoming refugees to communities across the country. Though the need for refugee resettlement remains great, new arrivals are facing initial integration challenges with the amount of the Reception and Placement per capita grant not keeping pace with inflation. Recognizing these challenges in FY 2010, PRM doubled the amount of the grant to enable refugees to better address the challenges they face in their first 30-90 days in the United States. This increase benefits refugees and the network of nonprofit agencies and local affiliates that serve them so that in the first several weeks after their arrival, refugees have a roof over their heads, a clean bed in which to sleep, and other basic assistance. In the area of international migration, the United States advances policies and programs that protect and assist asylum-seekers, victims of human trafficking, women, children, and other vulnerable migrants. Further, it supports international efforts to protect the human rights of migrants and promote humane and responsible migration policies; and supports capacity-building activities to help governments manage migration, especially in areas where vulnerable migrants travel among broader populations of migrants (including economic migrants), such as in the Gulf of Aden and the Caribbean. In FY 2010, with Department support for regional migration dialogues that aim to advance the aforementioned goals, 85 percent of initiatives agreed to at such dialogues were implemented, exceeding the Department’s target of 82 percent.",

A key part of the program will be people-to-people exchanges between business leaders, foundation staff and social entrepreneurs in U.S. and Muslim communities. This is just one of the many ways the Department is strengthening its people-to-people relationships. The Department is also continuing to better inform policy-making by integrating public diplomacy into foreign policy formulation and ensuring that an understanding of attitudes and opinions of foreign publics is part of the public diplomacy strategy.\n\nThe Department recognizes the central role of public diplomacy as a tool of Smart Power and an essential element for 21st Century statecraft, and has committed to renewing America’s engagement with the people of the world by enhancing mutual respect and understanding and creating partnerships aimed at solving common problems. We continue to face a changing global landscape of engagement. Global challenges require the Department to identify and implement complex, multi-dimensional public engagement strategies that forge partnerships, mobilize broad coalitions, and galvanize public opinion across all sectors of society.\n\nThe Department developed the first detailed global strategy for public diplomacy in over a decade — a strategic framework for 21st Century public diplomacy that ensures its alignment with foreign policy objectives and focuses on how public diplomacy programs, efforts, and structures support those objectives. Under the new strategic framework, the Department is developing proactive outreach strategies to inform, inspire, and persuade. This requires the Department to rapidly respond to inaccurate information and expand and strengthen its capability to proactively and nimbly engage with international audiences.",

Nevertheless, there are many challenges to building this trust, such as security concerns that have closed venues, preventing direct engagement. The challenges and strategies above require the use of new media and other connective technologies. We are working to use new tools to deal effectively with the 24/7 reality of new media. For example, a December 2009 redesign of the Department’s website, www.state.gov, provided improved navigation, a fresh design, and seamless integration with social media including the DipNote blog. In support of the President’s Open Government initiative, the site hosts www.state.gov/open as a tool for citizen engagement.

The Department also created and delivered over 4,000 hours of on-demand video to www.state.gov, Dipnote, YouTube, iTMS, Facebook, and broadcast aggregators and placement services such as PRNewsWire and Pathfire. The percentage of exchange program participants with increased understanding of the United States is an illustrative indicator for this Strategic Goal to assess the correlation between participating in U.S.-sponsored exchange programs and increased understanding and more favorable views of the United States.

The Department assesses the percentage of participants in Department-sponsored exchange programs who increased or changed their understanding of the United States immediately following their program. The Department exceeded its FY 2010 target with nearly 99 percent of respondents surveyed responding favorably, thus demonstrating that cultural exchange programs are positively reshaping foreign opinions of the United States. Another indicator the Department uses is the percent of foreign audiences who expressed a better understanding of the United States after exposure to International Information Programs (IIP), Products and Activities. This indicator measures the impact on intended target audiences who consume these products. The Department transforms U.S. policies into information products tailored to engage and persuade critically important international audiences. In FY 2009, 55 percent of IIP audiences surveyed responded that they have a better understanding of U.S. policy, society, and values.

    "text": "Assets. The Department’s total assets were $68.2 billion at September 30, 2010, an increase of $8.6 billion, 14 percent, over the 2009 total. Fund balances with Treasury were up $6 billion due to unexpended funds carried over from multi-year appropriations. Investments were up $529 million because contributions and appropriations received to support the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund (FSRDF) were greater than benefit payments; the excess is required to be invested for future benefit payments. Property and equipment increased $1.5 billion due to continued emphasis on the construction of new embassies and necessary security upgrades at existing embassies. Fund Balances, Investments and Property and Equipment comprise 98 percent of total assets for 2010 and 2009. Investments consist almost entirely of U.S. Government securities held in the FSRDF; government agencies are, for the most part, precluded from making any other type of investment. Many Heritage Assets, including art, historic American furnishings, rare books and cultural objects, are not reflected in assets on the Department’s Balance Sheet. Federal accounting standards attempt to match costs to accomplishments in operating performance, and have deemed that the allocation of historical cost through depreciation of a national treasure or other priceless item intended to be preserved forever as part of our American heritage would not contribute to performance cost measurement. Standards require only the maintenance cost of these heritage assets be expensed, since it is part of the government’s role to maintain them forever in good condition. All of the embassies and other properties on the Secretary of State’s Register of Culturally Significant Property, however, do appear as assets on the Balance Sheet, since they are used in the day-to-day operations of the Department.\nLiabilities. The Department’s total liabilities were down $34 million, .2 percent, between 2009 and 2010. The liability for future benefits payments to retired foreign service officers shown as the Foreign Service Retirement Actuarial Liability, 78 percent of total liabilities, was up $521 million, 3 percent, due to increasing participation in the benefit plan and changes in cost assumptions. Other liabilities decreased by $285 million, 14 percent, primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue on International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) reimbursable agreements.",

    "text": "The Combined Statement of Budgetary Resources details what budgetary resources were available to the Department for the year and the status of those resources at year-end. Total Budgetary Resources were up $2.5 billion, 5 percent, in 2010 over 2009. Most of that increase, $2.2 billion, came from increased budget authority from appropriations granted by Congress. Appropriations and offsetting collections comprised 76 percent of year-end resources. The remainder was transfers, recoveries of prior-year unpaid obligations, and unobligated balances brought forward. The Department obligated $39.2 billion of the $52.6 billion total resources in 2010, an increase of $1.1 billion, 3 percent, over 2009. Percent of total resources obligated remained stable at 75 percent in 2010 versus 76 percent in 2009.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Net Cost presents the Department’s costs by strategic goal. These strategic goals were determined by the Department’s current State-USAID Joint Strategic Plan for 2007 – 2012 established pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Cost by goal is net of earned revenue by goal. Revenue to the Department from other federal agencies must be established and billed based upon actual costs only, without profit, per statute. Revenue from the public, in the form of fees for service, such as visa issuance, is also to be cost-recovery only, without profit, at the Department. Therefore, the net cost per goal measures actual cost to the American taxpayer after fees and agreements with other federal agencies that should net to zero. Note 15 to the financial statements presents further breakdown of costs by responsibility segments, per under- secretary. Total net cost of $21.4 billion is a decrease of 1 percent or $233 million from 2009. The goals of Achieving Peace and Security, Investing in People, and Executive Direction and Other costs account for most of this change. As seen in the Net Cost by Strategic Goal chart, the goal of Achieving Peace and Security is the largest representing 28 percent of 2010 net costs. Our International Organizations (IO) costs increased by $1 billion and are distributed to most strategic goals with 51% to Achieving Peace and Security. IO costs include annual assessments for peacekeeping missions and assessments from the United Nations. Our second largest goal, Investing in People, decreased by $543 million primarily due to decreased cost in the Global Health and Child Survival Fund. Support costs for Diplomatic & Consular Programs and Diplomatic Security functions are distributed to all strategic goals and accounted for $1.1 billion of the increase in total costs. Cost increases in Executive Direction and Other costs were offset by a decrease of $1.4 billion from 2009 in the actuarial loss from experience and assumption changes in the FSRDF. In 2009, we performed an experience study to determine if the assumptions used still reflect actual experience within the retiree population. The results reflected that the population of FSRDF retirees is living longer. The Department and our actuaries agreed it was necessary to depart from using the assumptions of OPM’s Board of Actuaries. The assumption revisions, both demographic and economic, resulted in a pension cost of $2.7 billion in the FSRDF for 2009.",

    "text": "Budgetary Position The FY 2010 estimated budget for the Department of State operations totaled $16.6 billion, including appro­ priations for Administration of Foreign Affairs ($12.4 billion), contributions to international organizations and international peacekeeping activities ($3.9 billion), international commissions ($143 million), and related programs ($162 million). These amounts do not include foreign assistance funding, which was provided through the Foreign Operations appropriations. The Department’s FY 2010 budget was funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, under Division F – The Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act, 2010. The budget also included supplemental funding from the FY 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act. Supplemental funding supported Haiti disaster efforts and Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq programs. In addition to appropriated funds, the Department continued to utilize revenue from user fees – Machine Readable Visa fees, Enhanced Border Security Program fees, the Western Hemisphere Travel Surcharge, and other fees – for the Border Security Program. The revenue from these fees supported program requirements to protect American citizens and safeguard the nation’s borders. FY 2010 requirements included consular workloads in connection with renewals of Border Crossing Cards and passport demand associated with implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. Appropriations for Administration of Foreign Affairs constitute the Department’s core operational funding. They support the people and programs that carry out U.S. foreign policy and advance U.S. national security, political, and economic interests at more than 260 posts in over 180 countries around the world. These funds also build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the American diplomatic platform, from which most U.S. Government agencies operate overseas. For FY 2010, the Department’s principal operating appropriation – Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) – was funded at $9.6 billion. Total D&CP funding included $2.2 billion to support operations of the U.S. Mission in Iraq, $686 million for Department activities in Afghanistan, $1.6 billion for the Worldwide Security Protection program to strengthen security for diplomatic personnel and facilities under threat from terrorism, and $520 million for vigorous public diplomacy programs to counter extremist misinformation and secure support for U.S. policies abroad. The funding also included resources to further agency-specific initiatives on rightsizing the U.S. Government’s overseas presence and federal real property asset management. The Department’s IT Central Fund for FY 2010 investments in information technology totaled $259 million. The Fund total included $139 million from the Capital Investment Fund (CIF) appropriation and $120 million in revenue from Expedited Passport fees. Investment priorities included modernization of the Department’s global IT infrastructure to assure reliable access to foreign affairs applications and information and projects to facilitate collaboration and data sharing internally and with other agencies. The Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance (ESCM) appropriation was funded at $1.8 billion. This funding helped provide U.S. missions overseas with secure, safe and functional facilities. The funding also supported maintenance and repairs of the Department’s real estate portfolio, which exceeds $14 billion in value and includes over 15,000 properties. The ESCM funding included $847 million to support capital security construction and compound security projects. Other agencies with overseas staff under Chief of Mission authority also contributed $454 million to capital security cost-sharing reimbursements for the construction of new diplomatic facilities. The Educational and Cultural Exchange Programs (ECE) appropriation was funded at $635 million. Aligned with public diplomacy efforts, these strategic activities engaged foreign audiences to develop mutual understanding and build foundations for international cooperation. The funding included $359 million for academic programs of proven value, such as the J. William Fulbright Scholarship Program and English language teaching. It also included $210 million for professional and cultural exchanges, notably the International Visitor Leadership Program and Citizen Exchange Program. For FY 2011, the President’s request for the Department’s budget (at this date still pending before the Congress) totals $16.4 billion. It includes resources to address ongoing",

    "text": "The Lower Mekong region — comprising Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam — is united by a common natural heritage of forests, floodplains, and inland waterways. The Mekong River and its tributaries provide water, food, energy, and transportation to over 60 million inhabitants and sustain one of the most bio-diverse ecosystems on earth. In July 2009, the United States joined these countries to launch the Lower Mekong Initiative to promote cooperation on issues of regional importance. Since then, the United States has launched or expanded a number of projects to promote better management of these natural resources, a key to the sustainable development of the region. Strengthening Water Management: The Mississippi River Commission and the Mekong River Commission launched a “sister-river partnership” in 2010 to promote cooperation and share best practices in areas such as integrated floodplain management, climate change adaptation, and sustainable basin development. Cleaning up waterways: In 2010, the United States joined with the Mekong River Commission and local communities to improve regional coordination in managing pollution from agricultural and mining runoff, sewage, and waste-water as well as industrial pollution. Protecting Forests: National Park Service staff developed a dynamic, field-level exchange program to provide land management, stewardship, and law enforcement training for rangers in Cambodia’s Samlaut Protected Area, part of a sister- park relationship to build local capacity to protect this ecosystem from deforestation, wildlife trafficking, and other illicit activities. Building Science Partnerships: In December 2009, the U.S. Geological Survey and Vietnam’s Can Tho University brought together scientists and experts from throughout the region to share information on the impact of climate change and human activities on the ecology and food security of the Mekong basin. Advancing Clean Energy: Through the Methane-to-Markets Partnership initiative, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working with the livestock and food processing industries in Thailand and Vietnam to capture methane release from swine farms and convert it into electricity, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",

American firms need to find new markets as part of our economic recovery. The United States exported $1.57 trillion in goods and services in 2009, which made up 11 percent of our economic output and supported over 10 million jobs. NEI components are: Expanding Trade Advocacy — U.S. Government agencies will inform U.S. companies about export opportunities, connecting them with new customers and partners and advocating for their interests. Access to Credit — Export-Import Bank financing programs will be expanded by $10 billion over the next two years with a special focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises. Removing Trade Barriers — U.S. Government agencies will enforce international trade laws to level the playing field for American companies, pursuing balanced trade agreements that improve market access for U.S. workers, firms, farmers and ranchers. The NEI will expand U.S. Government assistance to small- and medium-sized firms by assisting first-time exporters and working with established exporters to broaden their markets. U.S. agencies will ensure that companies use Federal resources available for export support including credits, technical assistance, commercial and political risk insurance, trade missions, and advocacy by U.S. officials. The United States will work through the G-20 to promote balanced growth in the global economy, ensure that trade agreements are enforced, and work to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens markets. U.S. Embassies and Consulates are key advocates for U.S. businesses overseas and can offer U.S. exporters critical country-specific insight on markets, assist in commercial and investment disputes, and offer expertise on local judicial systems. The Department also facilitates visas for companies doing business overseas.  The request for D&CP is $9.5 billion, including $1.6 billion for Worldwide Security Protection to meet new demands in all regions. The centerpiece of the FY 2011 budget is the request for a 430-position increase in the Foreign Service, part of an ongoing long-range request to increase Foreign Service staff by 25 percent. The request provides $144 million for CIF for further investments in IT infrastructure and collaborative tools. The request for ESCM totals $1.7 billion, including $857 million for design and/or construction of secure facilities, additional site acquisitions, and compound security projects. Further, the request provides $633 million for ECE to strengthen the exchanges component of public diplomacy, expand the National Security Language Initiative, and bring influential individuals to America.",

Therefore, the leading objective of the FY 2011 Department of State Operations request is to build the capacity to advance diplomatic solutions for the most challenging issues of our time. The Department is focused on positioning the right people – with the appropriate training and resources – in the right locations. These diplomats will concentrate on the critical national security efforts of our day, combating terrorism, and promoting freedom. The timing and location of these efforts will often not be of our choosing. Therefore it is critical that the Department be able to conduct diplomacy and deliver assistance in a flexible and dynamic manner. This requires a concerted and long-term focus on recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining the most capable and motivated personnel while providing those stationed overseas the critical equipment and resources necessary. Diplomatic activities must also be seamlessly coordinated with other U.S. Government agencies, particularly those with foreign policy roles, and with U.S. allies and international partners. Leveraging multi-agency, bilateral and multilateral organizational efforts is the most effective way of achieving the results that serve U.S. national interest. The FY 2011 budget requests the resources necessary to increase diplomatic capacity; providing the tools and funding our diplomats require to pursue the most challenging national security issues, now and in the future. The FY 2011 budget request will enable the Department to meet the following critical goals: Strengthen Capacity to Pursue Diplomatic Solutions to National Security Issues; Coordinate Stabilization and Reconstruction Efforts; Further Assist Transition to Iraqi Responsibility; Strengthen Public Diplomacy and Exchanges; and Support Multilateral Engagement. The Department of State provides routine and emergency services to American citizens through two offices directly in touch with consular officers all over the world who are involved daily in assisting American citizens. The Office of American Citizen Services and Crisis Management (CA/OCS/ACS) has five geographical divisions with case officers who assist in all matters involving protective services for Americans abroad, including arrests, deaths, financial or medical emergencies, and welfare and whereabouts inquiries. The office also issues Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and Country-Specific Information and provides guidance on nationality and citizenship determination, document issuance, judicial and notarial services, estates and property claims, third-country representation, and disaster assistance. The Office of Children’s Issues (CA/OCS/CI) serves as the U.S. Central Authority for two multilateral treaties: the 1988 Hague Convention on International Child Abduction and the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Abductions: CA/OCS/CI assists in cases of international parental child abduction. A signatory to the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction since 1988, the United States works with 68 partner countries to obtain the return of children who are wrongfully held from their parents overseas and in the United States. International child abduction is a growing problem. The number of reported cases of children abducted from the United States to a foreign country in FY 2010 was 1,175 (involving 1,696 children). Adoptions: CA/OCS/CI also plays an active role in the intercountry adoption process, assisting parents as they seek to provide a home to orphans abroad.",

Foreign assistance programs enable the United States Government to promote stability in key countries and regions, confront security challenges, advance economic transformation, respond to humanitarian crises, and encourage better governance, policies, and institutions. The appropriation authority was provided through the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010, under Division F—Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-117). The budget also included supplemental funding provided through the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law 111-212). Foreign Assistance programs under the purview of the Department of State included International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement, which includes the Andean Counterdrug Program from FY 2010 forward; Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs; Peacekeeping Operations; International Military Education and Training; Foreign Military Financing; Migration and Refugee Assistance; Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance; International Organizations and Programs; and Democracy Fund. The Department also implements funds from the Economic Support Fund (ESF) and Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia (AEECA) accounts. The International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) appropriation for FY 2010 totaled $2.8 billion. INCLE supported bilateral and global programs critical to combating transnational crime and illicit threats, including efforts against terrorist networks in the illegal drug trade and illicit enterprises. INCLE-supported programs strengthen law enforcement jurisdictions and institutions. Many INCLE resources were focused where security situations are most dire, and where U.S. resources are used in tandem with host-country government strategies in order to maximize impact. INCLE resources were also targeted to countries having specific challenges to overcome in establishing a secure and stable environment, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Mexico, and Haiti. Finally, INCLE funded programs helped to reduce the flow of drugs to the United States and address instability in the Andean region by strengthening the ability of both source and transit countries to investigate and prosecute major drug-trafficking organizations and their leaders by blocking and seizing their assets. The Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR) appropriation was funded at $754 million to support critical U.S. strategic and humanitarian priority efforts, especially in the areas of nonproliferation and disarmament, export control, and other border security assistance; global threat-reduction programs, antiterrorism programs; and conventional weapons destruction. The FY 2010 Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) appropriation totaled $332 million to enhance international support for voluntary multinational stabilization efforts, including international missions not supported by the United Nations, and U.S. conflict-resolution activities. PKO funding was used to provide security assistance to help diminish and resolve conflicts, enhance participation in peacekeeping and stability operations, address counterterrorism threats, and reform military establishments into professional military forces with respect for the rule of law. In FY 2010, the PKO program supported ongoing funding requirements for the Global Peace Operations Initiative, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (a new counterterrorism program in East Africa), multilateral peacekeeping and regional stability operations, and security sector reform programs in Somalia. The FY 2010 International Military Education and Training (IMET) appropriation totaled $108 million. IMET is a key component of U.S. security assistance that promotes regional stability and defense capabilities through professional military training and education. IMET students from allied and friendly nations received valuable training and education on U.S. military practices and standards. This training included professional military leadership, technical and specialized military instruction, exposure to democratic values, and respect for internationally recognized standards of human rights. IMET is an effective mechanism for strengthening military alliances and international coalitions critical to the global fight against terrorism. The FY 2010 Foreign Military Financing (FMF) appropriation totaled $5.5 billion. FMF furthers U.S. interests around the world by equipping and training coalition partners and friendly foreign governments that are working to achieve common security goals and shared burdens in joint missions. FMF promotes U.S. national security by contributing to regional and global stability, strengthening military support for democratically-elected governments, containing transnational threats including terrorism and trafficking in narcotics, weapons, and persons. FMF was allocated strategically within regions; the vast majority of funds were directed to U.S. sustaining partners, and a significant proportion of funding was directed to developing countries to support their advancement to transforming status. In FY 2010, the Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) appropriation was funded at $1.8 billion. Through the MRA account, the U.S. Government provides humanitarian assistance and resettlement opportunities for refugees and conflict victims around the globe. MRA is an essential component of U.S. foreign policy, reflecting America’s dedication to assisting those in need. In FY 2010, MRA contributed to key international humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations to address international humanitarian needs and refugee resettlement in the United States. MRA funds supported programs that met basic life sustaining needs; protected refugees and conflict victims; assisted refugees with voluntary repatriation, local integration, or permanent third-country resettlement; and fostered the effective management of humane international migration. The FY 2010 Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance (ERMA) appropriation totaled $45 million. ERMA serves as a contingency fund from which the President can draw in order to respond effectively to humanitarian crises in an ever-changing international environment.",

As narco-trafficking and associated crime and violence continue to rise throughout the region, the United States has implemented programs to strengthen partnerships with the States of the Western Hemisphere to combat illicit trafficking in arms. The U.S. has offered technical assistance to all States in the hemisphere, outlining available U.S. small arms and light weapons-related assistance programs to combat illicit trafficking. Programs are being designed to address the specific needs of individual States. Some highlights of our efforts to combat illicit trafficking include: As part of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, the United States is partnering with Caribbean States to develop programs that address requests for technical assistance to help tackle trafficking in firearms throughout the region. The United States signed eTrace agreements with all seven Central American States and 14 of the 15 Caribbean States. ETrace is a web-based firearm trace request submission system that provides for the electronic exchange of criminal gun data in a secure environment. Expanding eTrace participation throughout the hemisphere was a priority for 2010, including the introduction of a Spanish version of the eTrace software. The United States provided the Organization of American States (OAS) a grant to supply marking equipment to States in the region in order to increase hemispheric capability to trace firearms and identify illicit trafficking routes and suppliers. The United States has assessed and offered stockpile management and destruction assistance to a number of States in Latin America and the Caribbean. Through the destruction of aging and unsafe stockpiles, States are avoiding the potential disaster of an explosion, ensuring an increased level of safety for their citizens.",

The International Organizations and Programs (IO&P) appropriation was funded at $394 million in FY 2010. IO&P provided international organizations voluntary contributions that advanced U.S. strategic goals by supporting and enhancing international consultation and coordination. This approach is required in transnational areas where solutions to problems are best addressed globally, such as protecting the ozone layer or safeguarding international air traffic. In other areas, such as in development programs, the United States can multiply the influence and effectiveness of its contributions through support for international programs. The FY 2010 Democracy Fund appropriation was funded at $120 million. The resources promoted democracy in priority countries where egregious human rights violations occur, democracy and human rights advocates are under pressure, governments are not democratic or are in transition, and where there is growing demand for human rights and democracy. The Department of State’s FY 2011 budget request for foreign assistance is $12 billion, and is currently still under Congressional consideration. The request provides $10 billion for international security assistance programs, such as INCLE ($2.1 billion), NADR ($758 million), PKO ($286 million), IMET ($110 million), FMF ($5.5 billion), and a new account called the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund ($1.2 billion). The requests for MRA ($1.6 billion) and ERMA ($45 million) will support overseas humanitarian assistance, and programs to admit refugees into the United States. Further, the request provides another $350.5 million for voluntary contributions to international organizations.",

    "text": "Challenges in Foreign Assistance The United States confronts threats more diffuse and complex than at any time in our history: Iraq and Afghanistan, terrorism, climate change, pandemic disease, extreme poverty, weapons proliferation, and global criminal networks all represent the transnational and sub-national challenges we face. The key to America’s security and prosperity is a stable and secure world. Our power does not come from our military might alone, but also from our values, our capacity to form strong partnerships, and our ability to improve the lives of others so we do not have to pay the price of global poverty, instability, and ultimately, conflict in the long run. The Office of the Director of U.S. Foreign Assistance (F) was established in 2006 with the mission of coordinating foreign assistance. To better coordinate U.S. foreign assistance programs within a country, F changed the budget formulation process to require a budget developed jointly from the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The joint foreign assistance budget is submitted to the Office of Management and Budget by F on the Secretary’s behalf. Each annual budget submission is controlled by a series of budget formulation database tables providing an overarching view of the budget formulation process. Once funding is appropriated, F requires each mission and Washington-based bureau that receives foreign assistance funding to submit an operational plan. The operational plan is a joint State and USAID document describing how appropriated foreign assistance funds will be spent. Because functional bureaus participate in this process by preparing operational plans, programs are much better understood by the missions in which they are implemented. State and USAID also develop and submit an annual joint Performance Plan and Report that describes their results and reports on standardized foreign assistance indicators developed by F. Many missions use this as an opportunity jointly to review the programs and make adjustments to improve effectiveness.",

    "text": "Measuring the results of foreign assistance programs remains paramount to achieving key national priorities while building the foundation for lasting global progress. However, attributing specific results to U.S. funding can be very difficult. Foreign assistance results can take years to accomplish, and U.S. assistance funds are often only a small part of the resources being directed at a problem. Other donors may also be contributing funds, as well as the host government and other partners. Finding indicators that describe assistance results effectively, and that can be collected at minimal cost and in a timely manner, can pose significant challenges. Both State and USAID continue to enhance their capacity to measure results. Both agencies continue reinvigorated monitoring and evaluation capacities, including adding staff to these functions and putting training and technical resources in place to help with performance management. The future challenge is better integrating the development of scarce foreign assistance program resources with personnel and other administrative requirements. The focus will be towards making targeted investments in a few key areas of convergence – food security, health, climate change, and global engagement. Under the leadership of the Department of State’s Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources, efforts are underway to integrate the foreign assistance and State Department operations budgeting processes better, so that personnel and administrative resources are optimally positioned for the effective management of foreign assistance.",

The Chilean government estimates the cost of the earthquake will be almost $30 billion. Secretary Clinton visited Chile soon after the quake to extend the American people’s sympathy and solidarity. She also brought with her the first of the supplies and assistance sent by the U.S. Government in support of Chile’s relief efforts. USAID provided nearly $10 million in assistance in the weeks and months following the earthquake, including the provision of temporary shelter materials, water, sanitation and hygiene supplies, mobile water treatment units, generators, and large tents to expand a medical unit. In addition, USAID provided $1 million to the International Federation of the Red Cross for the local purchase and distribution of emergency relief supplies and also supported the deployment to Chile of the U.S. Air Force Expeditionary Medical Support field hospital. Pakistan Floods of unprecedented and tragic proportions began in Pakistan on July 29, 2010. The United States responded immediately to Pakistan’s call for assistance, by late August providing approximately $250 million to support relief and early recovery efforts. U.S. military and civilian aircraft evacuated 9,433 people and delivered more than 2,752,413 pounds of relief supplies. U.S. water treatment units have supplied millions of liters of safe drinking water. The U.S. military delivered over 440,000 meals to Pakistan. Secretary Clinton called upon the international community, at a United Nations General Assembly Special Session on August 19, to donate to Pakistan relief. The Secretary also announced the Pakistan Relief Fund, created by the U.S. Government through the Department of State, as a mechanism for the public to contribute to the ongoing relief effort.",

All levels of management are responsible for ensuring adequate controls over all Department operations. The Department of State’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control and financial management systems that meet the objectives of the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA). The Department conducted its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over the efficiency and effectiveness of operations and compliance with applicable laws and regulations in accordance with OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control. Based on the results of this evaluation, the Department can provide reasonable assurance that its internal control over the effectiveness and efficiency of operations and compliance with applicable laws and regulations and financial management systems met the objectives of FMFIA as of September 30, 2010. In addition, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, which includes safeguarding of assets and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Department conducted its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123. Based on the results of this assessment, the Department can provide reasonable assurance that its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2010 was operating effectively and the Department found no material weaknesses in the design or operation of the internal control over financial reporting. As a result of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even if the internal control over financial reporting is determined to be effective, it can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. These systems of internal controls are also being used to support our stewardship over the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) spending by the Department. Our assessments of internal controls, along with senior managers’ assurance statements and our review for improper payments for Recovery Act activities, allow the Department to provide reasonable assurance that the key accountability objectives of the Recovery Act are being met and that significant risks to meeting Recovery Act accountability objectives are being mitigated.",

OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Internal Control, implements the FMFIA and defines management’s responsibility for internal control in federal agencies. In 2004, Appendix A of Circular A-123 was added to improve governance and accountability for internal control over financial reporting in federal entities similar to the internal control requirements for publicly-traded companies contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Circular A-123 requires that the agency head provide a separate assurance statement on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (ICOFR), which is an addition to and also a component of the overall FMFIA assurance statement. The Secretary of State’s 2010 Annual Assurance Statement for FMFIA and ICOFR is provided on the preceding page.

This will be a flagship partnership in advancing the New Beginning effort. Led by Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Vice-Chairs Walter Isaacson (CEO, Aspen Institute) and Muhtar Kent (Chairman and CEO, Coca-Cola Company), PNB seeks to engage Muslim communities globally on the basis of mutual interest, respect, and responsibility. The PNB Secretariat operates in close partnership with the Department, facilitated by the Office of Policy Planning, the Special Representative to Muslim Communities, and the Special Representative for Global Partnerships. PNB inaugurated its full Steering Committee in September 2010 at the Clinton Global Initiative’s Annual Meeting. PNB announced commitments to improve the lives of up to 500,000 people by providing increased access to finance, improved business capacity and development services, greater educational opportunities for students and teachers, enhanced physical and virtual exchange programs, and new science and technology solutions across the priority geographical areas of Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan and West Bank/Gaza. In the coming months, PNB will reach out to U.S. companies, universities, laboratories, research centers, NGOs, foundations, philanthropists, and others to harness their resources, capabilities and expertise to complement New Beginning programs and partnerships.

It is a comprehensive view of the Department’s financial activities set against the backdrop of global issues and engagements we face as an institution working to carry out U.S. foreign policy and advance U.S. interests abroad. It is also a snapshot in time of the immense financial work that occurs behind the scenes every day by Department financial personnel as we operate in more than 270 locations, 172 countries, and in over 150 currencies and foreign languages, often in the most challenging environments. This is my second opportunity to provide perspective on the AFR and annual audit results as the Department’s Acting Chief Financial Officer. It is a long and exacting march to reach the annual financial statements as part of the AFR by November 15. We have worked smarter and with unity of purpose this year to meet the demands and paces of the external audit process in order to demonstrate the strong financial management work that is conducted on a daily basis in the Department. I would like to express my sincere thanks and appreciation to the Department’s financial professionals, whose consistent efforts to plan, execute, and account for the Department’s global resources is the foundation of any success and our stewardship of public dollars. It has been a concerted and dedicated effort by all stakeholders involved. The scale and complexity of the Department’s activities and corresponding financial management requirements have grown significantly in the face of a wide range of global and regional issues. Secretary Clinton has challenged the Department to increase its capacity to utilize “Smart Power” by intelligently leveraging our diplomatic and development tools to reinvigorate our leadership around the world and amplify all facets of Civilian Power. The upcoming results of the first ever Quadrennial Diplomatic and Development Review (QDDR) will help further define and shape how we accomplish this goal. Fundamentally, we understand that strong financial management and internal controls provide the building blocks to support the transparency of operations and accountability to effectively manage our resources and support these efforts. In today’s fiscal climate, this financial role will have added significance and an even brighter spotlight as we work to squeeze the most value from our limited resources and execute investment decisions that support our most critical needs. We continue to work diligently to embrace the broadening landscape of financial compliance and reporting requirements and proactively incorporate them into our ongoing budgetary and financial operations. We recognize that the Annual Financial Reporting process is an essential discipline that has provided valuable benefit in the past and will continue in the future. At the same time, we want to be cognizant to strike the right balance between data driven compliance and reasoned practice tied to outcomes. The ultimate goal of course is to support a strong and efficient financial platform that furthers the Department’s global operations and mission as well as provide accurate and high-value financial information for decision-makers and transparency and confidence for the American public.",

Geisel SUBJECT: Independent Auditor’s Report on the U.S. Department of State 2010 and 2009 Financial Statements (AUD/FM-11-03) An independent certified public accounting firm, Kearney & Company, P.C., was engaged to audit the financial statements of the U.S. Department of State (Department) as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and for the years then ended, to provide a report on internal control over financial reporting (including safeguarding assets) and compliance with laws and regulations, to report on whether the Department’s financial management systems substantially complied with the requirements of the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), and to report any reportable noncompliance with laws and regulations it tested. The contract required that the audit be performed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards; Office of Management and Budget audit guidance; and the Financial Audit Manual, issued by the Government Accountability Office and the President’s Council on Integrity and Efficiency. In its audit of the Department, Kearney & Company, P.C., found • the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of net cost and changes in net position for the years then ended, and the related combined statement of budgetary resources for the year ended September 30, 2010, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Department as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and its net cost of operations and changes in net position for the years then ended, and its changes in budgetary resources for the year ended September 30, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Kearney & Company, P.C., was unable to obtain sufficient evidential support for the amounts presented in the 2009 UNCLASSIFIED 60 | United States Department of State • 2010 Agency Financial Report Financial Section Independent Auditor’s Report combined statement of budgetary resources and therefore was unable to express an opinion on the 2009 combined statement of budgetary resources; • no material weaknesses1 in internal control; and • instances of reportable noncompliance with laws and regulations tested, including instances in which the Department’s financial management systems did not substantially comply with FFMIA. Kearney & Company, P.C., is responsible for the attached auditor’s report, which includes the Report of Independent Auditors, the Report on Internal Control, and the Report on Compliance and Other Matters, dated November 14, 2010, and the conclusions expressed in the report. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) does not express an opinion on the Department’s financial statements or conclusions on internal control and compliance with laws and regulations, including whether the Department’s financial management systems substantially complied with FFMIA. Comments on the auditor’s report from the Bureau of Resource Management are attached to the report. OIG appreciates the cooperation extended to it and Kearney & Company, P.C., by Department managers and staff during the conduct of this audit.",

    "text": "Attachments: As stated. 1 A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2010 Agency Financial Report • United States Department of State | 61 Financial Section Independent Auditor’s Report 1701 Duke Street, Suite 500, Alexandria, VA 22314 PH: 703.931.5600, FX: 703.931.3655, www.kearneyco.com REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS To the Secretary and Inspector General of the U.S. Department of State We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of the U.S. Department of State (Department) as of September 30\n\n, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of net cost and changes in net position and combined statements of budgetary resources for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Department’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. Except as described in the following paragraphs, we conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The Department was unable to provide timely and complete competent evidential matter to enable us to perform audit procedures to satisfy ourselves that the combined statement of budgetary resources for the year ended September 30, 2009, was free of material misstatements. Our audit work identified issues related to the systems, processes, and internal controls supporting financial reporting, as well as key account balances. As a result of these limitations, we were unable to obtain sufficient evidential support for the amounts presented in the 2009 combined statement of budgetary resources. Because of the matter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on the combined statement of budgetary resources for the year ended September 30, 2009. In our report dated December 14, 2009, we expressed an opinion that the scope of our work was not sufficient to express an unqualified opinion on the 2009 consolidated balance sheet and statement of changes in net position. We qualified our report based on a scope limitation related to property and equipment. The Department was unable to provide timely and complete competent evidential matter to enable us to perform audit procedures to satisfy ourselves that the property and equipment balance was free of material misstatements. Our work identified issues related to land valuation; identification and valuation of assets and liabilities under capital leases; completeness and accuracy of real property; and existence, completeness, and valuation of 1 62 | United States Department of State • 2010 Agency Financial Report Financial Section Independent Auditor’s Report 2 personal property. As a result of these limitations, we were unable to obtain sufficient evidential support for property and equipment amounts presented in the 2009 consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of net position. As described in Note 20, the Department addressed these issues and restated its 2009 financial statements. Accordingly, our present opinion on the 2009 consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in net position, as presented herein, is different from that expressed in our previous report. In our opinion, the consolidated balance sheets of the Department as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of net cost and changes in net position for the years then ended, and the combined statement of budgetary resources for the year ended September 30 2010, including the accompanying notes, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Department as of September 30, 2010 and 2009, and its net cost of operations and changes in net position for the years then ended, and its changes in budgetary resources for the year ended September 30, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Department’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis, other Required Supplementary Information (including stewardship information), and other accompanying information contain a wide range of information, some of which is not directly related to the financial statements. We do not express an opinion on this information. However, we compared this information for consistency with the financial statements and discussed the methods of measurement and presentation with the Department. On the basis of this limited work, we found no material inconsistencies with the financial statements, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended. In accordance with Government Auditing Standards and OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended, we have also issued reports, dated November 14, 2010, on our consideration of the Department’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws and regulations for the year ended September 30, 2010. The purpose of those reports is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control",

Those reports are an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended, and should be considered in assessing the results of our audits. November 14, 2010 2010 Agency Financial Report • United States Department of State | 63 Financial Section Independent Auditor’s Report 1701 Duke Street, Suite 500, Alexandria, VA 22314 PH: 703.931.5600, FX: 703.931.3655, www.kearneyco.com REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL To the Secretary and Inspector General of the U.S. Department of State We have audited the financial statements of the U.S. Department of State (Department) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2010, and have issued our report dated November 14, 2010. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended. The management of the Department is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and assessing internal control related to financial reporting and compliance. In planning and performing our work, we considered the Department’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance by obtaining an understanding of the design effectiveness of the Department’s internal control, determining whether controls had been placed in operation, assessing control risk, and performing tests of the Department’s controls as a basis for designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements and not to provide an opinion on the internal controls. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance or on management’s assertion on internal control included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis. We limited our internal control testing to those controls necessary to achieve OMB Bulletin No. 07-04 control objectives that provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance, that: (1) transactions are properly recorded, processed, and summarized to permit the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), and assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition; and (2) transactions are executed in compliance with laws governing the use of budget authority, government-wide policies and laws identified in Appendix E of OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended, and other laws and regulations that could have a direct and material effect on financial statements. We did not test all internal controls relevant to operating objectives, as broadly defined by the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act, such as those controls relevant to ensuring efficient operations. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 1 64 | United States Department of State • 2010 Agency Financial Report Financial Section Independent Auditor’s Report Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the preceding paragraphs and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be deficiencies, significant deficiencies, or material weaknesses. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the following deficiencies in the Department’s internal control to be significant deficiencies. Significant Deficiencies I. Financial Reporting The Department compiles its financial statements through a multi-step process using a combination of manual and automated procedures. Neither the Department’s Global Financial Management System nor the “top level” Hyperion reporting system are used to fully compile the statements. The inability of the financial management system to track the necessary attributes related to financial reporting forces the Department to use a manual, labor-intensive process to develop its balance sheet, statement of net cost, and statement of changes in net position. The necessary data is extracted from multiple systems and source files, and is sometimes manually keyed into crosswalk files or statement preparation templates (Excel workbooks), which ultimately create the Department’s financial statements. In addition, the Department lacks a budgetary financial reporting system that is",

Financial reporting was identified as a material weakness in the 2009 financial statement audit.  A corrective action plan was developed and implemented during FY 2010, including an analysis of the compilation process and implementation of manual compensating controls. While improvements were made, the preparation of financial statements outside the Department’s financial systems and the lack of an integrated budgetary and financial process remain a significant deficiency.",

These actions identified significant misstatements and resulted in restatements of 2009 P&E balances.

    "text": "REPORT ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS\n\nTo the Secretary and Inspector General of the U.S. Department of State\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of the U.S. Department of State (Department) as of and for the year ended September 30, 2010, and have issued our report dated November 14, 2010. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Bulletin No. 07-04, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, as amended.\n\nThe management of the Department is responsible for compliance with laws and regulations. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Department’s financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of the Department’s compliance with certain provisions of laws and regulations, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts and certain other laws and regulations specified in OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended. As part of our work, we performed tests of compliance with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA), Section 803(a) requirements. We limited our tests of compliance to these provisions, and we did not test compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to the Department. Providing an opinion on compliance with certain provisions was not an objective of our audit and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\n\nThe results of our testing disclosed instances of noncompliance or other matters exclusive of FFMIA that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards and the requirements of OMB Bulletin No. 07-04, as amended, and which are summarized in the following paragraphs:\n\n• Antideficiency Act. This act prohibits the Department from (1) making or authorizing an expenditure from, or creating or authorizing an obligation under, any appropriation or fund in excess of the amount available in the appropriation or fund unless authorized by law; (2) involving the Government in any obligation to pay money before funds have been appropriated for that purpose, unless otherwise allowed by law; and (3) making obligations or expenditures in excess of an apportionment or reapportionment, or in excess of the amount permitted by agency regulations. Our audit procedures identified Department of the Treasury (Treasury) fund symbols with negative balances potentially in violation of the Antideficiency Act.\n\n• Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. This act requires the development and maintenance of an integrated accounting and financial management system that (1) complies with applicable accounting principles, standards and requirements, and internal control standards; (2) complies with such policies and requirements as may be prescribed by the Director of OMB; (3) complies with any other requirements applicable to such systems; and (4) provides for (i) complete, reliable, consistent, and timely information that is prepared on a uniform basis and is responsive to the financial information needs of agency management; (ii) the development and reporting of cost information; (iii) the integration of accounting and budgeting information; and (iv) the systematic measurement of performance. However, we found that the Department’s financial system does not fully integrate accounting and budgetary information.",

This circular requires the Department to establish and maintain an accounting system that provides for (1) complete disclosure of the financial results of the activities of the Department; (2) adequate financial information for Department management, and for formulation and execution of the budget; and (3) effective control over revenue, expenditure, funds, property, and other assets. However, we found that the financial system did not maintain effective control over property, budgetary accounting, and financial reporting.\n\n• Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of 1950. This act requires an accounting system to provide full disclosure of the results of financial operations, adequate financial information needed in the management of operations and the formulation and execution of the budget, and effective control over income, expenditures, funds, property, and other assets. The Department lacks a budgetary financial reporting system that is integrated with the financial management system general ledger, which forces the Department to use a manual, labor-intensive process to develop the statement of budgetary resources. In addition, we found that the Department’s financial system does not provide effective control over property and unliquidated obligations.\n\n• Prompt Payment Act of 1982. This act requires Federal agencies to make payments in a timely manner, pay interest penalties when payments are late, and take discounts only when payments are made within the discount period. Audit procedures identified multiple instances in which the Department had incorrectly calculated interest penalties on overdue payments. Additionally, we found that the Department did not consistently pay interest penalties for overseas payments that were not paid in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act.\n\nUnder FFMIA, we are required to report whether the Department’s financial management systems substantially comply with Federal financial management systems requirements, applicable Federal accounting standards, and the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) at the transaction level. We noted certain instances, described below, in which the Department’s financial management systems did not substantially comply with certain Federal system requirements, Federal accounting standards, and the USSGL at the transaction level.",

The Department operates in over 270 locations in 172 countries, while conducting business in 150 currencies and an even larger number of languages. Few agencies or corporations have the variety of challenges that the men and women of the Department of State (Department) face daily. Despite these complexities, the Department pursues a commitment to financial integrity, transparency, and accountability that is the equal of any large multi-national corporation. Working closely with your office and the Independent Auditor, Kearney & Company, we are pleased that we were able to achieve an unqualified opinion on our FY 2010 financial statements. It is a long and exacting march to issue the annual financial statements by November 15. We have worked smarter and with unity of purpose this year to meet the demands and paces of the external audit process in order to demonstrate the strong financial management work that is conducted on a daily basis in the Department. It has been a concerted and dedicated effort by all stakeholders involved.\n\nIt has been and continues to be a challenge for the Department to complete the audit and meet OMB’s reporting deadline given the complexity of our financial operations. The Department maintains a strong commitment to corporate governance and improving our internal controls. Therefore, we are also pleased that the Independent Auditor did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that they consider to be material weaknesses. The Report on Internal Controls cites six significant deficiencies that align themselves closely with those identified and reported by our Management Control Steering Committee. As reflected in the report, the Department has made progress in strengthening our financial processes and controls, but we also acknowledge that additional work is needed to address the reported significant deficiencies. We are committed to build on the progress made over the last year to further address these issues. We will work collaboratively and constructively with Kearney and your office on the issues identified in the Report to implement improvements and ensure their resolution. We thank you for the opportunity to comment on the draft report. We would also like to extend our appreciation to your staff and to Kearney & Company for the professional and collaborative manner in which they conducted the audit. We believe considerable progress on a number of matters was made over the past year as a result of the collaborative manner in which the audit was conducted, and the Department remains committed to improving the management of its programs and the quality of its financial reporting.",

Notes to Principal Financial Statements Organization Congress established the U.S. Department of State (“Department of State” or “Depart­ ment”), the senior executive department of the United States Government in 1789, replacing the Department of Foreign Affairs, which was established in 1781. The Department advises the President in the formulation and execution of foreign policy. As head of the Department, the Secretary of State is the President’s principal advisor on foreign affairs. 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reporting Entity and Basis of Consolidation The accompanying principal financial statements present the financial activities and position of the Department of State. The statements include all General, Special, Revolving, Trust and Deposit funds established at the Department of the Treasury to account for the resources entrusted to Department management, or for which the Department acts as a fiscal agent or custodian, (except fiduciary funds, see Note 19). Included in the Department’s reporting entity is the U.S. Section of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC). Treaties in 1848, 1853, and 1970, established the boundary between the U.S. and Mexico that extends 1,954 miles, beginning at the Gulf of Mexico, following the Rio Grande a distance of 1,255 miles and eventually ending at the Pacific Ocean below California. Established in 1889, the IBWC has responsibility for applying the boundary and water treaties between the U.S. and Mexico and settling differences that may arise in their application. Basis of Presentation and Accounting The statements are prepared as required by the CFO Act of 1990, as amended by the Government Management and Reform Act of 1994. They are presented in accordance with form and content requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, as amended. The statements have been prepared from the Department’s books and records, and are in accordance with the Department’s Accounting Policies (the significant policies are summarized below in this Note). The Department’s Accounting Policies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). GAAP for Federal entities is the hierarchy of accounting principles prescribed in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Auditing Standards No. 91, Federal GAAP Hierarchy, which is also incorporated in OMB Circular A-136. FASAB’s Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) 34, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, Including the Application of Standards Issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, incorporates the hierarchy into the FASAB’s authoritative literature. Transactions are recorded on both an accrual and budgetary basis. Budgetary accounting facilitates compliance with legal constraints. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, and exercise judgment that affects the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and net position and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues, financing sources, expenses and obligations incurred during the reporting period. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions the Department may take in the future, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the size and complexity of many of the Department’s programs, the estimates are subject to a wide range of variables, including assumptions on future economic and financial events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenues and Other Financing Sources Department operations are financed through appropriations, reimbursement for the provision of goods or services to other Federal agencies, proceeds from the sale of property, certain consular-related and other fees, and donations. In addition, the Department collects passport, visa, and other consular fees that are not retained by the Department but are deposited directly to a Treasury account. The passport and visa fees are reported as earned revenues on the Statement of Net Cost and as a transfer-out of financing sources on the Statement of Changes in Net Position. Congress annually enacts one-year and multi-year appropriations that provide the Department with the authority to obligate funds within the respective fiscal years for necessary expenses to carry out mandated program activities. In addition, Congress enacts appropriations that are available until expended. All appropriations are subject to OMB apportionment as well as Congressional restrictions. For financial statement purposes, appropriations are recorded as a financing source (i.e., Appropriations Used) and reported on the Statement of Changes in Net Position at the time they are recognized as expenditures. Appropriations expended for capitalized property and equipment are recognized when the asset is purchased. Work performed for other Federal agencies under reimbursable agreements is financed through the account providing the service and reimbursements are recognized as revenue when earned. Administrative support services at overseas posts are provided to other Federal agencies through the International Cooperative Administrative Support Services (ICASS). ICASS bills for the services it provides to agencies at overseas posts. These billings are recorded as revenue to ICASS and must cover overhead costs, operating expenses, and replacement costs for capital assets needed to carry on the operation. Proceeds from the sale of real property, vehicles, and other personal property are recognized as revenue when the proceeds are credited to the account from which the asset was funded. For non-capitalized property, the full amount realized is recognized as revenue. For capitalized property, revenue or loss is determined by whether the proceeds received were more or less than the net book value of the asset sold. The Department retains proceeds of sale, which are available for purchase of the same or similar category of property. The Department is authorized to collect and retain certain user",

The Department is also authorized to credit the respective appropriations with (1) fees for the use of Blair House; (2) lease payments and transfers from the International Center Chancery Fees Held in Trust to the International Center Project; (3) registration fees for the Office of Defense Trade Controls; (4) reimbursement for international litigation expenses; and (5) reimbursement for training foreign government officials at the Foreign Service Institute. Generally, donations received in the form of cash or financial instruments are recognized as revenue at their fair value in the period received. Contributions of services are recognized if the services received (a) create or enhance non-financial assets, or (b) require specialized skills that are provided by individuals possessing those skills, which would typically need to be purchased if not donated. Works of art, historical treasures, and similar assets that are added to collections are not recognized at the time of donation. If subsequently sold, proceeds from the sale of these items are recognized in the year of sale. More information on earned revenues can be found in Note 15. Allocation Transfers Allocation transfers are legal delegations by one federal agency of its authority to obligate budget authority and outlay funds to another agency. The Department processes allocation transfers with other federal agencies as both a transferring (parent) agency of budget authority to a receiving (child) entity and as a receiving (child) agency of budget authority from another transferring (parent) entity. A separate fund account (allocation account) is created in the U.S. Treasury as a subset of the parent fund account for tracking and reporting purposes. Subsequent obligations and outlays incurred by the child agency are charged to this allocation account as they execute the delegated activity on behalf of the parent agency. Generally, all financial activities related to allocation transfers (i.e., budget authority, obligations, outlays) are reported in the financial statements of the parent agency. An exception to this rule is for transfers from the Executive Office of the President for whom the Department is the receiving agency. Per OMB guidance, the Department reports all activity relative to these allocation transfers in its financial statements. The Department allocates funds, as the parent, to Department of Defense, Department of Labor, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Peace Corps, and the USAID. In addition, the Department receives allocation transfers, as the child, from USAID. Fund Balances with Treasury The Fund Balances with Treasury are available to pay accrued liabilities and finance authorized commitments relative to goods, services, and benefits. The Department does not maintain cash in commercial bank accounts for the funds reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for the Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Services, Office of Foreign Missions, Foreign Service National Defined Contributions Retirement Fund, and the International Center. Treasury processes domestic receipts and disbursements. The Department operates two Financial Service Centers, which are located in Bangkok, Thailand, and Charleston, South Carolina, and provide financial support for the Department and other Federal agencies’ operations overseas. The U.S. Disbursing Officer at each Center has the delegated authority to disburse funds on behalf of the Treasury. See Note 3 for additional information on Fund Balances with Treasury.",

    "text": "Accounts and Loans Receivable Intergovernmental Accounts Receivable are due principally from other Federal agencies for ICASS services, reimbursable agreements, and Working Capital Fund (WCF) services. Accounts and Loans Receivable from non-Federal entities are primarily the result of repatriation loans and IBWC receivables for Mexico’s share of IBWC activities. The U.S. and Mexican Governments generally share the total costs of IBWC projects in proportion to their respective benefits in cases of projects for mutual control and utilization of the waters of a boundary river, unless the Governments have predetermined by treaty the division of costs according to the nature of a project. The Department provides repatriation loans for destitute American citizens overseas whereby the Department becomes the lender of last resort. These loans provide assistance to pay for return transportation, food and lodging, or medical expenses. The borrower executes a promissory note without collateral. Consequently, the loans are made anticipating a low rate of recovery. Interest, penalties, and administrative fees are assessed if the loan becomes delinquent. Accounts and Loans Receivable from non-Federal entities are subject to the full debt collection cycle and mechanisms, e.g., salary offset, referral to collection agents, and Treasury offset. In addition, Accounts Receivable from non-Federal entities are assessed interest, penalties and administrative fees if they become delinquent. Interest and penalties are assessed at the Current Value of Funds Rate established by Treasury. Accounts Receivable is reduced to net realizable value by an Allowance for Uncollectable Accounts. See Note 5 for more information on Accounts and Loans Receivable. Interest Receivable Interest earned on investments, but not received as of September 30, is recognized as interest receivable. Advances and Prepayments Payments made in advance of the receipt of goods and services are recorded as advances or prepayments, and recognized as expenses when the related goods and services are received. Advances are made principally to Department employees for official travel, miscellaneous prepayments and advances to other entities for future services, and salary advances to Department employees transferring to overseas assignments. Advances and prepayments are reported as Other Assets on the Balance Sheet. Valuation of Investments The Department has several accounts that have the authority to invest cash resources. For these accounts, the cash resources not required to meet current expenditures are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the U.S. Government. These investments consist of U.S. Treasury special issues and securities. Special issues are unique public debt obligations for purchase exclusively by the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund and for which interest is computed and paid semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. They are purchased and redeemed at par, which is their carrying value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Investments by the Department’s Gift, Israeli-Arab Scholarship, Eisenhower Exchange Fellowship and Middle- Eastern-Western Dialogue accounts are in U.S. Treasury securities. Interest on these investments is paid semi-annually at various rates. These investments are reported at acquisition cost, which equals the face value net of unamortized discounts or premiums. Discounts and premiums are amortized over the life of the security using the straight-line method for Gift Funds investments, and effective interest method for the other accounts. Additional information on Investments can be found in Note 4.",

    "text": "Property and Equipment Real Property Real property assets primarily consist of facilities used for U.S. diplomatic missions abroad and capital improvements to these facilities, including unimproved land; residential and functional-use buildings such as embassy/consulate office buildings; office annexes and support facilities; and construction-in-progress. Title to these properties is held under various conditions including fee simple, restricted use, crown lease, and deed of use agreement. Some of these properties are considered historical treasures and are considered multi-use heritage assets. These items are reported on the Balance Sheet, in Note 7 to the financial statements, and in the Heritage Assets Section of Other Accompanying Information. The Department also owns several domestic real properties, including the National Foreign Affairs Training Center (Arlington, Va.); the International Center (Washington, D.C.); the Charleston Financial Services Center (S.C.); the Beltsville Information Management Center (Md.); the Florida Regional Center (Ft. Lauderdale); and consular centers in Charleston, S.C., Portsmouth, N.H. and Williamsburg, Ky. The IBWC owns buildings and structures related to its boundary preservation, flood control, and sanitation programs. Buildings and structures are carried at either actual or estimated historical cost. The Department capitalizes all costs for constructing new buildings and building acquisitions regardless of cost, and capitalizes all other improvements greater than $1 million. The capitalization threshold for improvements to Department real property was changed from $250,000 to $1,000,000 effective October 1, 2008. Costs incurred for constructing new facilities, major rehabilitations, or other improvements in the design or construction stage are recorded as Construction-in-Progress. After these projects are completed, costs are transferred to Buildings and Structures or Leasehold Improvements as appropriate. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis, principally over a 30-year period for buildings and other structures, a 10-year period for improvements, and the lesser of the useful life or the term of the lease for leasehold improvements. Personal Property Personal property consists of several asset categories including aircraft, vehicles, security equipment, communication equipment, automated data processing (ADP) equipment, reproduction equipment, and software. The Department holds title to these assets, some of which are operated in unusual conditions, as described below. The Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) uses aircraft to help eradicate and stop the flow of illegal drugs. To accomplish its mission, INL maintains an aircraft fleet that is one of the largest federal, nonmilitary fleets. Most of the aircraft are under direct INL air wing management. However, a number of aircraft are managed by host-countries. The Department holds title to most of the aircraft under these programs and requires congressional notification to transfer title for any aircraft to foreign governments. INL contracts with firms to provide maintenance support depending on whether the aircraft are INL air wing or host-country managed. INL air wing managed aircraft are maintained to FAA standards that involve routine inspection, as well as scheduled maintenance and replacements of certain parts after given hours of use. Host-country managed aircraft are maintained to host country requirements, which are less than FAA standards. The Department maintains a large vehicle fleet that operates overseas. Many vehicles require armoring for security reasons, and for some locations large utility vehicles are used instead of conventional sedans. In addition, the Department contracts with firms to provide support in strife-torn areas such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Darfur. The contractor support includes the purchase and operation of armored vehicles. Under the terms of the contracts, the Department has title to the contractor-held vehicles.",

    "text": "Personal property and equipment with an acquisition cost of $25,000 or more, and a useful life of two or more years, is capitalized at cost. Additionally, all vehicles are capitalized, as well as ADP software costing over $500,000. Except for contractor-held vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated life and begins when the property is put into service. Contractor-held vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to the harsh operating conditions, are depreciated on a double-declining balance basis. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Asset Category Estimated Useful Life Aircraft: INL airwing managed 10 years Host-country managed 5 years Vehicles: Department managed 3 to 6 years Contractor-held in Iraq and Afghanistan 2 1/2 years Security Equipment 3 to 15 years Communication Equipment 3 to 20 years Automated Data Processing Equipment 3 to 6 years Reproduction Equipment 3 to 15 years Software Estimated useful life or 5 years See Note 7, Property and Equipment, Net, for additional information. Capital Leases Leases are accounted for as capital leases if they meet one of the following criteria: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the property by the end of the lease term; (2) the lease contains an option to purchase the property at a bargain price; (3) the lease term is equal to or greater than 75% of the estimated useful life of the property; or (4) at the inception of the lease the present value of the minimum lease payment equals or exceeds 90% of the fair value of the leased property. The initial recording of the lease’s value (with a corresponding liability) is the lesser of the net present value of the lease payments or the fair value of the leased property. Capital leases that meet criteria (1) and (2) are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life (not to exceed 30 years) or the term of the lease. Capital leases that meet criteria (3) and (4) are depreciated over the useful life of the lease. Capital leases are amortized over the useful life of the lease; if the lease has an indefinite life the useful life is capped at 50 years. The capitalization threshold for capital leases was changed from $250,000 to $1,000,000 effective October 1, 2009. Additional information on Capital Leases is disclosed in Note 12. Grants The Department awards educational, cultural exchange and refugee assistance grants to various individuals, universities, and not-for-profit organizations. Budgetary obligations are recorded when grants are awarded. Grant funds are disbursed in two ways: grantees draw funds commensurate with their immediate cash needs via the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Payments Management System (PMS); or grantees submit invoices. In both cases, the expense is recorded upon disbursement. Accounts Payable Accounts payable represent the amounts accrued for contracts for goods and services received but unpaid at the end of the fiscal year and unreimbursed grant expenditures. In addition to accounts payables recorded through normal business activities, unbilled payables are estimated based upon historical data. Annual, Sick and Other Leave Annual leave is accrued as it is earned, and the accrual is reduced as leave is taken. Throughout the year the balance in the accrued annual leave liability account is adjusted to reflect current pay rates. The amount of the adjustment is recorded as an expense. Current or prior year appropriations are not available to fund annual leave earned but not taken. Funding occurs in the year the leave is taken and payment is made. Sick leave and other",

Members of the Foreign Service participate in either the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability System (FSRDS) or the Foreign Service Pension System (FSPS). Employees covered under CSRS contribute 7% of their salary; the Department contributes 7%. Employees covered under CSRS also contribute 1.45% of their salary to Medicare insurance; the Department makes a matching contribution. On January 1, 1987, FERS went into effect pursuant to Public Law 99-335. Most employees hired after December 31, 1983, are automatically covered by FERS and Social Security. Employees hired prior to January 1, 1984, were allowed to join FERS or remain in CSRS. Employees participating in FERS contribute 0.80% of their salary, with the Department making contributions of 11.20%. FERS employees also contribute 6.20% to Social Security and 1.45% to Medicare insurance. The Department makes matching contributions to both. A primary feature of FERS is that it offers a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) into which the Department automatically contributes 1% of pay and matches employee contributions up to an additional 4%. Foreign Service employees hired prior to January 1, 1984, participate in FSRDS with certain exceptions. FSPS was established pursuant to Section 415 of Public Law 99- 335, which became effective June 6, 1986. Foreign Service employees hired after December 31, 1983, participate in FSPS with certain exceptions. FSRDS employees contribute 7.25% of their salary; the Department contributes 7.25%. FSPS employees contribute 1.35% of their salary; the Department contributes 20.22%. FSRDS and FSPS employees contribute 1.45% of their salary to Medicare; the Department matches their contributions. FSPS employees also contribute 6.2% to Social Security; the Department makes a matching contribution. Similar to FERS, FSPS also offers the TSP described above. Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) and Third Country Nationals (TCNs) at overseas posts who were hired prior to January 1, 1984, are covered under CSRS. FSNs and TCNs hired after that date are covered under a variety of local government plans in compliance with the host country’s laws and regulations. In cases where the host country does not mandate plans or the plans are inadequate, employees are covered by a privately managed pension plan that conforms to the prevailing practices of comparable employers.",

Under FEHBP, the Department contributes the employer’s share of the premium as determined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Life Insurance: Unless specifically waived, employees are covered by the Federal Employees Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLIP). FEGLIP automatically covers eligible employees for basic life insurance in amounts equivalent to an employee’s annual pay, rounded up to the next thousand dollars plus $2,000. The Department pays one-third and employees pay two-thirds of the premium. Enrollees and their family members are eligible for additional insurance coverage, but the enrollee is responsible for the cost of the additional coverage.

As required by SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, the Department reports the full cost of employee benefits for the programs that OPM administers. The Department recognizes an expense and imputed financing source for the annualized unfunded portion of CSRS, post-retirement health benefits, and life insurance for employees covered by these programs. The Department recognized $238 million and $133 million in 2010 and 2009 for these benefits.

    "text": "Future Workers’ Compensation Benefits The Federal Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) provides income and medical cost protection to cover Federal employees injured on the job or who have incurred a work-related occupational disease, and beneficiaries of employees whose death is attributable to job-related injury or occupational disease. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers the FECA program. DOL initially pays valid claims and bills the employing Federal agency. DOL calculates the actuarial liability for future workers’ compensation benefits and reports to each agency its share of the liability. The actuarial liability for which the Department is responsible totaled $72 million as of both September 30, 2010 and 2009. Valuation of FSN Separation Liability Separation payments are made to eligible FSN employees who voluntarily resign, retire, or lose their jobs due to a reduction in force, and are in countries that require a voluntary separation payment. The amount required to finance the current and future costs of FSN separation pay is determined annually. Actuarial Present Value of Projected Plan Benefits for the Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Program See Note 10 on Foreign Service Retirement Actuarial Liability for the Department’s accounting policy for Foreign Service retirement-related benefits. Net Position The Department’s net position contains the following components: Unexpended Appropriations — the sum of undelivered orders and unobligated balances. Undelivered orders represent the amount of obligations incurred for goods or services ordered, but not yet received. An unobligated balance is the amount available after deducting cumulative obligations from total budgetary resources. As obligations for goods or services are incurred, the available balance is reduced. Cumulative Results of Operations — include (1) the accumulated difference between revenues and financing sources less expenses since inception; (2) the Department’s investment in capitalized assets financed by appropriation; (3) donations; and (4) unfunded liabilities, whose liquidation may require future Congressional appropriations or other budgetary resources. Net position of earmarked funds is separately disclosed. See Note 14. Foreign Currency Accounting records for the Department are maintained in U.S. dollars, while a significant amount of the Department’s overseas expenditures are in foreign currencies. For accounting purposes, overseas obligations and disbursements are recorded in U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange as of the date of the transaction. Foreign currency payments are made by the U.S. Disbursing Office. Fiduciary Activities Fiduciary activities are the collection or receipt, and the management, protection, accounting, investment, and disposition by the Federal Government of cash or other assets in which non-Federal individuals or entities have an ownership interest that the Federal Government must uphold. The Department’s fiduciary activities are not recognized on the principal financial statements, but are reported on schedules as a note to the financial statements. The Department’s fiduciary activities include receiving contributions from donors for the purpose of providing compensation for certain claims within the scope of an established agreement, investment of contributions into Treasury securities, and disbursement of contributions received within the scope of the established agreement. See Note 19 for disclosure of Fiduciary Activities.",

    "text": "Change in an Accounting Estimate The capitalization threshold for capital leases was changed from $250,000 to $1,000,000 effective October 1, 2009. As such, if the leased property has a fair value of less than $1,000,000 or if the present value of the lease payments is less than $1,000,000 then the lease will always be treated as an operating lease. The capitalization threshold for improvements to Department real property was changed from $250,000 to $1,000,000 effective October 1, 2008. In FY 2009, the actuarial estimates increased significantly over the previous year. The cause of this increase is the result of a change in the underlying assumptions used to calculate the values. The underlying assumption changed as a result of the Foreign Service Retirement Plans Actuarial Experience Study 2003 -2008, dated September 22, 2009. As a result of the study, the valuation for the assumed investment return, the assumed general salary scale, and the assumed rate of inflation have decreased by 0.5% from the previous valuations reported from FY 2004 through FY 2008. The decreases in these three economic indicators combined with changes in demographic assumptions such as withdrawal rates, active employee disability rates, and mortality rates has resulted in a significant increase, $1.8 billion, in the FSRDF reported Actuarial Liability between September 30, 2008 and 2009. Change in an Accounting Principle The Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard (SFFAS) 33 “Pensions, Other Retirement Benefits, and Other Post Employment Benefits: Reporting the Gains and Losses from Changes in Assumptions and Selecting Discount Rates and Valuation Dates” was issued by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board on October 14, 2008. SFFAS 33 became effective for fiscal years beginning after September 30, 2009. The standard establishes that the discount rate should be based on long-term assumptions such as Treasury borrowing rates for securities of similar maturity to the period over which the payments are to be made. Historical experience should be the basis for the expectations about future trends in marketable treasury securities. The discount rate, the underlying inflation rate, and the other economic assumptions should be consistent with one another. The discount rates as of the reporting date should reflect the average historical rates on marketable Treasury securities rather than giving undue weight to the current or recent past experience. The Department retains the services of a professional actuarial firm to determine these values. In applying this new standard that is prospective only, our actuaries have adjusted the economic assumptions accordingly. Further, the standard requires that the Statement of Net Cost and other disclosures display gains and losses resulting from changes in long term actuarial assumptions. Specifically, the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions are displayed in a separate line item in the Statement of Net Cost and are disclosed in detail in Note 10, Foreign Service Retirement Actuarial Liability.",

The Federal Government does not set aside assets to pay future benefits or other expenditures associated with earmarked funds. The cash receipts collected from the public for an earmarked fund are deposited in the U.S. Treasury, which uses the cash for general Government purposes. Treasury securities are issued to the Department as evidence of its receipts. Treasury securities are an asset to the Department and a liability to the Treasury. Because the Department and the U.S. Treasury are both parts of the Government, these assets and liabilities offset each other from the standpoint of the Government as a whole. For this reason, they do not represent an asset or liability in the U.S. Government-wide financial statements.\n\n5 Accounts and Loans Receivable, Net\nThe Department’s Accounts Receivable and Loans Receivable at September 30, 2010 and 2009, are summarized here (dollars in millions). All are entity receivables.\nThe allowances for uncollectible accounts are recorded using aging methodologies based on analysis of historical collections and write-offs. Included in Accounts and Loans Receivable, Net is $1 million, in both 2010 and 2009, of repatriation loans administered by the Department. Repatriation loans enable destitute American citizens overseas to return to the United States. Repatriation loans made prior to 1992 are reported net of an allowance for uncollectible loans based upon historical experience. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (the Act), as amended, governs repatriation loan obligations made after 1991, and the resulting direct loans. The Act requires that the present value of all direct costs (i.e., interest rate differentials, estimated delinquencies and defaults) associated with a loan be recognized and funded completely in the year the loan is disbursed. This value is termed the “subsidy cost” for the year, and is expressed as a percentage of the total face amount of loans disbursed that year. Funding for subsidy costs for loans made after 1991 establishes the subsidy allowance against which future collections and future loan write-offs are netted. Per the provisions of the Act, the Department borrows from Treasury the difference between the face value of loans disbursed and the appropriated subsidy costs, currently 60 percent of face value. The administrative costs associated with loan administration are separately budgeted and funded. Treasury securities provide the component entity with authority to draw upon the U.S. Treasury to make future benefits payments or other expenditures. When the Department requires redemption of these securities to make expenditures, the Government finances those expenditures out of accumulated cash balances, by raising taxes or other receipts, by borrowing from the public or repaying less debt, or by curtailing other expenditures. The Government finances most expenditures in this way.",

The value of benefits for disabled employees or survivors of employees is determined by multiplying the benefit the employee or survivor would receive on the date of disability or death, by a ratio of service at the valuation date to projected service at the time of disability or death. The Pension Actuarial Liability is calculated by applying actuarial assumptions to adjust the projected plan benefits to reflect the discounted time value of money and the probability of payment (by means of decrements such as death, disability, withdrawal or retirement) between the valuation date and the expected date of payment. The Plan uses the aggregate entry age normal actuarial cost method, whereby the present value of projected benefits for each employee is allocated on a level basis (such as a constant percentage of salary) over the employee’s service between entry age and assumed exit age. The portion of the present value allocated to each year is referred to as the normal cost.\nThe Department’s liabilities are classified as covered by budgetary resources or not covered by budgetary resources. Liabilities not covered by budgetary resources result from the receipt of goods and services, or occurrence of eligible events in the current or prior periods, for which revenue or other funds to pay the liabilities have not been made available through appropriations or current earnings of the Department.

The Pension Actuarial Liability represents the future periodic payments provided for current employee and retired Plan participants, less the future employee and employing Federal agency contributions, stated in current dollars. Future periodic payments include benefits expected to be paid to (1) retired or terminated employees or their beneficiaries; (2) beneficiaries of employees who have died;\nThe economic and demographic assumptions used to estimate the actuarial liability changed in FY 2009 as a result of an Experience Study conducted by the Department’s actuaries. Revisions made in FY 2009 included changes to the three key economic assumptions that had traditionally been set equal to the assumptions approved by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF). Since the September 30, 2009 valuation, the Board of Actuaries for the CSRDF has adapted new economic assumptions that are now consistent with the FSRDF assumptions. As discussed in Note 1 ‘Change in an Accounting Principle’, changes to certain actuarial assumption measurements were required. The table below reflects these required changes. Assumption Current Valuation (Under SFFAS No. 33) Prior Valuation Discount Rate 4.91% 5.75% Salary Scale 3.12% 3.75% Inflation Rate 2.37% 3.00% The decreases in these three economic indicators combined with other actuarial experience changes resulted in an increase of $521 million in the FSRDF reported Actuarial Liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet between September 30, 2009 and 2010. Under the previous standard, however, the actuarial liability would have been $601 million lower than the amount calculated under SFFAS No. 33.\nActuarial assumptions are based on the presumption that the Plan will continue.

The War Crimes Information Rewards Program offers rewards for information leading to the arrest, transfer, or conviction of persons indicted by a judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, or the Special Court of Sierra Leone for serious violations of international humanitarian law. Pending reward offers under the three programs total $652 million. We have paid out $151 million since FY 2003. Reward payments are funded with current year appropriations as necessary and, in the opinion of management and legal counsel, no further contingent liability is required because probable payments will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Department.",

    "text": "Earmarked funds are financed by specifically identified revenues, often supplemented by other financing sources, which remain available over time. These specifically identified revenues and other financing sources are required by statute to be used for designated activities, benefits or purposes, and accounted for separately from the Government’s general revenues. See Note 4, Investments for further information on investments in U.S. Treasury securities for earmarked funds. There are no intradepartmental transactions between the various earmarked funds. The Department administers fourteen earmarked funds as listed on the following page.  Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund (19X8186) The Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund (FSRDF) was established in 1924 to provide pensions to retired and disabled members of the Foreign Service. The FSRDF’s revenues consist of contributions from active participants and their U.S. Government agency employers; appropriations; and interest on investments. Monthly annuity payments are made to eligible retired employees or their survivors. Separated employees without title to an annuity may take a refund of their contributions. Public Law 96-465 limits the amount of administrative expense that can be charged to the fund to $5,000. Cash is invested in U.S. Treasury securities until it is needed for disbursement. The Department also issues separate annual financial statements for the FSRDF. Foreign Service National Separation Liability Trust Funds (FSNSLTF) (19X8340 and 19X8341) FSNSLTF funds separation liabilities to foreign service national (FSNs) and personal services contractor (PSCs) employees who voluntarily resign, retire, or lose their jobs due to a reduction in force. The liability is applicable only in those countries that, due to local law, require a lump- sum voluntary separation payment based on years of service. The FSNSLTF was authorized in 1991 and initially capitalized with a transfer from the Department. Contributions are made to the FSNSLTF by the Department’s appropriations, from which the FSNs and PSCs are paid. Once the liability to the separating FSN or PSC is computed in accordance with the local compensation plan, the actual disbursement is made from the FSNSLTF. Visas Fraud Detection and Prevention Funds (VFDPF) (19X5515) Visas Fraud Detection and Prevention Funds are supported by fees paid by employers applying for foreign workers under the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998 and the Global War on Terrorism and Tsunami Relief (Public Law 109-13). Section 426 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-447) authorizes one-third of the fees collected for H-1B, L, and H-2B visa applications to be available to the Department of State for fraud prevention and detection activities. These fees help finance the Department’s Border Security Program.",

Restricted Gifts must be used in the manner specified by the donor. Unrestricted Gifts can be used for any expense normally covered by an appropriation, such as representational purposes or embassy refurbishment. 15 Statement of Net Cost The Consolidated Statement of Net Cost reports the Department’s gross and net cost for its strategic objectives and strategic goals. The net cost of operations is the gross (i.e., total) cost incurred by the Department, less any exchange (i.e., earned) revenue.

In FY 2010, the Department evaluated all leases and identified 18 leases whose fair value indicated that they should be classified as capital leases. This change in classification resulted in a restatement with the following effect on the financial statements: increase assets on the Balance Sheet by $49 million and increase liabilities on the Balance Sheet by $54 million.\n\nThe third cause was to correct the valuation of internal-use software. The Department performed an analysis of all projects and discovered project costs that did not meet the criteria for capitalization and others that were not amortized appropriately. A formal process has been designed to prevent this from reoccurring. The effect of the restatement was to decrease assets on the Balance Sheet by $11 million. Cumulative Results of Operations at the beginning of 2009 on the Statement of Changes in Net Position has been adjusted for the effects of the restatements on prior years.

Fundamentally, the Department considers all of its overseas facilities to be in an “acceptable condition” in that they serve their required mission.\n\nAdopting standard criteria for a classification of acceptable condition is difficult due to the complex environment in which the Department operates. From a budgetary perspective, funding for maintenance and repair has been insufficient in the past. As a result, the Department has identified current maintenance and repair backlogs of $111 million and $84 million in 2010 and 2009 for buildings and facilities-related equipment and heritage assets that have not been funded.

Strengthening women’s political, economic and social empowerment and security are important means to achieve stability, peace and effective economic development. The office was created in 2009 to ensure key administration initiatives, such as global health, food security, and climate change are addressed in terms of how these issues impact women and families globally; and engages in strategic bilateral and multilateral dialogues with nations, including India, Pakistan, and China – to achieve U.S. objectives.\n\nThe Department is working with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries to put a first-time focus on women as drivers of economic growth – half of the 21 APEC countries have developing economies and it is calculated that the Asia-Pacific region is shortchanged in excess of $40 billion a year in GDP because of the untapped potential of women. The Department’s efforts under GWI reach women and men to build support in key countries of concern to the United States, whether in the Middle East, South and Central Asia, Africa, Asia or Latin America. In conjunction with the 2010 AGOA Ministerial (African Growth and Opportunity Act), the Department created the African Women’s Entrepreneurship Program to provide women with the tools and skills they need to more successfully implement AGOA and its benefits for building businesses and markets. The Department secured $200,000 from Exxon-Mobil to fund follow-up entrepreneurship training to support building businesses.\n\nOn behalf of the Department, the GWI Ambassador-At-Large has met with leaders, government officials, and women’s organizations, carrying the message that investment in women is a core pillar of U.S. foreign policy, development and security strategy. The Department manages the Iraqi Women’s Democracy Initiative through U.S. NGO partners working in Iraq to build the economic capacity of their women.

Governments that respect the will of their peoples and govern by consent are more successful and more stable than governments that do not. The United States will work with the international community and civil society in Africa to strengthen democratic institutions, including independent elections commissions, and to preserve the democratic gains made in recent years.\n\nAfrica contains many fragile states. Somalia remains locked in a state of war while the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to struggle to defeat rebel forces operating in the eastern part of the country. Tensions are mounting in Southern Sudan. President Obama has demonstrated his commitment to ending armed conflict on the continent by appointing a Special Envoy for Sudan and a Special Advisor for the Great Lakes. The United States is committed to supporting the African Union’s vision of an African Peace and Security Architecture, including the African Standby Force.\n\nThe Obama Administration’s new $3.5 billion food security initiative, Feed the Future, will assist 12 African focus countries. The African continent continues to suffer from weak health systems, which are taxed by the ravages of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other health challenges. The United States has a long tradition of investing in the health of the African continent through countless interventions, including providing treatment for millions of AIDS patients, bed nets to prevent malaria, training skilled birth attendants to decrease maternal mortality, and supporting vaccination campaigns to prevent childhood death.

This expansion resulted in a significant increase, primarily in volume, in amounts subject to review. This change also resulted in an increase in amounts identified for recovery. In FY 2010, the GFS domestic claims debt management process identified and validated 365 actual duplicate/erroneous payments, totaling $8.1 million, out of 412,225 total payments, totaling $22.95 billion. The claims office has collected or recovered 349 of the 365 erroneous payment debts identified during FY 2010, totaling $7.47 million, in addition to recovering 123 of prior year outstanding items totaling $410 thousand (80 percent). The primary reasons for these improper payments and debts continue to be the use of wrong vendor payment records in the funding of the awards and/or authorization of payment on submitted claims. The GFS duplicate or erroneous payment program has proven to be a cost effective tool (the program operates at an annual cost of $100 thousand) to supplement ARD’s domestic commercial debt management and recovery. Identified debts not collected by the Office of Claims are transferred to ARD for follow-up collection. Since FY 2005, this GFS program has identified 1,883 duplicate/erroneous payments ($40.57 million), and collected 1,767 identified debts ($38.33 million or a collection rate of 94 percent).",

According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the FY 2010 foreign assistance budget for the whole government is more than $32.9 billion (not including a pending FY 2010 supplemental budget request). Foreign assistance funding and the Department’s role in coordinating and managing assistance programs have grown considerably during the past several years. While the Department has made infrastructure changes to support these programs, it continues to face significant challenges. The U.S. Government delivers foreign assistance through grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, voluntary contributions, direct loans, or insurance. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has found insufficient numbers of contract and grant workforce personnel in the Department to handle all of its programs.  Additionally, OIG continues to find that some grants officers, grant officer representatives, and contract officer representatives do not have enough training or travel funds to perform their oversight responsibilities, resulting in uneven assistance oversight.  OIG has noted that some assistance programs need closer monitoring after award to ensure performance goals are met and that management controls are in place and working. This was especially true in conflict environments where security risks impeded proper performance monitoring during site visits. The absence of such oversight increases the risk of fraud. Inadequate performance evaluation has also resulted in the allotment and obligation of assistance funds repeatedly during several years that produced only meager results. In its embassy inspections, OIG has found that chiefs of mission—especially those with high value assistance programs—need to provide more active leadership and coordination. They need to ensure that assistance programs complement each other, integrate with the mission and bureau’s overall strategy, and that the agency best suited to oversee each program is given responsibility to do so.",

The Department estimates that, on average, each overseas position costs $500,000. While the Department has made progress through required mission rightsizing reviews, better National Security Decision Directive 38 tools, the capital security cost sharing program, and required leadership and management training, OIG has found that the Department continues to have difficulty ensuring that the right number and mix of personnel staff our embassies and domestic bureaus. During several recent post and domestic bureau inspections, OIG identified deficiencies in senior leadership indicating a failure to assign officers with strong interpersonal and team-building skills to senior positions. The deficiencies include the inability to address poor performance issues, establishing an atmosphere of intimidation, a failure to set priorities, and micromanagement. In many cases, problems have caused valuable mission employees to curtail their assignments. OIG has also identified training gaps at several overseas locations.  Overuse of language waivers that allow officers to start assignments before obtaining the required language proficiency has also had an impact. Although the Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and Innovation requires that missions conduct regular rightsizing reviews, OIG has found some missions do not conduct reviews on time and that others treat the reviews as paperwork exercises rather than opportunities to reassess staffing needs based on changing mission priorities. Shortcomings in rightsizing reviews and use of the NSDD-38 process have allowed haphazard growth at some missions.  Additionally, more agencies and bureaus are sending staff on long-term temporary duty assignments. Although these assignments essentially equate to a full-time presence, the staff do not fill direct hire positions and are therefore not subject to the NSDD-38 process. These assignments have left some missions with space, funding, and administrative support problems.",

Through engagement, assistance, and dialogue, the Department fosters a two-way flow of people, ideas, and information. Although the Department saw a significant expansion in the number of public diplomacy officers after consolidation with the United States Information Agency in 1999, many of the Department’s newer officers have spent their first tours in consular or other out-of-cone assignments. While their ability and enthusiasm are high, many of these officers are now serving in public diplomacy leadership positions in smaller missions without ever having had assignments in their specialties. Some bureaus have discussed creating a formal mentoring program, and at least one is considering employing retired foreign service officers to assist first-time public affairs officers (PAO) by visiting the embassies.  Mentoring and providing guidance for these officers is a challenge for the Department. The Department has made good progress in ensuring that public diplomacy is incorporated into every part of the Mission Strategic Resource Plans (MSRP). However, many public diplomacy sections have been less effective in developing a strategic communications plan. There is a greater need for a more careful analysis of audience, message, and media that will lead to the development of a communication plan that draws on the program resources available to a PAO.  Although the Office of the Undersecretary of State for Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy has been working with regional bureaus in developing tools for assisting overseas missions to develop and implement more effective strategic communication strategies, these efforts are still a work in progress. Despite staffing and financial constraints, embassies are increasingly using social media as a public diplomacy tool to reach a younger audience, some with notable success.  However, bringing the plethora of Department social media sites into conformance with the new FAM provisions and enhancing the sites’ effectiveness at promoting engagement presents the next challenge.",

    "text": "Protecting people, which continues to be the Department’s highest priority and its greatest challenge, is becoming even more challenging as an increasing number of U.S. diplomatic facilities are being established and maintained in areas of armed conflict or super-high threat, which in prior years would have been closed due to the threat to personnel and facilities. In response, the Department has instituted more high-threat training for post personnel, more rigorous security procedures at these posts, and at some facilities, physical security measures far in excess of those required for other diplomatic missions worldwide. The challenge to the Department will be the establishment and maintenance of appropriate security measures in these areas, a substantively different and relatively new area in the Department’s security program. Although the Department has undertaken a vigorous program to replace those U.S. diplomatic facilities that do not meet the Department’s security standards, many missions are still operating in sub-standard facilities, with projected dates for the construction of new facilities years in the offing, the highest priority being given to missions with the highest risk. Nevertheless, as recent events demonstrated, localities viewed as low risk can turn violent very quickly. At those facilities that do not meet security standards, the Department needs to continue to identify and implement necessary interim security measures to protect people, facilities, and information until such time as permanent, secure facilities can be constructed. The Department needs to put more focus on the memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the chief of mission (COM) and the geographic combatant commander (COCOM), which specifies either the COM or COCOM as having security responsibility for every Department of Defense element in the country.  Office of Inspector General inspections conducted in FY 2010 found several missions with MOAs that were either inaccurate or out-of-date. Adequately protecting U.S. overseas personnel requires clearly defined security responsibility.  In an audit of maintenance and improvements (M&I) of overseas property, OIG found that posts’ M&I needs were not met, primarily because the funding that the Department received was not sufficient. The lack of sufficient funds to address M&I needs has resulted in deteriorating facilities at posts.",

    "text": "Significant challenges face the Department during the transition from military to civilian presence in Iraq, including the effects of the delays in forming a new government in Iraq; securing people and facilities; budget adequacy and long-term cost sustainability. The U.S. has not been able to complete negotiations on future posts or programs due to delays in Iraq’s formation of a new government. These delays, in turn, have affected the United States’ ability to complete detailed plans and budgets. Diplomatic Security (DS) does not currently have the capacity to fully secure the facilities and movement of people for a large civilian presence, depending on security conditions and the availability of resources. As troops draw down, DS will be required to expand its security responsibilities in a dangerous environment and where, at previous diplomatic posts, State might have closed the post and evacuated all personnel. DS must provide security for this presence, which will require DS to expand already large operations in Iraq and replace the military’s protection services. The Department is requesting $1.9 billion to provide for this security. In addition, pending approval from the Government of Iraq, State and the Department of Defense (DOD) are considering options and potential funding sources for a large U.S. Office of Security Cooperation. The office could employ about 350 personnel in Baghdad and other locations and would continue DOD’s mission of supporting Iraq’s military development.\n\nThe Department requested $4.7 billion in the FY 2010 supplemental and FY 2011 budget to fund its plans for a large civilian presence in Iraq during and after the drawdown of U.S. forces. These budget requests may not reflect the actual costs of its future civilian presence. These requests were based on staffing estimates that continue to change and affect cost estimates for security and construction. FY 2012 costs for Iraq are likely to rise: the FY 2011 request only funds the final months of FY 2011 when State assumes responsibility for these posts and programs from DOD. For example, State only requested 3 months’ worth of operations costs, $294.6 million, for police training in FY 2011, to cover the transition from DOD. Full year costs are expected to be more than $1 billion. In the long term, the Department plans to maintain a robust presence that will include its largest embassy in the world and an extensive field presence of four branch offices with thousands of personnel. Further, the Department plans to operate a costly police development program, involving more than 200 hundred police advisors and hundreds of support contractors. And, the Department may need to absorb hundreds of support roles or activities currently undertaken by the military, such as working with the Government of Iraq to ensure its aviation system is compliant with international standards.",

    "text": "A new international relations orthodoxy is coalescing, to the effect that America is slouching towards mediocrity. In newspaper columns articles and on TV talk shows you will hear journalists charting the “relentless relative decline” of the United States. The military is overstretched; the economy is exposed; the political system is broken; the punters are suffering from an Iraq-induced hangover; and when it comes to international legitimacy, the White House has maxed out America’s credit card. And all the time, potential competitors such as China, the European Union, Russia, India and Iran are closing in. The best works in this area, by Richard Haass and Fareed Zakaria, are full of insight. Yet as a non-American living in the United States, I’m struck by the gulf that still remains between America and the rest – in terms of hard power, soft power and what we could call “smart power.” In relation to hard power, the $14 trillion American economy dwarfs all the others. The United States spends roughly as much on its military as the rest of the world combined. Washington has been bloodied and diverted by its foolhardy invasion of Iraq, but it remains the only capital capable of running a truly global foreign policy and projecting military power anywhere on earth. Almost every country thinks it has a special relationship with the United States, based on shared history or values – or clashing ones. None of the great challenges facing humanity can be solved without the Americans. \n\nSmart Power: Exaggerating America’s Decline\nMichael Fullilove\nJune 18, 2008\nAmerica has some worrying weaknesses – but we should not ignore the frailties of others: the cleavages in China, the divisions within Europe, the dark side of Russia, or the poverty of India. In terms of soft power, too – the ability to get others to want what you want – the case for America’s decline is easily overstated. America retains its hold on the world’s imagination. For most non-Americans around the world, America’s politics are, at some level, our politics as well. Why is the world so interested? America’s bulk is only part of the answer. Ultimately, it is not really the size of the U.S. economy that draws our attention. It is not even America’s blue-water navy or its new bunker-busting munitions. Rather, it is the idea of America which continues to fascinate: a superpower that is open, democratic, meritocratic and optimistic; a country that is the cockpit of global culture; a polity in which all candidates for public office, whether or not they are a Clinton, seem to come from a place called Hope. It’s worth noting that the declinist canon has emerged at the nadir of the Bush years; America’s soft power account will look much healthier the instant the next president is inaugurated. The final source of U.S. influence is the way in which American ideas continue to inform global narratives – its smart power. If you have an argument to make, or a book to publish, or a doctrine to expound, then the United States is the place where you must do it. It is not just that the market is so big, or that the world’s attention means that events that occur in the United States today are fodder for pundits everywhere tomorrow. Just as important is the sheer quality of the creative output from America’s great universities, think tanks, newspapers and magazines. The effect of all this is that the opinions of Americans on the great issues of the day ripple out through the world and are repackaged everywhere. Smart power flows from human creativity, which is why Americans should be happy about the migration flows that are replenishing their nation’s human capital. Both blue- collar workers and gold-collar workers continue to be drawn here like iron filings to a magnet. It is hard to imagine future Fareed Zakarias – or, for that matter, future Barack Obamas – emigrating to China or Russia or Iran instead of the United States. There is a long tradition of foreign visitors bemoaning that such a strong country as the United States is so stupid. They could not be more wrong: America is powerful because it is smart.",

    "section": "Remarks",
    "text": "Smart Power: From Theory to Practice\nSuzanne Nossel\nDeputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of International Organization Affairs\nCitizens for Global Solutions Annual Conference\nWashington, DC\nMarch 17, 2011\nIn the spring of 2004 I published an article in Foreign Affairs magazine entitled Smart Power. In it I countered the idea that either “soft power” – U.S. cultural influence – or “hard power” – military might, could alone be the basis for a winning foreign policy strategy. I argued that the effective exercise of U.S. power must involve multiple tools and approaches, including reliance on allies, outreach to civil society, and robust institutions, in order to deliver results. Four years later, in her confirmation testimony to become Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton picked up the term and made it her own She said that smart power means using “the full range of tools at our disposal — diplomatic, economic, military, political, legal, and cultural — picking the right tool, or combination of tools, for each situation.” Much of the early discussion of smart power aimed to counter the shrinking of the toolkit of American foreign policy. There were too many years of overreliance on the U.S. military to a point where our armed forces were stretched, and our other tools were overlooked. For too long, we sought to advance our interests through tactics that many regarded as coercive and threatening. Some of our foreign policy muscles became strained with fatigue, while others atrophied. The result was that U.S. influence over global events waned. The failure of this one-dimensional approach was so manifest that by the time Secretary Clinton said she planned to use smart power by expanding the range of foreign policy tools, she was criticized for making a point that was by then too obvious. “Smart power” has been a touchstone for a series of changes in the way the U.S. goes about the business of foreign policy. The U.S. has invigorated its efforts at public diplomacy, and sees the dividends in the form of improved public perceptions globally. Secretary Clinton, with the noteworthy support of Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has argued that the State Department, its diplomats and aid workers, need to be part of a single, common national security budget, rather than being treated as poor relations of the military. Secretary Clinton, in the first-ever Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, has committed to building up civilian capacity for conflict resolution, reconstruction and stabilization so that it becomes a truly worthy complement and counterpart to boots on the ground. In our operations in Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen the payoff from expanded civilian engagement to help mobilize populations to reject conflict and secure peace in their communities. Another critical component in broadening the array of power tools at the U.S.’s disposal has come through the Administration’s commitment to reengagement across the spectrum of multilateral bodies and international organizations. As a Deputy Assistant Secretary in the State Department’s Bureau of International Organizations, this is where my focus lies. Properly leveraged, international institutions – the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies and specialized agencies like the World Food Program, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees; regional organizations like NATO and the Organization of American States; and functional bodies like the G-8 and the Community of Democracies – can operate as tools to further U.S. priorities, and as force multipliers to help us deliver on our goals. International institutions, used well can spread cost, lower political risks, and provide an imprimatur of legitimacy that can reduce resistance to U.S. initiatives. If smart power refers to using the totality of America’s arsenal of influence, multilateral institutions represent a critical stronghold that must be kept ready and used wisely. Mobilizing multilateral institutions as effective instruments of power is not something that will happen automatically. Showing up and stating our demands will not bend these bodies to our will. Effectively using international institutions as part of the smart power toolkit requires a series of tactics reflected in this Administration’s approach to multilateral engagement. Underlying all this is recognition of the ubiquity and importance of the UN system. I’ll use this week’s latest example in Japan to prove the point. The UN’s Pacific Tsunami Warning System put in place by the UN Education, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) was the body that issued the initial tsunami warning and allowed scores to escape the deadly flooding. The UN’s World Meteorological Organization offered real-time communication to track the scale of the tsunami so that regional neighbors, the Pacific Islands, Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast knew ahead of time what was about to hit. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been at the forefront of helping manage the unfolding nuclear disaster – dispatching teams of experts, providing technology and offering expert advice. It is UN nuclear scientists that have plotted the path of the radioactive plume and warned countries what to expect. The UN’s Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Assistance activated its network of 80 countries that mobilized 35 search and rescue teams that were on alert within a day of the quake. You can make the same point with respect to a very different crisis on the other side of the world in Libya. The UN is debating the no-fly zone, has imposed sanctions, travel ban, ICC referral, commission of inquiry, and is leading the humanitarian assistance effort. As Secretary Clinton has acknowledged, the multilateral system is flawed but indispensible and that if we did not have it, we’d have to invent it. But just because the UN is ever-present doesn’t render it an effective partner or tool. Getting multilateral institutions to live\n",

Effective engagement necessitates understanding the inner workings of multilateral organizations, fostering cooperation with U.S. government agencies, and securing competent leadership within these organizations.  The U.S. has championed individuals like Tony Lake for UNICEF and Michelle Bachelet for UN Women, and established new forums to coordinate humanitarian reform and capacity building.  The scale and pace of global crises demand a robust UN humanitarian response system, and the U.S. leverages its donor status to push for reforms and better coordination.  Within political bodies like the UNSC, GA, and Human Rights Council, navigating diverse motives, agendas, and values of member states presents unique challenges.

A successful example is the Human Rights Council resolution on freedom of assembly and association, co-sponsored by Indonesia, Nigeria, and Mexico.

The U.S. has countered Iranian efforts through Security Council sanctions, opposing their bids for UN bodies like the HRC and UN Women, and highlighting their human rights record.  Active engagement is essential to achieve these results. A case in point is the absence of a standing UN mandate focused on Iran's human rights record. This gap emerged in 2002 when the U.S. was voted off the UN Commission on Human Rights, allowing others to abolish the mandate. The U.S. is now working to reinstate this mandate, demonstrating the cost of disengagement.  Effective multilateral diplomacy involves meticulous research, understanding of history, and direct engagement with officials worldwide, including smaller nations whose UN votes hold equal weight. The U.S. political machinery at the UN can be highly effective when fully engaged. Despite frustrations with the Human Rights Council's flaws, like its membership selection process and imbalanced focus on Israel, the U.S. has chosen to engage and push for reforms rather than cede the global human rights debate to repressive regimes.",

    "text": "For four decades after World War II, two superpowers leading antagonistic political and socioeconomic blocs dominated global affairs. Conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, capitalism and communism, defined the central drama within the international system. During this period, each superpower possessed armies and arsenals unmatched by others. The two superpowers were organized internally in radically different ways. The United States had a democratic polity and a market economy, while the Soviet Union had a totalitarian polity and a command economy. Because each country believed its system was superior, it actively promoted the replication of these political and socioeconomic systems in other countries while also resisting the expansion of the other’s system. This ideological divide drove the competition between them. In other words, the Soviet Union and the United States were rivals not only because they were the two greatest powers in the international system, but because they were two powers with antithetical visions about how political, social, and economic life should be organized.\n\nAt the end of 1991, one pole in this bipolar, ideologically divided system collapsed. For the first time in the history of the modern world, the international balance of power changed without a major war. For leaders in Russia and the United States, these were heady times. Giddy talk abounded on both sides about the new task of transforming Russia into a market economy, a democratic polity, and a new partner with the West, erasing the cold war in an instant. By the end of the 1990s, however, the mood in U.S.-Russian relations had more affinity with the old cold war era than with the more optimistic times in 1991. Journalists, academics, members of Congress, and the emerging George W. Bush campaign for president derided the policies that President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had pursued toward Boris Yeltsin’s Russia. “Who lost Russia?” they asked. They charged the Clinton administration with failure on every conceivable issue: too much meddling into Russia’s internal affairs, overpersonalizing the relationship with President Yeltsin, ignoring or even aiding corruption of leading Russian officials, turning a blind eye toward Russian atrocities in the breakaway Republic of Chechnya, and not stopping Russian assistance to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. To listen to the experts and to the Republicans, it would seem that everything that could go wrong did go wrong inside Russia and in U.S.-Russian relations.\n\nWhat happened in the intervening years between the euphoria of Soviet collapse and the Who Lost Russia witch-hunt less than a decade later? Some argued that it was the first Bush administration’s fault for not providing enough assistance to Yeltsin’s fledgling regime in 1992, others that the Clinton administration after 1993 had provided all the wrong kinds of assistance or had pursued “anti-Russian” policies such as the enlargement of NATO or the war on Kosovo that increased Russian resentment of the West. Less than a year after George W. Bush became president, in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, U.S.-Russian relations seemed to take a decisive turn for the better again. Russian president Putin moved quickly to show sympathy for the United States and pledged his support for a united front against worldwide terrorism. Optimism emerged that Russia had decided that it truly belonged in the West. On the domestic front, Russia’s economy was no longer the object of pity, the state seemed to be consolidating after a decade of decline, and a majority of Russians gave positive job approval marks for President Putin. U.S.-Russian relations appeared better than they had in years, at least until the American-led war with Iraq. In explaining the course of these events, we are primarily interested in what U.S. policymakers believed they were trying to accomplish and how they understood what was occurring and what was at stake. In 1991, did they recognize that a transition was occurring in the Soviet Union, and what did they believe they could do about it? Once the USSR had broken up, did they believe the old enemy was really gone and that the United States should provide massive assistance, or did they largely cheer on the revolution from the sidelines? Throughout, how did American decisionmakers calculate U.S. interests, in relation to Russia, in a post–cold war world?",

    "text": "The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 were the most transformative events in world affairs since the period immediately following World War II. Before 1989–91, containing the threat posed by the USSR had been the overarching purpose of U.S. foreign policy since the late 1940s. For American officials from the late 1940s to the late 1980s, every issue in the world—the defense of Europe, peace in the Middle East, civil war in Africa, or even the development of resources on the ocean floor—was seen through the prism of the cold war struggle with the Soviet Union.1 Thus the collapse of the USSR was both exhilarating and disorienting for U.S. foreign policymakers. Now that the main American enemy had been defeated, what would replace containment as the new defining tenet of American foreign policy?2 Henry Kissinger, America’s most famous diplomat, even felt compelled to write a book answering those who questioned whether the United States needed a foreign policy.3 The intellectual and organizational challenge of reorienting foreign policy away from forty years of cold war and toward a new relationship between the United States and Russia was enormous. As American leaders pieced together a new foreign policy, they confronted an age-old question: to what extent was the United States a traditional great power playing the global game of balance of power politics, and to what extent was the United States a special “city on the hill” pursuing a mission of helping others develop market and democratic institutions? As American foreign policymakers sought to balance power and purpose in the 1990s, they did so in a world in which American supremacy in global affairs only grew larger and Russia’s status as a major power dropped precipitously as the decade wore on. American leaders also had to define U.S. interests within Russia, where officials and the public were in the midst of one of the most profound revolutions in the modern era. American leaders had not faced such challenges in conceptualizing foreign policy since 1945.\n\nThat new world order had been full of uncertainties. Soviet intentions were unclear to many in 1945, and a Europe of two blocs only emerged after the communist coup in Czechoslovakia and the Berlin blockade in 1948. Many of the institutional innovations proposed immediately after World War II—including Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “Four Policemen” and even the U.N. Security Council—looked in retrospect naively inappropriate for addressing the real fundamental issues of the international system that only became clear with time.4 The transformation of the U.S.-Soviet standoff in Europe into a global struggle of titanic proportions only really began five years after World War II with the onset of the Korean War. In important ways, however, the global environment of 1945 was less uncertain than that of 1991. Although it would take time for Americans to embrace Germans and Japanese as partners and integrate those two former adversaries into Western security structures, what was certain in 1945 was the total defeat of these authoritarian regimes. Not only had the United States and its allies defeated those two nations militarily, but Germany and Japan had been occupied and their leaders put on trial. An American general, Douglas MacArthur, and his staff wrote the postwar Japanese constitution. Furthermore, the rise of the new threat from Moscow had helped to clarify the importance of a close relationship between the United States and its former enemies. By the early 1950s, the communist threat made it imperative that Japan and West Germany be transformed into democracies integrated into Western security and economic structures.\nThe world of 1991 and after was more ambiguous about America’s former enemy. The USSR had lost the cold war since communist ideology as a force in the world had withered away, and the Soviet Union no longer existed as a country. Yet the defeat of the enemy was not as complete in 1991 as in 1945. Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist, post-Soviet Russia did not suffer defeat in war and still had tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that could destroy the United States. The United States did not occupy post-Soviet Russia, making the trajectory of political and economic change more of a Russian affair than it had been in Germany and Japan after World War II. The president of the newly independent Russia, Boris Yeltsin, seemed prodemocracy, promarket, and pro-Western, but others in his entourage seemed less inclined to transform Russia internally and integrate with the West. His enemies, some of whom seemed to have real popular support in the country, were categorically against these changes. In 1945, U.S. occupying forces suppressed anti-Western forces in Germany and Japan. In 1991, by contrast, Yeltsin could not call on his allies in the West to suppress his foes. Nor did he have the power to do so alone. In the first years of independence, Yeltsin’s hold on power remained extremely tenuous, as communist and nationalist forces within and outside government structures challenged the Russian president and his policies.",

    "text": "Rather, they reflected two deep traditions in the making of American foreign policy. Regime transformers echoed a tradition as old as the United States itself. Since the creation of the United States, some American leaders have believed that the American democratic system of government made the United States unique. Many American leaders championed the democratic United States, in contrast to the power-hungry European nations, as a new moral force in international politics. The more countries that embraced freedom and the democratic way of life domestically, the more peaceful relations among states would be internationally. In the nineteenth century, American foreign policymakers who embraced this tradition had limited means and limited horizons. The American missionary impulse rarely extended outside of the American hemisphere. Only after the United States entered World War I did President Woodrow Wilson attempt to introduce American moralism onto the global stage.\nAs he explained to a joint session of Congress in January 1918 when he was outlining his fourteen points for a new world order,“What we demand in this war . . . is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation.” In Wilson’s view, the best way to achieve American security was not to defend the United States against the outside world but to change fundamentally the outside world. In policy circles, this tradition became known as Wilsonianism. Although Wilson was a Democrat, this philosophy about international affairs crossed partisan lines. During the cold war, one of the staunchest Wilsonians in foreign policy was Republican president Ronald Reagan, who also believed in regime change as a means of enhancing American national security. In academic circles, this approach to foreign policy and theory about international politics has been labeled “liberalism” (somewhat misleadingly given how the term is used in U.S. domestic politics).\nWilson’s attempt to make the world safe for democracy failed. The Republican-controlled Senate blocked American membership in his League of Nations. The rise of Nazi Germany and communist Russia in Europe and the onset of World War II stimulated the emergence of yet another group in American foreign policy thinking—the power balancers or the realists. In response to Wilson’s “naive idealism,” realists countered that the United States had to pay greater attention to the power capabilities of states and the balance of power between them. How states were organized internally—that is, whether they were democratic or autocratic—mattered much less. This school rose to prominence during the cold war, when the chief imperative for American foreign policymakers became the containment of Soviet power. During the cold war, the impulse to promote regime change abroad did not disappear. On the contrary, American politicians invented all sorts of new tools of foreign policy—including the Agency for International Development (AID), the Peace Corps, the Alliance for Progress, Radio Free Europe, and the National Endowment for Democracy—to facilitate regime change in other countries. Moreover, realist and liberal impulses (or regime transformers and power balancers) have been present in every American administration’s foreign policy since 1945; different administrations simply accentuated one approach over the other.",

    "text": "Swings between liberal and realist tendencies in American foreign policy did not follow neatly with changes in presidential party affiliations. For instance, Republican President Richard Nixon and his chief foreign policy adviser, Henry Kissinger, were classic realists or power balancers. They focused on the balance of power as the crucial ingredient of the international system and pursued policies that sought to preserve America’s position in the world, for example, by reaching out to China to balance against a rising Soviet power. While in office, Nixon and Kissinger cared little about the internal politics of the USSR or China. They were ready to reach out to dictatorships such as China if it helped to balance the power of the Soviet Union. As Nixon once told Chinese leader Mao Zedong, “What is important is not a nation’s internal political philosophy. What is important is its policy toward the rest of the world and toward us.” In contrast, fellow Republican Ronald Reagan devoted more attention to domestic regimes and crafted policies to undermine autocratic regimes, including most prominently (but not only) communist systems. Reagan was selective about where he promoted regime change, concerned more about communist dictatorships in eastern Europe than capitalist dictatorships in Africa or Latin America. Nonetheless, Reagan’s approach to international politics had more in common with Democrats Wilson and Harry Truman than Republican Nixon.\nThe Centrality of Individuals and Ideas in America’s Russia Policy\nFew administrations promoted regime change with the vigor of Wilson or Reagan or championed power balancing with the energy of Nixon and Kissinger. Most presidents have pursued some combination of both. As Bill Clinton’s national security adviser Anthony Lake wrote nearly a decade before assuming his high-level position, “In foreign policy, [Americans] have constantly been torn between a heritage of hardheaded realism and an idealistic belief in America’s mission to promote democracy and individual freedoms. . . . The latter pushes Americans toward an expansive belief in their power; the former toward a recognition of the limits of that power.” No matter what their stripe, presidents prone to power balancing will always be pressured by America’s identity as the leader of the community of democracies to infuse power politics with a liberal purpose, and regime transformers will find that when America needs allies, a blind eye is easily turned to violations of liberal values. Throughout the first decade of the post–cold war era, both of these frameworks influenced American foreign policy toward Russia. Yet at different periods in the post–cold war era, these two philosophical approaches influenced American policy in distinct, identifiable ways. It is a central claim of this book that ideas do matter in the making of foreign policy. Individual actors—not states, structures, or bureaucracies—make choices about what foreign policy to pursue. People with names and faces, not “the United States” or “Russia” or “globalization” or “the international balance of power,” make foreign policy. When making foreign policy, ideas about the nature of international politics shape the choices of these actors in profound, observable ways. Policy entrepreneurs armed with and passionate about a particular set of ideas can push the policy of the entire government in a particular direction.",

    "text": "In our story, James Baker and his ideas about denuclearization, Anthony Lake and his ideas about NATO enlargement, William Perry and his ideas about Cooperative Threat Reduction, or Lawrence Summers and David Lipton and their ideas about macroeconomic stabilization are a few of the most salient examples in which the fusion of effective policy entrepreneurs and novel ideas had a major impact on the formation of U.S. policy toward Russia in the 1990s. The potential causal weight of ideas grows especially during times of rapid change like the end of the cold war, when old institutions, norms, and practices have been challenged or broken down but new rules of the game (domestically and internationally) shaping foreign policy have not consolidated. To be sure, the balance of power in the international system defined the parameters of the possible for American foreign policymakers. U.S. foreign policymakers were confronted with decisions about the promotion of regime change in Russia or the destruction of nuclear weapons inside Russia because the United States had the power to consider such policies. Nonetheless, the balance of power in the international system does not by itself determine the foreign policy of states. Structural or systemic factors—be they the balance of power or international institutions—are least constraining for the most powerful state in the system, the United States. Nor in this case did a particular geostrategic concern such as oil or the security of a vital ally trump all other foreign policy concerns. Worries over nuclear proliferation came closest, but even this concern did not determine what American policy toward Russia would be. In the crafting of post-Soviet Russia policy, U.S. policymakers had choices to make, and these choices were influenced to a great extent by their ideas about international politics. Nor, looking inside the United States, did domestic forces play a major constraining role on the executive branch in the making of American policy toward Russia after 1991. In other foreign policy areas, corporate lobbies, congressional actors, and ethnic interest groups played an important part in shaping American policy during this period (and others). But on Russia policy after 1991, these other kinds of actors were less consequential. Rather, it was the philosophical approach embraced by the president and his key advisers that had the greatest impact on defining American policy toward Russia after the cold war. Ideas about the nature of the international system, the nature of Russia, and definition of the American national security interests changed across administrations in ways that had consequences for the formulation of American foreign policy toward post-Soviet Russia.",

He leaned toward Nixonian realism (not surprising given that he and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, served in high-level positions in the Nixon administration). As the Soviet Union waned, Bush was most concerned with maintaining global stability and less concerned with promoting freedom within the Soviet Union or Russia. Given Republican support for free markets and democracy, the first Bush administration also spoke about the importance of the Western zone of peace and prosperity and the possibility of a new Russia finding its place in that order. The last cold war president just was not prepared to spend significant resources on such an endeavor. For George H.W. Bush, the fundamental challenge was how to manage a peaceful transition from the world we knew to the new world order. As the world transformed, the Bush administration’s primary goal was to ensure that the transition was peaceful, and a fundamental security goal was to ensure that in a post-Soviet world, no rival power to American hegemony emerged. As articulated in a Pentagon paper overseen by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, “Simply put, it is the intent of the new Regional Defense Strategy to enable the U.S. to lead in shaping an uncertain future so as to preserve and enhance this strategic depth won at such great pains.”\nIt was not just with respect to the Soviet Union and then Russia where realism rather than Wilsonianism generally prevailed in the first Bush administration. The Bush team might have spoken about a commitment to a Europe whole and free (thus evoking Wilsonian ideals), but in the Balkans, the administration made clear it would not get involved in preventing ethnic cleansing because the United States—in Secretary of State James A. Baker III’s words—had “no dog in that fight.” Yugoslavia would be a problem only if the conflict spread and involved other major powers, and so the Bush administration put a small U.S. force in Macedonia to deter the conflict from spreading but not to put the fire out. Similarly, the United States led a coalition to expel Iraq from Kuwait but did not seek to overthrow Saddam Hussein or dismember Iraq because the primary concern was to preserve the balance of power in the region. Bush did little to promote regime change in the Soviet Union. Although Bush and his foreign policy team welcomed the internal changes initiated by President Mikhail Gorbachev within the Soviet Union, they never pursued activist policies that might accelerate the process of internal change or push it in a particular direction. Reform, in Bush’s view, was an internal matter for the Soviet leadership to which the United States should only react and not try to shape or stimulate. Bush and his team were fundamentally nervous about radical regime change.",

In foreign policy, George H. W. Bush sought to obtain Soviet support for American foreign policy initiatives such as ensuring that a unified Germany remained in NATO and conducting the Persian Gulf War. For Soviet domestic policy, Bush wanted above all else to help avoid creating a Yugoslav scenario of civil war in a country that stretched eleven time zones and possessed thousands of nuclear weapons, and thus freedom of the constituent republics was not high on the list of foreign policy priorities for most of the team. For most of their time in office, Bush and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft hoped that Gorbachev could stay in power. After all, Gorbachev had offered concession after concession to the United States, and Bush and Scowcroft feared what might follow. But the events of the fall of 1991 were not subject to outside influence, and a team trained to fight the cold war now had to retool to respond to the drama of fifteen new post-Soviet and postcommunist states as they began the new year of 1992. After the Soviet breakup, the Bush team did seek to foster Russia’s integration into the West, but the emphasis remained on Russia’s foreign policy and not its internal transformation. In the nuclear realm, this meant working with Russia and the other newly independent republics to consolidate the Soviet nuclear arsenal and ensure singular command and control. In economics, the focus was on ensuring that Russia avoid defaulting on its debt rather than on generating massive assistance for building a market economy.

Baker III spent the winter and spring of 1992 cajoling the new countries of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine to commit to the withdrawal of the vast nuclear arsenals on their soil to Russia. The ultimate transfer of the warheads, which was completed at the end of the Clinton administration’s first term, was one of the most important and least noticed successes of American policy toward the region in the 1990s. But in 1991–92, the Bush administration’s efforts to reduce this clear and present danger were pursued without active involvement in the internal trans- formation of Russia. Thus, on the economic side, the policy was far less ambi- tious. Candidate Bill Clinton and former president Richard Nixon (in a dramatic turnaround from his days in office when he ignored other countries’ internal philosophies) exhorted the Bush team in the spring of 1992 to pro- vide massive financial assistance to the new Russian reform team. But that assistance was not forthcoming. Instead, the Bush Treasury Department focused primarily on ensuring that Russia would assume the debt incurred by the previous regime. The overarching message of the Bush team to Russia and the other republics emerging from the ashes of the Soviet Union was, “If you want acceptance into the West, you have to do X, Y, and Z.” Get the nuclear situa- tion under control. Commit to paying your debt. Although many in the West called for the Bush administration to give more aid, devote more attention, and generally engage more comprehensively in helping to guide Russia’s transformation, Bush and his team put the onus of action on Russia. If Russia successfully transformed, then it would be welcomed into the Western club.",

His administration aimed to assist democratic and market reform in Russia as the key to its integration into the Western community.  Clinton's policy emphasized a causal connection between transformation and integration, with the US playing a role in promoting both.  While promoting democracy and economic assistance, Clinton stood by Yeltsin even during controversial actions like the assault on parliament and intervention in Chechnya.  The Clinton administration continued power-balancing policies like the removal of nuclear weapons from non-Russian republics and Russian troop withdrawal from the Baltics, but framed these within the broader Wilsonian goal of integrating Russia into the West. Clinton offered assistance for membership, believing that welcoming Russia would promote internal transformation and foster better relations.  He used the language of engagement and integration even in cases like the Dayton Peace Accords and NATO enlargement, offering Russia something in return for accepting the US agenda.  Despite this commitment to fostering Russia’s internal transformation, Clinton acted in US national interests even when Russia objected, such as with NATO enlargement and the Kosovo intervention. However, by the late 1990s, shocks in democracy promotion, economic assistance, and security integration led to a collapse of the ambitious American agenda. The Russian financial crisis of 1998 led to US disillusionment and disengagement from economic transformation efforts. The Kosovo war chilled NATO-Russia relations, and Russia’s renewed war in Chechnya further eroded democratic institutions. By the fall of 1999, Clinton’s Russia policy had stalled.",

    "text": "By the 2000 presidential campaign, the narrative shifted from Russia's transformation to how Russia had been \"lost.\"  The George W. Bush team criticized the Clinton administration's focus on Russia's domestic affairs, advocating for a return to realpolitik.  Initially prioritizing allies in North America, Asia, and Europe, the Bush administration placed Russia on the periphery of US foreign policy. Despite intending to focus on states rather than individuals, Bush established a personal bond with Putin. After 9/11, Bush embraced a foreign policy closer to Reagan and Wilson, emphasizing individual liberty and regime change. While promoting democracy in the Middle East, Bush adopted a more pragmatic approach with Russia, embracing Putin as an ally in the war on terrorism.  This rapprochement prioritized Russia's international role over domestic transformation, focusing on strategic nuclear issues and the war on terrorism while giving less attention to issues like Chechnya and media freedom.  The shift in policy highlighted the growing asymmetry of power between the US and Russia, which became increasingly apparent throughout the decade.",

    "text": "Perceptions of this power asymmetry changed more slowly than the actual power balance, but over time, the true distribution of power became clearer. By the end of the 1990s, decisionmakers in Washington correctly believed that Russia had little capacity to influence American foreign policy, even in traditional spheres of Russian influence such as the Balkans. This updating emboldened Clinton officials. They pursued foreign policies such as NATO expansion and the war against Serbia that a decade earlier would have been perceived as sure to spark conflict between the two great powers.\n\nSecond, uncertainty about the course of Russia’s revolution also changed over time. At the beginning of the decade, the endpoint of Russia’s transition from communism was highly uncertain. Those who believed that regime type mattered—and that the United States was better off with a democratic Russia than with a communist or fascist Russia—had the daunting challenge of devising policies that promoted democracy and markets in the largest country in the world with an unbroken history of autocratic rule and a seventy-year experiment with a command economy. Trying to assist a transition from that system to a market economy and democratic polity that could trade with the West and join Western institutions was simply unprecedented. By the end of the decade, worst-case scenarios for Russia’s domestic transformation seemed unlikely. Imperfect capitalism and an even more imperfect democracy emerged in Russia in the 1990s, an outcome that left the regime transformers in the Clinton team frustrated. At the same time, the specter of fascism or the return to communism had disappeared, an outcome that allowed George W. Bush officials to worry less about the negative implications of domestic developments inside Russia for American national security interests.\n\nThe emergence of these two factors over time would become influential in the formulation of American foreign policy even if worldview continued to shape the general approach. Recognition of the growing asymmetry of power between the United States and Russia enabled American officials to pursue foreign policy initiatives unilaterally with less regard for Russian reactions. Recognition of the end of revolution inside Russia allowed U.S. officials to focus less on internal developments inside Russia. At the same time, the growing asymmetry of power between these former equals and a mixed record of transformation inside Russia influenced the bilateral relationship, mostly in a negative way. Russian leaders grew tired of American arrogance in international affairs and wary of American intentions inside Russia. Only the combination of a new ideological orientation inside the White House and a shock to the international system as momentous as September 11 could change the mood in U.S.-Russian relations.",

    "section": "The Age of Leverage",
    "text": "Leverage is an old theme in human civilization, but it has become very prominent in recent years in all spheres of life.  Our man in 2010 is forced three times between 2000 and 2010 to look for a new job; our man from 1950 does not have to leverage resources and relationships because he does not have to look for a new job at all. In our case of the step father seeking to get his step son to mow the lawn, a similar dynamic emerges. The upshot of this leverage triangle is that the father obtains his end of getting the step son to mow the lawn and the step son obtains his end of getting use of his mother’s car and the mother herself gets her end of maintaining stability between her husband and her son. The comparison with the 1950s family is striking, at least that traditional family in which the father tells his son to mow the lawn and his son mows the lawn no questions asked. The mother in the 1950s example does not have her own car and she is not needed, by either the father or the son, in order for the lawn to be mowed. The case of the husband negotiating with his wife regarding their potential divorce is a classic example of how one spouse uses leverage in divorce negotiations. The husband is using a delaying strategy as leverage in his negotiations with his wife; in order to expedite the divorce, then, she needs to make certain economic concessions. Leverage in this instance is a common negotiating strategy.  The example of the SONY Walkman comes from Gary Hamel and the late C.K. Prahalad.  They identify five basic notions of “resource leverage”: concentrating resources, accumulating resources, complementing resources, conserving resources, and recovering resources.  Consider the example about Keynesian policies. Keynesian fiscal stimulus policies are essentially leverage policies since they seek to use targeted government investments as leverage in order to grow the economy. Invest $100 billion here in order to create jobs and increase investment that are many times greater than the investment of the $100 billion itself. The global economic crisis of 2008 saw major Keynesian leverage policies implemented in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, China and most of the world’s major economies.",

    "section": "Leverage in Foreign Policy and Terrorism",
    "text": "Foreign policy for all nations has always involved leverage. But today leverage has taken on new dimensions. Joe Nye’s distinction between “soft power” and “hard power” — power that “co-opts rather than coerces” — is in many ways a distinction between leveraging resources and using traditional military and economic power to overwhelm opponents. In the case of soft power, a country uses its music and its literature and its movies and its emotional intelligence and its public diplomacy to make other countries want the outcomes that they want. The soft power strategies, then, enable countries to invade foreign markets and reap economic gain even as they achieve political goals, especially peace. Traditional hard power strategies, though of course needed in great measures at times, for instance during World War I and World War II, are nevertheless frequently not ideally suited to achieving economic and political goals in the post-Cold War world. In many ways terrorist strategies today, like terrorist strategies in the past, are about leverage. Terrorists, whose military actions fit into the broad category of asymmetric warfare, typically lack the military and economic power of nation states, certainly Great Powers or a Superpower. The terrorists therefore must leverage resources in order to bring about great destruction: 9/11 is the prime example since the Al Qaeda terrorists were able to topple the World Trade Center and do severe human and physical damage in Washington and Pennsylvania without exploding a bomb or sending a missile. They in fact leveraged our own resources against ourselves — therefore existing resources — in order to cause loss, pain, and destruction. Terrorists also often use dramatic techniques to create societal effects, like paralysis and mass fear and anxiety, which have a greater force than the techniques themselves, like car bombs. Finally, the example of economic sanctions used against Iran serves as a standard example of a strategy nations use to force or compel other nations to change their behavior. Preventing a country from acquiring some product that they desire — for example natural gas — is thus a traditional way of using leverage to try to cause changes in behavior. This is more of a hard power than soft power technique, but it uses the notion of leverage nonetheless.",

    "text": "Our analysis, therefore, serves to underline the point that we live during a time when resources and relationships are being leveraged to an extraordinary extent. In some cases leverage was not used in the past where today it is; in others, leverage was used in the past but just not to the same extent. The Age itself is best regarded as the “Age of Leverage.” This feature of social reality is most observable in American culture, in the American family, in American business, and in American foreign policy. Still, we can discern the prominence of leverage throughout the world today. Essentially a set of dynamics around the world has compelled individuals, families, corporations, NGOs, nations and regional coalitions to make leverage the dominant element of their strategies for success, whether the effort in question is economic development, justice, or peace. As a tool leverage is a form of power. Professor Nye explains that “smart power” involves using the right amounts of “soft power” and “hard power,” but it would appear that “soft power” is more likely to involve leveraging resources and relationships than hard power. Although we are referring to the “Age of Leverage” it may make more sense to refer to Leverage as the “Main Current of the Age.” Others may wish to call it “one of the” Main Currents.  Ages can also overlap and generations and decades with distinct identities can arise within ages. From the 1950s to 2000 we had, among others, the Nuclear Age, the Space Age, The Cold War, the Beat Generation, The Culture of Narcissism, the 60s, the Me Generation, the Millennials, the Computer Age, The Information Age, The Internet Age, and the Age of Globalization. Leverage is a theme that cuts across all societal spheres. It is best regarded as the structural feature that provides a unifying explanatory theme for understanding the United States and even the world. The Societal Changes That Have Brought Forth the Prominence of Leverage Let’s address the chief societal changes that have led to the emergence of the Age of Leverage. Informational and Communications Technology Revolution The information and communications technology revolution has transformed the way individuals communicate, companies operate, and governments are organized. Our treatment focuses on the major change from essentially top-down hierarchical forms of communications to network systems of communication. “Cyberspace leveraging,” according to Stephen Whitehead, enables a small set of internet users to “to harness the power of a large population of networked users.” With respect to patterns of communication, there can be no doubt that the Information and Communications Technology Revolution has caused some fundamental changes. In the traditional organization, be it business or government, the lines of authority move from the top down and communication travels from the bottom up following normal channels, level by level. In Information age businesses and governments, there are vast networks of overlapping departments which diverge from the typical hierarchies. These networks make it both possible and necessary for effective managers to communicate across departments and divisions and not just down to workers and up to executives. Organizations today leverage information technology through the creation of social capital. This notion speaks to the Hamel and Prahalad notion of getting “the most from the least.”",

    "text": "And although many are skeptical that these organizations with horizontal structures adequately overcome some of the morally offensive features of the traditional top-down hierarchical firms, most would agree that the use of the new information and communication technology, especially e-mail and cell phones, has transformed the nature of business, nonprofit, and government communication. Communication for individuals as family members or citizens in general has followed suit.  The New Family Networks The process of decentralization that has occurred in personal and organizational life has some important similarities with the process whereby the American family has shifted from a nuclear family model with a married couple and children in which the husband is the breadwinner to a family system which has a range of family structures, including this traditional model as well as two-parent, two-paycheck family to the single-parent, one-paycheck family and the single person household with no children. Whether it is the step-son who wants to use his mother’s car or the husband who does not want to get a divorce, navigating your way through family life for today’s mothers and fathers, step fathers and step-mothers, sons and daughters, step-sons and step-daughters, grandmothers and grandfathers, grandmothers whose sons or daughters are now divorced and have an unclear status, grandsons and granddaughters whose grandmothers and grandfathers now have an unclear status – living in these networks today requires leveraging resources and relationships when old style direct asks, direct communications, and simple lines of authority do not exist. Surviving your family situation today, and most of us have multiple family situations, requires that you be very skilled at leveraging resources and relationships. The clear and direct lines of communication we associate with the traditional firm have also dissolved in most American families.  Geopolitics in the Same Vein The overall structure of geopolitics has, in many ways, mirrored the overall structural changes in communication networks and the family network. For the shift from the Cold War paradigm is very similar to the shift from the Nuclear Family paradigm. We shifted from a very clear, very firm, very structured relationship between two superpowers, the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R., in which almost every other country was entangled with one of these superpowers, to a world with one superpower and a great range of other powers.",

It is an oversimplification to say that global politics is decentralized compared to how things were during the Cold War, but basically this description is broadly accurate. You can’t squeeze China politics or Iran politics or Middle East politics into a simple Cold War mold. It is, we are told, a multi-polar world. Essentially all countries today must use creative leveraging strategies to advance their national or regional interests because there are so few instances of one to one treaties or alliances. Not even the world’s superpower, the United States, has the liberty to leave leverage behind, although at times, to our peril, we seem to use hard power traditional military and economic strategies where we should be leveraging resources and using soft power public diplomacy strategies. Business, government, family life, individual life, and international relations all today exist in spaces where there has been a proliferation of agents of change and a shift away from clear sources of power and authority. These shifts, which admittedly came about for different reasons, although some were related, have made leverage king. When power and authority have been dispersed those who wish to meet their ends must use leverage more than they did in the past. In a sense it is that simple. When you are in control you just order people what to do, and short of revolution they listen. But when power is dispersed leverage becomes the dominant strategy to get things done.",

    "text": "Leverage, as we have explained throughout, is essentially a causal strategy for bringing about change. Effectively executed leverage is basically effectively used power. Leverage itself, however, is morally neutral. Like all forms of power, the ends to which the power is put are subject to moral evaluation. This much said, we can still make some observations about the practice of leverage itself, observations which are not themselves sufficient to render a moral judgment but which are useful in any full scale analysis of a particular leverage strategy. It is clear that leverage can go too far. Or we can say that someone or some institution is overleveraged. The obvious examples are individuals and institutions during the global economic crisis, especially in the United States, culminating in the crash on Wall Street in September 2008 and the subsequent six months. If you are leveraging a set of resources in order to achieve substantial financial gains and the financial basis of your leveraging activities is weak, then your leverage strategy is subject to collapse. At the same time, individuals and institutions and countries should not be reluctant to use leverage strategies. Thus, you can also be “under-leveraged.” It is therefore a mistake to avoid leveraging resources and relationships when more direct frontal approaches to problems might blow up in your face. Therefore, fear of leveraging may side step strong economic sanctions on a rogue nation when these sanctions might be effective. Fear of leveraging might prevent a couple from being able to afford the bio-technology that they need to be able to have a child. Fear of leveraging may cause a nation to fail to invest in the private sector when such investments might sharply reduce unemployment and substantially increase GDP.",

With 600 regular contacts on Facebook, the individual in question is scattered across the globe, engaged in the lives of 600 people but without an integrated sense of self who has a driving purpose and a reasonable set of friends and contacts with whom share experiences and ideas. A similar problem can arise for countries if they are tempted to leverage an ever increasing number of relationships and they discover that their abundance of treaties, alliances, deals, and group plans contain many inconsistencies and conflicts. Thus by avoiding both going at things alone or choosing a very few partners in international affairs, countries run the risk of alienating others who believe they are friends when in reality a range of agreements and actions present them with manifest forms of hostility and harm.",

In recent years an increasing number of international relations theorists, notably realists, have sought to integrate ethical notions in their theories of international relations. Wilsonian idealists, practically by definition, incorporate ethical considerations into their theories. See, for example, Mark R. Amstutz, International Ethics: Concepts, Theories, and Cases in Global Politics, Third Edition, (Lanham, Maryland, Plymouth England: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2008). As his book makes clear, philosophers and political scientists for decades have addressed the role of ethical reasoning in foreign policy and international relations regarding a range of issues, from just war theory to economic sanctions. The International Relations scholarly community, however, has in recent years given considerable attention to ethical reasoning. This came about when many realists adopted “principled realism” or “ethical realism” in light of the 2003 Iraq War and President Bush’s rationale behind it. I have outlined a position for “pragmatism” in international relations with specific reference to the role of ethical concepts -- as opposed to all forms of realism as well as idealism -- in “A New Taxonomy for Approaches to Foreign Policy,” (unpublished). This piece develops the arguments in “President Obama’s Moral Surge,” Roll Call, December 14, 2009 http://www.rollcall.com/news/41522-1.html; and “Against the Realism vs. Idealism Debate in Foreign Policy,” Roll Call, December 22, 2009 http://www.rollcall.com/news/41841-1.html",

    "section": "Smart Power and American Decline",
    "text": "A new international relations orthodoxy is coalescing, to the effect that America is slouching towards mediocrity. In newspaper columns articles and on TV talk shows you will hear journalists charting the “relentless relative decline” of the United States. The military is overstretched; the economy is exposed; the political system is broken; the punters are suffering from an Iraq-induced hangover; and when it comes to international legitimacy, the White House has maxed out America’s credit card. And all the time, potential competitors such as China, the European Union, Russia, India and Iran are closing in. The best works in this area, by Richard Haass and Fareed Zakaria, are full of insight. Yet as a non-American living in the United States, I’m struck by the gulf that still remains between America and the rest – in terms of hard power, soft power and what we could call “smart power.” In relation to hard power, the $14 trillion American economy dwarfs all the others. The United States spends roughly as much on its military as the rest of the world combined. Washington has been bloodied and diverted by its foolhardy invasion of Iraq, but it remains the only capital capable of running a truly global foreign policy and projecting military power anywhere on earth. Almost every country thinks it has a special relationship with the United States, based on shared history or values – or clashing ones. None of the great challenges facing humanity can be solved without the Americans. COMMENTARY OP-ED Smart Power: Exaggerating America’s Decline Michael Fullilove June 18, 2008 America has some worrying weaknesses – but we should not ignore the frailties of others: the cleavages in China, the divisions within Europe, the dark side of Russia, or the poverty of India. In terms of soft power, too – the ability to get others to want what you want – the case",

    "text": "America’s decline is easily overstated. America retains its hold on the world’s imagination. For most non-Americans around the world, America’s politics are, at some level, our politics as well. Why is the world so interested? America’s size is only part of the answer. Ultimately, it is not really the size of the U.S. economy that draws our attention. It is not even America’s military might. Rather, it is the idea of America which continues to fascinate: a superpower that is open, democratic, meritocratic and optimistic; a country that is the cockpit of global culture; a polity in which all candidates for public office seem to come from a place called Hope. It’s worth noting that the declinist canon has emerged at the nadir of the Bush years; America’s soft power account will look much healthier the instant the next president is inaugurated.",

    "text": "The final source of U.S. influence is the way in which American ideas continue to inform global narratives – its smart power. If you have an argument to make, or a book to publish, or a doctrine to expound, then the United States is the place where you must do it. It is not just that the market is so big, or that the world’s attention means that events that occur in the United States today are fodder for pundits everywhere tomorrow. Just as important is the sheer quality of the creative output from America’s great universities, think tanks, newspapers and magazines. The effect of all this is that the opinions of Americans on the great issues of the day ripple out through the world and are repackaged everywhere. Smart power flows from human creativity, which is why Americans should be happy about the migration flows that are replenishing their nation’s human capital. Both blue-collar workers and gold-collar workers continue to be drawn here like iron filings to a magnet. It is hard to imagine future influential figures emigrating to China or Russia or Iran instead of the United States. There is a long tradition of foreign visitors bemoaning that such a strong country as the United States is so stupid. They could not be more wrong: America is powerful because it is smart.",
