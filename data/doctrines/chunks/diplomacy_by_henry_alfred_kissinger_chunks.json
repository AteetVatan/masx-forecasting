Moving from a sweeping overview of his own interpretation of history to personal accounts of his negotiations with world leaders, Kissinger describes the ways in which the art of diplomacy and the balance of power have created the world we live in, and shows how Americans, protected by the size and isolation of their country; as well as by their own idealism and mistrust of the Old World, have sought to conduct a unique kind of foreign policy based on the way they wanted the world to be, as opposed to the way it really is. Diplomacy is must reading for anyone who cares about America's position in the world: Spanning more than three centuries of history from Cardinal Richelieu; the father of the modern state system; to the 'New World Order;' in which we live, Kissinger demonstrates how modern diplomacy emerged from the trials and experiences of the balance of power of warfare and peacemaking; and why America, sometimes to its peril, refused to learn its lessons.",

    "text": "Almost as if according to some natural law, in every century there seems to emerge a country with the power, the will, and the intellectual and moral impetus to shape the entire international system in accordance with its own values. In the seventeenth century, France under Cardinal Richelieu introduced the modern approach to international relations, based on the nation-state and motivated by national interest as its ultimate purpose. In the eighteenth century, Great Britain elaborated the concept of the balance of power, which dominated European diplomacy for the next 200 years. In the nineteenth century, Metternich’s Austria reconstructed the Concert of Europe and Bismarck’s Germany dismantled it, reshaping European diplomacy into a cold-blooded game of power politics. In the twentieth century, no country has influenced international relations as decisively and at the same time as ambivalently as the United States.\n\nNo society has more firmly insisted on the inadmissibility of intervention in the domestic affairs of other states, or more passionately asserted that its own values were universally applicable. No nation has been more pragmatic in the day-to-day conduct of its diplomacy, or more ideological in the pursuit of its historic moral convictions. No country has been more reluctant to engage itself abroad even while undertaking alliances and commitments of unprecedented reach and scope.\n\nThe singularities that America has ascribed to itself throughout its history have produced two contradictory attitudes toward foreign policy: The first is that America serves its values best by perfecting democracy at home, thereby acting as a beacon for the rest of mankind; the second, that America’s values impose on it an obligation to crusade for them around the world. Torn between nostalgia for a pristine past and yearning for a perfect future, American thought has oscillated between isolationism and commitment, though, since the end of the Second World War, the realities of interdependence have predominated.\n\nBoth schools of thought—of America as beacon and of America as crusader—envision as normal a global international order based on democracy, free commerce, and international law. Since no such system has ever existed, its evocation often appears to other societies as utopian, if not naive. Still, foreign skepticism never dimmed the idealism of Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, or Ronald Reagan, or indeed of all other twentieth-century American presidents. If anything, it has spurred America’s faith that history can be overcome and that if the world wants peace, it needs to apply America’s moral prescriptions.\n\nBoth schools of thought were products of the American experience. Though other republics have existed, none had been consciously created to vindicate the idea of liberty. No other country’s population had chosen to head for a new continent and tame its wilderness in the name of freedom and prosperity for all. Thus the two approaches, the isolationist and the missionary, so contradictory on the surface, reflected a common underlying faith: that the United States possessed the world’s best system of government, and that the rest of mankind could attain peace and prosperity by abandoning traditional diplomacy and adopting America’s reverence for international law and democracy.",

    "text": "America’s journey through international politics has been a triumph of faith over experience. Since the time America entered the arena of world politics in 1917, it has been so preponderant in strength and so convinced of the rightness of its ideals that this century’s major international agreements have been embodiments of American values—from the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact to the United Nations Charter and the Helsinki Final Act. The collapse of Soviet communism marked the intellectual vindication of American ideals and, ironically, brought America face to face with the kind of world it had been seeking to escape throughout its history: In the emerging international order, nationalism has gained a new lease on life. Nations have pursued self-interest more frequently than high-minded principle, and have competed more than have cooperated. There is little evidence to suggest that this age-old mode of behavior has changed, or that it is likely to change in the decades ahead.\n\nWhat is new about the emerging world order is that, for the first time, the United States can neither withdraw from the world nor dominate it. America cannot change the way it has perceived its role throughout its history, nor should it want to. When America entered the international arena, it was young and robust and had the power to make the world conform to its vision of international relations. By the end of the Second World War in 1945, the United States was so powerful (at one point about 35 percent of the world’s entire economic production was American) that it seemed as if it was destined to shape the world according to its preferences. John F. Kennedy declared confidently in 1961 that America was strong enough to ‘pay any price, bear any burden’ to ensure the success of liberty. Three decades later, the United States is in less of a position to insist on the immediate realization of all its desires. Other countries have grown into Great Power status. The United States now faces the challenge of reaching its goals in stages, each of which is an amalgam of American values and geopolitical necessities.\n\nOne of the new necessities is that a world comprising several states of comparable strength must base its order on some concept of equilibrium—an idea with which the United States has never felt comfortable. When American thinking on foreign policy and European diplomatic traditions encountered each other at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, the differences in historical experience became dramatically evident. The European leaders sought to refurbish the existing system according to familiar methods; the American peacemakers believed that the Great War had resulted not from intractable geopolitical conflicts but from flawed European practices. In his famous Fourteen Points, Woodrow Wilson told the Europeans that henceforth, the international system should be based not on the balance of power but on ethnic self-determination; that their security should depend not on military alliances but on collective security; and that their diplomacy should no longer be conducted secretly by experts but on the basis of “open agreements, openly arrived at.” Clearly, Wilson had come not so much to discuss the terms for ending a war or for restoring the existing international order, as he had to recast a whole system of international relations as it had been practiced for nearly three centuries.",

    "section": "Balance of Power and Historical Context",
    "text": "When working properly, a balance-of-power system was meant to limit both the ability of states to dominate others and the scope of conflicts. It promoted stability and moderation rather than absolute peace. By definition, a balance-of-power arrangement cannot fully satisfy every member of the international system; it functions best when it keeps dissatisfaction below the level that would lead to an attempt to overthrow the international order.\n\nTheorists often portray the balance of power as the natural form of international relations, but in reality, such systems have been rare. The Western Hemisphere and contemporary China (since the Warring States period) have never experienced one.  Empire, not balance of power, has been the typical mode of government throughout most of history. Empires aim to be the international system, not operate within one. The United States in the Americas and China throughout much of its history in Asia exemplify this.\n\nFunctioning balance-of-power systems existed primarily among the city-states of ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy, and in the European state system following the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. These systems elevated the existence of multiple states with comparable strength into a guiding principle of world order.  This concept resonated with Enlightenment thinkers who believed the universe, including politics, operated according to rational, balancing principles. They believed that the collective actions of reasonable men, even seemingly selfish ones, would ultimately contribute to the common good.",

The separation of powers and checks and balances, inspired by Montesquieu and enshrined in the American Constitution, embodied similar principles.  The goal was to prevent despotism, not necessarily achieve perfect harmony; each branch of government, by pursuing its interests, would restrain excess and serve the common good.\n\nThese principles extended to international affairs. Each state, pursuing self-interest, was presumed to contribute to overall progress.  This expectation seemed valid for a time. After the Napoleonic Wars, European leaders restored the balance of power at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, attempting to moderate international conduct with moral and legal bonds. However, by the late 19th century, the system reverted to a focus on power in a more unforgiving environment. Confrontation became standard diplomatic practice, leading to escalating tests of strength and culminating in the catastrophe of World War I.",

Before the world wars, it benefited from the system without active involvement, while critiquing it from afar. During the Cold War, the US engaged in an ideological, political, and strategic struggle with the Soviet Union within a two-power world operating on different principles than a balance-of-power system. In this bipolar world, there was no pretense of conflict benefiting the common good; any gain for one side was a loss for the other. America's Cold War victory presented it with a new dilemma.  American values, often taken for granted, can appear revolutionary and unsettling to others. The US asserts that ethical principles apply to international relations as they do to individuals, contrasting sharply with concepts like raison d'état.  America emphasizes preventing war through legal and diplomatic means, resisting not change itself, but the use of force to achieve it. This focus on method over substance in foreign policy, along with the moral demands America places on itself, distinguishes it from other nations.",

    "text": "During the Cold War, traditional power dynamics were disrupted. The Soviet Union was a military superpower but an economic dwarf, while Japan was an economic giant but militarily insignificant.  The post-Cold War world sees a return to more congruent and symmetrical power elements.  America's relative military power will decline, and domestic pressures will shift resources away from defense.  Without a single overarching threat, nations under American protection will assume greater responsibility for their own security, leading towards equilibrium in the military field.  This trend will be even stronger in economics, where American dominance is already fading. The 21st-century international system presents a contradiction: fragmentation alongside globalization.  Relations among states will resemble the 18th and 19th-century European system more than the rigid Cold War structure, featuring at least six major powers (US, Europe, China, Japan, Russia, and possibly India) and numerous smaller countries. Simultaneously, international relations are truly global for the first time, with instantaneous communication, a globalized economy, and transnational issues like nuclear proliferation, environment, population growth, and economic interdependence requiring worldwide solutions. For America, reconciling diverse values and historical experiences among comparable powers will be a novel challenge, distinct from past isolationism or Cold War hegemony.",

    "section": "Challenges for Major Players in the New World Order",
    "text": "The emerging world order presents unique challenges for major players. Europe, the inventor of the nation-state, sovereignty, and balance of power, finds its individual nations too weak to act as principals. The effort to create a unified Europe consumes much of their energy, and even if successful, there are no established guidelines for such an entity on the global stage.  Russia has always been a special case, arriving late on the European scene and never fully adhering to traditional European diplomacy.  Straddling Europe, Asia, and the Muslim world, Russia was an empire unlike European nation-states, constantly changing with each territorial acquisition. Its large armies reflected internal security concerns as much as external threats.  Torn between insecurity and messianic zeal, Russia has been a disruptive force in the European equilibrium. Post-communist Russia faces a new identity crisis within unprecedented borders. Its future direction, including its relationship with Asia and its response to regional upheavals, remains uncertain, making it both essential to and a potential threat to world order. China also confronts a novel situation. For millennia, it unified its world under imperial rule. Wars were internal struggles for imperial authority, ultimately leading to a new central power.  China lacked comparable neighbors and dismissed outsiders as barbarians in a tributary relationship.  This system, unlike the European balance of power, lacked a permanent diplomatic establishment.  Humiliated by European colonialism in the 19th century, China re-emerged into a multipolar world unprecedented in its history. Japan, too, historically isolated itself, priding itself on its unique culture and military tradition.  During the Cold War, it aligned with distant America against the Soviet threat. The new world order, however, may compel Japan to reassess its reliance on a single ally and become more attuned to the Asian balance of power, where China, Korea, and Southeast Asia hold different significance than they do for the United States.",

    "text": "And will inaugurate a more autonomous and more self-reliant Japanese foreign policy. As for India, which is now emerging as the major power in South Asia, its foreign policy is in many ways the last vestige of the heyday of European imperialism, leavened by the traditions of an ancient culture. Before the arrival of the British, the subcontinent had not been ruled as a single political unit for millennia. British colonization was accomplished with small military forces because, at first, the local population saw these as the replacement of one set of conquerors by another. But after it established unified rule, the British Empire was undermined by the very values of popular government and cultural nationalism it had imported into India. Yet, as a nation-state, India is a newcomer: Absorbed by the struggle to feed its vast population, India dabbled in the Nonaligned movement during the Cold War. But it has yet to assume a role commensurate with its size on the international political stage.\n\nThus, in effect, none of the most important countries which must build a new world order have had any experience with the multistate system that is emerging. Never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so many different perceptions, or on so global a scale. Nor has any previous order had to combine the attributes of the historic balance-of-power systems with global democratic opinion and the exploding technology of the contemporary period.\n\nIn retrospect, all international systems appear to have an inevitable symmetry. Once established, it is difficult to imagine how history might have evolved had other choices been made, or indeed whether any other choices had been possible. When an international order first comes into being, many choices may be open to it. But each choice constricts the universe of remaining options. Because complexity inhibits flexibility, early choices are especially crucial. Whether an international order is relatively stable, like the one that emerged from the Congress of Vienna, or highly volatile, like those that emerged from the Peace of Westphalia and the Treaty of Versailles, depends on the degree to which they reconcile what makes the constituent societies feel secure with what they consider just. The two international systems that were the most stable—that of the Congress of Vienna and the one dominated by the United States after the Second World War—had the advantage of uniform perceptions. The statesmen at Vienna were aristocrats who saw intangibles in the same way and agreed on fundamentals; the American leaders who shaped the postwar world emerged from an intellectual tradition of extraordinary coherence and vitality.\n\nThe order that is now emerging will have to be built by statesmen who represent vastly different cultures, run huge bureaucracies of such complexity that, often, the energy of these statesmen is more consumed by serving the administrative machinery than by defining a purpose; rise to eminence by means of qualities that are not necessarily those needed to govern, and are even less suited to building an international order. And the many available models of a multistate system were ones built by Western societies, which some of the participants may reject.\n\nYet the rise and fall of previous world orders based on many states—from the Peace of Westphalia to our time—is the only experience on which one can draw in trying to understand the challenges facing contemporary statesmen. The study of history offers no manual of instructions that can be applied automatically; history teaches by analogy, shedding light on the likely consequences of comparable situations. But each generation must determine for itself which circumstances are in fact comparable.",

    "section": "Part 3: The Hinge: Theodore Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson",
    "text": "Chapter Two: The Hinge: Theodore Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson\nUntil early in this century, the isolationist tendency prevailed in American foreign policy. Then, two factors projected America into world affairs: its rapidly expanding power and the gradual collapse of the international system centered on Europe. Two watershed presidencies marked this progression: Theodore Roosevelt's and Woodrow Wilson's. These men held the reins of government when world affairs were drawing a reluctant nation into their vortex. Both recognized that America had a crucial role to play in world affairs, though they justified its emergence from isolation with opposite philosophies. Roosevelt was a sophisticated analyst of the balance of power. He insisted on an international role for America because its national interest demanded it and because a global balance of power was inconceivable to him without American participation. For Wilson, the justification of America's international role was messianic: America had an obligation, not to the balance of power, but to spread its principles throughout the world. During the Wilson Administration, America emerged as a key player in world affairs, proclaiming principles which, while reflecting the truisms of American thought, nonetheless marked a revolutionary departure for Old World diplomats. These principles held that peace depends on the spread of democracy, that states should be judged by the same ethical criteria as individuals, and that the national interest consists of adhering to a universal system of law. To hardened veterans of a European diplomacy based on the balance of power, Wilson's views about the ultimately moral foundations of foreign policy appeared strange, even hypocritical. Yet Wilsonianism has survived while history has bypassed the reservations of his contemporaries. Wilson was the originator of the vision of a universal world organization, the League of Nations, which would keep the peace through collective security rather than alliances. Though Wilson could not convince his own country of its merit, the idea lived on. It is above all to the drumbeat of Wilsonian idealism that American foreign policy has marched since his watershed presidency and continues to march to this day.",

    "section": "The Early Republic and Manifest Destiny",
    "text": "The dominant view in the early Republic was that America could best serve democracy by example, by creating a “just and solid republican government” as a “standing monument” for the world.  Leaders emphasized the moral foundations of American conduct and its symbolism of freedom, rejecting traditional European diplomacy based on balance of power and raison d'état. This created an ambivalence: if American foreign policy demanded the same rectitude as personal lives, how could security be achieved? Was survival subordinate to morality? Or did America’s devotion to freedom inherently moralize its actions, even self-serving ones?  This tension between moral principles and the pursuit of national interests became a major theme in American foreign policy. By 1820, a compromise emerged: America criticized European balance-of-power politics while justifying its own expansion across North America as “manifest destiny.”  Until the turn of the 20th century, American foreign policy remained simple: fulfill manifest destiny and avoid overseas entanglements. While favoring democratic governments, America abstained from actively promoting them globally. John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State, summarized this stance in 1821: America offered “benedictions and prayers” for freedom everywhere but intervened only to protect its own. The corollary to this self-restraint was the Monroe Doctrine (1823), which aimed to exclude European power politics from the Western Hemisphere.  The Monroe Doctrine, born from European attempts to suppress revolutions in Spain’s American colonies, declared the Western Hemisphere off-limits to further European colonization.  While motivated by principle, it also served American interests by creating space for expansion.  Under its umbrella, the US pursued policies akin to European powers – expanding commerce, annexing territory – without acknowledging its own power politics.  American expansion, whether against Native Americans or Mexico, was justified as manifest destiny, allowing the US to reconcile its power with its self-image of moral purity.",

    "text": "The Civil War briefly interrupted expansionist pursuits, but by 1868, expansion was again justified using the Monroe Doctrine, as seen with the purchase of Alaska.  More significantly, the US was rapidly becoming a global power, surpassing Great Britain in manufacturing output by 1885. By the turn of the century, its energy consumption dwarfed that of several major European powers combined.  Massive economic growth and immigration fueled this rise. Such a surge in power inevitably leads to greater global influence.  While some leaders envisioned an expanded American empire, the Senate, focused on domestic issues, resisted these ambitions. The US military remained relatively small, and the country was treated as a second-rank power internationally. However, this restraint could not last.  In the late 1880s, the US began naval expansion, fueled by a growing sense of its own importance and perceived threats from Great Britain. The Monroe Doctrine, initially supported by the British, was now used to challenge British influence in the Western Hemisphere. By 1902, Great Britain had relinquished its claims in Central America, cementing US hegemony in the region. Now supreme in the Western Hemisphere, the US began to engage more actively in global affairs. Its rise to power had been almost accidental, a byproduct of continental expansion.  American leaders still emphasized the nation's role as a 'beacon' of freedom, but some recognized that its power demanded a more active role in the international system.  Theodore Roosevelt articulated this view most forcefully, arguing that America had global interests and a duty to exert its influence. Unlike his predecessors, he viewed the US as a power like any other, obligated to use its strength to protect its interests.",

In his \"Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine, proclaimed on December 6, 1904, he asserted a general right of intervention by some civilized nation in the Western Hemisphere, a right which the United States alone was entitled to exercise. Roosevelt's practice preceded his preaching. In 1902, America forced Haiti to settle its debts with European banks. In 1903, it fueled unrest in Panama, leading to an insurrection and the establishment of the Canal Zone under U.S. sovereignty. In 1905, the United States established a financial protectorate over the Dominican Republic, and in 1906, American troops occupied Cuba. For Roosevelt, muscular diplomacy in the Western Hemisphere was part of America's new global role.

    "text": "Universal law and not equilibrium; national trustworthiness and not national self-assertion were, in Wilson's view, the foundations of international order. Recommending the ratification of several treaties of arbitration, Wilson argued that binding arbitration, not force, should become the method for resolving international disputes: “There is only one possible standard by which to determine controversies between the United States and other nations, and that is compounded of these two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to the peace of the world. A test so compounded ought easily to be made to govern both the establishment of new treaty obligations and the interpretation of those already assumed.”\nNothing annoyed Roosevelt as much as high-sounding principles backed by neither the power nor the will to implement them. He wrote to a friend: “If I must choose between a policy of blood and iron and one of milk and water, why I am for the policy of blood and iron. It is better not only for the nation but in the long run for the world.” By the same token, Roosevelt's proposal to respond to the war in Europe by increasing defense spending made no sense to Wilson. In his second State of the Union address on December 8, 1914, and after the European war had been raging for four months, Wilson rejected an increase in America's armaments because this would signal that “we had lost our self-possession” as the result of a war “whose causes cannot touch us, whose very existence affords us opportunities for friendship and disinterested service.” America's influence, in Wilson's view, depended on its unselfishness; it had to preserve itself so that, in the end, it could step forward as a credible arbiter between the warring parties. Roosevelt had asserted that the war in Europe, and especially a German victory, would ultimately threaten American security. Wilson maintained that America was essentially disinterested, hence should emerge as mediator: Because of America's faith in values higher than the balance of power, the war in Europe now afforded it an extraordinary opportunity to proselytize for a new and better approach to international affairs. Roosevelt ridiculed such ideas and accused Wilson of pandering to isolationist sentiments to help his re-election in 1916. In fact, the thrust of Wilson's policy was the opposite of isolationism. What Wilson was proclaiming was not America's withdrawal from the world but the universal applicability of its values and, in time, America's commitment to spreading them.",

    "text": "Wilson restated what had become the conventional American wisdom since Jefferson, but put it in the service of a crusading ideology: America’s special mission transcends day-to-day diplomacy and obliges it to serve as a beacon of liberty for the rest of mankind. The foreign policies of democracies are morally superior because the people are inherently peace-loving. Foreign policy should reflect the same moral standards as personal ethics. The state has no right to claim a separate morality for itself. Wilson endowed these assertions of American moral exceptionalism with a universal dimension: “Dread of the power of other nations we are incapable of. We are not jealous of rivalry in the fields of commerce or of any other peaceful achievement. We mean to live our own lives as we will; but we mean also to let live. We are, indeed, a true friend to all the nations of the world, because we threaten none, covet the possessions of none, desire the overthrow of none.”\nNo other nation has ever rested its claim to international leadership on its altruism. All other nations have sought to be judged by the compatibility of their national interests with those of other societies. Yet, from Woodrow Wilson through George Bush, American presidents have invoked their country's unselfishness as the crucial attribute of its leadership role. Neither Wilson nor his later disciples, through the present, have been willing to face the fact that, to foreign leaders imbued with less elevated maxims, America's claim to altruism evokes a certain aura of unpredictability; whereas the national interest can be calculated, altruism depends on the definition of its practitioner. To Wilson, however, the altruistic nature of American society was a gift of divine favor: “It was as if in the Providence of God a continent had been kept unused and waiting for a peaceful people who loved liberty and the rights of men more than they loved anything else, to come and set up an unselfish commonwealth.”\nThe claim that America represented a providential dispensation implied a global role for America that would prove far more sweeping than any Roosevelt had ever imagined. For he had wanted no more than to improve the balance of power and to invest America's role in it with the importance commensurate with its growing strength. In Roosevelt's conception, America would have been one nation among many—more powerful than most and part of an elite group of great powers—but still subject to the historic ground rules of equilibrium. Wilson moved America onto a plane entirely remote from such considerations: “Disdaining the balance of power, he insisted that America's role was not to prove our selfishness, but our greatness.”",

    "text": "If that was true, America had no right to hoard its values for itself. As early as 1915, Wilson put forward the unprecedented doctrine that the security of America was inseparable from the security of all the rest of mankind. This implied that it was henceforth America's duty to oppose aggression everywhere: “because we demand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right.”\nEnvisioning America as a beneficent global policeman, this foreshadowed the containment policy, which would be developed after the Second World War. Even at his most exuberant, Roosevelt would never have dreamt of so sweeping a sentiment portending global interventionism. But, then, he was the warrior-statesman; Wilson was the prophet-priest. Statesmen, even warriors, focus on the world in which they live; to prophets, the real world is the one they want to bring into being. Wilson transformed what had started out as a reaffirmation of American neutrality into a set of propositions laying the foundations for a global crusade. In Wilson's view, there was no essential difference between freedom for America and freedom for the world. Proving that the time spent in faculty meetings, where hairsplitting exegesis reigns supreme, had not been wasted, he developed an extraordinary interpretation of what George Washington had really meant when he warned against foreign entanglements. Wilson redefined 'foreign' in a way that would surely have astonished the first president: What Washington meant, according to Wilson, was that America must avoid becoming entangled in the purposes of others. But, Wilson argued, nothing that concerns humanity “can be foreign or indifferent to us.” Hence America had an unlimited charter to involve itself abroad. What extraordinary conceit to derive a charter for global intervention from a Founding Father's injunction against foreign entanglements, and to elaborate a philosophy of neutrality that made involvement in war inevitable! As Wilson edged his country ever closer to the world war by articulating his visions of a better world, he evoked a vitality and an idealism that seemed to justify America's hibernation for a century just so it could now enter the international arena with a dynamism and an innocence unknown to its more seasoned partners. European diplomacy had been hardened, and humbled, in the crucible of history; its statesmen saw events through the prism of many dreams proved fragile, of high hopes dashed and ideals lost to the fragility of human foresight. America knew no such limitations, boldly proclaiming, if not the end of history, then surely its irrelevance, as it moved to transform values heretofore considered unique to America into universal principles applicable to all.",

    "text": "Wilson was thus able to overcome, at least for a time, the tension in American thinking between America the secure and America the unsullied. America could only approach entry into World War I as an engagement on behalf of peoples everywhere, not just itself, and in the role of the crusader for universal liberties. Germany’s announcement of unrestricted submarine warfare and its sinking of the Lusitania became the proximate cause of America’s declaration of war. But Wilson did not justify America’s entry into the war on the grounds of specific grievances. National interests were irrelevant; Belgium’s violation and the balance of power had nothing to do with it. Rather, the war had a moral foundation, whose primary objective was a new and more just international order: “It is a fearful thing,” Wilson reflected in the speech asking for a declaration of war, “to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts,—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.”\nIn a war on behalf of principles, there could be no compromise. Total victory was the only valid goal. Roosevelt would almost certainly have expressed America’s war aims in political and strategic terms; Wilson, flaunting American disinterest, defined America’s war aims in entirely moral categories. In Wilson’s view, the war was not the consequence of clashing national interests pursued without restraint, but of Germany’s unprovoked assault on the international order. More specifically, the true culprit was not the German nation, but the German Emperor himself. In urging a declaration of war, Wilson argued: “We have no quarrel with the German people. We have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship. It was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war. It was not with their previous knowledge or approval. It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties.”",

    "text": "Though William II had long been regarded as a loose cannon on the European stage, no European statesman had ever advocated deposing him; nobody had viewed the overthrow of the Emperor or of his dynasty as the key to peace in Europe. But once the issue of Germany’s domestic structure had been advanced, the war could no longer end in the sort of compromise balancing conflicting interests that Roosevelt had achieved between Japan and Russia ten years earlier. On January 22, 1917, before America had entered the war, Wilson proclaimed its goal to be “peace without victory.” What Wilson proposed, however, when America did enter the war was a peace achievable only by total victory. Wilson’s pronouncements soon became conventional wisdom. Even as experienced a figure as Herbert Hoover began to describe the German ruling class as inherently wicked, preying “upon the life blood of other peoples.” The mood of the times was aptly expressed by Jacob Schurman, President of Cornell University, who saw the war as a struggle between the “Kingdom of Heaven” and the “Kingdom of Hun-land, which is force and frightfulness.” Yet the overthrow of a single dynasty could not possibly bring about all that Wilson’s rhetoric implied. In urging a declaration of war, Wilson extended his moral reach to the entire world; not only Germany but all other nations had to be made safe for democracy, for peace would require a partnership of democratic nations. In another speech, Wilson went even further by saying that America’s power would atrophy unless the United States spread freedom around the globe: “We set this Nation up to make men free, and we did not confine our conception and purpose to America, and now we will make men free. If we did not do that, all the fame of America would be gone, and all her power would be dissipated.” The closest Wilson ever came to stating his war aims in detail was in the Fourteen Points, which will be dealt with in chapter 9. Wilson’s historic achievement lies in his recognition that Americans cannot sustain major international engagements that are not justified by their moral faith. His downfall was in treating the tragedies of history as aberrations, or as due to the shortsightedness and the evil of individual leaders, and in his rejection of any objective basis for peace other than the force of public opinion and the worldwide spread of democratic institutions. In the process, he would ask the nations of Europe to undertake something for which they were neither philosophically nor historically prepared, and right after a war which had drained them of substance: For 300 years, the European nations had based their world order on a balancing of national interests, and their foreign policies on a quest for security.",

Wilson's appearance on the scene was a watershed for America, one of those rare examples of a leader who fundamentally alters the course of his country's history. Had Roosevelt or his ideas prevailed in 1912, the question of war aims would have been based on an inquiry into the nature of American national interest: Roosevelt would have rested America's entry into the war on the proposition—which he in fact advanced—that unless America joined the Triple Entente, the Central Powers would win the war and, sooner or later, pose a threat to American security. The American national interest, so defined, would, over time, have led America to adopt a global policy comparable to Great Britain's toward Continental Europe. For three centuries, British leaders had operated from the assumption that if Europe's resources were marshaled by a single dominant power, that country would then have the resources to challenge Great Britain's command of the seas, and thus threaten its independence. Geopolitically, the United States, also an island off the shores of Eurasia, should, by the same reasoning, have felt obliged to resist the domination of Europe or Asia by any one power and, even more, the control of both continents by the same power. In these terms, it should have been the extent of Germany's geopolitical reach and not its moral transgressions that provided the principal casus belli. However, such an Old World approach ran counter to the wellspring of American emotions being tapped by Wilson—as it does to this day. Not even Roosevelt could have managed the power politics he advocated, though he died convinced that he could have. At any rate, Roosevelt was no longer the president, and Wilson had made it clear, even before America entered the war, that he would resist any attempt to base the postwar order on established principles of international politics. Wilson saw the causes of the war not only in the wickedness of the German leadership but in the European balance-of-power system as well. On January 22, 1917, he attacked the international order which had preceded the war as a system of \"organized rivalries.\" The question upon which the whole future peace and policy of the world depends is this: Is the present war a struggle for a just and secure peace, or only for a new balance of power? There must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power; not organized rivalries, but an organized common peace. What Wilson meant by \"community of power\" was an entirely new concept that later became known as 'collective security' (though William Gladstone in Great Britain had put forward a stillborn variation of it in the course of 1880). Convinced that all the nations of the world had an equal interest in peace and would therefore unite to punish those who disturbed it, Wilson proposed to defend the international order by the moral consensus of the peace-loving: \"this age is an age which rejects the standards of national selfishness that once governed the counsels of nations and demands that they shall give way to a new order of things in which the only questions will be: 'Is it right?' 'Is it just?' 'Is it in the interest of mankind?'\" To institutionalize this consensus, Wilson put forward the League of Nations, a quintessentially American institution. Under the auspices of this world organization, power would yield to morality and the force of arms to the dictates of public opinion.",

    "text": "Wilson kept emphasizing that, had the public been adequately informed, the war would never have occurred—ignoring the passionate demonstrations of joy and relief which had greeted the onset of war in all capitals, including those of democratic Great Britain and France. If the new theory was to work, in Wilson's view, at least two changes in international governance had to take place: first, the spread of democratic governments throughout the world, and, next, the elaboration of a 'new and more wholesome diplomacy' based on 'the same high code of honor that we demand of individuals.' In 1918, Wilson stated as a requirement of peace the hitherto unheard-of and breathtakingly ambitious goal of 'the destruction of every arbitrary power anywhere that can separately, secretly and of its single choice disturb the peace of the world; or, if it cannot be presently destroyed, at the least its reduction to virtual impotence.' A League of Nations so composed and animated by such attitudes would resolve crises without war, Wilson told the Peace Conference on February 14, 1919: \"throughout this instrument [the League Covenant] we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one great force, and that is the moral force of the public opinion of the world—the cleansing and clarifying and compelling influences of publicity—so that those that are destroyed by the light may be properly destroyed by the overwhelming light of the universal expression of the condemnation of the world.\" The preservation of peace would no longer spring from the traditional calculus of power but from worldwide consensus backed up by a policing mechanism. A universal grouping of largely democratic nations would act as the 'trustee of peace,' and replace the old balance-of-power and alliance systems. Such exalted sentiments had never before been put forward by any nation, let alone been implemented. Nevertheless, in the hands of American idealism they were turned into the common currency of national thinking on foreign policy. Every American president since Wilson has advanced variations of Wilson's theme. Domestic debates have more often dealt with the failure to fulfill Wilson's ideals (soon so commonplace that they were no longer even identified with him) than with whether they were in fact lending adequate guidance in meeting the occasionally brutal challenges of a turbulent world. For three generations, critics have savaged Wilson's analysis and conclusions; and yet, in all this time, Wilson's principles have remained the bedrock of American foreign-policy thinking. And Wilson's intermingling of power and principle also set the stage for decades of ambivalence as the American conscience tried to reconcile its principles with its necessities. The basic premise of collective security was that all nations would view every threat to security in the same way and be prepared to run the same risks in resisting it. Not only had nothing like it ever actually occurred, nothing like it was destined to occur in the entire history of both the League of Nations and the United Nations.",

    "text": "fanaticism, a dispassionate foreign policy free of moral imperatives stood out like a SnOw-covered Alp in the desert: Richelieu's objective was to end what he considered the encirclement of France; t0 exhaust the Habsburgs, and to prevent the emergence of a major power on the borders of France especially the German border: His only criterion in making alliances was that served France's interests, and this he did at first with the Protes- tant states and, later, even with the Muslim Ottoman Empire. In order to exhaust the belligerents and to prolong the war, Richelieu subsidized the enemies of his enemies, bribed, fomented insurrections, and mobilized an extraordinary array of dynastic and legal arguments He succeeded so well that the war that had begun in 1618 dragged on decade after decade until, finally, history found no more appropriate name for it than its duration the Thirty Years' War. France stood on the sidelines while Germany was devastated; until 1635, when sheer exhaustion seemed once again tO portend an end to the hostilities and a compromise peace. Richelieu; however;, had no inter- est in compromise until the French King had become as powerful as the Habsburg Emperor; and preferably stronger: In pursuit of this goal, Richelieu convinced his sovereign; in the seventeenth year of the war, of the necessity of entering the fray on the side of the Protestant princes and with no better justification than the opportunity to exploit France's growing power:\nIf it is a sign of singular prudence to have held down the forces Op posed to your state for a period of ten years with the forces of your allies, by putting your hand in your pocket and not on your sword, then to engage in open warfare when your allies can no longer exist without yOu is a sign of courage and great wisdom; which shows that; in hus banding the peace of your kingdom; you have behaved like those econ- omists who, having taken care tO amass money, also know how to spend it.\nThe success of a policy of raison detat depends above all on the ability to assess power relationships Universal values are defined by their per- ception and are not in need of constant reinterpretation; indeed are inconsistent with it: But determining the limits of power requires a blend of experience and insight; and constant adjustment tO circumstance: In theory, of course; the balance of power should be quite calculable; in practice; it has proved extremely difficult to work out realistically: Even more complicated is harmonizing one's calculations with those of other states, which is the precondition for the operation of a balance of power: Consensus on the nature of the equilibrium is usually established by periodic conflict Richelieu had no doubt about his ability to master the challenge; con- vinced as he was that it was possible to relate means to ends with nearly mathematical precision: 'Logic;' he wrote in his Political Testament; re- quires that the thing that is to be supported and the force that is to support it should stand in geometrical proportion to each other: '8 Fate had made him a prince of the Church; conviction put him in the intellec- tual company of rationalists like Descartes and Spinoza, who thought that human action could be scientifically charted; opportunity had enabled him to transform the international order to the vast advantage of his country: For once, a statesman's estimate of himself was accurate. Riche lieu had a penetrating perception of his goals, but he_~and his ideas would not have prevailed had he not been able to gear his tactics to his strategy: So novel and s0 cold-blooded a doctrine could not possibly pass with- out challenge: However dominant the doctrine of balance of power was to become in later years, it was deeply offensive to the universalist tradi- tion founded on the primacy of moral law.",

    "text": "One of the most telling cri- tiques came from the renowned scholar Jansenius; who attacked a policy cut loose from all moral moorings:\nDO believe that a secular, perishable state should outweigh reli- gion and the Church? Should not the Most Christian King believe that in the guidance and administration of his realm there is nothing that obliges him to extend and protect that of Jesus Christ; his Lord? Would he dare say to God: Let your power and glory and the religion which teaches men to adore You be lost and destroyed, provided my state is protected and free of risks?9\nThat; of course, was precisely what Richelieu was saying to his contempo- raries and, for all we know, to his God. It was the measure of the revolu- tion he had brought about that what his critics thought was a reductio ad absurdum (an argument S0 immoral and dangerous that it refutes itself) was, in fact; a highly accurate summary of Richelieu's thought As the King s First Minister; he subsumed both religion and morality tO raison detat; his guiding light. Demonstrating how well they had absorbed the cynical methods of the master himself; Richelieu's defenders turned the argument of their critics against them: A policy of national self-interest; they argued, represented the highest moral law; it was Richelieu's critics who were in violation of ethical principle, not he. It fell to Daniel de Priezac, a scholar close to the royal administration, to make the formal rebuttal, almost certainly with Richelieu's own impri- matur: In classically Machiavellian fashion; Priezac challenged the prem- ise that Richelieu was committing mortal sin by pursuing policies which seemed to favor the spread of heresy: Rather; he argued, it was Richelieu's critics whose souls were at risk Since France was the most pure and devoted of the European Catholic powers, Richelieu, in serving the inter- ests of France; was serving as well the interests of the Catholic religion: Priezac did not explain how he had reached the conclusion that France had been endowed with such a unique religious vocation. However, it followed from his premise that strengthening the French state was in the interest of the well-being of the Catholic Church; hence Richelieus policy was highly moral Indeed; the Habsburg encirclement posed so great a threat to France's security that it had to be broken; exonerating the French King in whatever methods he chose to pursue that ultimately moral goal:\nHe seeks peace by means of war, and if in waging it something happens contrary to his desires; it is not a crime of will but of necessity whose laws are most harsh and commands most cruel A war is just when the intention that causes it to be undertaken is just: The will is there- fore the principal element that must be considered, not the means. [He] who intends to kill the guilty sometimes faultlessly sheds the blood of the innocent 10 Not to put tOo fine a point on it; the end justified the means Another of Richelieus critics, Mathieu de Morgues, accused the Car- dinal of manipulating religion 'as your preceptor Machiavelli showed the ancient Romans doing, shaping it explaining it and applying it as far aS it aids the advancement ofyour designs. 11 De Morgues's criticism was as telling as that of Jansenius, and as ineffec tive. Richelieu was indeed the manipulator described, and did use reli- gion precisely in the manner alleged He would no doubt have replied that he had merely analyzed the world aS it was, much as Machia- velli had Like Machiavelli; he might well have preferred a world of more refined moral sensibilities, but he was convinced that history would judge his statesmanship by how well he had used the conditions and the factors he was given to work with Indeed, if, in evaluating a statesman; reaching the goals he sets for himself is a test; Richelieu must be remembered as one of the seminal figures of modern history. For he left behind him a world radically different from the one he had found, and set in motion the policy France would follow for the next three centuries In this manner; France became the dominant country in Europe and vastly expanded its territory: In the century following the Peace of West- phalia of 1648, ending the Thirty Years' War; the doctrine of raison detat grew into the guiding principle of European diplomacy. Neither the re- spect in which statesmen of later centuries would hold Richelieu nor the oblivion which was the fate of his opponent; Ferdinand II, would have surprised the Cardinal, who was utterly without illusions, even about himself. In matters of state, wrote Richelieu in his Political Testament; who has the power often has the right; and he who is weak can only with difficulty keep from being wrong in the opinion of the majority of the world' ~~a maxim rarely contradicted in the intervening centuries 12",

    "text": "faith that out of a clash of competing interests harmony and fairness would emerge: The concept of the balance of power was simply an extension of conventional wisdom. Its primary goal was to prevent domination by one state and to preserve the international order; it was not designed to prevent conflicts, but to limit them. To the hard-headed statesmen of the eighteenth century, the elimination of conflict (of ambition, of greed) was utopian; the solution was to harness or counterpoise the inherent flaws of human nature to produce the best possible long-term outcome. The philosophers of the Enlightenment viewed the international system as part of a universe operating like a great clockwork which, never standing still, inexorably advanced toward a better world. In 1751, Voltaire described a 'Christian Europe' as a sort of great republic divided into several states, some monarchical, the others mixed, but all in harmony with each other, all possessing the same principles of public and political law, unknown in other parts of the world. These states were above all at one in the wise policy of maintaining among themselves, as far as possible, an equal balance of power. Montesquieu took up the same theme. For him, the balance of power distilled unity out of diversity: 'The state of things in Europe is that all the states depend on each other: Europe is a single state composed of several provinces.' As these lines were being written, the eighteenth century had already endured two wars over the Spanish succession; a war over the Polish succession, and a series of wars over the Austrian succession. In the same spirit, the philosopher of history Emmerich de Vattel could write in 1758, the second year of the Seven Years' War, that: 'The continual negotiations that take place, make modern Europe a sort of republic, whose members—each independent, but all bound together by a common interest—unite for the maintenance of order and the preservation of liberty. This is what has given rise to the well-known principle of the balance of power, by which is meant an arrangement of affairs so that no state shall be in a position to have absolute mastery and dominate over the others.' The philosophers were confusing the result with the intent. Throughout the eighteenth century, the princes of Europe fought innumerable wars without there being a shred of evidence that the conscious goal was to implement any general notion of international order. At the precise moment when international relations came to be based on power, so many new factors emerged that calculations became increasingly unmanageable. The various dynasties henceforth concentrated on enhancing their security by territorial expansion. In the process, the relative power positions of several of them altered drastically: Spain and Sweden were sinking into second-rank status; Poland began its slide toward extinction; Russia (which had been entirely absent from the Peace of Westphalia) and Prussia (which played an insignificant role) were emerging as major powers. The balance of power is difficult enough to analyze when its components are relatively fixed. The task of assessing it and reconciling the assessments of the various powers becomes hopelessly intricate when the relative mights of the powers are in constant flux. The vacuum created in Central Europe by the Thirty Years' War tempted the surrounding countries to encroach upon it. France kept pressing from the west. Russia was on the march in the east; Prussia expanded in the center of the Continent. None of the Continental countries felt any special obligation to the balance of power so lauded by the philosophers. Russia thought of itself as too distant; Prussia, as the smallest of the Great Powers, was still too weak to affect the general equilibrium. Every king consoled himself with the thought that strengthening his own rule was the greatest possible contribution to the general peace, and left it to the ubiquitous invisible hand to justify his exertions without limiting his ambitions.",

    "text": "The nature of raison d'etat as an essentially risk-benefit calculation was shown by the way Frederick the Great justified his seizure of Silesia from Austria, despite Prussia's heretofore amicable relations with that state and despite its being bound by treaty to respect Austria's territorial integrity: 'The superiority of our troops, the promptitude with which we can set them in motion, in a word, the clear advantage we have over our neighbors, gives us in this unexpected emergency an infinite superiority over all other powers of Europe. England and France are foes. If France should meddle in the affairs of the empire, England could not allow it; so I can always make an alliance with one or the other. England could not be jealous of my getting Silesia, which would do her no harm, and she needs allies. Holland will not care, all the more since the loans of the Amsterdam business world secured on Silesia will be guaranteed. If we cannot arrange with England and Holland, we can certainly make a deal with France, who cannot frustrate our designs and will welcome the abasement of the imperial house. Russia alone might give us trouble. If the empress lives we can bribe the leading counsellors. If she dies, the Russians will be so occupied that they will have no time for foreign affairs.' Frederick the Great treated international affairs as if it were a game of chess. He wanted to seize Silesia in order to expand the power of Prussia. The only obstacle he would recognize to his designs was resistance from superior powers, not moral scruples. His was a risk/reward analysis: if he conquered Silesia, would other states retaliate or seek compensation? Frederick resolved the calculation in his favor. His conquest of Silesia made Prussia a bona fide Great Power; but it also set off a series of wars as other countries tried to adjust to this new player. The first was the War of the Austrian Succession, from 1740 to 1748. In it, Prussia was joined by France, Spain, Bavaria, and Saxony—which in 1743 switched sides—while Great Britain supported Austria. In the second war, the Seven Years' War, from 1756 to 1763, the roles were reversed. Austria was now joined by Russia, France, Saxony, and Sweden, while Great Britain and Hanover supported Prussia. The change of sides was the result of pure calculations of immediate benefit and specific compensations, not of any overriding principle of international order. Yet a sort of equilibrium gradually emerged out of this seeming anarchy and rapine in which each state sought single-mindedly to augment its own power. It was due not to self-restraint but to the fact that no state, not even France, was strong enough to impose its will on all the others and thus form an empire. When any state threatened to become dominant, its neighbors formed a coalition—not in pursuit of a theory of international relations but out of pure self-interest—to block the ambitions of the most powerful. These constant wars did not lead to the devastations of the religious wars for two reasons. Paradoxically, the absolute rulers of the eighteenth century were in a less strong position to mobilize resources for war than was the case when religion or ideology or popular government could stir the emotions. They were restrained by tradition and perhaps by their own insecurity from imposing income taxes and other modern exactions, limiting the amount of national wealth potentially devoted to war; and weapons technology was rudimentary. Above all, the equilibrium on the Continent was reinforced and in fact managed by the appearance of a state whose foreign policy was explicitly dedicated to maintaining the balance: England's policy was based on throwing its weight, as the occasion required, to the weaker and more threatened side to redress the equilibrium.",

    "text": "British disputes about the best strategy to implement the balance of power policy involved two schools of thought, mirroring a similar disagreement in the United States after the two world wars. The Whigs argued for engagement only when the balance was directly threatened, while the Tories believed in actively shaping the balance of power. The Whigs believed in waiting for an actual assault on the Low Countries, while the Tories argued that such a policy could allow irreparable damage to the balance.  Lord Carteret, a Tory Foreign Secretary, advocated for permanent engagement in Europe, denouncing the Whig's isolationist tendencies. He argued for supporting the Habsburgs as a counterweight to France, fearing French domination of the continent if unchecked. The difference in Whig and Tory foreign policy was practical, reflecting each party's assessment of Great Britain's vulnerability. Whigs saw a wide margin of safety, while Tories found Britain's position more precarious.  This mirrors the later divide between American isolationists and globalists.  Leaders like Wilson, Carteret, Castlereagh, and Gladstone all proposed permanent engagements or collective security, but their appeals failed until after World War II. Great Britain became the balancer of Europe, first by default, then by strategy.  Churchill later claimed that Britain had 'preserved the liberties of Europe'.",

    "text": "In the early 19th century, Britain formalized its defense of the balance of power. France's revolutionary expansionism, justified by universal principles rather than raison d'état, threatened European stability. Napoleon's conquests brought France close to dominating Europe, with Russia as the main obstacle. Russia's growing power, coupled with its autocratic system, inspired a mix of hope and fear. Tsar Alexander I, influenced by Enlightenment ideals, proposed a universal peace plan to British Prime Minister Pitt, suggesting constitutional reforms and arbitration. Pitt, needing Russian support against Napoleon, cautiously responded.  He prioritized a balance of power, focusing on strengthening Central Europe to prevent French incursions. Pitt proposed a European settlement based on the balance of power, restoring the Low Countries' independence and consolidating German states. He envisioned a permanent alliance between Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia to guarantee the new order.  Both Pitt and later Roosevelt faced the dilemma of relying on a current ally who might become a future threat.  The fear of Napoleon pushed Britain towards a permanent continental engagement, a departure from its usual policy.",

Both periods saw collapsing world orders, states pursuing self-interest, and a search for international roles.  The question is whether the international system's maintenance can be a conscious design or a result of power struggles. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Europe was ready to design an international order based on the balance of power.  Experience showed that the balance of power could not be left to chance. Pitt's plan outlined a territorial settlement, but his allies recognized that power is too difficult to assess and requires shared values for stability. The balance of power inhibits the capacity to overthrow the international order, while shared values inhibit the desire. Combining power and legitimacy was the challenge and success of the Congress of Vienna, leading to a century of peace.",

    "text": "For years, and after the Crimean War of 1854, no general war for another sixty years. The Vienna settlement corresponded so closely to the Pitt Plan that when Castlereagh submitted it to Parliament, he attached a draft of the original British design to show the close resemblance. Paradoxically, this international order, created in the name of the balance of power, relied the least on power to maintain itself. This occurred partly because the equilibrium was well-designed, making it difficult to overthrow. But the most important reason was the shared values among Continental countries. There was not only a physical equilibrium but a moral one, where power and justice were in harmony. The balance of power reduces opportunities for using force, while shared justice reduces the desire to use it. An unjust international order will eventually be challenged. How people perceive fairness depends on domestic institutions as much as foreign policy issues. Therefore, compatible domestic institutions reinforce peace.  Metternich, like Wilson, believed shared justice was a prerequisite for international order, though their ideas of justice differed drastically.\n\nCreating the balance of power proved relatively simple. Statesmen followed the Pitt Plan closely. Since national self-determination was not yet a concept, they were unconcerned with ethnic homogeneity. Austria was strengthened in Italy, Prussia in Germany, and the Dutch Republic acquired the Austrian Netherlands. France returned to its pre-Revolution borders, and Russia received the heartland of Poland. Great Britain, adhering to its policy of no Continental acquisitions, gained the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nIn Great Britain's view, the balance of power's test was how well nations performed their assigned roles. Great Britain faced a difference in perspective with Continental countries, similar to the US during the Cold War. Nations don't see themselves as cogs in a security system. Security enables their existence, but isn't their sole purpose. Austria and Prussia didn't see themselves as 'great masses,' nor did France view NATO as a division of labor. The balance of power meant little to Austria and Prussia if it didn't address their complex relationship and historic roles. After the Habsburgs failed to achieve Central European hegemony in the Thirty Years' War, Austria abandoned dominating Germany. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was abolished, but Austria still saw itself as Germany's leader and was determined to prevent any other German state, especially Prussia, from assuming that role.",

Ruthless diplomacy, military devotion, and strong discipline propelled Prussia from a secondary principality to a formidable kingdom. Its fragmented territories fueled a strong sense of national mission.\n\nThe relationship between the two largest German states and their relationship with other German states were crucial for European stability. Since the Thirty Years' War, Germany's internal arrangements presented a dilemma: a weak, divided Germany tempted neighbors, especially France, into expansionism. Yet, a united Germany terrified surrounding states. Historically, Germany has been either too weak or too strong for European peace. The Congress of Vienna aimed to consolidate, but not unify, Germany, undoing Richelieu's work of fostering a weak Central Europe that tempted French encroachment. They strengthened Austria and Prussia, along with medium-sized states like Bavaria, Württemberg, and Saxony. The 300-odd pre-Napoleonic states were combined into thirty and bound together in the German Confederation. This new entity provided common defense, too strong for France to attack but too weak to threaten its neighbors. It balanced Prussia's military strength with Austria's prestige and legitimacy, aiming to prevent German unity, preserve German princes' thrones, and forestall French aggression. It succeeded on all counts.",

    "text": "Victors designing a peace settlement must transition from wartime intransigence to peacetime conciliation. A punitive peace burdens the victors with suppressing a resentful defeated country, ensuring its support from the disaffected. The Congress of Vienna, like the victors of World War II, avoided this mistake. Despite France's history of attempted European domination, the statesmen at Vienna concluded that a relatively satisfied France would make Europe safer. France lost its conquests but regained its pre-revolutionary borders. Castlereagh argued that a satisfied France would be less likely to cause future conflict. By 1818, France joined the Congress system, participating in periodic European congresses that nearly constituted a European government for half a century.\n\nGreat Britain believed that national self-interest was sufficient to maintain peace, but the war-weary countries of Central Europe, especially Austria, sought tangible assurances. Austria, a multinational empire threatened by liberalism and nationalism, sought moral restraint to prevent conflicts. Metternich skillfully guided countries to submit disagreements to shared values. Talleyrand emphasized the importance of restraint, noting that true equilibrium required a balance of power, but artificial equilibrium relied on moderation and justice.\n\nAfter the Congress of Vienna, the balance of power and shared legitimacy were expressed in two documents: the Quadruple Alliance (Great Britain, Prussia, Austria, and Russia) and the Holy Alliance (Prussia, Austria, and Russia). France, seen as chronically aggressive, prompted the Quadruple Alliance to deter aggression. A similar alliance in 1918 might have prevented World War II. The Holy Alliance, proposed by Tsar Alexander I, aimed to reform the international system based on religious principles. Metternich transformed it into a commitment to preserve the domestic status quo in Europe. For the first time, European powers had a common mission.",

However, Metternich saw it as a way to commit the Tsar to supporting legitimate rule and restraining his unilateral impulses.  The Holy Alliance united conservative monarchs against revolution, but also obliged them to act in concert, giving Austria a veto over Russian adventures. The Concert of Europe meant that competitive nations would settle matters of overall stability by consensus.  The Holy Alliance's significance was introducing moral restraint into Great Power relations. The vested interest in preserving domestic institutions led Continental countries to avoid conflicts that would have been commonplace in the previous century.\n\nHowever, compatible domestic institutions don't guarantee peace. In the 18th century, rulers governed by divine right, yet fought endless wars precisely because they considered their domestic institutions unassailable.  Metternich, like Wilson, believed domestic institutions determined international behavior, but with different premises. While Wilson saw democracies as inherently peaceful, Metternich considered them dangerous. Having witnessed republican France's impact on Europe, he equated peace with legitimate rule, expecting crowned heads of ancient dynasties to preserve peace.",

    "text": "In this manner, legitimacy became the cement by which the international order was held together: The difference between the Wilsonian and the Metternich approaches to domestic justice and international order is fundamental to understand- ing the contrasting views of America and Europe. Wilson crusaded for principles which he perceived as revolutionary and new. Metternich sought to institutionalize values he considered ancient Wilson, presiding over a country consciously created to set man free, Was persuaded that democratic values could be legislated and then embodied in entirely new worldwide institutions. Metternich; representing an ancient country whose institutions had developed gradually, almost imperceptibly, did not believe that rights could be created by legislation. 'Rights;' according to Metternich, simply existed in the nature of things. Whether they were affirmed by laws or by constitutions was an essentially technical question which had nothing to do with bringing about freedom: Metternich consid- ered guaranteeing rights to be a paradox: \"Things which ought to be taken for granted lose their force when they emerge in the form of arbitrary pronouncements. Objects mistakenly made subject to legisla- tion result only in the limitation; if not the complete annulment; of that which is attempted to be safeguarded.\" Some of Metternich's maxims were self-serving rationalizations of the practices of the Austrian Empire, which was incapable of adjusting to the emerging new world. But Metternich also reflected the rationalist conviction that laws and rights existed in nature and not by fiat. His formative experience had been the French Revolution; which started with the proclamation of the Rights of Man and ended with the Reign of Terror: Wilson emerged from a far more benign national experience and, fifteen years before the rise of modern totalitarianism, could not conceive of aberrations in the will. In the post-Vienna period, Metternich played the decisive role in man- aging the international system and in interpreting the requirements of the Holy Alliance. Metternich was forced to assume this role because Austria was in the direct path of every storm, and its domestic institutions were less and less compatible with the national and liberal trends of the century. Prussia loomed over Austria's position in Germany, and Russia over its Slavic populations in the Balkans. And there was always France; eager to reclaim Richelieu’s legacy in Central Europe. Metternich knew that; if these dangers were permitted to turn into tests of strength; Austria would exhaust itself; whatever the outcome of any particular conflict: His policy, therefore; was to avoid crises by building a moral consensus and to deflect those which could not be avoided by discreetly backing whichever nation was willing to bear the brunt of the confrontation—Great Britain vis-a-vis France in the Low Countries, Great Britain and France vis- a-vis Russia in the Balkans, the smaller states vis-a-vis Prussia in Germany: Metternich's extraordinary diplomatic skill permitted him to translate familiar diplomatic verities into operational foreign policy principles. He managed to convince Austria's two closest allies, each of which repre- sented a geopolitical threat to the Austrian Empire; that the ideological danger posed by revolution outweighed their strategic opportunities. Had Prussia sought to exploit German nationalism; it could have challenged Austrian pre-eminence in Germany a generation before Bismarck. Had Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I only considered Russia's geopoliti- cal opportunities, they would have exploited the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire far more decisively to Austria’s peril—as their succes- sors would do later in the century. Both refrained from pushing their advantage because it ran counter to the dominant principle of main- taining the status quo. Austria, seemingly on its deathbed after Napoleon's onslaught; was given a new lease on life by the Metternich system, which enabled it to survive for another hundred years.",

    "text": "The man who saved this anachronistic empire and guided its policy for nearly fifty years did not even visit Austria until he was thirteen years old or live there until he was seventeen. Prince Klemens von Metternich's father had been governor general of the Rhineland then a Habsburg possession. A cosmopolitan figure, Metternich was always more comfort- able speaking French than German. 'For a time now,' he wrote to Wellington in 1824, \"Europe has had for me the quality of a fatherland [patrie].\" Contemporary opponents sneered at his righteous maxims and polished epigrams. But Voltaire and Kant would have understood his views. A rationalist product of the Enlightenment; he found himself pro- pelled into a revolutionary struggle which was foreign to his tempera- ment; and into becoming the leading minister of a state under siege whose structure he could not modify: Sobriety of spirit and moderation of objective were the Metternich style: 'Little given to abstract ideas, we accept things as they are and we attempt to the maximum of our ability to protect ourselves against delu- sions about realities.' And; \"with phrases which on close examination dissolve into thin air, such as the defense of civilization, nothing tangible can be defined.\" With such attitudes, Metternich strove to avoid being swept away by the emotion of the moment. As soon as Napoleon was defeated in Russia, and before Russian troops had even reached Central Europe, Metternich had identified Russia as a potential long-term threat: At a time when Austria's neighbors were concentrating on liberation from French rule; he made Austria's participation in the anti-Napoleon coalition dependent on the elaboration of war aims compatible with the survival of his rickety em- pire: Metternich's attitude was the exact opposite of the position taken by the democracies during the Second World War, when they found them- selves in comparable circumstances vis-a-vis the Soviet Union: Like Cas- tlereagh and Pitt; Metternich believed that a strong Central Europe was the prerequisite to European stability. Determined to avoid tests of strength if at all possible, Metternich was as concerned with establishing a moderating influence as he was with accumulating raw power: The attitude of the [European] powers differs as their geographical situation: France and Russia have but a Single frontier and this hardly vulnerable: The Rhine with its triple line of fortresses assures the re- pose of France; a frightful climate makes the Niemen a no less safe frontier for Russia: Austria and Prussia find themselves exposed on all sides to attack by their neighbouring powers. Continuously menaced by the preponderance of these two powers, Austria and Prussia can find tranquillity in a wise and measured policy, in relations of goodwill among each other and with their neighbours. Though Austria needed Russia as a hedge against France; it was wary of its impetuous ally, and especially of the Tsar's crusading bent; Talleyrand said of Tsar Alexander I that he was not for nothing the son of the mad Tsar Paul. Metternich described Alexander as a 'strange combination of masculine virtues and feminine weaknesses. Too weak for true ambition; but too strong for pure vanity.' For Metternich; the problem posed by Russia was not so much how to contain its aggressiveness—an endeavor which would have exhausted Austria—as how to temper its ambitions. Alexander desires the peace of the world;' reported an Austrian diplomat; 'but not for the sake of peace and its blessings; rather for his own sake; not unconditionally, but with mental reservations: he must remain the arbiter of this peace; from him must emanate the repose and happiness of the world and all of Europe must recognize that this repose is his work; that it is dependent on his goodwill and that it can be disturbed by his whim.' Castlereagh and Metternich parted company over how to contain a mercurial and meddlesome Russia: As the Foreign Minister of an island power far from the scene of confrontation, Castlereagh was prepared to resist only overt attacks, and even then the attacks had to threaten the equilibrium: Metternich's country, on the other hand; lay in the center of the Continent and could not take such chances. Precisely because Metter- nich distrusted Alexander; he insisted on staying close to him and concen- trated on keeping threats from his direction from ever arising: 'If one cannon is fired,' he wrote, 'Alexander will escape us at the head of his retinue and then there will be no limit any longer to what he will consider his divinely ordained laws.' To dilute Alexander's zealousness; Metternich pursued a two-pronged strategy. Under his leadership, Austria was in the vanguard of the fight against nationalism; though he was adamant about not permitting Austria to be too exposed or to engage in unilateral acts. He was even less inclined to encourage others to act on their own, partly because he feared Russia’s missionary zeal could turn into expansionism: For Metternich, moderation was a philosophical virtue and a practical necessity: In his instructions to an Austrian ambassador; he once wrote: \"It is more im- portant to eliminate the claims of others than to press our own: We will obtain much in proportion as we ask little.\" Whenever possible, he tried to temper the Tsar's crusading schemes by involving him in time consuming consultations and by limiting him to what the European con- sensus would tolerate: The second prong of Metternich's strategy was conservative. Whenever action became unavoidable, Metternich would resort to a jug- gling act which he once described as follows: 'Austria considers every- thing with reference to the substance. Russia wants above all the form; Britain wants the substance without the form. It will be our task to combine the impossibilities of Britain with the modes of Russia.' Metter- nich's dexterity enabled Austria to control the pace of events for a genera- tion by turning Russia, a country he feared, into a partner on the basis of the unity of conservative interests, and Great Britain; which he trusted, into a last resort for resisting challenges to the balance of power: The inevitable outcome; however; would merely be delayed: Even so, to have preserved an ancient state on the basis of values inconsistent with the dominant trends all around it for a full century is not a mean achievement. Metternich's dilemma was the closer he moved toward the Tsar, the more he risked his British connection; and the more he risked that; the closer he had to move toward the Tsar to avoid isolation. For Metter- nich, the ideal combination would have been British support to preserve the territorial balance, and Russian support to quell domestic upheaval—the Quadruple Alliance for geopolitical security, and the Holy Alliance for domestic stability: But as time passed and the memory of Napoleon faded, that combina- tion became increasingly difficult to sustain: The more the alliances ap- proached a system of collective security and European government; the more Great Britain felt compelled to dissociate itself from it. And the more Great Britain dissociated itself; the more dependent Austria became on Russia, hence the more rigidly it defended conservative values. This was a vicious circle that could not be broken. However sympathetic Castlereagh might have been to Austria's prob- lems, he was unable to induce Great Britain to address potential, as opposed to actual, dangers. \"When the Territorial Balance of Europe is disturbed;' avowed Castlereagh; \"She [Britain] can interfere with effect; but She is the last Government in Europe which can be expected, or can venture to commit Herself on any question of an abstract character: We shall be found in our Place when actual danger menaces the System of Europe; but this Country cannot; and will not; act upon abstract and speculative Principles of Precaution.\" Yet the crux of Metternich's prob- lem was that necessity obliged him to treat as practical what Great Britain considered abstract and speculative. Domestic upheaval happened to be the danger Austria found the least manageable. To soften the disagreement in principle, Castlereagh proposed peri- odic meetings, or congresses, of the foreign ministers to review the Euro- pean state of affairs. What became known as the Congress system sought to forge a consensus on the issues confronting Europe and to pave the way for dealing with them on a multilateral basis. Great Britain; however; was not comfortable with a system of European government; because it came too close to the unified Europe that the British had consistently opposed. Traditional British policy apart, no British government had ever undertaken a permanent commitment to review events as they arose without confronting a specific threat: Participating in a European govern- ment was no more attractive to British public opinion than the League of Nations would be to Americans a hundred years later, and for much the same reasons. The British Cabinet made its reserve quite evident as early as the first such conference, the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818. Castlereagh was dispatched with these extraordinarily grudging instructions: \"We ap- prove [a general declaration] on this occasion, and with difficulty too, by assuring [the secondary powers] that periodic meetings are to be confined to one subject; or even to one power, France, and no engagement to interfere in any manner in which the Law of Nations does not justify interference. Our true policy has always been not to interfere except in great emergencies and then with commanding force.\" Great Britain wanted France kept in check but; beyond that; the twin fears of continental entanglements and a unified Europe prevailed in London. There was only one occasion when Great Britain found Congress diplo- macy compatible with its objectives. During the Greek Revolution of 1821, England interpreted the Tsar’s desire to protect the Christian population of the collapsing Ottoman Empire as the first stage of Russia's attempt to conquer Egypt. With British strategic interests at stake, Castlereagh did not hesitate to appeal to the Tsar in the name of the very allied unity he had heretofore sought to restrict to containing France: Characteristically",

    "text": "He elaborated a distinction between theoretical and practical issues: \"The question of Turkey is of a totally different character and one which in England we regard not as a theoretical but a practical consideration.\" But Castlereagh's appeal to the Alliance served above all to demonstrate its inherent brittleness. An alliance in which one partner treats his own strategic interests as the sole practical issue confers no additional security on its members. For it provides no obligation beyond what considerations of national interest would have impelled in any event. Metternich undoubtedly drew comfort from Castlereagh's obvious personal sympathy for his objectives, and even for the Congress system itself. Castlereagh, it was said by one of Austria's diplomats, was 'like a great lover of music who is at Church; he wishes to applaud but he dare not.' But if even the most European-minded of British statesmen dared not applaud what he believed in, Great Britain's role in the Concert of Europe was destined to be transitory and ineffective. Somewhat like Wilson and his League of Nations a century later, Castlereagh's efforts to persuade Great Britain to participate in a system of European congresses went far beyond what English representative institutions could tolerate on either philosophical or strategic grounds. Castlereagh was convinced, as Wilson would be, that the danger of new aggression could best be avoided if his country joined some permanent European forum that dealt with threats before they developed into crises. He understood Europe better than most of his British contemporaries and knew that the newly created balance would require careful tending. He thought that he had devised a solution Great Britain could support, because it did not go beyond a series of discussion meetings of the foreign ministers of the four victors and had no obligatory features. But even discussion meetings smacked too much of European government for the British Cabinet. Indeed, the Congress system never even cleared its initial hurdle. When Castlereagh attended the first conference at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, France was admitted to the Congress system and Great Britain made its exit from it. The Cabinet refused to let Castlereagh attend any further European congresses, which subsequently took place at Troppau in 1820, at Laibach in 1821, and at Verona in 1822.",

In each case, the attempt by the leader of the most powerful country to create a general system of collective security failed because of domestic inhibitions and historic traditions. Both Wilson and Castlereagh believed that the international order established after a catastrophic war could only be protected by the active participation of all of the members of the international community and especially of their own countries. To Castlereagh and Wilson, security was collective; if any nation was victimized, in the end all would become victims. With security thus perceived as seamless, all states had a common interest in resisting aggression, and an even greater interest in preventing it. In Castlereagh's view, Great Britain, whatever its views on specific issues, had a genuine interest in the preservation of general peace and in the maintenance of the balance of power. Like Wilson, Castlereagh thought that the best way to defend that interest was to have a hand in shaping the decisions affecting international order and in organizing resistance to violations of the peace. The weakness of collective security is that interests are rarely uniform, and that security is rarely seamless. Members of a general system of collective security are therefore more likely to agree on inaction than on joint action; either it will be held together by glittering generalities, or it may witness the defection of the most powerful member, who feels the most secure and therefore least needs the system. Neither Wilson nor Castlereagh was able to bring his country into a system of collective security because their respective societies did not feel threatened by foreseeable dangers and thought they could deal with them alone or, if need be, find allies at the last moment. To them, participating in the League of Nations or the European Congress system compounded risks without enhancing security.",

He left no legacy; no British statesman has used Castlereagh as a model. Wilson not only responded to the wellsprings of American motivation, but took it to a new and higher level. All his successors have been Wilsonian to some degree, and subsequent American foreign policy has been shaped by his maxims. Lord Stewart, the British observer permitted to attend the various European congresses, who was Castlereagh's half-brother, spent most of his energy defining the limits of Great Britain's involvement rather than contributing to a European consensus. At Troppau, he submitted a memorandum which affirmed the right to self-defense but insisted that Great Britain would 'not charge itself as a member of the Alliance with the moral responsibility of administering a general European Police.' At the Congress of Laibach, Lord Stewart was obliged to reiterate that Great Britain would never engage itself against 'speculative' dangers. Castlereagh himself had set forth the British position in a state paper of 1820. The Quadruple Alliance, he affirmed, was an alliance for the 'liberation of a great proportion of the Continent of Europe from the military dominion of France.' It never was, however, intended as an 'Union for the Government of the World or for the Superintendence of the Internal Affairs of other States.' In the end, Castlereagh found himself trapped between his convictions and his domestic necessities. From this untenable situation, he could see no exit. 'Sir,' Castlereagh said at his last interview with the King, 'it is necessary to say goodbye to Europe; you and I alone know it and have saved it; no one after me understands the affairs of the Continent.' Four days later, he committed suicide.",

It had never relied on the Congress system for its security; for Great Britain, the new pattern of international relations was more like business as usual.  In the course of the nineteenth century, Great Britain became the dominant country in Europe.  It was strong enough to stand alone and had the advantages of geographic isolation and imperviousness to domestic upheavals on the Continent.  But it also had the benefit of steady leaders pursuing an unsentimental commitment to the national interest. Castlereagh's successors did not understand the Continent as well as he had, but they had a surer grasp of what constituted the essential British national interest and pursued it with extraordinary skill and persistence. George Canning, Castlereagh's immediate successor, lost no time in eliminating the last few ties through which Castlereagh had maintained his influence, however remote, on the European Congress system.  Canning called for a policy of \"neutrality in word and deed.\" He stated, \"Let us not, in the foolish spirit of romance, suppose that we alone could regenerate Europe.\" After becoming Foreign Secretary, he left no doubt that his guiding principle was the national interest, which, in his view, was incompatible with permanent engagement in Europe.  He believed Great Britain should reserve the right to steer its own course according to the merits of each case and guided only by its national interest; a policy which made allies either auxiliaries or irrelevant. Palmerston and later Sir Edward Grey echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the pursuit of immediate national interest without elaborate future calculations. This pragmatic, case-by-case approach, guided by the principle of national interest, was a hallmark of British foreign policy.",

They were even more reluctant to spell out positive aims, perhaps because they liked the status quo well enough. Convinced that they would recognize the British national interest when they saw it, British leaders felt no need to elaborate it in advance. They preferred to await actual cases—a position impossible for the Continental countries to adopt because they were generating those actual cases. The British view of security was not unlike the view of American isolationists, in that Great Britain felt impervious to all but cataclysmic upheavals. But America and Great Britain differed when it came to the relationship between peace and domestic structure. British leaders did not consider the spread of representative institutions as a key to peace, nor did they feel concerned about institutions different from their own. Palmerston outlined what Great Britain would resist by force of arms: territorial encroachment by one nation upon another, as it deranged the balance of power.  However, internal constitutional changes were not considered grounds for intervention. British ministers were concerned above all with preserving their country's freedom of action, rejecting abstract cases and preemptive engagements. They insisted on freedom of action and rejected collective security, preferring \"splendid isolation\" based on their strength and the belief that any threat to them would also threaten potential allies. This policy was sustainable because it strove for no territorial gains in Europe; England could pick and choose its quarrels, intervening only to maintain equilibrium. This did not preclude temporary alliances for specific circumstances, but Great Britain remained flexible, switching sides or forming new coalitions as needed to preserve the balance of power, earning them the epithet \"Perfidious Albion.\" This pragmatic approach preserved the peace of Europe, especially as the Metternich system declined.",

They supported Greek independence when it didn't threaten their strategic interests, but later intervened to contain Russia in the Ottoman Empire. They welcomed Russia's restoration of the status quo in Hungary in 1848, yet remained non-interventionist during Italian revolts against Habsburg rule.  Their approach was relentlessly pragmatic, prioritizing the balance of power, which generally meant supporting the weaker against the stronger. This principle became so ingrained that any policy was described in terms of protecting the balance of power.  Key objectives included keeping the Low Countries out of the hands of major powers and, for much of the century, preserving Austria as a counterweight to Russia.  However, as Austria weakened, its utility diminished, leading to British indifference during its defeats by Piedmont and Prussia.  By the turn of the century, fear of Germany would dominate British policy, and Austria, as Germany's ally, became an opponent.  Russia, seen as pursuing \"universal aggression\" throughout the century, eventually became an ally due to growing German bellicosity.",

    "text": "The Concert of Europe: Great Britain, Austria, and Russia.  Great Britain maintained an extraordinary consistency of purpose. Once embarked on a particular course, it would pursue it with unrelenting tenacity and dogged reliability, which enabled Great Britain to exert a decisive influence on behalf of tranquillity in Europe. One cause of Great Britain's single-mindedness in times of crisis was the representative nature of its political institutions. Since 1700, public opinion had played an important role in British foreign policy. No other country in eighteenth-century Europe had an 'opposition' point of view with respect to foreign policy; in Great Britain, it was inherent in the System. In the eighteenth century, the Tories as a rule represented the King's foreign policy, which leaned toward intervention in Continental disputes; the Whigs, like Sir Robert Walpole, preferred to retain a measure of aloofness from quarrels on the Continent and sought greater emphasis on overseas expansion. By the nineteenth century, their roles had been reversed. The Whigs, like Palmerston, represented an activist policy, while the Tories, like Derby or Salisbury, were wary of foreign entanglements. Radicals such as Richard Cobden were allied with the Conservatives in advocating a noninterventionist British posture. Because British foreign policy grew out of open debates, the British people displayed extraordinary unity in times of war. On the other hand, so openly partisan a foreign policy made it possible – though highly unusual – for foreign policy to be reversed when a prime minister was replaced.  For instance, Great Britain's support for Turkey in the 1870s ended abruptly when Gladstone, who regarded the Turks as morally reprehensible, defeated Disraeli in the election of 1880. At all times, Great Britain treated its representative institutions as unique unto itself. Its policies on the Continent were always justified in terms of the British national interest and not ideology. Whenever Great Britain expressed sympathy for a revolution, as it did in Italy in 1848, it did so on eminently practical grounds. Thus Palmerston approvingly quoted Canning's own pragmatic adage: \"That those who have checked improvement because it is innovation, will one day or other be compelled to accept innovation when it has ceased to be improvement.\" But this was advice based on experience, not a call for the dissemination of British values or institutions. Throughout the nineteenth century, Great Britain judged other countries by their foreign policies and, but for a brief Gladstonian interlude, remained indifferent to their domestic structures. Though Great Britain and America shared a certain aloofness from day-to-day involvement in international affairs, Great Britain justified its own version of isolationism on dramatically different grounds. America proclaimed its democratic institutions as an example for the rest of the world; Great Britain treated its parliamentary institutions as devoid of relevance to other societies. America came to believe that the spread of democracy would ensure peace; indeed, that a reliable peace could be achieved in no other way. Great Britain might prefer a particular domestic structure but would run no risks on its behalf. In 1848, Palmerston subordinated Great Britain's historic misgivings about the overthrow of the French monarchy and the emergence of a new Bonaparte by invoking this practical rule of British statecraft: \"The invariable principle on which England acts is to acknowledge as the organ of every nation that organ which each nation may deliberately choose to have.\" Palmerston was the principal architect of Great Britain's foreign policy for nearly thirty years.",

    "text": "In 1841, Metternich analyzed Palmerston's pragmatic style with cynical admiration: \"...what does Lord Palmerston then want? He wants to make France feel the power of England; by proving to her that the Egyptian affair will only finish as he may wish; and without France having any right to take a hand. He wants to prove to the two German powers that he does not need them, that Russia's help suffices for England. He wants to keep Russia in check and drag her in his train by her permanent anxiety of seeing England draw near to France again.\" It was not an inaccurate description of what Great Britain understood by the balance of power. In the end, it enabled Great Britain to traverse the century with only one relatively short war with another major power – the Crimean War. Although it was far from anyone's intent when the war started, it was, however, precisely the Crimean War which led to the collapse of the Metternich order, forged so painstakingly at the Congress of Vienna. The disintegration of unity among the three Eastern monarchs removed the moral element of moderation from European diplomacy. Fifteen years of turmoil followed before a new and much more precarious stability emerged. Two Revolutionaries: Napoleon III and Bismarck. The collapse of the Metternich system in the wake of the Crimean War produced nearly two decades of conflict: the war of Piedmont and France against Austria of 1859, the war over Schleswig-Holstein of 1864, the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Out of this turmoil, a new balance of power emerged in Europe. France, which had participated in three of the wars and encouraged the others, lost its position of predominance to Germany. Even more importantly, the moral restraints of the Metternich system disappeared. This upheaval became symbolized by the use of a new term for unrestrained balance-of-power policy: the German word Realpolitik replaced the French term raison d'etat without, however, changing its meaning. The new European order was the handiwork of two rather unlikely collaborators who eventually became arch-adversaries—Emperor Napoleon III and Otto von Bismarck. These two men ignored Metternich's old pieties: that in the interest of stability the legitimate crowned heads of the states of Europe had to be preserved, that national and liberal movements had to be suppressed, and that, above all, relations among states had to be determined by consensus among like-minded rulers. They based their policy on Realpolitik – the notion that relations among states are determined by raw power and that the mighty will prevail.",

    "text": "In the early nineteenth century, Paris was still a medieval city with narrow, winding streets. Napoleon III provided his close adviser, Baron Haussmann, with the authority and the budget to create the modern city of broad boulevards, great buildings, and sweeping vistas. The purpose of the broad avenues was to provide a clear field of fire to discourage revolutions, but this does not detract from the magnificence and permanence of the achievement. Foreign policy was Napoleon's passion, but he was torn by conflicting emotions. He realized he would never be able to fulfill his quest for legitimacy because a monarch's legitimacy is a birthright that cannot be conferred. He also did not want to go down in history as a legitimist. He had been an Italian Carbonari (independence fighter) and considered himself a defender of national self-determination. At the same time, he was averse to running risks.\nNapoleon's ultimate goal was to abrogate the territorial clauses of the Vienna settlement and to alter the state system on which it had been based. But he never understood that achieving his goal would also result in a unified Germany, which would forever end French aspirations to dominate Central Europe. The erratic nature of his policy was a reflection of his personal ambivalence. Distrustful of his 'brother' monarchs, Napoleon was driven to dependence on public opinion, and his policy fluctuated with his assessment of what was needed to sustain his popularity. In 1857, Baron Hubner wrote to the Austrian Emperor: “In his [Napoleon's] eyes foreign policy is only an instrument he uses to secure his rule in France, to legitimize his throne, to found his dynasty. He would not shrink from any means, from any combination which suited itself to making him popular at home.” In the process, Napoleon made himself the prisoner of crises he had himself engineered because he lacked the inner compass to keep him on course. Time and again, he would encourage a crisis—now in Italy, now in Poland, later in Germany—only to recoil before its ultimate consequences. He possessed his uncle's ambition but not his nerve, genius, or raw power. He supported Italian nationalism as long as it was confined to Northern Italy and advocated Polish independence as long as it involved no risk of war. As for Germany, he simply did not know on which side to place his bet. Having expected a protracted struggle between Austria and Prussia, Napoleon made himself ridiculous by asking Prussia, the victor, to compensate him after the event for his own inability to discern the winner.",

    "text": "What most suited Napoleon's style was a European Congress to redraw the map of Europe, where he might shine at minimum risk. He had no clear idea of how he wanted the borders altered. No other Great Power was willing to arrange such a forum to accommodate his domestic needs. No nation agrees to redraw its borders—especially to its own disadvantage—unless there is an overwhelming necessity to do so. The only Congress at which Napoleon presided—the Congress of Paris, which ended the Crimean War—did not redraw the map of Europe; it merely ratified what had been achieved in the war. Russia was forbidden to maintain a navy in the Black Sea, thus deprived of a defensive capability against another British assault. Russia was also forced to return Bessarabia and the territory of Kars to Turkey. Additionally, the Tsar was compelled to renounce his claim to be the Protector of the Ottoman Christians, the immediate cause of the war. The Congress of Paris symbolized the splintering of the Holy Alliance, but no participant was prepared to undertake the revision of the map of Europe.\nNapoleon never succeeded in assembling another congress to redraw the map of Europe for one basic reason, which the British ambassador, Lord Clarendon, pointed out to him: a country that seeks great changes and lacks the willingness to run great risks dooms itself to futility. “I see that the idea of a European Congress is germinating in the Emperor's mind, and with it the arrondissement of the French frontier, the abolition of obsolete Treaties, and other remaniements as may be necessary. I improvised a longish catalogue of dangers and difficulties that such a Congress would entail, unless its decisions were unanimous, which was not probable; or one or two of the strongest Powers were to go to war for what they wanted.” Palmerston once summed up Napoleon's statesmanship by saying: “Ideas proliferated in his head like rabbits in a hutch.” The trouble was that these ideas did not relate to any overriding concept.\nIn the disarray of the collapsing Metternich system, France had two strategic options. It could pursue the policy of Richelieu and strive to keep Central Europe divided. This option would have required Napoleon to subordinate his revolutionary convictions, at least within Germany, in favor of the existing legitimate rulers, who were eager to maintain the fragmentation of Central Europe. Or Napoleon could have put himself at the head of a republican crusade, as his uncle had done, in the expectation that France would thereby gain the gratitude of the nationalists and perhaps even the political leadership of Europe.",

    "text": "Unfortunately for France, Napoleon pursued both strategies simultaneously. An advocate of national self-determination, he seemed oblivious to the geopolitical risk this position posed for France in Central Europe. He supported the Polish Revolution but recoiled when confronted by its consequences. He opposed the Vienna settlement as an affront to France without understanding—until it was too late—that the Vienna world order was the best available security guarantee for France as well. The German Confederation was designed to act as a unit only against an overwhelming external danger. Its component states were explicitly forbidden to join together for offensive purposes and would never have been able to agree on an offensive strategy—as shown by the fact that the subject had never even been broached in the half-century of the Confederation's existence. France's Rhine frontier, inviolable so long as the Vienna settlement was intact, would not prove to be secure for a century after the collapse of the Confederation, which Napoleon's policy made possible. Napoleon never grasped this element of French security. As late as the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866—the conflict which ended the Confederation—he wrote to the Austrian Emperor: “I must confess that it was not without a certain satisfaction that I witnessed the dissolution of the German Confederation organized mainly against France.” The Habsburg responded far more perceptively: “The German Confederation, organized with purely defensive motives, had never, during the half-century of its existence, given its neighbors cause for alarm.” The alternative to the German Confederation was not Richelieu's fragmented Central Europe but a unified Germany with a population exceeding that of France and an industrial capacity soon to overshadow it. By attacking the Vienna settlement, Napoleon was transforming a defensive obstacle into a potential offensive threat to French security.\nA statesman's test is whether he can discern from the swirl of tactical decisions the true long-term interests of his country and devise an appropriate strategy for achieving them. Napoleon could have basked in the acclaim given to his clever tactics during the Crimean War (which were helped along by Austrian shortsightedness) and in the increased diplomatic options now opening before him. France's key interest would have been to stay close to Austria and Great Britain, the two countries most likely to sustain the territorial settlement of Central Europe. The Emperor's policy, however, was largely idiosyncratic and driven by his mercurial nature. As a Bonaparte, he never felt comfortable cooperating with Austria, whatever raison d'état might dictate. In 1858, Napoleon told a Piedmontese diplomat: “Austria is a cabinet for whom I have always felt, and still feel, the most lively repugnance.” His penchant for revolutionary projects caused him to go to war with Austria over Italy in 1859. Napoleon alienated Great Britain by annexing Savoy and Nice in the aftermath of the war, as well as by his repeated proposals for a European Congress to redraw the frontiers of Europe. To complete his isolation, Napoleon sacrificed his option of allying France with Russia by supporting the Polish Revolution in 1863. Having brought European diplomacy to a state of flux under the banner of national self-determination, Napoleon now suddenly found himself alone when, out of the turmoil he had done so much to cause, a German nation materialized to the end of French primacy in Europe.",

    "text": "The Emperor made his post-Crimean move in Italy in 1859, three years after the Congress of Paris. Nobody had expected Napoleon to return to the vocation of his youth in seeking to liberate Northern Italy from Austrian rule. France would have had little to gain from such an adventure. If it succeeded, it would create a state in a much stronger position to block the traditional French invasion route; if it failed, the humiliation would be compounded by the vagueness of the objective. And whether it succeeded or failed, French armies in Italy would disquiet Europe. For all these reasons, the British Ambassador, Lord Henry Cowley, was convinced that a French war in Italy was beyond all probability. “It is not in his interests to fight a war,” Hubner reported Cowley as saying. “The alliance with England, although shaken for a moment, and still quite dormant, remains the basis of Napoleon III's policy.” Some three decades later, Hubner was to offer these reflections: “We could scarcely comprehend that this man, having reached the pinnacle of honor, unless he was mad, or afflicted with the madness of gamblers, seriously could consider, having no understandable motive, joining in another adventure.”\nYet Napoleon surprised all the diplomats with the exception of his ultimate nemesis, Bismarck, who had predicted a French war against Austria and indeed hoped for it as a means of weakening Austria's position in Germany. In July 1858, Napoleon concluded a secret understanding with Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Prime Minister of Piedmont (Sardinia), the strongest Italian state, to cooperate in a war against Austria. It was a purely Machiavellian move in which Cavour would unify Northern Italy and Napoleon would receive as his reward Nice and Savoy from Piedmont. By 1859, a suitable pretext had been found: Austria, always short of steady nerves, permitted itself to be provoked by Piedmontese harassment into declaring war. Napoleon let it be known that this amounted to a declaration of war against France, and launched his armies into Italy.\nOddly enough, in Napoleon's time, when Frenchmen talked of the consolidation of nation-states as the wave of the future, they thought primarily of Italy and not of the much stronger Germany. The French had a sympathy and cultural affinity for Italy that was lacking vis-à-vis their ominous Eastern neighbor. In addition, the mighty economic boom which was to take Germany to the forefront of the European Powers was only just beginning; hence it was not obvious that Italy would be any less powerful than Germany. Prussia's cautiousness during the Crimean War strengthened Napoleon's view that Prussia was the weakest of the Great Powers and incapable of strong action without Russian support. Thus, in Napoleon's mind, an Italian war weakening Austria would reduce the power of France's most dangerous German opponent and enhance France's significance in Italy—an egregious misjudgment on both counts. Napoleon kept open two contradictory options. In the better case, Napoleon could play European statesman: Northern Italy would throw off the Austrian yoke, and the European Powers would gather at a congress under Napoleon's sponsorship and agree to the large-scale territorial revisions he had failed to achieve at the Congress of Paris. In the worse case, the war would reach a stalemate and Napoleon would play the Machiavellian manipulator of raison d'état, gaining some advantage from Austria at Piedmont's expense in return for ending the war. Napoleon pursued the two objectives simultaneously. French armies were victorious at Magenta and Solferino but unleashed such a tide of anti-French sentiment in Germany that, for a time, it appeared as if the smaller German states, fearing a new Napoleonic onslaught, would force Prussia to intervene on Austria's side. Jolted by this first sign of German nationalism and shaken by his visit to the battlefield at Solferino, Napoleon concluded an armistice with Austria at Villafranca on July 11, 1859, without informing his Piedmontese allies. Not only had Napoleon failed to achieve either of his objectives, he had seriously weakened his country's position in the international arena. Henceforth, the Italian nationalists would carry the principles he had espoused to lengths he had never envisioned. Napoleon's goal of establishing a medium-sized satellite in an Italy divided into perhaps five states annoyed Piedmont, which was not about to abandon its national vocation. Austria remained as adamant about holding on to Venetia as Napoleon was about returning it to Italy, creating another insoluble dispute involving no conceivable French interest. Great Britain interpreted the annexation of Savoy and Nice as the beginning of another period of Napoleonic conquests and refused all French initiatives for Napoleon's favorite obsession of holding a European congress. And all the while, German nationalists saw in Europe's turmoil a window of opportunity to advance their own hopes for national unity.",

Frivolity is a costly indulgence for a statesman; and its must eventually be Actions to the mood of the moment and unre- lated to any overall strategy cannot be sustained indefinitely.

Yet Europe was now in disarray largely due to the actions of the French Emperor: Russia was not prepared to antagonize the two countries which had stood aside while it quelled the Polish revolt: Great Britain was uneasy about the attack on Denmark but would need a Continental ally to intervene, and France, its only feasible partner; in- spired little confidence History, ideology, and raison detat should have warned Napoleon that events would soon develop a momentum of their own: Yet he wavered between upholding the principles of traditional French foreign policy, which was designed to keep Germany divided, and supporting the principle of nationality, which had been the inspiration of his youth:",

The responsibility of statesmen, however, is to resolve complexity rather than to contemplate it: For leaders unable to choose among their alterna- tives, circumspection becomes an alibi for inaction: Napoleon had be- come convinced of the wisdom of inaction; enabling Prussia and Austria to settle the future of the Elbe duchies. They detached Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark and occupied them jointly while the rest of Europe stood by_~a solution which would have been unthinkable under the Metternich system. France's nightmare of German unity was approaching, something Napoleon had been dodging for a decade: Bismarck was not about t0 share the leadership of Germany He turned the joint war for Schleswig-Holstein into another of Austria's seemingly endless series of blunders, which for a decade marked the progressive erosion of its position aS a Great Power: The reason these errors occurred was always the same~Austria'$ appeasing a self-proclaimed opponent by offering to cooperate with it The strategy of appeasement worked no better with Prussia than it had a decade earlier; during the Crimean War, vis-a-vis France. Far from buying Austria's release from Prussian pres- sures, the joint victory over Denmark provided a new and highly disad- vantageous forum for harassment: Austria was now left to administer the Elbe duchies with a Prussian ally whose Prime Minister; Bismarck; was determined to use the Opportunity to bring about a long-desired show- down in a territory hundreds of miles from Austrian soil and adjoining Prussia's principal possessions: As the tension mounted, Napoleon's ambivalence came into sharper focus. He dreaded German unification but was sympathetic to German nationalism and dithered about solving that insoluble dilemma: He con- sidered Prussia the most genuinely national German state, writing in 1860 that: Prussia personifies the German nationality, religious reform; commer- cial progress, liberal constitutionalism: It is the largest of the truly German monarchies; it has more freedom of conscience, more enlight- enment; grants more political rights, than most other German states. Bismarck would have subscribed to every word. However; for Bismarck; Napoleon's affirmation of Prussia's unique pOSition was the key to Prus- sia'$ eventual triumph: In the end, Napoleon's avowed admiration for Prussia amounted to one more alibi for doing nothing; Rationalizing indecision as So much clever maneuvering, Napoleon in fact encouraged an Austro-Prussian war, partly because he was convinced that Prussia would lose. He told Alexandre Walewski; his erstwhile Foreign Minister, in December 1865: \"Believe me dear friend, war between Austria and Prussia constitutes one of those unhoped-for eventualities which can bring us more than one advantage.\"",

    "text": "Curiously, in the course of Napoleon's encouragement of the drift toward war; he never seemed to have asked himself why Bismarck was S0 determined on war if Prussia was SO likely to be defeated. Four months before the Austro-Prussian War started, Napoleon went beyond the tacit to the explicit In effect urging war, he told the Prussian Ambassador to Paris, Count von der Goltz, in February 1866: I ask you to tell the King [of Prussia] that he can always count on my amity: In case of a conflict between Prussia and Austria; I will maintain the most absolute neutrality: 1 desire the reunion of the Duchies [Schleswig-Holstein] with Prussia: Should the struggle take on di- mensions that one can t yet foresee; I am convinced that I could always reach an understanding with Prussia, whose interests in a great number of questions are identical with those of France, while I see no turf on which I could agree with Austria. What did Napoleon really want? Was he convinced of the likelihood of a stalemate that would enhance his bargaining position? He was clearly hoping for some Prussian concessions in exchange for his neutrality: Bismarck understood this game: If Napoleon remained neutral, he of- fered to take a benevolent attitude to French seizure of Belgium, which would have had the additional benefit of embroiling France with Great Britain: Napoleon probably did not take this offer too seriously Since he expected Prussia to lose; his moves were designed more to keep Prussia On its course t0 war than to bargain for benefits. Some years later, Count Armand; the French Foreign Minister's top assistant; admitted: The only worry that we had at the Foreign Office was that Prussia would be crushed and humiliated to tOo great an extent; and we were determined to prevent this through timely intervention: The Emperor wanted to let Prussia be defeated; then to intervene and to construct Germany according to his fantasies. What Napoleon had in mind was an updating of Richelieu's machinations. Prussia was expected to offer France compensation in the West for extri- cation from its defeat; Venetia would be given to Italy, and a new German arrangement would result in the creation of a North German Confedera- tion under Prussian auspices and a South German grouping supported by France and Austria. The Only thing wrong with this scheme was that; whereas the Cardinal knew how to judge the relation of forces and was willing to fight for his judgments, Napoleon was prepared to do neither; Napoleon procrastinated, hoping for a turn of events that would pre- sent him with his deepest desires at no risk The device he used was his standard ploy of calling for a European congress to avert the threat of war: The reaction by now was equally standard The other powers, fearful of Napoleon's designs, refused to attend: Wherever he turned, his di- lemma awaited him: he could defend the status quo by abandoning his support of the nationality principle; Or he could encourage revisionism and nationalism and in the process jeopardize the national interests of France as had been historically conceived Napoleon sought refuge in hinting to Prussia about 'compensations without specifying what they were; which convinced Bismarck that French neutrality was a question of price, not principle.",

Great Britain made its attendance at the Congress dependent On a French agreement t0 the status quo. Instead of seizing upon this conse- cration of the German arrangements which owed so much to French leadership and to which France owed its security, Napoleon backed off;, insisting that; 'to maintain the peace, it is necessary to take into account the national passions and requirements'. In short; Napoleon was willing to risk an Austro-Prussian war and a unified Germany in order to gain vague spoils in Italy, which affected no real French national interests, and for prior gains in Western Europe, which he was reluctant to specify: But in Bismarck he was up against a master who insisted on the power of reali- ties, and who exploited for his own ends the cosmetic maneuvers at which Napoleon excelled There were French leaders who understood the risks Napoleon was running, and who realized that the So-called compensation he was aiming for involved no basic French interest: In a brilliant speech on May 3, 1866, Adolphe Thiers; a staunch republican opponent of Napoleon and later President of France, predicted correctly that Prussia was likely to emerge as the dominant force in Germany: One will see a return of the Empire of Charles V, which formerly resided in Vienna, and now will reside in Berlin which will be close to our border; and will apply pressure to it You have a right to resist this policy in the name of the interest of France; for France is too important for such a revolution not to menace her gravely: And when she had struggled for two centuries to destroy this colossus; is she prepared to watch as it re-establishes itself before her eyes?! Thiers argued that; in place of Napoleon's vague musings, France should adopt a clear policy of opposition to Prussia and invoke as a pretext the defense of the independence of the German states-_the old Richelieu formula. France; he claimed, had the power to resist German unification \"first in the name of the independence of the German states second, in the name of her own independence, and, finally in the name of the European balance, which is the interest of all, the interest of universal society.

    "text": "Bismarck made it clear that Prussia, once a linchpin of the Holy Alliance, had abandoned legitimacy as the guiding principle of the international order. The North German states which retained their independence were incorporated into Bismarck's new creation, the North German Confederation, subject to Prussian leadership in everything from trade legislation to foreign policy. The South German states of Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg were allowed to retain their independence at the price of treaties with Prussia that brought their armies under Prussian military leadership in the event of a war with an outside power. The unification of Germany was now just one crisis away.\n\nNapoleon III had maneuvered his country into a dead end from which extrication proved impossible. Too late, he tried for an alliance with Austria, which he had expelled from Italy by military action and from Germany by neutrality. But Austria had lost interest in recovering either position, preferring to concentrate first on rebuilding its empire as a dual monarchy based in Vienna and Budapest, and then on its possessions in the Balkans. Great Britain was put off by France's designs on Luxembourg and Belgium; and Russia never forgave Napoleon his conduct over Poland. France was now obliged to tend to the collapse of its historic European pre-eminence all by itself. The more hopeless its position, the more Napoleon sought to recoup it by some brilliant move, like a gambler who doubles his bet after each loss.\n\nBismarck had encouraged Napoleon's neutrality in the Austro-Prussian War by dangling before him the prospect of territorial acquisitions—first in Belgium, then in Luxembourg. These prospects vanished whenever Napoleon tried to snatch them because Napoleon wanted his 'compensation' handed to him; and because Bismarck saw no reason to run risks when he had already harvested the fruits of Napoleon's indecisiveness. Humiliated by these demonstrations of impotence, and above all by the increasingly obvious tilt of the European balance of power against France, Napoleon sought to compensate for his miscalculation that Austria would win the Austro-Prussian War by making an issue of the succession to the Spanish throne, which had become vacant. He demanded an assurance from the Prussian King that no Hohenzollern prince (the Prussian dynasty) would seek the throne. It was another empty gesture capable of producing at best a prestige success without any relevance to the power relationships in Central Europe. Nobody ever outmaneuvered Bismarck in fluid diplomacy. In one of his craftier moves, Bismarck used Napoleon's posturing to lure him into declaring war on Prussia in 1870. The French demand that the Prussian King renounce any member of his family ever seeking the Spanish crown was indeed provocative. But the stately old King William, rather than losing his temper, patiently and correctly refused the French ambassador sent to secure the pledge. The ambassador sent his account of the affair to Bismarck, who edited his telegram—taking out any language conveying the patience and propriety with which the King had in fact treated the French ambassador. Bismarck, well ahead of his time, then resorted to a technique which subsequent statesmen developed into an art form: he leaked the so-called Ems Dispatch to the press. The edited version of the King's telegram looked like a royal snub of France. Outraged, the French public demanded war, which Napoleon gave them.",

    "text": "Prussia won quickly and decisively with the assistance of all the other German states. The road now clear for completing the unification of Germany, proclaimed rather tactlessly by the Prussian leadership on January 18, 1871, in the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles. Napoleon had wrought the revolution which he had sought, though its consequences were the opposite of what he had intended. The map of Europe had indeed been redrawn, but the new arrangement had irreparably weakened France's influence without bringing Napoleon the renown he craved. Napoleon had encouraged revolution without understanding its likely outcome. Unable to assess the relationship of forces and to enlist it in fulfilling his long-term goals, Napoleon failed this test. His foreign policy collapsed not because he lacked ideas but because he was unable to establish any order among his multitude of aspirations or any relationship between them and the reality emerging all around him. Questing for publicity, Napoleon never had a single line of policy to guide him. Instead, he was driven by a web of objectives, some of them quite contradictory. When he confronted the crucial crisis of his career, the various impulses canceled each other out.\n\nNapoleon saw the Metternich system as humiliating to France and as a constraint upon its ambitions. He was successful in disrupting the Holy Alliance by driving a wedge between Austria and Russia during the Crimean War. But he did not know what to do with his triumph. From 1853 to 1871 relative chaos prevailed as the European order was reorganized. When this period ended, Germany emerged as the strongest power on the Continent. Legitimacy—the principle of the unity of conservative rulers that had mitigated the harshness of the balance-of-power system during the Metternich years—turned into an empty slogan. Napoleon himself had contributed to all these developments. Overestimating France's strength, he had encouraged every upheaval, convinced that he could turn it to France's benefit. In the end, international politics came to be based on raw power. And in such a world, there was an inherent gap between France's image of itself as the dominant nation of Europe and its capacity to live up to it—a gap that has blighted French policy to this day. During Napoleon's reign, this was evidenced by the Emperor's inability to implement his endless proposals for holding a European congress to revise the map of Europe. Napoleon called for a congress after the Crimean War in 1856, before the Italian War in 1859, during the Polish revolt in 1863, during the Danish War in 1864, and before the Austro-Prussian War in 1866—always seeking to gain at the conference table the revision of frontiers which he never precisely defined and for which he was not prepared to run the risk of war. Napoleon's problem was that he was not strong enough to insist, and that his schemes were too radical to command consensus.",

His policy resembled nonalignment, selling Prussia's cooperation in a perceived seller's market. He aimed to maintain freedom of action, exploiting relationships as they arose, with France requiring the most careful attention.  This implied a willingness to discard ideology, cooperating with any country that advanced Prussian interests, echoing Richelieu's prioritization of French interests over religious affiliations.  Similarly, Bismarck, though personally conservative, diverged from conservative mentors when their legitimist principles hindered Prussia's actions.\nThis disagreement surfaced in 1856 when Bismarck, then ambassador to the German Confederation, advocated for a more open approach to Napoleon III, whom Prussian conservatives saw as a usurper.  This suggestion outraged his conservative supporters, mirroring the reaction to Richelieu's prioritizing of raison d'état over religion and, later, to Nixon's détente with the Soviet Union. Conservatives viewed Napoleon III as a threat of French expansionism and a symbol of the French Revolution.",

Bismarck's break with conservatives mirrored Richelieu's clash with clerical critics: Bismarck prioritized power, while conservatives valued legitimacy. Bismarck believed power implied self-limitation, while conservatives saw moral principles as the only limit to power.  This conflict led to an exchange of letters between Bismarck and his mentor, Gerlach. Bismarck argued for a pragmatic approach to Austria, even suggesting exploiting opportunities for a 'coup de grace.' Gerlach, upholding conservative principles, advocated restoring the Holy Alliance to isolate France.  He found Bismarck's proposal to invite Napoleon III to Prussian maneuvers incomprehensible, viewing Napoleon as Prussia's 'natural enemy.'

Echoing Richelieu, he separated personal beliefs from Realpolitik, asserting that states are judged by what works. He didn't reject Gerlach's morals, but deemed them irrelevant to statesmanship.

    "text": "…fact; it reflected no previous significant strain of German thinking, having come into being as a diplomatic compact among German sovereigns rather than as an expression of 'popular will.' Its legitimacy derived from Prussia's power, not from the principle of national self-determination. Though Bismarck achieved what he had set out to do, the very magnitude of his triumph mortgaged the future of Germany and, indeed, of the European world order. To be sure, he was as moderate in concluding his wars as he had been ruthless in preparing them. As soon as Germany had achieved the borders he considered vital to its security, Bismarck conducted a prudent and stabilizing foreign policy. For two decades, he maneuvered Europe's commitments and interests in masterly fashion on the basis of Realpolitik and to the benefit of the peace of Europe.\n\nBut, once called forth, the spirits of power refused to be banished by juggling acts, however spectacular. Or restrained these were. Germany had been unified as the result of a diplomacy presupposing infinite adaptability; yet the very success of that policy removed all flexibility from the international system. There were now fewer participants. And when the number of players declines, the capacity to make adjustments diminishes. The new international system contained both fewer and weightier components, making it difficult to negotiate a generally acceptable balance or to sustain it without constant tests of strength. These structural problems were magnified by the scope of Prussia's victory in the Franco-Prussian War and by the nature of the peace that concluded it. The German annexation of Alsace-Lorraine produced irreconcilable French antagonism, which eliminated any German diplomatic option toward France. In the 1850s, Bismarck had considered the French option so essential that he had sacrificed his friendship with Gerlach to promote it. After the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, French enmity grew into the 'organic fault of our nature' against which Bismarck had warned so insistently. And it precluded the policy of his Master Dispatch—of remaining aloof until other powers were already committed, then selling Prussia's support to whoever offered it the most. The German Confederation had succeeded in acting as a unit only in the face of threats so overwhelming that they had obliterated the rivalries among the various states; and joint offensive action was structurally impossible. The tenuousness of these arrangements was indeed one of the reasons Bismarck had insisted that German unification be organized under Prussian leadership. But he also paid a price for the new arrangement. Once Germany was transformed from a potential victim of aggression to a threat to the European equilibrium, the remote contingency of the other states of Europe uniting against Germany became a real possibility. And that nightmare in turn drove a German policy that was soon to split Europe into two hostile camps.\n\nThe European statesman who grasped the impact of German unification most quickly was Benjamin Disraeli, who was about to become British Prime Minister. In 1871, he said the following about the Franco-Prussian War: 'The war represents the German revolution, a greater political event than the French Revolution of the last century. There is not a diplomatic tradition which has not been swept away. You have a new world. The balance of power has been entirely destroyed.'",

    "text": "While Bismarck was at the helm, these dilemmas were obscured by his intricate and subtle diplomacy. Yet in the long term, the very complexity of Bismarck’s arrangements doomed them. Disraeli was right on the mark. Bismarck had recast the map of Europe and the pattern of international relations, but in the end he was not able to establish a design his successors could follow. Once the novelty of Bismarck’s tactics had worn off, his successors and competitors sought safety in multiplying arms as a way of reducing their reliance on the baffling intangibles of diplomacy. The Iron Chancellor’s inability to institutionalize his policies forced Germany onto a diplomatic treadmill it could only escape, first by an arms race, and then by war.\n\nIn his domestic policy as well, Bismarck was unable to establish a design his successors could follow. Bismarck, a solitary figure in his lifetime, was even less understood after he passed from the scene and attained mythic proportions. His compatriots remembered the three wars which had achieved German unity but forgot the painstaking preparations that had made them possible, and the moderation required to reap their fruits. They had seen displays of power but without discerning the subtle analysis on which these had been based. The constitution which Bismarck had designed for Germany compounded these tendencies. Though based on the first universal male suffrage in Europe, the Parliament (the Reichstag) did not control the government, which was appointed by the Emperor and could only be removed by him. The Chancellor was closer to both the Emperor and the Reichstag than each was to the other. Therefore, within limits, Bismarck could play Germany’s domestic institutions off against each other, much as he did the other states in his foreign policy. None of Bismarck’s successors possessed the skill or the daring to do so. The result was that nationalism unleavened by democracy turned increasingly chauvinistic, while democracy without responsibility grew sterile.\n\nThe essence of Bismarck’s life was perhaps best expressed by the Iron Chancellor himself in a letter he had written to his then still future wife: 'That which is imposing here on earth has always something of the quality of the fallen angel who is beautiful but without peace, in his conceptions and exertions but without success, proud and lonely.'\n\nThe two revolutionaries who stood at the beginning of the contemporary European state system incarnated many of the dilemmas of the modern period. Napoleon, the reluctant revolutionary, represented the trend of gearing policy to public relations. Bismarck, the conservative revolutionary, reflected the tendency to identify policy with the analysis of power. Napoleon had revolutionary ideas but recoiled before their implications. Having spent his youth in what the twentieth century would call protest, he never bridged the gap between the formulation of an idea and its implementation. Insecure about his purposes and indeed his legitimacy, he relied on public opinion to bridge that gap. Napoleon conducted his foreign policy in the style of modern political leaders who measure their success by the reaction of the television evening news. Like them, Napoleon made himself a prisoner of the purely tactical, focusing on short-term objectives and immediate results, seeking to impress his public by magnifying the pressures he had set out to create. In the process, he confused foreign policy with the moves of a conjurer. For in the end, it is reality, not publicity, that determines whether a leader has made a difference.",

    "text": "But since, of the five Great Powers—England, France, Russia, Austria, and Germany—France was hostile; Great Britain unavailable due to its policy of “splendid isolation;” and Russia ambivalent because of its conflict with Austria, Germany needed an alliance with both Russia and Austria for such a grouping of three. Only a statesman possessed of Bismarck’s willpower and skill could even have conceived such a precarious balancing act: Thus, the relationship between Germany and Russia became the key to the peace of Europe. Once Russia entered the international arena, it established a dominant position with astonishing speed. At the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Russia had not yet been deemed sufficiently important to be represented. From 1750 onward, however, Russia became an active participant in every significant European war. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Russia was already inspiring a vague uneasiness in Western observers. In 1762, the French chargé d’affaires in St. Petersburg reported: “If Russian ambition is not checked, its effects may be fatal to the neighboring powers. I know that the degree of Russian power should not be measured by its expanse and that its domination of eastern territories is more an imposing phantom than a source of real strength. But I also suspect that a nation which is capable of braving the intemperance of the seasons better than any other because of the rigor of its native climate, which is accustomed to servile obedience, which needs little to live and is therefore able to wage war at little cost—such a nation, I suspect, is likely to conquer.” By the time the Congress of Vienna took place, Russia was arguably the most powerful country on the Continent. By the middle of the twentieth century, it had achieved the rank of one of only two global superpowers before imploding, nearly forty years later, losing many of its vast gains of the previous two centuries in a matter of months. The absolute nature of the tsar’s power enabled Russia’s rulers to conduct foreign policy both arbitrarily and idiosyncratically. In the space of six years, between 1756 and 1762, Russia entered the Seven Years’ War on the side of Austria and invaded Prussia, switched to Prussia’s side at the death of Empress Elizabeth in January 1762, and then withdrew into neutrality when Catherine the Great overthrew her husband in June 1762. Fifty years later, Metternich would point out that Tsar Alexander I had never held a single set of beliefs for longer than five years. Metternich’s adviser, Friedrich von Gentz, described the position of the Tsar as follows: “None of the obstacles that restrain and thwart the other sovereigns—divided authority, constitutional forms, public opinion, etc.—exists for the Emperor of Russia. What he dreams of at night he can carry out in the morning.” Paradox was Russia’s most distinguishing feature. Constantly at war and expanding in every direction, it nevertheless considered itself permanently threatened. The more polyglot the empire became, the more vulnerable Russia felt, partly because of its need to isolate the various nationalities from their neighbors. To sustain their rule and to surmount the tensions among the empire’s various populations, all of Russia’s rulers invoked the myth of some vast, foreign threat, which, in time, turned into another of the self-fulfilling prophecies that doomed the stability of Europe. As Russia expanded from the area around Moscow toward the center of Europe, the shores of the Pacific, and into Central Asia, its quest for security evolved into expansion for its own sake. The Russian historian Vasili Kliuchevsky described the process as follows: “These wars, defensive in their origin, imperceptibly and unintentionally on the part of the Muscovite politicians became wars of aggression—a direct continuation of the unifying policy of the old [pre-Romanov] dynasty, a struggle for Russian territory that had never belonged to the Muscovite state.”",

    "text": "Cancer of the European equilibrium: Even now, of all the major European countries, only Great Britain was in a position to conduct a balance-of-power diplomacy unfettered by irreconcilable animosity toward some other power. But Great Britain had grown confused as to what constituted the central threat; and would not regain its bearings for several decades. The balance of power of the Vienna system, with which Great Britain was familiar, had been radically altered. Unified Germany was achieving the strength to dominate Europe all by itself--an occurrence which Great Britain had always resisted in the past when it came about by conquest. However, most British leaders, Disraeli excepted, saw no reason to oppose a process of national consolidation in Central Europe, which British statesmen had welcomed for decades, especially when its culmination occurred as the result of a war in which France had been technically the aggressor. Ever since Canning had distanced Great Britain from Metternich's system forty years earlier, Great Britain's policy of splendid isolation had enabled it to play the role of protector of the equilibrium largely because no single country was capable of dominating the Continent by itself. After unification, Germany progressively acquired that capacity. And, confusingly, it did so by means of developing its own national territory and not by conquest. It was Great Britain's style to intervene only when the balance of power was actually under attack and not against the prospect of attack. Since it took decades for the German threat to the European equilibrium to become explicit, Great Britain's foreign policy concerns for the rest of the century were focused on France, whose colonial ambitions clashed with those of Great Britain, especially in Egypt, and on Russia's advance toward the Straits, Persia, India, and later toward China. All of these were colonial issues. In regard to European diplomacy, which produced the crises and wars of the twentieth century, Great Britain continued to practice its policy of splendid isolation. Bismarck was therefore the dominant figure of European diplomacy until he was dismissed from office in 1890. He wanted peace for the newly created German Empire and sought no confrontation with any other nation. But in the absence of moral bonds among the European states, he faced a Herculean task. He was obliged to keep both Russia and Austria out of the camp of his French enemy. This required preventing Austrian challenges to legitimate Russian objectives and keeping Russia from undermining the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He needed good relations with Russia without antagonizing Great Britain, which was keeping a wary eye on Russian designs on Constantinople and India. Even a genius like Bismarck could not have performed such a precarious balancing act indefinitely; the intensifying strains on the international system were becoming less and less manageable. Nevertheless, for the nearly twenty years that Bismarck led Germany, he practiced the Realpolitik he had preached with such moderation and subtlety that the balance of power never broke down.",

    "text": "Bismarck's goal was to give no other power—except irreconcilable France—any cause to join an alliance directed against Germany. Professing the unified Germany to be satiated and without further territorial ambitions, Bismarck sought to reassure Russia that Germany had no interest in the Balkans; the Balkans, he said, were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier. Keeping Great Britain in mind, Bismarck mounted no challenge on the Continent that might trigger a British concern for the equilibrium; and he kept Germany out of the colonial race. 'Here is Russia and here is France and here we are in the middle. That is my map of Africa,' was Bismarck’s reply to an advocate of German colonialism—a piece of advice domestic politics would later force him to modify. Reassurance was not enough, however. What Germany needed was an alliance with both Russia and Austria, improbable as that appeared at first glance. Yet Bismarck forged just such an alliance in 1873—the first so-called Three Emperors' League. Proclaiming the unity of the three conservative courts, it looked a great deal like Metternich's Holy Alliance. Had Bismarck suddenly developed an affection for the Metternich system which he had done so much to destroy? The times had changed largely as a result of Bismarck’s successes. Though Germany, Russia, and Austria pledged in true Metternich fashion to cooperate in the repression of subversive tendencies in each other's domains, a common aversion to political radicals could no longer hold the Eastern Courts together above all because each had become confident that domestic upheavals could be repressed without outside aid. Moreover, Bismarck had lost his solid legitimist credentials. Though his correspondence with Gerlach (see chapter 5) had not been made public, his underlying attitudes were common knowledge. As an advocate of Realpolitik throughout his public career, he could not suddenly make dedication to legitimacy credible. The increasingly bitter geopolitical rivalry between Russia and Austria came to transcend the unity of conservative monarchs. Each was in pursuit of the spoils of the decaying Turkish Empire. Pan-Slavism and old-fashioned expansionism were contributing to an adventurous Russian policy in the Balkans. Plain fear was producing parallel attitudes in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Thus, while on paper the German Emperor had an alliance with his fellow conservative monarchs in Russia and Austria, these two brethren were in fact at each other's throats. The challenge of how to deal with two partners who perceived each other as mortal threats was destined to torment Bismarck's alliance system for the remainder of his days. The first Three Emperors' League taught Bismarck that he could no longer control the forces he had unleashed by appealing to Austria’s and Russia's domestic principles. Henceforth, he would attempt to manipulate them by emphasizing power and self-interest.",

    "section": "The Rise of Realpolitik and the Eastern Question",
    "text": "Two events above all demonstrated that Realpolitik had become the dominant trend of the period. The first occurred in 1875 in the form of a pseudo-crisis, a contrived war scare triggered by an editorial in a leading German newspaper bearing the provocative headline “Is War Imminent?” The editorial had been placed in reaction to an increase in French military expenditures and the purchase of a large number of horses by the French military. Bismarck may well have inspired the war scare without intending to go any further; for there was no partial German mobilization or threatening troop movements. Facing down a nonexistent threat is an easy way to enhance a nation’s standing. Clever French diplomacy created the impression that Germany was planning a pre-emptive attack. The French Foreign Office put out the story that, in a conversation with the French Ambassador, the Tsar had indicated he would support France in a Franco-German conflict. Great Britain, ever sensitive to the threat of a single power dominating Europe, began to stir. Prime Minister Disraeli instructed his Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby, to approach Russian Chancellor Gorchakov with the idea of intimidating Berlin: “My own impression is that we should construct some concerted movement to preserve the peace of Europe like Pam [Lord Palmerston] did when he baffled France and expelled the Egyptians from Syria. There might be an alliance between Russia and ourselves for this special purpose; and other powers, as Austria and perhaps Italy, might be invited to accede.” That Disraeli, deeply distrustful of Russia’s imperial ambitions, could even hint at an Anglo-Russian alliance showed how seriously he took the prospect of German domination of Western Europe. The war scare subsided as quickly as it had blown up, so Disraeli’s scheme was never tested. Although Bismarck did not know the details of Disraeli’s maneuver, he was too astute not to have sensed Britain’s underlying concern. As George Kennan has demonstrated, there was far less to this crisis than the publicity made it seem. Bismarck had no intention of going to war so soon after humiliating France, though he did not object to leaving France with the impression that he might do so if pushed too far. Tsar Alexander II was not about to guarantee republican France, though he did not mind conveying to Bismarck that that option existed. Thus, Disraeli was reacting to what was still a chimera. Still, the combination of British uneasiness, French maneuvering, and Russian ambivalence convinced Bismarck that only an active policy could stave off the coalition-building which would result a generation later in the Triple Entente, aimed at Germany. The second crisis was real enough. It came in the form of yet another Balkan crisis, which demonstrated that neither philosophical nor ideological bonds could hold the Three Emperors' League together in the face of the underlying clash of national interests. Because it laid bare the conflict which would ultimately doom Bismarck’s European order and plunge Europe into World War I, it will be treated here in some detail. The Eastern Question, dormant since the Crimean War, again came to dominate the international agenda in the first series of convoluted imbroglios, which, as the century progressed, would become as stereotyped as Japanese Kabuki plays. Some almost accidental event would trigger a crisis; Russia would make threats and Great Britain would dispatch the Royal Navy. Russia would then occupy some part of the Ottoman Balkans to hold as hostage. Great Britain would threaten war. Negotiations would start, during which Russia would reduce its demands, at which precise point the whole thing would blow up.",

    "section": "The Bulgarian Crisis and the Breakdown of the Three Emperors' League",
    "text": "In 1876, the Bulgarians, who for centuries had lived under Turkish rule, rebelled and were joined by other Balkan peoples. Turkey responded with appalling brutality, and Russia, swept up by Pan-Slavic sentiments, threatened to intervene. In London, Russia’s response raised the all-too-familiar specter of Russian control of the Straits. Ever since Canning, British statesmen had observed the maxim that, if Russia controlled the Straits, it would dominate the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East, thereby threatening Great Britain’s position in Egypt. Therefore, according to British conventional wisdom, the Ottoman Empire, decrepit and inhuman as it was, had to be preserved even at the risk of war with Russia. This state of affairs presented Bismarck with a grave dilemma. A Russian advance capable of provoking a British military reaction was also likely to rouse Austria to enter the fray. And if Germany was forced to choose between Austria and Russia, Bismarck’s foreign policy would be wrecked along with the Three Emperors’ League. Whatever happened, Bismarck faced the risk of antagonizing either Austria or Russia, and of quite possibly incurring the wrath of all the parties if he adopted a neutral attitude. “We have always avoided,” Bismarck said before the Reichstag in 1878, “in the case of differences of opinion between Austria and Russia, building a majority of two against one by taking the side of one of [the] parties.” The moderation was classical Bismarck, though it also defined a mounting dilemma as the crisis unfolded. Bismarck’s first move was to attempt to tighten the bonds of the Three Emperors’ League by seeking to develop a common position. In early 1876, the Three Emperors’ League drew up the so-called Berlin Memorandum warning Turkey against continuing its repression. It seemed to imply that, with certain provisos, Russia might intervene in the Balkans on behalf of the Concert of Europe, much as Metternich’s Congresses of Verona, Laibach, and Troppau had designated some European power to carry out their decisions. But there was one enormous difference between taking such action then and now. In Metternich’s day, Castlereagh was the British Foreign Secretary and had been sympathetic to intervention by the Holy Alliance, even though Great Britain had refused to participate in it. But now Disraeli was the Prime Minister, and he interpreted the Berlin Memorandum as the first step toward dismantling the Ottoman Empire to the exclusion of Great Britain. This was too close to the European hegemony Great Britain had been opposing for centuries. Complaining to Shuvalov, the Russian Ambassador to London, Disraeli said: “England has been treated as though we were Montenegro or Bosnia.” To his frequent correspondent Lady Bradford, he wrote: “There is no balance and unless we go out of our way to act with the three Northern Powers, they can act without us which is not agreeable for a state like England.” Given the unity being displayed by St. Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna, it would have been exceedingly difficult for Great Britain to resist whatever they might agree upon. It appeared that Disraeli had no choice but to join the Northern Courts while Russia assaulted Turkey. However, in the tradition of Palmerston, Disraeli decided to flex British muscles. He moved the Royal Navy to the Eastern Mediterranean and proclaimed his pro-Turkish sentiments—guaranteeing that Turkey would prove obdurate, and forcing whatever latent differences existed in the Three Emperors’ League into the open. Never known for excessive modesty, Disraeli declared to Queen Victoria that he had broken the Three Emperors’ League. It was, he believed, “virtually extinct; as extinct as the Roman triumvirate.”",

    "text": "Adhering to convictions such as these, Disraeli was bound to oppose Russia's threat to the Ottoman Empire. In the name of the European equilibrium, he would not accept the prescriptions of the Three Emperors' League, and in the name of the British Empire, he would oppose Russia as the enforcer of a European consensus on the approaches to Constantinople. For, in the course of the nineteenth century, the notion that Russia was the principal threat to Great Britain's position in the world had taken firm hold. Great Britain perceived its overseas interests menaced by a Russian pincer movement, one prong of which was aimed at Constantinople and the other at India via Central Asia. In the course of its expansion across Central Asia during the second half of the nineteenth century, Russia had elaborated methods of conquest which would become stereotyped. The victim was always so far from the center of world affairs that few Westerners had any precise idea of what was taking place. They could thus fall back on their preconceptions that the tsar was in fact benevolent and his subordinates were bellicose, turning distance and confusion into tools of Russian diplomacy. Of the European Powers, only Great Britain concerned itself with Central Asia. As Russian expansion pushed ever southward in the direction of India, London's protests were stonewalled by Chancellor Prince Aleksandr Gorchakov, who often did not know what the Russian armies were doing. Lord Augustus Loftus, the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg, speculated that Russia's pressure on India 'had not originated with the Sovereign, although he is an absolute monarch, but rather from the dominant part played by the military administration. Where an enormous standing army is maintained, it is absolutely necessary to find employment for it. When a system of conquest sets in in Central Asia, one acquisition of territory leads to another, and the difficulty is where to stop.'\nThis observation, of course, practically replicated Gorchakov's own words (see page 141, above). On the other hand, the British Cabinet did not much care whether Russia was threatening India by momentum or out of deliberate imperialism. The same pattern was repeated again and again. Each year, Russian troops would penetrate deeper into the heart of Central Asia. Great Britain would ask for an explanation and receive all kinds of assurances that the Tsar did not intend to annex one square meter of land. At first, they were able to put matters to rest. But, inevitably, another Russian advance would reopen the issue. For instance, after the Russian army occupied Samarkand (in present-day Uzbekistan) in May 1868, Gorchakov told the British Ambassador, Sir Andrew Buchanan, 'that the Russian Government not only did not wish, but that deeply regretted, the occupation of that city, and he was assured that it would not be permanently retained.' Samarkand, of course, remained under Russian sovereignty until the collapse of the Soviet Union more than a century later. In 1872, the same charade was repeated a few hundred miles to the southeast with respect to the principality of Khiva on the border of present-day Afghanistan. Count Shuvalov, the Tsar's aide-de-camp, was sent to London to reassure the British that Russia had no intention of annexing additional territory in Central Asia. Not only was it far from the intention of the Emperor to take possession of Khiva, but positive orders had been prepared to prevent it, and directions given that conditions imposed should be such as could not in any way lead to a prolonged occupation of Khiva. These assurances had hardly been uttered when word arrived that Russian General Kaufmann had crushed Khiva and imposed a treaty which was the dramatic opposite of Shuvalov's assertions. In 1875, these methods were applied to Kokand, another principality on the border of Afghanistan. On this occasion, Chancellor Gorchakov felt some need to justify the gap between Russia's assurances and its actions. Ingeniously, he devised an unprecedented distinction between unilateral assurances (which, according to his definition, had no binding force) and formal, bilateral engagements. 'The Cabinet in London,' he wrote in a note, 'appears to derive, from the fact of our having on several occasions spontaneously and amicably communicated to them our views with respect to Central Asia, and particularly our firm resolve not to pursue a policy of conquest or annexation, a conviction that we have contracted definite engagements toward them in regard to this matter.' In other words, Russia would insist on a free hand in Central Asia, would set its own limits, and not be bound even by its own assurances.",

It can be argued that Disraeli was the only statesman who ever got the better of Bismarck. Disraeli arrived at the Congress in the impregnable position of having already achieved his aims—a position which Castlereagh had enjoyed at Vienna, and Stalin after the Second World War. The remaining issues concerned the details of implementing the previous agreement between Great Britain and Russia, and the essentially technical military question of whether Turkey or the new Bulgaria should control the Balkan passes. For Disraeli, the strategic problem at the Congress was to deflect from Great Britain as much as possible Russia's frustration at having to relinquish some of its conquests. Disraeli succeeded because Bismarck's own position was so complicated. Bismarck perceived no German interest in the Balkans and basically had no preference with respect to the issues at hand other than that war between Austria and Russia had to be avoided at nearly any cost. He described his role at the Congress as that of the \"ehrlicher Makler\" (honest broker) and introduced almost every statement at the Congress with the words: \"L'Allemagne, qui n'est liée par aucun intérêt direct dans les affaires d'Orient…\" (Germany, which has no direct interest of any kind in Eastern questions). Though Bismarck understood the game being played all too well, he nevertheless felt like a person in a nightmare who sees danger approaching but is unable to avoid it. When the German parliament urged Bismarck to take a stronger stand, he retorted that he intended to steer clear. Bismarck pointed out the perils of mediation by referring to an incident in 1851 when Tsar Nicholas I had intervened between Austria and Prussia, in effect on Austria's side: \"Then Tsar Nicholas played the role that [my opponent] now presumes to give Germany; he (Nicholas) came and said: 'The first one who shoots, I'll shoot,' and as a result peace was maintained. To whose advantage, and to whose disadvantage, that belongs to history, and I don't want to discuss it here. I am simply asking, was this role that Tsar Nicholas played, in which he took one side, ever repaid in gratitude? Certainly not by us in Prussia! Was Tsar Nicholas thanked by Austria? Three years later came the Crimean War, and I don't need to say anything more.\" Nor, he might have added, did the Tsar's intervention prevent Prussia from ultimately consolidating Northern Germany—the real issue in 1851. Bismarck played the hand he had been dealt as well as possible. His approach was generally to back Russia on questions concerning the eastern part of the Balkans (such as the annexation of Bessarabia) and to support Austria on those relating to the western part (such as the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina). On only one issue did he come down against Russia. When Disraeli threatened to leave the Congress unless Turkey was left in possession of the mountain passes in Bulgaria, Bismarck interceded with the Tsar to overrule the Russian negotiator, Shuvalov. In this manner, Bismarck avoided the estrangement with Russia that had befallen Austria after the Crimean War. But he did not emerge unscathed.",

    "text": "Many leading Russians felt cheated of victory. Russia might defer territorial gains for the sake of legitimacy (as Alexander I did in the Greek rebellion in the 1820s, and Nicholas I during the revolutions of 1848), but Russia never relinquished an ultimate objective or accepted compromise as just. Checks to Russian expansionism generally produced sullen resentment. Thus, after the Congress of Berlin, Russia blamed its failure to achieve all of its aims on the Concert of Europe rather than on its own excessive ambition; not on Disraeli, who had organized the coalition against Russia and threatened war, but on Bismarck, who had managed the Congress in order to avoid a European war. Russia had grown accustomed to British opposition, but that the role of honest broker was being assumed by a traditional ally like Germany was treated by Pan-Slavists as an affront. The Russian nationalist press styled the Congress as a 'European coalition against Russia under the leadership of Prince Bismarck,' who was turned into a scapegoat for Russia's failure to achieve its exorbitant goals. Shuvalov, the principal Russian negotiator at Berlin, who was therefore in a position to know the real state of affairs, summed up Russian jingoistic attitudes in the aftermath of the Congress: \"One prefers to leave people with the mad illusion that Russia's interests have been grievously damaged by the action of certain foreign powers, and in this way one gives sustenance to the most pernicious agitation. Everyone wants peace; the condition of the country urgently demands it; but at the same time one tries to divert to the outside world the effects of the discontents produced, in reality, by the mistakes of one's own policies.\" Shuvalov, however, did not reflect Russian public opinion. Though the Tsar himself did not venture as far as his jingoist press or radical Pan-Slavists, neither was he fully reconciled to the outcome of the Congress. In the decades ahead, German perfidy at Berlin would become the staple of many a Russian policy document, including several just prior to the outbreak of World War I. The Three Emperors' League, based on the unity of conservative monarchs, could no longer be maintained. Henceforth, if there was to be any cohesive force in international affairs, it would have to be Realpolitik itself. In the 1850s, Bismarck had advocated a policy which was the Continental equivalent of England's own policy of 'splendid isolation.' He had urged aloofness from entanglements before throwing Prussia's weight behind whichever side seemed best to serve the Prussian national interest at any given point. This approach avoided alliances, which limited freedom of action, and above all, gave Prussia more options than any potential rival. During the 1870s, Bismarck sought to consolidate the unification of Germany by returning to the traditional alliance with Austria and Russia. But in the 1880s, an unprecedented situation came about: Germany was too strong to stand aloof, for that might unite Europe against it. Nor could it any longer rely on the historic, almost reflexive, support of Russia. Germany was a giant in need of friends. Bismarck solved this dilemma by completely reversing his previous approach to foreign policy: If he could no longer operate the balance of power by having fewer commitments than any potential adversary, he would arrange more relationships with more countries than any conceivable opponent and thereby be able to choose among many allies, as circumstances required. Abandoning the freedom of maneuver which had characterized his diplomacy for the previous twenty years, Bismarck began to build a system of alliances deftly engineered on the one hand to keep Germany's potential adversaries from coalescing and, on the other, to restrain the actions of Germany's partners. In each of Bismarck's sometimes contradictory coalitions, Germany was always closer to the various partners than any of them was to each other; hence Bismarck always had a veto over common action as well as an option of independent action. For a decade he succeeded in maintaining pacts with his allies' adversaries so that he could restrain tension on all sides.",

    "section": "Gladstone's Moral Foreign Policy and Bismarck's Realpolitik",
    "text": "Gladstone defeated Disraeli in 1880 in the only British election fought largely over foreign policy issues, and then reversed Disraeli's Balkan policy. Gladstone, perhaps the dominant figure of British politics in the nineteenth century, viewed foreign policy much the same way as Americans did after Wilson: judging foreign policy by moral instead of geopolitical criteria. He argued that the national aspirations of the Bulgarians were legitimate, and that as a fellow Christian nation, Great Britain owed support to Bulgaria against the Muslim Turks. The Turks should be made to behave, argued Gladstone, by a coalition of powers which would then assume responsibility for the administration of Bulgaria. Gladstone put forth the same concept that came to be known under President Wilson as 'collective security.' Europe needed to act jointly, otherwise Great Britain should not act at all.  In 1880, Gladstone, offended by Disraeli's emphasis on geopolitics, launched his landmark Midlothian Campaign, the first whistle-stop campaign in history and the first in which the issues of foreign policy were taken directly to the people. Asserting that morality was the only basis for a sound foreign policy, Gladstone insisted that Christian decency and respect for human rights ought to be the guiding lights of British foreign policy, not the balance of power and the national interest. Gladstone blazed a trail which Wilson later followed when he claimed that there could be no distinction between the morality of the individual and the morality of the state. Like Wilson a generation later, he thought that he had detected a global trend toward peaceful change policed by world public opinion. Every word in this paragraph could have been uttered by Wilson and the implication of it was certainly very similar to Wilson's League of Nations.  To Bismarck, such views were pure anathema.  It is not surprising that these two titanic figures cordially detested each other. Bismarck's attitude toward Gladstone paralleled that of Theodore Roosevelt toward Wilson: he considered the Victorian a humbug, and a menace. Gladstone's ideas on foreign policy suffered the same fate as Wilson's, in that they stirred his compatriots to withdrawal from global affairs rather than greater participation. On the level of day-to-day diplomacy, Gladstone's coming to power in 1880 made little difference to Great Britain's imperial policy in Egypt and east of Suez. But it did prevent England from being a factor in the Balkans and in the European equilibrium in general. Gladstone's second tenure in office (1880-85) thus had the paradoxical effect of removing the safety net under Bismarck, the most moderate of the Continental statesmen, just as Canning's withdrawal from Europe had driven Metternich toward the Tsar. As long as the Palmerston/Disraeli view dominated British foreign policy, Great Britain could serve as the last resort whenever Russia went too far in the Balkans or the approaches to Constantinople. With Gladstone, this assurance came to an end, making Bismarck ever more dependent on his increasingly anachronistic triangle with Austria and Russia.",

    "text": "The Eastern Courts—heretofore the bulwark of conservatism—in a way proved even more susceptible to nationalistic public opinion than the representative governments. Germany's domestic structure had been designed by Bismarck to permit him to apply to it the maxims of his balance-of-power diplomacy, yet it also had a strong tendency to invite demagoguery. Despite the fact that the Reichstag was elected by what was the widest suffrage in Europe, German governments were appointed by the emperor and reported to him, not to the Reichstag. Thus deprived of responsibility, Reichstag members were at liberty to indulge in the most extreme rhetoric. The fact that the military budget was voted for periods of five years at a time tempted governments to create crises during the crucial year in which the defense program would be voted. Russian foreign policy, too, suffered from the rabid propaganda of the Pan-Slavs, whose basic themes were a call for an aggressive policy in the Balkans and a showdown with Germany. Austria, the other polyglot empire, was in a similar position. In these circumstances, it became increasingly difficult for Bismarck to execute his precarious balancing act. In 1881, a new tsar, Alexander III, came to the throne in St. Petersburg, unrestrained by conservative ideology like his grandfather, Nicholas I, or by personal affection for the German Emperor, like his father, Alexander II. Indolent and autocratic, Alexander III distrusted Bismarck, in part because Bismarck's policy was too complicated for him to understand. The Bulgarian crisis of 1885 brought all these impulses to a head. Another revolt produced the greater Bulgaria which Russia had sought so passionately a decade earlier, and which Great Britain and Austria had feared. Demonstrating how history can falsify the most firmly held expectations, the new Bulgaria, far from being dominated by Russia, was unified under a German prince. The court at St. Petersburg blamed Bismarck for what the German chancellor in fact would have far preferred to avoid.  In this atmosphere, Alexander refused to renew the Three Emperors' League in 1887.",

    "text": "Bismarck, however, was not ready to give up on his Russian option. He knew that, left to its own devices, Russia would sooner or later drift into an alliance with France. Yet in the conditions of the 1880s, with Russia and Great Britain permanently on the verge of war, such a course increased Russia's peril vis-à-vis Germany without diminishing British antagonism. Ever ingenious, Bismarck now came up with his last major initiative, the so-called Reinsurance Treaty. Germany and Russia promised each other to stay neutral in a war with a third country unless Germany attacked France, or Russia attacked Austria. Theoretically, Russia and Germany were now guaranteed against a two-front war, provided they stayed on the defensive. However, much depended on how the aggressor was defined, especially since mobilization was becoming increasingly equated with a declaration of war. Since that question was never posed, there were obvious limits to the Reinsurance Treaty, the utility of which was further impaired by the Tsar's insistence on keeping it secret. The secrecy of the agreement was the clearest illustration of the conflict between the requirements of cabinet diplomacy and the imperatives of an increasingly democratized foreign policy. Matters had become so complex that two levels of secrecy existed within the secret Reinsurance Treaty. Despite its complexities, the Reinsurance Treaty maintained the indispensable link between St. Petersburg and Berlin. And it reassured St. Petersburg that, though Germany would defend the integrity of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it would not assist in its expansion at Russia's expense. Germany thus achieved at least a delay in a Franco-Russian alliance. That Bismarck had put his intricate foreign policy into the service of restraint and the preservation of peace was shown by his reaction to pressure from German military leaders urging a pre-emptive war against Russia when the Three Emperors' League ended in 1887. Nevertheless, for all its dexterity and moderation, Bismarck's balancing act was due to end soon. The maneuvers were becoming too complex to sustain, even for the master. Overlapping alliances designed to ensure restraint led to suspicion instead, while the growing importance of public opinion reduced everyone's flexibility. Though Bismarck's style of diplomacy was probably doomed by the end of his period in office, it was far from inevitable that it should have been replaced by a mindless armaments race and…",

By 1890, the concept of the balance Of power had reached the end of its potential It had been made necessary in the first place by the multi- tude of states emerging from the ashes of medieval aspirations to univer- sal empire. In the eighteenth century, its corollary of raison detat had led to frequent wars whose primary function was to prevent the emer- gence of a dominant power and the resurrection of a European empire: The balance of power had preserved the liberties of states, not the peace of Europe: Balance-of-power policy reached its zenith in the years after the Napoleonic Wars. It operated smoothly during this period because the equilibrium had been deliberately designed t0 enhance balance, and; as importantly, because it was buttressed by a sense of shared values, at least among the conservative courts. After the Crimean War, that sense of shared values gradually eroded, and matters reverted to eighteenth- century conditions; now made all the more dangerous by modern tech- nology and the growing role of public opinion: Even the despotic states could appeal to their publics by invoking a foreign danger and by sub stituting outside threats for democratic consensus National consolidation of the states of Europe reduced the number of players and the ability to substitute diplomatic combinations for the deployment of power; while the collapse of a shared sense of legitimacy eroded moral restraint: Despite America's historic aversion to the balance of power; these lessons are relevant to post_Cold War American foreign policy: For the first time in its history, America is currently part ofan international system in which it is the strongest country Though a military superpower; America can no longer impose its will because neither its power nor its ideology lends itself to imperial ambitions And nuclear weapons; in which America is preponderant militarily, tend toward an equalization of usable power: The United States therefore finds itself increasingly in a world with numerous similarities to nineteenth-century Europe, albeit on a global scale: One can hope that something akin to the Metternich system evolves, in which a balance of power is reinforced by a shared sense of values And in the modern age, these values would have to be democratic Yer Metternich had not had t0 create his legitimate order; it essentially already existed: In the contemporary world, democracy is far from univer- sal, and where it is proclaimed it is not necessarily defined in commensu- rable terms. It is reasonable for the United States to try tO buttress equilibrium with moral consensus To be true to itself; America must trY to forge the widest possible moral consensus around a global commit- ment tO democracy: But it dare not neglect the analysis of the balance of power.

    "text": "If a Metternich-type system based on legitimacy is not possible, America will have to learn to operate in a balance-of-power system, however uncongenial it may find such a course. In the nineteenth century, there were two models for balance-of-power systems: the British model exem- plified by the Palmerston/Disraeli approach; and Bismarcks model. The British approach was to wait for the balance of power to be threatened directly before engaging itself; and then almost always on the weaker side; Bismarcks approach sought to prevent challenges from arising by establishing close relations with as many parties as possible; by building overlapping alliance systems, and by using the resulting influence to moderate the claims of the contenders. Strange as it may seem in light of America's experiences with Germany in the course of two world wars, the Bismarck style of operating a balance of power is probably more attuned to the traditional American approach to international relations The Palmerston/Disraeli method would require a disciplined aloofness from disputes and a ruthless commitment to the equilibrium in the face of threats Both the disputes and the threats would have to be assessed almost entirely in terms of balance of power. America would find it difficult to marshal either the aloofness or the ruth- lessness, not to mention the willingness to interpret international affairs strictly in terms of power. Bismarck's later policy sought t0 restrain power in advance by some consensus On shared objectives with various groups of countries In an interdependent world, America will find it difficult to practice Great Brit- ain’s splendid isolation: But it is also unlikely that it will be able to establish a comprehensive system of security equally applicable to all parts of the world. The most -and quite likely constructive solution would be partially overlapping alliance systems, some focusing on security, oth- ers on economic relations. The challenge for America will be to generate objectives growing out of American values that can hold together these various groupings (see chapter 31). In any event; by the end of the nineteenth century, both of these approaches to foreign policy were fading Great Britain no longer felt predominant enough to risk isolation: And Bismarck was dismissed from office by an impatient new emperor who set himself the immodest task of improving on the policy of the master: In the process, the balance of power turned rigid, and Europe headed toward a catastrophe all the more devastating because nobody believed it was possible:",

    "text": "By the end of the twentieth centurys first decade, the Concert of Eu- rope, which had maintained peace for a century, had for all practical purposes ceased to exist The Great Powers had thrown themselves with blind frivolity into a bipolar struggle that led to petrification into two power blocs, anticipating the pattern of the Cold War years later. There was one important difference, however; In the age of nuclear weapons, the avoidance of war would be a major, perhaps the principal, foreign policy goal, At the beginning of the twentieth century, wars could still be started with a touch of frivolity. Indeed, some European thinkers held that periodic bloodletting was cathartic; a naive hypothesis that was brutally punctured by the First World War: For decades, historians have been debating who must bear responsibil- ity for the outbreak of the First World War: Yet no one country can be singled out for that mad dash to disaster, Each of the major powers contributed its quota of shortsightedness and irresponsibility, and did so with an insouciance which would never again be possible once the disas- ter they had wrought entered the collective memory of Europe. They had forgotten Pascals warning in Pensees_~if they had ever known it \"We run heedlessly into the abyss after putting something in front of uS to Stop uS seeing it: There was surely enough blame to go around The nations of Europe transformed the balance of power into an armaments race without under- standing that modern technology and mass conscription had made gen- eral war the greatest threat to their security, and to European civilization as a whole Though all the nations of Europe contributed to the disaster with their policies, it was Germany and Russia which undermined any sense of restraint by their very natures Throughout the process of German unification, there had been little concern about its impact on the balance of power: For 200 years, Ger- many had been the victim, not the instigator; of the wars of Europe. In the Thirty Years' War; the Germans had suffered casualties estimated as high as 30 percent of their entire population, and all the decisive battles of the dynastic wars of the eighteenth century and of the Napoleonic Wars were fought on German soil It was therefore nearly inevitable that a united Germany would aim to prevent the recurrence of these tragedies But it was not inevitable that the new German state should have approached this challenge largely as a military problem; or that German diplomats after Bismarck should have conducted foreign policy with such bullying assertiveness Whereas Fred- erick the Great s Prussia had been the weakest of the Great Powers; soon after unification, Germany became the strongest and aS such proved disquieting t0 its neighbors In order to participate in the Concert of Europe, it therefore needed to show special restraint in its foreign policy ! Unfortunately, after Bismarck's departure, moderation was the quality Germany lacked the most: The reason German statesmen were obsessed with naked power was that; in contrast to other nation-states, Germany did not possess any integ- rating philosophical framework None of the ideals which had shaped the modern nation-state in the rest of Europe was present in Bismarck's construction--not Great Britain's emphasis on traditional liberties, the French Revolution's appeal to universal freedom; Or even the benign universalist imperialism of Austria. Strictly speaking, Bismarcks Germany did not embody the aspirations of a nation-state at all, because he had deliberately excluded the Austrian Germans.

His successors, however, were clearly not comfortable with the balance of power. They never seemed to understand that the more they magnified their own strength, the more they would encourage the compensating coalitions and arms buildups inherent in the system of European equilibrium. German leaders resented the reluctance of other countries to ally themselves with a nation that was already the strongest in Europe, and whose strength was generating fears of German hegemony. Bullying tactics seemed to Germany's leaders the best way to bring home to their neighbors the limits of their own strength and, presumably, the benefits of Germany's friendship. This taunting approach had quite the opposite effect. Trying to achieve absolute security for their country, German leaders after Bismarck threatened other European nations with absolute insecurity, triggering countervailing coalitions nearly automatically. There are no diplomatic shortcuts to domination; the only route that leads to it is war; a lesson the provincial leaders of post-Bismarck Germany learned only when it was too late to avoid a global catastrophe.",

    "text": "Ironically, for the greater part of imperial Germany's history, Russia, not Germany, was considered the main threat to peace. First Palmerston and then Disraeli were convinced that Russia intended to penetrate into Egypt and India. By 1913, the corresponding fear among German leaders that they were about to be overrun by the Russian hordes had reached such a pitch that it contributed significantly to their decision to force the fateful showdown a year later. In fact, there was little hard evidence to substantiate the fear that Russia might seek a European empire. The claims by German military intelligence of having proof that Russia was in fact preparing for such a war were as true as they were irrelevant. All the countries of both alliances, intoxicated with the new technology of railways and mobilization schedules, were constantly engaged in military preparations out of proportion to any of the issues disputed. But, precisely because these fervid preparations could not be related to any definable objective, they were interpreted as portents of vast, if nebulous, ambitions. Characteristically, Prince von Bülow, German Chancellor from 1900 to 1909, espoused Frederick the Great's view that of all Prussia's neighbors the Russian Empire is \"the most dangerous in its strength as well as in its position.\" Throughout Europe, there was a sense of unease about the vastness and persistence of Russia. All the nations of Europe were seeking aggrandizement by means of threats and counterthreats. But Russia seemed impelled to expand by a rhythm all its own, containable only by the deployment of superior force, and usually by war. Throughout numerous crises, a reasonable settlement often seemed well within Russia's reach; much better in fact than what ultimately emerged. Yet Russia always preferred the risk of defeat to compromise. This had been true in the Crimean War of 1854, the Balkan Wars of 1875-78, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904.",

    "text": "A remarkable change occurred in British foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.  It was no small irony that the man who led Great Britain through the first part of this transition represented everything traditional about Great Britain and British foreign policy. For the Marquis of Salisbury was the ultimate insider: He was the scion of the ancient Cecil family, whose ancestors had served as top ministers to British monarchs since the time of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nKing Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910 and came from an upstart family compared with the Cecils, was known to complain occasionally at the condescending tone Salisbury used toward him. Salisbury’s rise in politics was as effortless as it was foreordained. After an education at Christ Church, Oxford, the young Salisbury toured Europe, perfected his French, and met heads of state. By the age of [thirty-]eight, after serving as viceroy of India, he became Disraeli’s Foreign Minister and played a major role at the Congress of Berlin, where he did most of the detailed day-to-day negotiating. After Disraeli’s death, he took over the leadership of the Tory Party and, apart from Gladstone’s last government of 1892–94, was the dominant figure in British politics during the last fifteen years of the nineteenth century.\n\nIn some respects, Salisbury’s position was not unlike that of President George Bush, though he served longer in his nation’s highest office. Both men bestrode a world which was receding by the time they came to power, though that fact was not obvious to either of them. Both left an impact by knowing how to operate what they had inherited. Bush’s view of the world was shaped by the Cold War, in which he had risen to prominence and over whose end he was obliged to preside while at the pinnacle of his career; Salisbury’s formative experiences had been in the Palmerston era of unparalleled British power overseas and of intractable Anglo-Russian rivalry, both of which were clearly coming to an end during his leadership.\n\nSalisbury’s government had to grapple with the decline in Great Britain’s relative standing: Its vast economic power was now matched by Germany’s; Russia and France had expanded their imperial efforts and were challenging the British Empire nearly everywhere. Though Great Britain was still pre-eminent, the dominance it had enjoyed in the middle of the nineteenth century was slipping. Just as Bush adjusted skillfully to what he had not foreseen, by the 1890s Great Britain’s leaders recognized the need to relate traditional policy to unexpected realities.\n\nOverweight and rumpled in his physical appearance, Lord Salisbury more adequately embodied Great Britain’s contentment with the status quo than he did its transformation. As the author of the phrase “splendid isolation,” Salisbury, on the face of it, promised to carry on the traditional British policies of holding a firm line overseas against other imperial powers, and of involving Great Britain in Continental alliances only when it was required as a last resort to prevent an aggressor from overturning the balance. For Salisbury, Great Britain’s insular position meant that its ideal policy was to be active on the high seas and to remain unentangled in the customary Continental alliances. “We are fish,” he bluntly asserted on one occasion.",

    "text": "In the end, Salisbury was obliged to recognize that Great Britain’s overextended empire was straining under the pressures of Russia in the Far and Near East, and of France in Africa. Even Germany was entering the colonial race. Though France, Germany, and Russia were frequently in conflict with one another on the Continent, they always clashed with Great Britain overseas. For Great Britain possessed not only India, Canada, and a large portion of Africa, but insisted on dominating vast territories which, for strategic reasons, it wanted to keep from falling into the hands of another power even though it did not seek to control them directly. Salisbury called this claim “a sort of ear-mark upon territory, which, in case of a break-up, England did not want any other power to have.” These areas included the Persian Gulf, China, Turkey, and Morocco.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Great Britain felt beleaguered by endless clashes with Russia in Afghanistan, around the Straits, and in Northern China, and with France in Egypt and Morocco. With the Mediterranean Agreements of 1887, Great Britain became indirectly associated with the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy in the hope that Italy and Austria might strengthen its hand in dealing with France in North Africa, and with Russia in the Balkans. Yet the Mediterranean Agreements proved to be only a stopgap. The new German empire, deprived of its master strategist, did not know what to do with its opportunity. Geopolitical realities were gradually drawing Great Britain out of its splendid isolation, though there was enough handwringing about it by traditionalists. The first move toward greater involvement with the Continent was on behalf of warmer relations with imperial Germany. Convinced that Russia and Great Britain desperately needed Germany, German policymakers thought they could drive a hard bargain with both of them simultaneously without specifying the nature of the bargain they were seeking or ever imagining that they might be pushing Russia and Great Britain closer together. When rebuffed in these all-or-nothing overtures, German leaders would withdraw into sulkiness, which quickly changed to truculence. This approach was in contrast to that of France, which settled for slow, step-by-step progress, waiting twenty years for Russia and another decade and a half for Great Britain to propose an agreement. For all the noise post-Bismarck Germany made, its foreign policy was overwhelmingly amateurish, short-sighted, and even timid when faced with the confrontations it had itself generated.",

    "section": "Diplomacy and the Rise of Tensions",
    "text": "Diplomacy turns rigid. A zero-sum game develops in which any gain of one side is conceived as a loss for the other; armaments races and mounting tensions become inevitable. This was the situation during the Cold War, and in Europe tacitly after Great Britain joined the Franco-Russian alliance, thereby forming the Triple Entente starting in 1908. Unlike during the Cold War, the international order after 1891 did not turn rigid after a single challenge. It took fifteen years before each of the three elements of flexibility was destroyed in sequence. After the formation of the Triple Entente, the balance of power ceased to function. Tests of strength became the rule and not the exception. Diplomacy as the art of compromise ended. It was only a question of time before some crisis would drive events out of control.\nBut in 1891, as France and Russia lined up against it, Germany still hoped that it could bring about the offsetting alliance with Great Britain for which William II yearned but which his impetuousness made impossible. The colonial agreement of 1890 did not lead to the alliance the Russian Ambassador had feared. Its failure to materialize was partly due to British domestic politics. When Gladstone returned to office in 1892 for the last time, he bruised the Kaiser's tender ego by rejecting any association with autocratic Germany or Austria. Yet the fundamental reason for the failure of the several attempts to arrange an Anglo-German alliance was the German leadership's incomprehension of traditional British foreign policy as well as of the real requirements of its own security.\nFor a century and a half, Great Britain had refused to commit itself to an open-ended military alliance. It would make only two kinds of engagements: limited military agreements to deal with definable, clearly specified dangers; or entente-type arrangements to cooperate diplomatically on those issues in which interests with another country ran parallel. In a sense, the British definition of entente was, of course, a tautology: Great Britain would cooperate when it chose to cooperate. But an entente also had the effect of creating moral and psychological ties and a presumption—if not a legal obligation—of joint action in crises. And it would have kept Great Britain apart from France and Russia, or at least complicated their rapprochement.\nGermany refused such informal procedures. William II insisted on what he called a 'Continental-type alliance.' 'If England wants allies or aid,' he said in 1895, 'she must abandon her non-committal policy and provide continental type guarantees or treaties.' But what could the Kaiser have meant by a 'Continental-type guarantee'? After nearly a century of splendid isolation, Great Britain was clearly not ready to undertake the permanent Continental commitment it had so consistently avoided for 150 years, especially on behalf of Germany, which was fast becoming the strongest country on the Continent. What made this German pressure for a formal guarantee so self-defeating was that Germany did not really need it because it was strong enough to defeat any prospective Continental adversary or combination of them, so long as Great Britain did not take their side. What Germany should have asked of Great Britain was not an alliance, but benevolent neutrality in a Continental war, and for that an entente-type arrangement would have been sufficient. By asking for what it did not need, and by offering what Great Britain did not want (sweeping commitments to defend the British Empire), Germany led Great Britain to suspect that it was in fact seeking world domination. German impatience deepened the reserve of the British, who were beginning to entertain grave doubts about the judgment of their suitor.",

    "text": "While the German leadership impetuously pursued alliances, the German public was demanding an ever more assertive foreign policy. Only the Social Democrats held out for a time, though in the end they, too, succumbed to public opinion and supported Germany's declaration of war in 1914. The leading German classes had no experience with European diplomacy, much less with the Weltpolitik on which they were so loudly insisting. The Junkers, who had led Prussia to the domination of Germany, would bear the weight of opprobrium after the two world wars, especially in the United States. In fact, they were the social stratum least guilty of overreaching in foreign affairs, being basically geared to Continental policy and having little interest in events outside Europe. Rather, it was the new industrial managerial and the growing professional classes that provided the nucleus of nationalist agitation without encountering in the political system the sort of parliamentary buffer which had evolved in Great Britain and France over several centuries. In the Western democracies, the strong nationalist currents were channeled through parliamentary institutions; in Germany, they had to find expression in extra-parliamentary pressure groups. As autocratic as Germany was, its leaders were extremely sensitive to public opinion and heavily influenced by nationalistic pressure groups. These groups saw diplomacy and international relations almost as if they were sporting events, always pushing the government to a harder line: more territorial expansion, more colonies, a stronger army, or a larger navy. They treated the normal give-and-take of diplomacy, or the slightest hint of German diplomatic concession, as an egregious humiliation. Kurt Riezler, the political secretary of the German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who was in office when war was declared, remarked aptly: \"The threat of war in our time lies in the internal politics of those countries in which a weak government is confronted by a strong nationalist movement.\"",

    "text": "Germany had historically resisted assuming the role of a British auxiliary, especially concerning issues peripheral to German interests, like the threat to India.  Furthermore, Germany's arrogance blinded it to the benefits of British neutrality.  Foreign Secretary Lansdowne's 1902 alliance with Japan, a move outside the traditional European Concert, stunned Europe. This alliance stipulated neutrality if either Britain or Japan faced a single adversary over China or Korea, but mutual assistance if either faced two adversaries. This arrangement provided Britain with an eager partner to contain Russia in the Far East without extraneous entanglements, and protected Japan from potential French interference. This marked a turning point, as Britain began to view Germany less as a strategic partner and more as a potential geopolitical threat.\n\nAs late as 1912, Anglo-German reconciliation remained a possibility. Lord Haldane's visit to Berlin aimed to ease tensions through a naval accord and a British neutrality pledge if Germany was not the aggressor in a war. However, the Kaiser's insistence on British neutrality even if Germany launched a pre-emptive war proved unacceptable to London.  The talks collapsed, highlighting the Kaiser's misjudgment of Britain's willingness to commit to a formal alliance.  He remained convinced he could intimidate Britain, failing to grasp that a tacit understanding was all Germany truly needed. The Kaiser's aggressive pursuit of an alliance only deepened British suspicions.  The German naval program, coupled with Germany's harassment of Britain during the Boer War, triggered a reassessment of British foreign policy.  Britain, which had long considered France its primary European threat and Russia its greatest imperial threat, shifted its priorities after securing the Japanese alliance.  In 1903, Britain began resolving colonial disputes with France, culminating in the Entente Cordiale of 1904 – the very kind of informal cooperation Germany had spurned.  This marked Britain's departure from its 'splendid isolation' and its alignment with one side of the European power balance.  A French representative assured Lansdowne that France would alleviate Russian pressure on Britain, emphasizing that Germany posed the most serious threat to European peace and an Anglo-French understanding was crucial to containing German ambitions.",

    "text": "Within a decade of the Entente Cordiale, Russia, formerly linked to Germany by the Reinsurance Treaty, became a French military ally, while Britain joined the French diplomatic camp. Germany, through its own actions, had isolated itself and fostered a hostile coalition.  A statesman facing such a threat must decide whether to act preemptively or wait for circumstances to change. Richelieu, two centuries earlier, recognized the danger of encirclement but understood its components and chose to wait for divisions among France's adversaries to emerge.  The Kaiser lacked such patience and acumen, despite the unnatural alliances arrayed against Germany. Germany's response to encirclement was to double down on the very diplomacy that had created the problem. It sought to break the Entente Cordiale by challenging France in Morocco, aiming to expose the hollowness of British support.  The Kaiser's 1905 declaration in Tangier, upholding Moroccan independence, was a gamble based on flawed assumptions: that the US, Italy, and Austria would support Germany's open-door policy; that Russia, weakened by war with Japan, would remain uninvolved; and that Britain would welcome relief from its French obligations.  These assumptions proved false as fear of Germany unified the other powers. Britain fully backed France, refusing Germany's call for a conference until France agreed.  The German leadership, having staked its prestige on the dispute, found itself facing a diplomatic debacle. The Kaiser, adept at initiating crises but lacking the nerve for prolonged confrontation, was forced to accept a conference in Algeciras, scheduled for six months later.  This retreat undermined the credibility of Germany's threats.  The Algeciras Conference of 1906 exposed Germany's isolation.  Britain's Foreign Secretary warned the German ambassador that Britain would side with France in case of a German attack stemming from the Moroccan agreement. The US, Italy, Russia, and Britain all refused to support Germany. The crisis, intended to shatter the Entente, instead strengthened Franco-British military cooperation and paved the way for the 1907 Anglo-Russian Entente.",

    "text": "Following Algeciras, Britain, for the first time in a long time, engaged in military cooperation with a continental power, initiating naval consultations with France. While Britain maintained its traditional escape clause, avoiding a formal military commitment, France accepted this ambiguity, recognizing the growing moral obligation.  Germany's inflexibility in this regard had cost it dearly.  The Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907, primarily a colonial agreement resolving disputes in Afghanistan and Persia, completed the Triple Entente and Germany's encirclement. To secure Russian cooperation, Britain abandoned its long-standing policy of blocking Russia's access to the Dardanelles. While some historians argue that the Triple Entente was merely two colonial agreements gone astray, focused on imperial defense rather than containing Germany, the Crowe Memorandum suggests otherwise.  Sir Eyre Crowe's 1907 analysis argued that accommodation with Germany was impossible and the entente with France was Britain's only viable option.  Crowe's memorandum demonstrated a level of strategic thinking unmatched by any German document of the post-Bismarck era.  He identified the core conflict as one between strategy and brute force, arguing that strategy prevails unless countered by overwhelming strength. While acknowledging Anglo-French and Anglo-Russian differences, Crowe believed these were manageable as they stemmed from definable, limited objectives.  Germany's foreign policy, however, was menacing due to its lack of clear rationale and its ceaseless global challenges.  Crowe also saw the German naval buildup as a direct threat to the British Empire's survival, concluding that Germany's unrestrained behavior made confrontation inevitable.  He predicted that a union of the greatest military and naval power in one state would compel the world to unite against it.",

    "text": "argued that structure, not motive, determined stability: Germany's intentions were essentially irrelevant; what mattered were its capabilities. He put forward two hypotheses: Either Germany is definitely aiming at general political hegemony and maritime ascendancy, threatening the independence of her neighbours and ultimately the existence of England; Or Germany, free from any clear-cut ambition; and thinking for the present merely of her legitimate position and influence as one of the leading Powers in the council of nations, is seeking to promote her foreign commerce, spread the benefits of German culture, extend the scope of her national energies; and create fresh German interests all over the world wherever and whenever a peaceful opportunity offers. Crowe insisted that these distinctions were irrelevant because, in the end, they would be overridden by the temptations inherent in Germany's growing power: 'it is clear that the second scheme (of semi-independent evolution, not entirely unaided by statecraft) may at any stage merge into the Or conscious-design scheme: Moreover, if ever the evolution scheme should come to be realized, the position thereby accruing to Germany would obviously constitute as formidable a menace to the rest of the world as would be presented by any deliberate conquest of a similar position by malice aforethought'. Though the Crowe Memorandum did not actually go further than to oppose an understanding with Germany, its thrust was clear: if Germany did not abandon its quest for maritime supremacy and moderate its so-called Weltpolitik, Great Britain was certain to join Russia and France in opposing it. And it would do so with the implacable tenacity that had brought down French and Spanish pretensions in previous centuries. Great Britain made it clear that it would not stand for any further accretion of German strength: In 1909, Foreign Secretary Grey made this point in response to a German offer to slow down (but not end) its naval buildup if Great Britain agreed to stay neutral in a German war against France and Russia: The proposed agreement, Grey argued, 'would serve to establish German hegemony in Europe and would not last after it had served that purpose. It is in fact an invitation to help Germany to make a European combination which could be directed against us when it suited her to use it. If we sacrifice the other Powers to Germany, we shall eventually be attacked.' After the creation of the Triple Entente, the cat-and-mouse game Germany and Great Britain had played in the 1890s grew deadly serious and turned into a struggle between a status quo power and a power demanding a change in the equilibrium. With diplomatic flexibility no longer possible, the only way to alter the balance of power was by adding more arms or by victory in war. The two alliances were facing each other across a gulf of growing mutual distrust. Unlike the period of the Cold War, the two groupings did not fear war; they were in fact more concerned with preserving their cohesiveness than with avoiding a showdown. Confrontation became the standard method of diplomacy.",

No other member of the Triple Entente would have gone to war to help France regain Alsace-Lorraine; Germany, even in its exalted frame of mind, was unlikely to support an Austrian war of aggression in the Balkans. A policy of restraint might have delayed the war and caused the unnatural alliances gradually to disintegrate—especially as the Triple Entente had been forged by fear of Germany in the first place. By the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, the balance of power had degenerated into hostile coalitions whose rigidity was matched by the reckless disregard for consequence with which they had been assembled. Russia was tied to a Serbia teeming with nationalist, even terrorist, factions and which, having nothing to lose, had no concern for the risk of a general war. France had handed a blank check to a Russia eager to restore its self-respect after the Russo-Japanese War. Germany had done the same for an Austria desperate to protect its Slavic provinces against agitation from Serbia, which, in turn, was backed by Russia. The nations of Europe had permitted themselves to become captives of reckless Balkan clients. Far from restraining these nations of unbounded passion and limited sense of global responsibility, they allowed themselves to be dragged along by the paranoia that their restless partners might shift alliances if they were not given their way. For a few years, crises were still being surmounted although each new one brought the inevitable showdown closer. And Germany's reaction to the Triple Entente revealed a dogged determination to repeat the same mistake over and over again; every problem became transformed into a test of manhood to prove that Germany was decisive and powerful while its adversaries lacked resolution and strength. Yet, with each new German challenge, the bonds of the Triple Entente grew tighter. In 1908, an international crisis occurred over Bosnia-Herzegovina, worth retelling because it illustrates the tendency of history to repeat itself. Bosnia-Herzegovina had been the backwater of Europe, its fate having been left in an ambiguous status at the Congress of Berlin because no one really knew what to do with it. This no-man's-land between the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires, which contained Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim religions, and Croatian, Serbian, and Muslim populations, had never been a state or even self-governing. It only seemed governable if none of these groups was asked to submit to the others. For years, Bosnia-Herzegovina had been under Turkish suzerainty, Austrian administration, and local autonomy without experiencing a serious challenge to this multinational arrangement which left the issue of ultimate sovereignty unsettled. Austria had waited thirty years to initiate outright annexation because the passions of the polyglot mix were too complex even for the Austrians to sort out, despite their experience of administering in the midst of chaos. When they finally did annex Bosnia-Herzegovina, they did so more to score a point against Serbia (and indirectly Russia) than to achieve any coherent political objective. As a result, Austria upset the delicate balance of offsetting hatreds. Three generations later, in 1992, the same elemental passions erupted over comparable issues, confounding all but the zealots directly involved and those familiar with the region's volatile history. Once more, an abrupt change in government turned Bosnia-Herzegovina into a cauldron. As soon as Bosnia was declared an independent state, all the nationalities fell upon each other in a struggle for dominance, with the Serbs settling old scores in a particularly brutal manner. Taking advantage of Russia's weakness in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War, Austria frivolously implemented a thirty-year-old secret codicil from the Congress of Berlin in which the powers had agreed to let Austria annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. Heretofore, Austria had been satisfied with de facto control because it wanted no more Slavic subjects. But in 1908, Austria reversed that decision, fearing its empire was about to dissolve under the impact of Serbian agitation and thinking that it needed some success to demonstrate its continued pre-eminence in the Balkans. In the intervening three decades, Russia had lost its dominant position in Bulgaria and the Three Emperors' League had lapsed. Not unreasonably, Russia was outraged that the all-but-forgotten agreement should now be invoked to permit Austria to acquire a territory which a Russian war had liberated. But outrage does not guarantee success, especially when its target is already in possession of the prize.",

    "text": "For a while, the alliance system itself provided a certain restraint; France held Russia back in conflicts which primarily involved Austria; Germany played a similar role with Austria vis-a-vis Russia. In the Bosnian crisis of 1908, France made it clear that it would not go to war over a Balkan issue. During the Moroccan crisis of 1911, French President Calliaux was told firmly that any French attempt to resolve a colonial crisis by force would not receive Russian support. As late as the Balkan War of 1912, Germany warned Austria that there were limits to German backing, and Great Britain pressured Russia to moderate its acts on behalf of the volatile and unpredictable Balkan League, which was led by Serbia. At the London Conference of 1913, Great Britain helped to thwart Serbian annexation of Albania, which would have been intolerable to Austria. The London Conference of 1913 would, however, be the last time that the pre-World War I international system could ease conflicts. Serbia was unhappy with Russia's lukewarm support, while Russia resented Great Britain's posture as an impartial arbiter and France's clear reluctance to go to war. Austria, on the verge of disintegrating under Russian and South Slav pressures, was upset that Germany was not backing it more vigorously. Serbia, Russia, and Austria all expected greater support from their allies; France, Great Britain, and Germany feared they might lose their partners if they did not support them more forcefully in the next crisis. Afterward, each Great Power was suddenly seized by panic that a conciliatory stance would make it appear weak and unreliable and cause its partners to leave it all alone facing a hostile coalition. Countries began to assume levels of risk unwarranted by their historic national interests or by any rational long-term strategic objective. Richelieu's dictum that means must correspond to ends was violated almost daily. Germany accepted the risk of world war in order to be seen as supportive of Vienna's South Slav policy, in which it had no national interest. Russia was willing to risk a fight to the death with Germany in order to be viewed as Serbia's steadfast ally. Germany and Russia had no major conflict with each other; their confrontation was by proxy. In 1912, the new French President, Raymond Poincaré, informed the Russian Ambassador with respect to the Balkans that \"if Russia goes to war, France will also, as we know that in this question Germany is behind Austria.\" The gleeful Russian Ambassador reported 'a completely new French view' that 'the territorial grabs by Austria affect the general European balance and therefore France's interests.' That same year, the British Undersecretary in the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicholson, wrote to the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg: \"I do not know how much longer we shall be able to follow our present policy of dancing on a tight rope, and not be compelled to take some definite line or other. I am also haunted by the same fear as you—lest Russia should become tired of us and strike a bargain with Germany.\" Not to be outdone in recklessness, the Kaiser promised Austria in 1913 that, in the next crisis, Germany would follow it into war if necessary. On July 7, 1914, the German Chancellor explained the policy which, less than four weeks later, would lead to actual war: \"If we urge them [the Austrians] ahead, then will we have pushed them in; if we dissuade them, then it will become a matter of our leaving them in the lurch. Then they will turn to the Western Powers, whose arms are wide open, and we will lose our last ally, such as it is.\" The precise benefit Austria was to draw from an alliance with the Triple Entente was left undefined. Nor was it likely that Austria could join a grouping containing Russia, which sought to undermine Austria's Balkan position. Historically, alliances had been formed to augment a nation's strength in case of war; as World War I approached, the primary motive for war was to strengthen the alliances. The leaders of all the major countries simply did not grasp the implications of the technology at their disposal, or of the coalitions they were feverishly constructing. They seemed oblivious to the huge casualties of the still relatively recent American Civil War, and expected a short, decisive conflict. It never occurred to them that the failure to make their alliances correspond to rational political objectives would lead to the destruction of civilization as they knew it. Each alliance had too much at stake to permit the traditional Concert of Europe diplomacy to work. Instead, the Great Powers managed to construct a diplomatic doomsday machine, though they were unaware of what they had done.",

    "text": "The astonishing aspect of the outbreak of the First World War is not that a crisis simpler than many already surmounted had triggered a global catastrophe, but that it took so long for it to happen. By 1914, the confrontation between Germany and Austria-Hungary on the one side, and the Triple Entente on the other, had turned deadly earnest. The statesmen of all the major countries had helped to construct the diplomatic doomsday mechanism that made each succeeding crisis progressively more difficult to solve. Their military chiefs had vastly compounded the peril by adding strategic plans which compressed the time available for decision-making. Since the military plans depended on speed and the diplomatic machinery was geared to its traditional leisurely pace, it became impossible to disentangle the crisis under intense time pressure. To make matters worse, the military planners had not adequately explained the implications of their handiwork to their political colleagues. Military planning had, in effect, become autonomous. The first step in this direction occurred during the negotiation for a Franco-Russian military alliance in 1892. Up to that time, alliance negotiations had been about the casus belli, or what specific actions by the adversary might oblige allies to go to war. Almost invariably, its definition hinged on who was perceived to have initiated the hostilities. In 1892, the Russian negotiator, Adjutant General Nikolai Obruchev, sent a letter to his Foreign Minister, Giers, explaining why the traditional method for defining the casus belli had been overtaken by modern technology: Obruchev argued that what mattered was who mobilized first, not who fired the first shot: \"The undertaking of mobilization can no longer be considered as a peaceful act. On the contrary, it represents the most decisive act of war.\" The side that procrastinated in mobilizing would lose the benefit of its alliances and enable its enemy to defeat each adversary in turn. The need for all the allies to mobilize simultaneously had become so urgent in the minds of European leaders that it turned into the keystone of solemn diplomatic engagements. The purpose of alliances was no longer to guarantee support after a war had started, but to guarantee that each ally would mobilize as soon as, and, it was hoped, just before, any adversary did. When alliances so constructed confronted each other, threats based on mobilization became irreversible because stopping mobilization in midstream was more disastrous than not having started it at all. If one side stopped while the other proceeded, it would be at a growing disadvantage with every passing day. If both sides tried to stop simultaneously, it would be technically so difficult that almost certainly the mobilization would be completed before the diplomats could agree on how to arrest it. This doomsday procedure effectively removed the casus belli from political control. Every crisis had a built-in escalator to war—the decision to mobilize—and every war was certain to become general.",

    "text": "Schlieffen jettisoned the strategic concepts of Helmuth von Moltke, the military architect of Bismarck's three rapid victories between 1864 and 1870. Moltke had devised a strategy that left open the option of a political solution to Bismarck's nightmare of hostile coalitions. In case of a two-front war, Moltke planned to split the German army more or less evenly between the East and the West; and to go on the defensive on both fronts. Since France's principal objective was to regain Alsace-Lorraine, it was certain to attack. If Germany defeated that offensive, France would be obliged to consider a compromise peace. Moltke specifically warned against extending military operations to Paris, having learned in the Franco-Prussian War how difficult it was to conclude a peace while besieging the enemy's capital. Moltke proposed the same strategy for the Eastern front – namely, to defeat a Russian attack and to follow it by pushing the Russian army back to a strategically significant distance, and then to offer a compromise peace. Whichever forces first achieved victory would be available to aid the armies on the other front. In this manner, the scale of the sacrifices, and the political solution would be kept in some sort of balance.\n\nBut just as Bismarck's successors had been uncomfortable with the ambiguities of his overlapping alliances, so Schlieffen rejected Moltke's plan because it left the military initiative to Germany's enemies. Nor did Schlieffen approve of Moltke's preference for political compromise over total victory. Determined to impose terms which were, in effect, unconditional surrender, Schlieffen elaborated a scheme for a quick and decisive victory on one front and then throwing all of Germany's forces against the other adversary, thereby achieving a clear-cut outcome on both fronts. Because a quick, knockout blow in the East was precluded by the slow pace of Russian mobilization, which was expected to take six weeks, and by Russia's vast territory, Schlieffen decided to destroy the French first, before the Russian army was fully mobilized. To circumvent the heavy French fortifications at the German border, Schlieffen came up with the idea of violating Belgian neutrality by wheeling the German army through its territory. He would capture Paris and trap the French army from the rear in its fortresses along the border. In the meantime, Germany would stay on the defensive in the East. The plan was as brilliant as it was reckless. A minimum knowledge of history would have revealed that Great Britain would surely go to war if Belgium was invaded – a fact which seems to have totally eluded the Kaiser and the German general staff.",

    "text": "For twenty years after the Schlieffen Plan was devised in 1892, Germany's leaders had made innumerable proposals to Great Britain for its support – or at least neutrality – in a European war, all of which were rendered illusory by German military planning. There was no cause for which Great Britain had fought as consistently or implacably as the independence of the Low Countries. And Great Britain's conduct in the wars against Louis XIV and Napoleon testified to its tenacity: Once engaged, it would fight to the end, even if France were defeated. Nor did the Schlieffen Plan allow for the possibility of failure. If Germany did not destroy the French army – which was possible, since the French had interior lines and railways radiating from Paris whereas the German army had to march by foot in an arc through a devastated countryside – Germany would be forced into Moltke's strategy of defense on both fronts after it had destroyed the possibility of a political compromise peace by occupying Belgium. Where the principal goal of Bismarck's foreign policy had been to avoid a two-front war and of Moltke's military strategy to limit it, Schlieffen insisted on a two-front war conducted in an all-out fashion. With German deployment focused against France while the most likely origin of the conflict would be in Eastern Europe, Bismarck's nightmare question, \"what if there is a two-front war?\" was transformed into Schlieffen's nightmare question, \"what if there is *not* a two-front war?\" If France were to declare neutrality in a Balkan war, Germany might face the danger of a French declaration of war after Russian mobilization was complete, as Obruchev had already explained from the other side of the European dividing line. If, on the other hand, Germany ignored France's offer of neutrality, Schlieffen's plan would put Germany in the uncomfortable position of attacking non-belligerent Belgium in order to get to non-belligerent France. Schlieffen therefore had to invent a reason to assault France should France stay on the sidelines. He created an impossible standard for what Germany would accept as French neutrality: Germany would regard France as neutral only if it agreed to cede one of its major fortresses to Germany – in other words, only if France put itself at Germany's mercy and abdicated its position as a Great Power. The unholy mix of general political alliances and hair-trigger military strategies guaranteed a vast bloodletting. The balance of power had lost any semblance of the flexibility it had had during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Wherever war erupted (and it would almost certainly be in the Balkans), the Schlieffen Plan saw to it that the initial battles would be fought in the West between countries having next to no interest in the immediate crisis. Foreign policy had abdicated to military strategy, which now consisted of gambling on a single throw of the dice. A more mindless and technocratic approach to war would have been difficult to imagine.",

    "text": "Maintaining their unbroken record of misjudging the psychology of potential adversaries, the German leaders were now as convinced of the vastness of their opportunity as when they had tried to force Great Britain into an alliance by building a large navy, or to isolate France by threatening war over Morocco. Operating from the assumption that Austria's success might break their ever-tighter encirclement by disillusioning Russia with the Triple Entente, they ignored France, which they deemed irreconcilable, and evaded mediation by Great Britain lest it spoil their triumph. They had persuaded themselves that if, against all expectations, war did break out, Great Britain would either remain neutral or intervene too late. Yet Serge Sazonov, Russia's Foreign Minister at the outbreak of the war, described why Russia would not back off this time:\n\nEver since the Crimean War, we could entertain no illusions on the subject of Austria's feelings toward us. On the day she initiated her predatory policy in the Balkans, hoping thereby to prop up the tottering structure of her dominion, her relations with us became more and more unfriendly. We were able, however, to reconcile ourselves to this inconvenience, until it became clear that her Balkan policy had the sympathy of Germany, and received encouragement from Berlin. Russia felt it had to resist what it interpreted as a German maneuver to destroy its position among the Slavs by humiliating Serbia, its most reliable ally in the area. 'It was clear,' wrote Sazonov, 'that we had to do not with the rash decision of a short-sighted Minister, undertaken at his own risk and on his own responsibility, but with a carefully prepared plan, elaborated with the aid of the German Government, without whose consent and promise of support Austria-Hungary would never have ventured upon its execution.'\n\nAnother Russian diplomat later wrote nostalgically of the difference between the Germany of Bismarck and the Germany of the Kaiser:\n\nThe Great War was the inevitable consequence of the encouragement given by Germany to Austria-Hungary in her policy of penetration into the Balkans, which was combined with the grandiose Pan-German idea of a Germanized 'Middle-Europe.' In Bismarck's day this never would have happened. What did happen was the result of Germany's novel ambition to grapple with a task more stupendous than that of Bismarck without a Bismarck.\n\nThe Russian memoirs must be taken with a grain of salt because they were trying to shift the total responsibility for the war onto Germany's shoulders. Sazonov in particular must bear part of the blame because he clearly belonged to the war party pushing for full mobilization—even though his overall analysis has much merit.",

    "text": "The Russian diplomats were paying the Germans too great an honor, for the Kaiser and his advisers had no more of a long-range plan in 1914 than they had had during any previous crisis. The crisis over the Archduke's assassination ran out of control because no leader was prepared to back down and every country was concerned above all with living up to formal treaty obligations rather than to an overall concept of long-range common interest. What Europe lacked was some all-encompassing value system to bind the powers together, such as had existed in the Metternich system or the cold-blooded diplomatic flexibility of Bismarck's Realpolitik. World War I started not because countries broke their treaties, but because they fulfilled them to the letter.\n\nOf the curious aspects of the prelude to the First World War, one of the strangest was that nothing happened at first. Austria, true to its operating style, procrastinated, in part because Vienna needed time to overcome the reluctance of Hungarian Prime Minister Stephen Tisza to risk the Empire. When he finally yielded, Vienna issued a forty-eight-hour ultimatum to Serbia on July 23, deliberately putting forward such onerous conditions that they were sure to be rejected. Yet the delay had cost Austria the benefits of the widespread initial feelings of indignation in Europe over the Archduke's assassination. In Metternich's Europe, with its shared commitment to legitimacy, there can be little doubt that Russia would have sanctioned Austrian retribution against Serbia for the assassination of a prince in direct line of succession to the Austrian throne. But by 1914, legitimacy was no longer a common bond. Russia's sympathy for its ally, Serbia, outweighed its outrage at the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.\n\nFor the entire month following the assassination, Austrian diplomacy had been dilatory. Then came the mad rush to cataclysm in the space of less than a week. The Austrian ultimatum drove events out of the control of the political leaders. For once the ultimatum had been issued, any major country was in a position to trigger the irreversible race to mobilization. Ironically, the mobilization juggernaut was set off by the one country for which mobilization schedules were essentially irrelevant: Austria. For, alone among all the major powers, Austria's military plans were still old-fashioned in that they did not depend on speed. It mattered little to Austrian war plans which week the war started, as long as its armies were able to fight Serbia sooner or later. Austria had delivered its ultimatum to Serbia in order to forestall mediation, not to speed military operations. Nor did Austrian mobilization threaten any other major power, since it would take a month to be completed. Thus, the mobilization schedules which made war inevitable were set in motion by the country whose army did not actually start fighting until after the major battles in the West were already over.",

Ironically, Germany lost the offensive battle in the West and won the defensive battle in the East; much as the elder Moltke had foreseen; In the end; Germany was obliged to adopt Moltke's defensive strategy in the West as well after having committed itself to a policy which excluded the compromise political peace on which Moltke's strategy had been based; 216 willing pull they replied good day, day, prise INTO THE VORTEX: THE MILITARY DOOMSDAY MACHINE The Concert of Europe failed miserably because the political leader- had abdicated As a result; the sort of European Congress which throughout most of the nineteenth century had provided a cooling-off period or led to actual solution, was not even attempted. European leaders had provided for every contingency except the time needed for diplomatic conciliation: And they had forgotten Bismarcks dictum: \"Woe to the leader whose arguments at the end ofa war are not as plausible as were at the beginning' By the time events had run their course, 20 million lay dead; the Austro- Hungarian Empire had disappeared; three of the four dynasties which entered the war__the German, the Austrian, and the Russian -_were over- thrown: Only the British royal house remained standing: Afterward; it was hard to recall exactly what had triggered the conflagration. All that anyone knew was that; from the ashes produced by monumental folly, a new European system had to be constructed, though its nature was difficult to discern amidst the passion and the exhaustion deposited by the carnage: 217 ship an they",

    "text": "On November 11, 1918, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George announced that an armistice between Germany and the Allied Powers had been signed with these words: \"Ihope that we may say that thus, this fateful morning, come to end all wars. 1 In reality, Europe was a mere two decades away from an even more cataclysmic war: Since nothing about the First World War had gone aS planned; it was inevitable that the quest for peace would prove as futile as the expecta- tions with which nations had launched themselves into the catastrophe Every participant had anticipated a brief war and had left the determina- tion of its peace terms to the sort of diplomatic congress which had ended European conflicts for the past century: But as the casualties mounted to horrendous proportions, obliterated the political disputes of the 218 an they THE NEw FACE OF DIPLOMACY: WiLSON AND THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES prelude to the conflict the competition for influence in the Balkans, the possession of Alsace-Lorraine, and the naval race. The nations of Europe came to blame their suffering on the inherent evil of their adversaries, and convinced themselves that compromise could bring no real peace; the enemy had to be totally defeated or the war fought to utter exhaustion Had European leaders continued the practices of the prewar interna- tional order, a compromise peace would have been made in the spring of 1915. Offensives by each side had run their bloody course, and stalemate prevailed on all fronts. But just as mobilization schedules had run away with diplomacy in the week prior to the outbreak of the war; So now the scale of the sacrifices stood in the way of a sensible compromise. Instead, the leaders of Europe kept raising their terms, thereby not only com- pounding the incompetence and the irresponsibility with which they had slid into war; but destroying the world order in which their nations had coexisted for nearly a century: By the winter of 1914-15, military strategy and foreign policy had lost touch with each other: None of the belligerents dared to explore a compromise peace France would not settle without regaining Alsace- Lorraine; Germany would not consider a peace in which it would be asked to give up the territory it had conquered Once plunged into war, the leaders of Europe became s0 obsessed with fratricide; so maddened by the progressive destruction of an entire generation of their young men, that victory turned into its own reward; regardless of the ruins on which that triumph would have t0 be erected: Murderous offensives confirmed the military stalemate and produced casualties unimaginable before the advent of modern technology: Efforts to enlist new allies deepened the political deadlock For each new ally_Italy and Romania on the Allied side, Bulgaria on the side of the Central Powers__demanded its share of the anticipated booty, thereby destroying whatever flexibility might have remained to diplomacy: Peace terms gradually took on a nihilistic character: The aristocratic, somewhat conspiratorial style of nineteenth-century diplomacy proved irrelevant in the age of maSs mobilization: The Allied side specialized in (( couching the war in moral slogans such as 'the war to end all wars' Or (6 'making the world safe for Democracy' -especially after America en- tered the war. The first of these was understandable, if not highly promising, for nations that had been fighting each other in various combi- nations for a thousand years Its practical interpretation was the complete disarmament of Germany. The second proposition-~spreading democ racy_-required the overthrow of German and Austrian domestic institu- tions. Both Allied slogans therefore implied a fight to the finish: 219 deep- goals DIPLOMACY Great Britain; which in the Napoleonic Wars had produced a blueprint for European equilibrium via the Pitt Plan, supported the pressures for an all-out victory: In December 1914, a German feeler offering to with- draw from Belgium in exchange for the Belgian Congo was rejected by British Foreign Secretary Grey with the argument that the Allies must be given \"security against any future attack from Germany: 2 Greys comment marked a transformation in the British attitude. Until shortly before the outbreak of the war; Great Britain had identified its security with the balance of power, which it protected by supporting the weaker side against the stronger: By 1914, Great Britain felt less and less comfortable in this role: Sensing that Germany had become stronger than all the rest of the Continent combined, Great Britain felt it could no longer play its traditional role of trying to remain above the fray in Eu- rope. Because it perceived Germany aS a hegemonic threat in Europe, a return to the status quo ante would do nothing to alleviate the fundamen- tal problem: Thus, Great Britain; tOO, would no longer accept compro 4 mise and insisted on its own 'guarantees; which amounted to the permanent weakening of Germany, especially a sharp reduction of the German High Sea Fleet ~something Germany would never accept unless it were totally defeated. The German terms were both more precise and more geopolitical Yet with their characteristic lack of a sense of proportion, the German lead- ers , tOO, asked for what amounted to unconditional surrender; In the West; they demanded the annexation of the coal fields of northern France and military control over Belgium; including the port of Antwerp, which guaranteed Great Britain's implacable hostility: In the East; Germany only stated formal terms with respect to Poland, where, on November 5, 1916, it promised to create 'an independent State with a hereditary and consti- tutional monarchy\" 3 ~dashing any prospect for a compromise peace with Russia. (Germanys hope had been that the promise of Polish indepen- dence would produce enough Polish volunteers for five divisions; as it turned out; only 3,000 recruits showed up.)4 After defeating Russia, Ger- many imposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918, by which it annexed a third of European Russia and established a protectorate over the Ukraine. In finally Cefining what it meant by Weltpolitik, Germany was opting for the domination of Europe at the least; The First World War began as a typical cabinet war; with notes passed from embassy to embassy, and telegrams being distributed among sovereign monarchs at all the decisive steps On the road to actual combat But once war had been declared, and as the streets of European capitals filled with cheering throngs, the conflict ceased being a conflict of chan- 220 very being THE NEw FACE OF DIPLOMACY: WILSON AND THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES celleries and turned into a struggle of the masses. After the first two years of the war; each side was stating terms incompatible with any notion of equilibrium: What proved beyond everyone's imagination was that both Sides would win and lose at the same time: that Germany would defeat Russia and seriously weaken both France and England; but that; in the end; the Western Allies, with America's indispensable assistance, would emerge as the victors The aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars had been a century of peace based on equilibrium and sustained by common values The after- math of World War I was social upheaval, ideological conflict; and another world war, The enthusiasm that marked the beginning of the war evaporated once the peoples of Europe came t0 understand that their governments' ability to produce the carnage was not matched by a commensurate ability to achieve either victory Or peace. In the resulting maelstrom; the Eastern Courts, whose unity had sustained the peace of Europe in the days of the Holy Alliance, were overthrown: The Austro-Hungarian Empire disap- peared altogether: The Russian Empire was taken over by the Bolsheviks and for two decades receded into the periphery of Europe. Germany was successively racked by defeat; revolution, inflation, economic depression, and dictatorship. France and Great Britain did not benefit from the weak- ened state of their adversaries. They had sacrificed the best of their young men for a peace which left the enemy geopolitically stronger than it had been before the war: Before the full dimension of this largely self-inflicted debacle could become evident; a new player appeared on the scene to end once and for all what had up to this time been called the Concert of Europe. Amidst the rubble and the disillusionment of three years of carnage, America stepped into the international arena with a confidence; a power, and an idealism that were unimaginable to its more jaded European allies America's entry into the war made total victory technically possible, but it was for which bore little relation to the world order Europe had known for",

    "text": "some three centuries and for which it had presumably entered the war. America disdained the concept of the balance of power and considered the practice of Realpolitik immoral. America's criteria for international order were democracy, collective security, and self-determination—none of which had undergirded any previous European settlement. To Americans, the dissonance between their philosophy and European thought underlined the merit of their beliefs. Proclaiming a radical departure from the precepts and experiences of the Old World, Wilson's idea of world order derived from Americans' faith in the essentially peaceful nature of man and an underlying harmony of the world. It followed that democratic nations were, by definition, peaceful; people granted self-determination would no longer have reason to go to war or to oppress others. Once all the peoples of the world had tasted of the blessings of democracy, they would surely rise as one to defend their peace gains. European leaders had no categories of thought to encompass such views. Neither their domestic institutions nor their international order had been based on political theories postulating man's essential goodness. Rather, they had been designed to place man's demonstrated selfishness in the service of a higher good. European diplomacy was predicated not on the peace-loving nature of states but on their propensity for war, which needed to be either discouraged or balanced. Alliances were formed in the pursuit of specific, definable objectives, not in the defense of peace in the abstract. Wilson's doctrines of self-determination and collective security put European diplomats on thoroughly unfamiliar terrain. The assumption behind all European settlements had been that borders could be adjusted to promote the balance of power, the requirements of which took precedence over the preferences of the affected populations. This was how Pitt had envisaged the great masses to contain France at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Throughout the nineteenth century, for example, Great Britain and Austria resisted the breakup of the Ottoman Empire because they were convinced that the smaller nations emerging from it would undermine international order. To their way of thinking, the smaller nations' inexperience would magnify endemic ethnic rivalries, while their relative weakness would tempt Great Power encroachment. In the British and Austrian view, the smaller states had to subordinate their national ambitions to the broader interests of peace. In the name of equilibrium, France had been prevented from annexing the French-speaking Walloon part of Belgium, and Germany was discouraged from uniting with Austria (though Bismarck had his own reasons for not seeking a union with Austria). Wilson entirely rejected this approach, as the United States has done ever since. In America's view, it was not self-determination which caused wars but the lack of it; not the absence of a balance of power that produced instability but the pursuit of it. Wilson proposed to found peace on the principle of collective security. In his view and that of all his disciples, the security of the world called for, not the defense of the national interest, but of peace as a legal concept. The determination of whether a breach of peace had indeed been committed required an international institution, which Wilson defined as the League of Nations.",

    "text": "Oddly enough, the idea for such an organization first surfaced in London, heretofore the bastion of balance-of-power diplomacy. And the motive for it was not an attempt to invent a new world order but England's search for a good reason why America should enter a war of the old order. In September 1915, in a revolutionary departure from British practice, Foreign Secretary Grey wrote to Wilson's confidant, Colonel House, with a proposal which he believed the idealistic American President would not be able to refuse. To what extent, asked Grey, might the President be interested in a League of Nations committed to enforcing disarmament and to the pacific settlement of disputes? Would the President propose that there should be a League of Nations binding themselves to side against any Power which broke a treaty or which refused, in case of dispute, to adopt some other method of settlement than that of war? It was unlikely that Great Britain, which for 200 years had steered clear of open-ended alliances, had suddenly developed a taste for open-ended commitments on a global scale. Yet Great Britain's determination to prevail against the immediate threat of Germany was so great that its Foreign Secretary could bring himself to put forward a doctrine of collective security, the most open-ended commitment imaginable. Every member of his proposed world organization would have an obligation to resist aggression anywhere and from whatever quarter, and to penalize nations which rejected the pacific settlement of disputes. Grey knew his man. From the days of his youth, Wilson had believed that American federal institutions should serve as a model for an eventual 'parliament of man.' Early in his presidency, he was already exploring a Pan-American pact for the Western Hemisphere. Grey could not have been surprised—though surely he was gratified—to receive a prompt reply falling in with what was, in retrospect, his rather transparent hint. The exchange was perhaps the earliest demonstration of the \"special relationship\" between America and Great Britain that would enable Great Britain to maintain a unique influence in Washington after the decline of its power in the wake of the Second World War. A common language and cultural heritage combined with tactfulness to enable British leaders to inject their ideas into the American decision-making process in such a manner that they imperceptibly seemed to be a part of Washington's own. Thus, when, in May 1916, Wilson advanced for the first time his scheme for a world organization, he was no doubt convinced that it had been his own idea. And in a way it had been, since Grey had proposed it in full awareness of Wilson's likely convictions. Regardless of its immediate parentage, the League of Nations was a quintessentially American concept. What Wilson envisaged was a 'universal association of the nations to maintain the inviolate security of the highway of the seas for the common and unhindered use of all the nations of the world, and to prevent any war begun either contrary to treaty covenants or without warning and full submission of the causes to the opinion of the world'—a virtual guarantee of territorial integrity and political independence. Initially, however, Wilson refrained from offering American participation in this 'universal association.' Finally, in January 1917, he took the leap and advocated American membership, using, amazingly enough, the Monroe Doctrine as a model: 'I am proposing, as it were, that the nations should with one accord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doctrine of the world: that no nation should seek to extend its polity over any other nation or people; that all nations henceforth avoid entangling alliances which would draw them into competitions of power.' Mexico was probably astonished to learn that the president of the country which had seized a third of its territory in the nineteenth century and had sent its troops into Mexico the preceding year was now presenting the Monroe Doctrine as a guarantee for the territorial integrity of sister nations and as a classic example of international cooperation. Wilson's idealism stopped short of the belief that his views would prevail in Europe on their inherent merits. He showed himself quite prepared to supplement argument with pressure. Shortly after America entered the war in April 1917, he wrote to Colonel House: 'When the war is over we can force them to our way of thinking, because by that time they will, among other things, be financially in our hands.' For the time being, several of the Allies lingered over their responses to Wilson's idea. Though they could not quite bring themselves to approve views so contrary to their traditions, they also needed America far too much to voice their reservations. In late October 1917, Wilson dispatched House to ask the Europeans to formulate war aims which would reflect his proclaimed aim for a peace without annexations or indemnities safeguarded by a world authority. For several months, Wilson refrained from putting forward his own views because, as he explained to House, France and Italy might object if America expressed doubts about the justice of their territorial aspirations.",

    "text": "Before the Senate early in 1917, Wilson asserted that the establishment of equal rights among states would provide the precondition for maintaining peace through collective security regardless of the power each nation represented:\n\nRight must be based upon the common strength, not upon the individual strength, of the nations upon whose concert peace will depend. Equality of territory or of resources there of course cannot be; nor any other sort of equality not gained in the ordinary peaceful and legitimate development of the peoples themselves. But no one asks or expects anything more than an equality of rights. Mankind is looking now for freedom of life, not for equipoises of power.\n\nWilson was proposing a world order in which resistance to aggression would be based on moral rather than geopolitical judgments. Nations would ask themselves whether an act was unjust rather than whether it was threatening. Though America's allies had little faith in this new dispensation, they felt too weak to challenge it. America's allies knew, or thought they knew, how to calculate equilibrium based on power; they had no confidence that they, or anyone else, knew how to assess equilibrium on the basis of moral precepts.\n\nBefore America's entry into the war, the European democracies never dared to express openly their doubts about Wilson's ideas and indeed made every attempt to enlist Wilson by humoring him. By the time America did join the Allies, they were desperate. The combined forces of Great Britain, France, and Russia had not been sufficient to overcome Germany and, in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, they feared that America’s entry into the war might do no more than offset Russia's collapse. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia showed what fate Germany had in mind for the losers. Fear of German victory kept Great Britain and France from debating war aims with their idealistic American partner.\n\nAfter the Armistice, the Allies found themselves in a better position to express their reservations. Nor would it have been the first time that a European alliance was strained or broken in the aftermath of victory (for example, the Congress of Vienna went through a phase in which the victors threatened each other with war). Yet the victors of the First World War were too drained by their sacrifices and still too dependent on the American giant to risk a testy dialogue with it, or its withdrawal from the peace settlement. This was especially true of France, which now found itself in a truly tragic position. For two centuries it had struggled to achieve the mastery of Europe, but, in the war's aftermath, it no longer had confidence in its ability to protect even its own frontiers against a defeated enemy. French leaders felt instinctively that containing Germany was beyond the capacity of their ravaged society. War had exhausted France and the peace seemed to induce premonitions of further catastrophe. France, which had fought for its existence, now struggled for its identity. France dared not stand alone; its most powerful ally was proposing to found the peace on principles that turned security into a judicial process. Victory brought home to France the stark realization that revanche had cost it too dearly, and that it had been living off capital for nearly a century. France alone knew just how weak it had become in comparison with Germany, though nobody else, especially not America, was prepared to believe it.",

    "text": "Thus, on the eve of victory began a Franco-American dialogue which accelerated the process of French demoralization. Like Israel in the modern period, France masked its vulnerability with prickliness, and incipient panic with intransigence. And, like Israel in the modern period, it stood in constant danger of isolation. Though France's allies insisted that its fears were exaggerated, French leaders knew better. In 1880, the French had represented 15.7 percent of Europe's population. By 1900, that figure had declined to 9.7 percent. In 1920, France had a population of 41 million and Germany a population of 65 million, causing the French statesman Briand to answer critics of his conciliatory policy toward Germany with the argument that he was conducting the foreign policy of France's birthrate. France's relative economic decline was even more dramatic. In 1850, France had been the largest industrial nation on the Continent. By 1880, German production of steel, coal, and iron exceeded that of France. In 1913, France produced 41 million tons of coal compared with Germany’s 279 million tons; by the late 1930s, the disparity was to widen to 47 million tons produced by France against Germany's total of 351 million tons.\n\nThe residual strength of the defeated enemy marked the essential difference between the post-Vienna and post-Versailles international orders, and the reason for it was the disunity of the victors after Versailles. A coalition of powers defeated Napoleon and a coalition of powers was needed to surmount imperial Germany. Even after both of the vanquished—France in 1815 and Germany in 1918—remained strong enough to overcome any one of the coalition members singly and perhaps even a combination of two of them. The difference was that, in 1815, the peacemakers at the Congress of Vienna stayed united and formed the Quadruple Alliance, an overwhelming coalition of four powers that would crush any revisionist dreams. In the post-Versailles period, the victors did not remain allied; America and the Soviet Union withdrew altogether; and Great Britain was highly ambivalent as far as France was concerned. It was not until the post-Versailles period that France came to the searing realization that its defeat by Germany in 1871 had not been an aberration. The only way France could have maintained equilibrium with Germany by itself would have been to break Germany up into its component states, perhaps by re-establishing the German Confederation of the nineteenth century. Indeed, France fitfully pursued this objective by encouraging separatism in the Rhineland and by occupying the Saar coal mines. Two obstacles, however, stood in the way of the partitioning of Germany: For one, Bismarck had built too well.",

    "text": "The Paris Peace Conference of 1919, tasked with crafting a post-World War I settlement, faced a daunting array of issues.  Fifty-eight committees were established, grappling with territorial disputes, war criminals, reparations, and the formation of the League of Nations. However, beneath the surface of these deliberations lay a fundamental divergence in perspective, particularly between the American and French visions of international order.  Woodrow Wilson, the American President, championed a vision of collective security and self-determination, believing that inherent global harmony could be achieved through proper institutions.  He rejected the notion of structural causes for international conflict, instead seeking to create a framework that would reveal a shared sense of community. In stark contrast, France, scarred by repeated invasions and acutely aware of its vulnerability, prioritized tangible security guarantees. Two German occupations within a half-century had instilled a deep-seated fear of future aggression. France sought concrete measures to protect itself, either through the weakening of Germany or through assurances of military support from other powers, primarily the United States and Great Britain.  Dismembering Germany, however, was opposed by the Americans, leaving collective security and a potential Anglo-American security guarantee as the remaining options.  The former was deemed too nebulous by the French, while the latter was met with reluctance by both potential guarantors.  France found itself in the precarious position of relying on world opinion for its security, a prospect that deeply unsettled French negotiators.  They argued for a buffer zone, preferably the separation of the Rhineland from Germany, but this proposal clashed with American ideals of self-determination. The British, similarly, saw an independent Rhineland as a source of instability.  France countered that its security needs were comparable to British imperial interests, and that without a buffer zone, an alliance with Great Britain and the United States was essential.",

    "text": "Wilson's concept of the League of Nations, presented in February 1919, offered a glimmer of hope for France.  Wilson envisioned the League as a mechanism for both enforcing the peace and rectifying any inherent inequities within the treaty.  He portrayed it as an international tribunal capable of adjusting boundaries based on principles of justice and evolving circumstances.  This notion appealed to French anxieties, as it suggested a potential avenue for addressing future threats.  However, Wilson's vision relied heavily on the moral force of world public opinion and economic pressure as deterrents to aggression, a perspective that contrasted sharply with the European experience of power politics.  Furthermore, Wilson's ideas, bordering on world government, were unlikely to find support within the United States, let alone the rest of the world. French skepticism stemmed from their precarious geopolitical reality.  Having barely survived the war, France faced a power vacuum in Eastern Europe and a Germany with superior strength. Collective security, with its assumption of shared threat assessments and unified responses, offered little solace.  France needed a guarantee specific to its circumstances, not a general assurance. The American delegation, however, remained steadfast in its refusal to provide such a guarantee.  Wilson's reluctance, while understandable given domestic political constraints, fueled French anxieties. The American commitment to the Monroe Doctrine contrasted with its hesitancy to address European security concerns, raising doubts about the American commitment to European stability.  France pressed for an international army or automatic enforcement mechanisms within the League, but these proposals were met with resistance from Wilson's advisors, who cited constitutional limitations and the improbability of Senate ratification.  Wilson retreated to the doctrine of collective security, emphasizing trust and faith in the member nations, an argument that failed to resonate with the French, who sought tangible guarantees, not abstract promises.  Lord Cecil, a British delegate, underscored the French dilemma, pointing out that America had little to gain from the League and that its offer of support was a gift to France. Faced with this reality, France reluctantly accepted the ambiguous wording of Article 10 of the League Covenant, which offered little more than a framework for future consultation in times of crisis.",

    "text": "A French memorandum highlighted the inadequacy of the League's security arrangements, arguing that a formal alliance, such as the one between Britain and France in 1914, would have resulted in a more prompt intervention and potentially averted German victory. With concrete American security guarantees off the table, France renewed its push for the dismemberment of Germany, proposing an independent Rhineland as a buffer zone.  When this proposal was rejected, France suggested a temporary separation of the Rhineland until the League's enforcement mechanisms could be tested. As a compromise, Wilson and the British leaders offered a treaty guaranteeing the Versailles settlement, pledging to go to war if Germany violated it.  This offer mirrored the post-Napoleonic arrangements, but with a crucial difference: after Waterloo, the allies genuinely perceived a French threat; after World War I, the Anglo-American guarantee lacked conviction and a firm resolve for implementation.  While the French negotiator celebrated the British commitment as unprecedented, the underlying reality was that the guarantee was offered without a genuine belief in its necessity or a strong determination to uphold it.",

    "text": "In their eagerness for formal guarantees, French leaders overlooked the crucial fact that the unprecedented Anglo-Saxon decisions were primarily a tactic to induce France to abandon its demand that Germany be dismembered. In foreign policy, the term unprecedented is always somewhat suspect because the actual range of innovation is so circumscribed by history, domestic institutions, and geography. Had Tardieu been privy to the American delegation's reaction, he would have understood how tenuous the guarantee really was. Wilson's advisers were unanimous in opposing their chief. Had not the new diplomacy been explicitly created to do away with this type of national commitment? Had America fought the war only to end up in a traditional alliance? House wrote in his diary: 'I thought I ought to call the President's attention to the perils of such a treaty. Among other things, it would be looked upon as a direct blow at the League of Nations. The League is supposed to do just what this treaty proposed, and if it were necessary for the nations to make such treaties, then why the League of Nations?' It was a fair question: For if the League performed as advertised, the guarantee was unnecessary; and if the guarantee was necessary, the League was not living up to its design and all postwar concepts would be in doubt. The isolationists in the United States Senate had misgivings of their own; they were not so much worried that the guarantee conflicted with the League as that the devious Europeans were luring America into the web of their corrupt ancient entanglements. The guarantee did not last long. The Senate's refusal to ratify the Treaty of Versailles rendered it moot; and Great Britain jumped at the pretext to release itself from its commitment as well. France's abandonment of its claims turned out to be permanent, and the guarantee ephemeral.",

    "text": "Out of all these crosscurrents finally emerged the Treaty of Versailles, named after the Hall of Mirrors of Versailles Palace in which it was signed. The location seemed to invite unnecessary humiliation. Fifty years earlier, Bismarck had tactlessly proclaimed the unified Germany there; now, the victors inflicted an insult of their own. Nor was their handiwork likely to calm the international environment. Too punitive for conciliation, too lenient to keep Germany from recovering, the Treaty of Versailles condemned the exhausted democracies to constant vigilance and to the need for permanent enforcement against an irreconcilable and revisionist Germany. The Fourteen Points notwithstanding, the Treaty was punitive in territorial, economic, and military areas. Germany had to surrender 13 percent of its prewar territory: Economically important Upper Silesia was handed over to a newly created Poland, which also received an outlet to the Baltic Sea and the area around Posen, thereby creating the 'Polish Corridor' separating East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The tiny territory of Eupen-et-Malmedy was given to Belgium, and Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France. Germany lost its colonies, the legal status of which occasioned a dispute between Wilson on the one side and France, Great Britain, and Japan on the other, all three of which wanted to annex their share of the spoils. Wilson insisted that such a direct transfer would violate the principle of self-determination. The Allies finally arrived at the so-called Mandate Principle, which was as ingenious as it was hypocritical. German colonies as well as former Ottoman territories in the Middle East were assigned to the various victors with a 'mandate' under League supervision to facilitate their independence. What that meant was never specifically defined, nor in the end did the mandates lead to independence any more rapidly than in other colonial areas. The Treaty's military restrictions reduced the German army to 100,000 volunteers and its navy to six cruisers and a few smaller vessels. Germany was forbidden to possess offensive weapons such as submarines, aircraft, tanks, or heavy artillery, and its general staff was dissolved. To supervise German disarmament, an Allied Military Control Commission was created and given, as it turned out, extremely vague and ineffective authority. Despite Lloyd George's electioneering promise to 'squeeze' Germany, the Allies began to realize that an economically prostrate Germany might produce a world economic crisis affecting their own societies. But the victorious populations showed little interest in the warnings of theoretical economists. The British and the French demanded that Germany indemnify their civilian populations for all damages. Against his better judgment, Wilson finally agreed to a provision that made Germany pay for the pensions of war victims and some compensation for their families. Such a provision was unheard of; no previous European peace treaty had ever contained such a clause. No figure was set for these claims; it was to be determined at some later date, generating a source of endless controversy. Other economic penalties included immediate payment of $5 billion in cash or in kind. France was to receive large quantities of coal as compensation for Germany's destruction of its mines during the occupation of eastern France. To make up for ships sunk by German submarines, Great Britain was awarded much of the German merchant fleet. Germany's foreign assets, totaling about $7 billion, were seized, with many German patents (thanks to the Versailles Treaty, Bayer Aspirin is an American, not a German product). Germany's major rivers were internationalized, and its ability to raise tariffs was restricted. These terms mortgaged the new international order instead of helping to create it.",

    "text": "The most dangerous weakness of the Versailles settlement, however, was psychological. The world order created by the Congress of Vienna had been cemented by the principle of conservative unity that had meshed with the requirements of the balance of power; in effect, the powers that were most needed to maintain the settlement also considered it just. The Versailles settlement was stillborn because the values it extolled clashed with the incentives needed to enforce it: the majority of the states required to defend the agreement considered it unjust in one way or another.\n\nThe paradox of the First World War was that it had been fought to curb German power and looming predominance, and that it had aroused public opinion to a pitch which prevented the establishment of a conciliatory peace. Yet, in the end, Wilsonian principles inhibited a peace which curbed Germany's power and there was no shared sense of justice. The price they paid for conducting foreign policy on the basis of abstract principles is the impossibility of distinguishing among individual cases. Since the leaders at Versailles were not willing to reduce German power by either the implicit rights of victory or the calculations of the balance of power, they were obliged to justify German disarmament as the first installment of a general plan of disarmament, and reparations as an expiation of guilt for the war itself. In justifying German disarmament in this way, the Allies undermined the psychological readiness that was required to sustain their agreement. From the first, Germany could, and did, claim that it was being discriminated against, and demanded that it either be permitted to rearm or that other nations disarm to its level. In the process, the disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles ended up demoralizing the victors. At every disarmament conference, Germany would seize the moral high ground, in which it was usually supported by Great Britain. But if France did grant Germany equality in rearmament, the possibility of safeguarding the independence of the nations of Eastern Europe would vanish. The disarmament clauses were therefore bound to lead to either the disarmament of France or the rearmament of Germany. In neither case would France be strong enough to defend Eastern Europe or, in the long run, even itself.\n\nSimilarly, the prohibition against the union of Austria and Germany violated the principle of self-determination, as did the presence of a large German minority in Czechoslovakia and, to a lesser extent, of a German minority in Poland. German irredentism was thus supported by the organizing principle of the Treaty of Versailles, compounding the guilty conscience of the democracies.",

    "text": "The gravest psychological blight on the Treaty was Article 231, the so-called War Guilt clause. It stated that Germany was solely responsible for the outbreak of World War I, and delivered a severe moral censure. Most of the punitive measures against Germany in the Treaty—economic, military, and political—were based on the assertion that the whole conflagration had been entirely Germany's fault.\n\nEighteenth-century peacemakers would have regarded war guilt clauses as absurd. For them, wars were amoral inevitabilities caused by clashing interests. In the treaties that concluded eighteenth-century wars, the losers paid a price without its being justified on moral grounds. But for Wilson and the peacemakers at Versailles, the cause of the war of 1914-18 had to be ascribed to some evil which had to be punished. When the hatreds had diminished, however, astute observers began to see that responsibility for the outbreak of the war was far more complicated. To be sure, Germany bore a heavy responsibility, but was it fair to single out Germany for punitive measures? Was Article 231 really proper? Once this question began being asked, especially in Great Britain in the 1920s, the will to enforce the punitive measures against Germany contained in the Treaty began to waver. The peacemakers, assailed by their own consciences, wondered if what they had wrought was fair, and this fostered a lack of resolve in maintaining the Treaty. Germany, of course, was irresponsible on this issue. In German public discourse, Article 231 became known as the 'War Guilt Lie.' The physical difficulty of establishing a balance of power was matched by the psychological difficulty of creating a moral equilibrium. Thus, the framers of the Versailles settlement achieved the precise opposite of what they had set out to do. They had tried to weaken Germany physically but instead strengthened it geopolitically. From a long-term point of view, Germany was in a far better position to dominate Europe after Versailles than it had been before the war. As soon as Germany threw off the shackles of disarmament, which was just a matter of time, it was bound to emerge more powerful than ever. Harold Nicolson summed it up: “We came to Paris confident that the new order was about to be established; we left it convinced that the new order had merely fouled the old.”",

    "text": "At the end of the First World War, the age-old debate about the relative roles of morality and interest in international affairs seemed to have been resolved in favor of the dominance of law and ethics. Under the shock of the cataclysm, many hoped for a better world as free as possible from the kind of Realpolitik which, in their view, had decimated the youth of a generation. America emerged as the catalyst of this process even as it was withdrawing into isolationism. Wilson's legacy was that Europe embarked on the Wilsonian course of trying to preserve stability via collective security rather than the traditional European approach of alliances and the balance of power, despite the absence of America. In subsequent American usage, alliances in which America participated (such as NATO) were generally described as instruments of collective security. This is not, however, how the term was originally conceived, for in their essence, the concepts of collective security and of alliances are diametrically opposed. Traditional alliances were directed against specific threats and defined precise obligations for specific groups of countries linked by shared national interests or mutual security concerns. Collective security defines no particular threat, guarantees no individual nation, and discriminates against none. It is theoretically designed to resist any threat to the peace, by whoever might pose it and against whomever it might be directed. Alliances always presume a specific potential adversary; collective security defends international law in the abstract, which it seeks to sustain in much the same way that a judicial system upholds a domestic criminal code. It no more assumes a particular culprit than does domestic law. In an alliance, the casus belli is an attack on the interests or the security of its members. The casus belli of collective security is the violation of the principle of “peaceful” settlement of disputes in which all peoples of the world are assumed to have a common interest. Therefore, force has to be assembled on a case-by-case basis from a shifting group of nations with a mutual interest in “peacekeeping.” The purpose of an alliance is to produce an obligation more predictable and precise than an analysis of national interest. Collective security works in the exact opposite way: It leaves the application of its principles to the interpretation of particular circumstances when they arise, unintentionally putting a large premium on the mood of the moment and, hence, on national self-will. Collective security contributes to security only if all nations—or at least all nations relevant to collective defense—share nearly identical views about the nature of the challenge and are prepared to use force or apply sanctions on the merits of the case, regardless of the specific national interest they may have in the issues at hand. Only if these conditions are fulfilled can a world organization devise sanctions or act as an arbiter of international affairs. This was how Wilson had perceived the role of collective security as the end of the war approached in September 1918: “National purposes have fallen more and more into the background and the common purpose of enlightened mankind has taken their place. The counsels of plain men have become on all hands more simple and straightforward and more unified than the counsels of sophisticated men of affairs, who still retain the impression that they are playing a game of power and playing for high stakes.” The fundamental difference between the Wilsonian and the European interpretations of the causes of international conflict is reflected in these words. European-style diplomacy presumes that national interests have a tendency to clash, and views diplomacy as the means for reconciling them; Wilson, on the other hand, considered international discord the result of “clouded thinking,” not an expression of a genuine clash of interests. In the practice of Realpolitik, statesmen shoulder the task of relating particular interests to general ones through a balance of incentives and penalties. In the Wilsonian view, statesmen are required to apply universal principles to specific cases. Moreover, statesmen are generally treated as the causes of conflict because they are believed to distort man’s natural bent toward harmony with abstruse and selfish calculations.",

    "text": "The conduct of most statesmen at Versailles belied Wilsonian expectations. Without exception, they stressed their national interests, leaving the defense of the common purposes to Wilson, whose country in fact had no national interest (in the European sense) in the territorial issues of the settlement. It is in the nature of prophets to redouble their efforts, not to abandon them, in the face of a recalcitrant reality. The obstacles Wilson encountered at Versailles raised no doubt in his mind about the feasibility of his new dispensation. On the contrary, they fortified his faith in its necessity. And he was confident that the League and the weight of world opinion would correct the provisions of the Treaty that departed from his principles. Indeed, the power of Wilson’s ideals was demonstrated by their impact on Great Britain, the motherland of the balance-of-power policy. The official British commentary on the League Covenant declared that “the ultimate and most effective sanction must be the public opinion of the civilized world,” as Lord Cecil argued before the House of Commons, “what we rely upon is public opinion and if we are wrong about it, then the whole thing is wrong.”\n\nIt seems improbable that the scions of the policy of Pitt, Canning, Palmerston, and Disraeli would have come to such conclusions on their own. At first they went along with Wilson’s policy in order to ensure American support in the war. As time went on, Wilsonian principles succeeded in capturing British public opinion. By the 1920s and 1930s, Great Britain’s defense of collective security was no longer tactical, Wilsonianism had made a genuine convert. In the end, collective security fell prey to the weakness of its central premise - that all nations have the same interest in resisting a particular act of aggression and are prepared to run identical risks in opposing it. Experience has shown these assumptions to be false. No act of aggression involving a major power has ever been defeated by applying the principle of collective security. Either the world community has refused to assess the act as one which constituted aggression, or it has disagreed over the appropriate sanctions. And when sanctions were applied, they inevitably reflected the lowest common denominator, often proving so ineffectual that they did more harm than good. At the time of the Japanese conquest of Manchuria in 1932, the League had no machinery for sanctions. It remedied this defect, but faced with Italian aggression against Abyssinia, it voted for sanctions while stopping short of imposing a cutoff of oil with the slogan “All sanctions short of war.” When Austria was forcibly united with Germany and Czechoslovakia’s freedom was extinguished, there was no League reaction at all. The last act of the League of Nations, which no longer contained Germany, Japan, or Italy, was to expel the Soviet Union after it attacked Finland in 1939. It had no effect on Soviet actions. During the Cold War, the United Nations proved equally ineffective in every case involving Great Power aggression, due to either the communist veto in the Security Council or the reluctance on the part of smaller countries to run risks on behalf of issues they felt did not concern them. The United Nations was ineffective or at the sidelines during the Berlin crises and during the…",

    "text": "Soviet interventions in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Afghanistan proved the irrelevance of collective security.  It was similarly inconsequential in the Cuban Missile Crisis until the superpowers reached a bilateral agreement. America's invocation of UN authority against North Korea in 1950 succeeded only because the Soviet representative was absent from the Security Council and the General Assembly was still predominantly anti-Soviet. While the United Nations provided a valuable venue for diplomacy and technical functions, it failed in its core mission of collective security—preventing war and resisting aggression. This remained true even post-Cold War.  In the 1991 Gulf War, the UN ratified American actions, but the response to Iraqi aggression was not an application of collective security. The United States acted unilaterally, deploying a large force. Other nations could only influence events by joining the American effort. Collective security served as a justification for American leadership, not a substitute for it. These lessons were unlearned in the interwar period. Post-Versailles statesmen mistakenly believed armaments caused tensions, not the reverse, and that goodwill could eradicate conflict.  They overlooked the impracticality of collective security given the exclusion of three major powers: the United States, which refused to join the League of Nations; Germany, which was barred; and the Soviet Union, which was ostracized. France, despite being victorious, suffered most under the postwar order. Its leaders knew the Treaty of Versailles wouldn't permanently restrain Germany.  Marshal Foch's prediction that the treaty was merely a twenty-year armistice proved accurate. By 1924, the British ground forces predicted renewed German aggression within ten years, mirroring French assessments.  They foresaw France's vulnerability unless it formed alliances with major powers.  Yet, British leaders mistakenly believed a too-powerful France needed balancing, while Germany, seen as the aggrieved party, required conciliation. This misjudgment of trends proved disastrous. British leaders failed to recognize the long-term dangers, perceiving France as the primary threat. The British Foreign Office viewed the French occupation of the Rhineland as a potential springboard for expansion into Central Europe, even seeing it as an encirclement of Belgium. The Admiralty echoed outdated fears, invoking historical rivalries. Maintaining a balance of power was impossible while Britain misidentified the threat.  Some in Britain even considered Germany a necessary counterweight to France. The British Ambassador in Berlin argued that a unified Germany balanced France, while its disintegration would grant France unchecked power. While Britain correctly advocated for Germany’s reintegration into the international community, appeasing German grievances wouldn’t stabilize Europe given the shifting balance of power.  France and Britain, whose unity was crucial, were locked in mutual incomprehension.  Britain exaggerated French strength, while France overestimated its ability to contain Germany through the Versailles Treaty. Britain's fear of French hegemony was unfounded, while France's belief in its ability to suppress Germany was delusional.",

    "text": "British leaders considered the Versailles Treaty unjust, particularly regarding Eastern Europe, fearing an alliance with France might entangle them in conflicts over peripheral issues. Lloyd George articulated the prevailing view that the British public wouldn't support involvement in disputes concerning Poland, Danzig, or Upper Silesia, perceiving the region as unstable.  Consequently, discussions of a French alliance served primarily as a tactic to alleviate pressure on Germany. France persisted in its quest to contain Germany, while Britain sought security arrangements without firm commitments. This was an intractable problem, as Britain refused to provide the one assurance—a full military alliance—that might have moderated French policy. Recognizing the impossibility of a formal alliance in 1922, French Prime Minister Briand proposed an entente cordiale, mirroring the 1904 agreement. However, Britain, now more wary of France than Germany, saw the proposal as a way to improve relations with Germany. A Cabinet note revealed the cynical rationale: supporting Germany was strategically important due to trade and its potential role in containing Russia.  An alliance with France would preclude such a strategy. Whether due to suspicion or the arrangement’s vagueness, French President Millerand rejected Briand's scheme, leading to the Prime Minister's resignation. Failing to secure a traditional alliance, France attempted to achieve the same outcome through the League of Nations by defining aggression and establishing a universal obligation to aid victims. In 1923, the League devised a Treaty of Mutual Assistance.  The League Council would designate aggressor and victim, obligating members to assist the victim, by force if necessary.  However, to qualify for aid, the victim must have signed a disarmament agreement and reduced its forces, perversely incentivizing aggression by weakening potential victims.  Furthermore, the lengthy negotiation process for disarmament treaties created a security vacuum. The Treaty failed to gain support; the United States and Soviet Union rejected it, and Germany’s opinion was ignored.  Britain ultimately withdrew its support, realizing the treaty's overextension of its forces. The situation was absurd: resisting aggression was contingent on the victim’s disarmament, ignoring geopolitical realities and strategic importance.  France, undeterred, continued seeking criteria for collective security, encouraged by the MacDonald government's support for the League's progressive causes. They formulated the 1924 Geneva Protocol, requiring League arbitration for all conflicts and defining aggression as refusal of conciliation, arbitration, or judicial settlement. Victims, also required to participate in disarmament, would receive assistance from all signatories. The Protocol failed because it was simultaneously too demanding for Britain and insufficient for France. Britain aimed for French disarmament, not increased defense obligations. France prioritized mutual assistance, with disarmament secondary.  The United States further undermined the Protocol by refusing to honor it.  The British Cabinet withdrew the Protocol after warnings about overextending British forces.",

The wisest course for the Allies would have been to relieve Germany voluntarily of the most onerous provisions of Versailles and to forge a firm Franco-British alliance: This is what Winston Churchill had in mind when he advocated an alliance with France 'if (and only if) she entirely alters her treatment of Germany and loyally accepts a British policy of help and friendship towards Germany:' Such a policy was never pursued with any consistency; however: French leaders were too afraid of both Germany and their own opinion, which was deeply hostile to Germany, and British leaders were too suspicious of French designs: The disarmament provisions of the Treaty of Versailles widened the Anglo-French split: Ironically, eased Germany's road toward military parity, which, given the weakness of Eastern Europe; would spell geopolitical superiority in the long run: For one the Allies had compounded discrimination with incompetence by neglecting to set up any prior verification machinery for the disarmament provisions. In a letter to Colonel House in 1919, Andre Tardieu; a principal French negotiator at Versailles, predicted that the failure to set up verification machinery would cripple the disarmament clauses of the Treaty: 'a weak instrument is being drawn up, dangerous and absurd; Will the League say to Germany, 'Prove that my information is false,' or even; 'We wish to verify:' But then it is claiming a right of supervision; and Germany will reply: 'By what right?' That is what Germany will reply and she will be justified in so replying if she is not forced by the Treaty to recognize the right of verification;' In the innocent days before the study of arms control had become an academic subject, no one thought it odd to be asking Germany to verify its own disarmament: To be sure; an Inter-Allied Military Control Commission had been set up. But it had no independent right of inspection; it could only ask the German government for information about German violations--not exactly a foolproof procedure: The Commission was disbanded in 1926, leaving the verification of German compliance to Allied intelligence services No wonder the disarmament provisions were being grossly violated before Hitler refused to carry them out; On the political level, German leaders skillfully insisted on the general disarmament promised in the Versailles Treaty, of which their own disarmament was to have been the first stage With the passage of time, they managed to obtain British support for this proposition, and used it as well to justify the failure to fulfill other provisions of the Treaty: To pressure on France, Great Britain announced dramatic reductions of its own ground forces (on which it had never relied for security), though not of its navy (on which; of course, it did) France's security, On the other hand, depended totally on its standing army's being significantly larger than Germany's because the industrial potential of Germany and its population were so superior: The pressure to alter this balance -through either German rearmament or French disarmament-had the practical consequence of reversing the results of the war; By the time Hitler came to power, it was already quite apparent that the disarmament provisions of the Treaty would soon be in tatters; making Germany's geopolitical advantage apparent:",

After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Germany did not feel compelled to invoke any principle other than its victory for the indemnity it imposed on France; nor did it do so in 1918 with respect to the staggering reparations bill it presented to Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk Yet; in the new world order of Versailles, the Allies had come to believe that reparations required a moral justification found it in Article 231, or the War Guilt Clause, described in the previous chapter. The clause was furiously attacked in Germany, and eliminated the already incentive there to cooperate with the peace settlement: One of the astonishing aspects of the Versailles Treaty was that its drafters included so invidious and precise a clause on war without specifying the total amount to be paid in reparations The determination of the reparations figure had been left to future expert commissions because the amount which the Allies had led their publics to expect was so exorbitant; it could never have survived Wilson's scrutiny or the analysis of serious financial experts. In this manner, reparations, like disarmament; became a weapon of the German revisionists; experts increasingly doubted not only the morality but the feasibility of the claims John Maynard Keynes' Treatise on the Economic Consequences of the Peace was a prime example.!5 Finally, the bargaining position of the victor always diminishes with time. Whatever is not exacted during the shock of defeat becomes increasingly difficult to attain later_~a lesson America had to learn with respect to Iraq at the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It was not until 1921--two years after the signing of the Versailles Treaty_~that a figure for reparations was finally established It was absurdly high: 132 billion Goldmarks (some $40 billion; which amounts to approximately $323 billion in present value), a sum which would have necessitated German payments for the rest of the century: Predictably, Germany claimed insolvency; even if the international financial system could have accommodated such a vast transfer of resources, no democratic German government could have survived agreeing to it In the summer of 1921, Germany paid the first installment of the reparations bill, transferring 1 billion Marks ($250 million) But it did so by printing paper Marks and selling them for foreign currency on the open market-~in other words, by inflating its currency to the point where no significant transfer of resources was taking place At the end of 1922, Germany proposed a four-year moratorium on reparations The demoralization of the Versailles international order and of France; its leading European pillar, was now far advanced: No enforcement machinery existed for reparations, and no verification machinery for disarmament:",

    "text": "advocated the policy of 'no war, no peace.' Yet the weaker side has the option of playing for time only against an adversary that considers negotiations as operating according to their own internal logic_~an illusion to which the United States has been especially subject. The Germans had no such views. When Trotsky returned with instructions proclaiming a policy of neither peace nor war and announced unilaterally that the war was over, the Germans resumed military operations. Faced with total defeat; Lenin and his colleagues accepted Hoffmann's terms and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, accepting coexistence with imperial Germany: The principle of coexistence would be invoked time and again over the next sixty years by the Soviets, with the reactions of the protagonists remaining constant: the democracies would each time hail the Soviet proclamation of peaceful coexistence as a sign of conversion to a permanent policy of peace. Yet; for their part, communists always justified periods of peaceful coexistence on the ground that the relation of forces was not conducive to confrontation. The obvious corollary was that; as that relationship changed, so would the Bolsheviks' devotion to peaceful coexistence. According to Lenin; it was reality which dictated coexistence with the capitalist foe: 'By concluding a separate peace, we are freeing ourselves in the largest measure possible at the present moment from both warring imperialist groups; by utilizing their mutual enmity we utilize the war; which makes a bargain between them against us difficult,' The high point of that policy was, of course, the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939. Potential inconsistencies were easily rationalized. 'We are convinced;' said a communist statement; 'that the most consistent socialist policy can be reconciled with the sternest realism and most level-headed practicality.' In 1920, Soviet policy took the final step in acknowledging the need for a more traditional policy toward the West when Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin said: 'There may be differences of opinion as to the duration of the capitalist system; but at present the capitalist system exists, so that a modus vivendi must be found.' Despite the revolutionary rhetoric; in the end national interest emerged as a dominant Soviet goal, becoming elevated into a socialist verity just as it had stood for so long at the core of the policies of the capitalist states. Survival was now the immediate goal and coexistence the tactic: Yet the socialist state soon confronted another military threat when; in April 1920, it was attacked by Poland. Polish forces reached the neighborhood of Kiev before they were defeated: When the Red Army, in a counterthrust; approached Warsaw, the Western Allies intervened, demanding an end to the offensive and peace: British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon proposed a dividing line between Poland and Russia which the Soviets were prepared to accept: Poland, however; refused, so the final settlement was made along the prewar military lines, far to the east of what Curzon had proposed. Poland thus managed to sharpen the antagonism of its two historic enemies: Germany, from which it had acquired Upper Silesia and the Polish corridor; and the Soviet Union, from which it had seized the territory east of what became known as the Curzon Line. When the smoke cleared; the Soviet Union found itself free at last of wars and revolution; yet having paid for it with the loss of most of the tsars' conquests in the Baltic; Finland, Poland, Bessarabia, and the Turkish frontier. By 1923, Moscow had reclaimed control of Ukraine and Georgia, which had seceded from the Russian Empire during the turmoil-~an event not forgotten by many contemporary Russian leaders. To restore domestic control, the Soviet Union had to make a pragmatic compromise between revolutionary crusades and Realpolitik, between the proclamation of world revolution and the practice of peaceful coexistence: Though it opted to defer world revolution, the Soviet Union was far from a supporter of the existing order: It saw in peace an opportunity to pit the capitalists against each other. Its particular target was Germany, which had always played a major role in Soviet thought and in Russian sentiment;",

    "text": "The Treaty of Versailles had left open the possibility of the Soviet government not acknowledging tsarist debts or recognizing British and French financial claims.  Moscow also wanted to avoid adding Germany to its list of adversaries.  To prevent the Genoa Conference from resolving this issue to their disadvantage, Moscow proposed that Germany and the Soviet Union establish diplomatic relations and mutually renounce all claims against each other. Germany evaded the proposition, not wanting to be the first European country to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and jeopardize its chances of obtaining relief from reparations. Soviet Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin used the Genoa Conference to proclaim 'peaceful coexistence' and practical cooperation.  He proposed a sweeping agenda, including the abolition of weapons of mass destruction, a world economic conference, and international control of waterways. This aimed to mobilize Western public opinion and portray Moscow as peaceful, making it difficult for the democracies to organize an anti-communist crusade.  Both Germany and the Soviet Union felt isolated at Genoa.  The Western Allies rebuffed German requests for a meeting with Lloyd George, while France proposed private consultations with Great Britain and the Soviet Union, excluding Germany. These meetings aimed to resurrect the idea of trading tsarist debts for German reparations, a proposal the Soviets saw as a trap. By the end of the first week, Germany and the Soviet Union worried about being pitted against each other.  On April 16, 1922, a Soviet aide proposed a meeting with the German delegation at Rapallo. Germany accepted, eager to end its isolation.  The two foreign ministers quickly drafted an agreement establishing full diplomatic relations, renouncing claims, and granting each other Most Favored Nation status. Lloyd George tried to intervene, but the agreement was signed.  Within a year, Germany and the Soviet Union were negotiating secret agreements for military and economic cooperation. Rapallo, though later seen as a symbol of dangerous rapprochement, was an accident born of Western Allies' ostracism of both countries, the creation of a belt of weak, hostile states between them, and their dismemberment. This incentivized Germany and the Soviet Union to cooperate in undermining Versailles.",

    "text": "Traditional balance-of-power diplomacy would have dictated an anti-German alliance between Great Britain and France to contain Germany. However, both were weaker than Germany individually and needed a coalition, which never formed. Britain abandoned its pursuit of equilibrium, oscillating between balancing against France and pursuing collective security. France, desperate, alternated between using the Treaty of Versailles to delay German recovery and attempting reconciliation. Thus, Gustav Stresemann, the statesman who shaped 1920s diplomacy, came from defeated Germany. In late 1922, with reparations elusive, disarmament controversial, British security guarantees unavailable, and German-Soviet rapprochement underway, France, led by Raymond Poincare, unilaterally enforced the Versailles reparations clause by occupying the Ruhr in January 1923.  This action, taken without consulting the other Allies, was criticized by Lloyd George, who linked it to Rapallo. However, a British security guarantee could have prevented it. France's unilateral action backfired. The German government ordered passive resistance, bankrupting itself and causing hyperinflation, but also preventing France from achieving its objectives. The United States withdrew its troops from the Rhineland, and Great Britain expressed disapproval. Germany saw an opportunity for rapprochement with Britain, with some even suggesting an Anglo-German alliance. While Britain did not consider such an alliance, it demanded in August 1923 that France reconsider its Ruhr policy. Poincare, believing British support was in Britain's own interest, dismissed this.  He was ultimately proven right, but miscalculated the time it would take Britain to realize this. The Ruhr occupation ended in late 1923, a failure for France. The mined coal barely covered administrative costs, and no significant separatist movement emerged. France and Britain had effectively checkmated each other: France by alienating Britain, and Britain by prioritizing conciliation over the balance of power.  Even disarmed, Germany thwarted French actions. In the 1920s, whenever the democracies reached an impasse, they invoked the League of Nations instead of facing geopolitical realities.  Even the British general staff, while identifying Germany as the primary threat and France as incapable of resistance, proposed strengthening the League and forming ad hoc alliances, a recipe for failure. Germany needed a farsighted statesman to dismantle the Treaty of Versailles, and found one in Stresemann, who became Foreign Minister and then Chancellor in 1923. His \"fulfillment\" policy reversed previous German policy, abandoning the diplomatic guerrilla war against Versailles and exploiting the discomfort of Britain and France with the treaty's terms.",

    "text": "A nation defeated in war and partially occupied by foreign troops has basically two choices: It can challenge the victor in the hope of making enforcement of the peace too painful; or it can cooperate with the victor while regaining strength for a later confrontation. Both strategies contain risks. After military defeat, resistance invites a test of strength at the moment of maximum weakness; collaboration risks demoralization, because policies which appeal to the victor also tend to confuse the public opinion of the vanquished.\n\nBefore Stresemann, Germany had pursued the policy of resistance. Confrontational tactics had enabled it to prevail in the Ruhr crisis, but Germany's grievances were hardly allayed by the French withdrawal from the Ruhr. Strangely enough, the return of Alsace-Lorraine to France was not controversial. But the redrawing of Germany's borders, giving Poland large tracts of German territory, faced passionate nationalistic opposition. Finally, there were widespread pressures to throw off the restrictions on German military strength. And there was nearly unanimous consensus in Germany that the Allied reparations demands were outrageous.\n\nUnlike the nationalists, Stresemann understood that no matter how unpopular the Versailles Treaty—indeed, regardless of how much he hated it himself—he needed British and, to some extent, French help to throw off its most onerous provisions. The Rapallo understanding had been a useful tactic to unnerve the Western democracies. But because the Soviet Union was too impoverished to aid German economic recovery and too isolated to lend support in most diplomatic confrontations, its real impact would be felt only after Germany became strong enough to challenge the Versailles settlement openly. Above all, regaining economic strength required foreign loans, something Germany would find difficult in an atmosphere of confrontation. Thus, Stresemann's policy of fulfillment reflected above all his realistic assessment of the requirements of German political and economic recovery: 'Germany's basic military weakness,' he wrote, 'spells out the limits, the nature, and the methods of Germany's foreign policy.'\n\nThough the fulfillment policy was grounded in realism, that commodity was in no more abundant supply in postwar Germany (especially in conservative circles) than it had been in the days when the conservatives' policies had so heavily contributed to the outbreak of World War I. Ending the war while German forces still stood on Allied soil had enabled those responsible for Germany's participation in the war to escape the consequences of their folly and to saddle their more moderate successors with the blame.",

Stresemann was the first postwar German leader—and the only democratic leader—who exploited the geopolitical advantages which the Versailles settlement conferred on Germany. He grasped the essentially brittle nature of the Franco-English relationship and used it to widen the wedge between the two wartime allies. He cleverly exploited the British fear of a German collapse vis-à-vis both France and the Soviet Union.\n\nStresemann's ultimate aims were irrelevant in the early stages of his fulfillment policy. Whether he was seeking permanent conciliation or an overthrow of the existing order—or, as was most likely, keeping both options open—he first had to free Germany from the controversy over reparations. With the exception of France, the Allies were equally eager to put the issue behind them and to begin receiving some reparations at last.  Stresemann skillfully proposed international arbitration for a new schedule of reparations, expecting an international forum to prove less exacting than France alone was likely to be.  The Dawes Committee's recommendations establishing a reduced schedule of payments were accepted.  In effect, America was paying Germany's reparations, while Germany used the surplus from American loans to modernize its industry.  France had insisted on reparations in order to keep Germany weak. Forced to choose between a weak Germany and a Germany capable of paying reparations, France had opted for the latter but then had to stand by as reparations helped to rebuild Germany's economic and, ultimately, its military power.",

Fulfillment placed British diplomats in a difficult position as well.  To avoid this dilemma, Austen Chamberlain developed an idea for a limited alliance among Great Britain, France, and Belgium, which would guarantee only their borders with Germany—in essence, a military alliance to resist German aggression in the West.  Stresemann declared that a pact without Germany was a pact against Germany.  Chamberlain retreated to a curious hybrid agreement in which he sought to blend a traditional alliance with the new principle of collective security.  The new pact—signed at Locarno, Switzerland—guaranteed the borders between France, Belgium, and Germany against aggression.  By the mid-1920s, Stresemann, the minister of defeated Germany, was in the driver's seat much more than Briand and Chamberlain, the representatives of the victors. In return for renouncing revisionism in the West, Stresemann drew from Briand and Chamberlain an implicit recognition that the Versailles Treaty required revision in the East. Germany accepted its western frontier with France and Belgium, and the permanent demilitarization of the Rhineland. Great Britain and Italy guaranteed this arrangement, pledging assistance to repel invasions across the frontiers or into the demilitarized Rhineland from whatever direction.  At the same time, Stresemann refused to accept Germany's border with Poland, which the other signatories also refused to guarantee.  The Locarno Pact was greeted with exuberant relief as the dawning of a new world order.  But amidst all the jubilation, no one noticed that the statesmen had sidestepped the real issues. Locarno had not so much pacified Europe as it had defined the next battlefield.",

    "text": "Great Britain's refusal to guarantee even the arbitration treaties gave international sanction to two classes of frontier in Europe—those accepted by Germany and guaranteed by the other powers, and those neither accepted by Germany nor guaranteed by the other powers. To confuse matters further, three tiers of commitments now prevailed in Europe. The first consisted of traditional alliances backed by the conventional machinery of staff talks and political consultations. No longer in vogue, these were confined to French arrangements with the weak new states in Eastern Europe—alliances which Great Britain refused to join. In the event of German aggression in Eastern Europe, France would face a choice between undesirable alternatives: abandoning Poland and Czechoslovakia, or fighting alone, which had been its recurring nightmare since 1870 and was not something it was very likely to undertake. The second tier consisted of special guarantees such as Locarno, obviously deemed less binding than formal alliances, which explains why they never encountered obstacles in the House of Commons. Finally, there was the League of Nations' own commitment to collective security, which was in practice devalued by Locarno. For, if collective security was in fact reliable, Locarno was unnecessary; and if Locarno was necessary, the League of Nations was, by definition, inadequate to assure the security of even its principal founding members. Because neither the Locarno-type guarantee nor the general concept of collective security identified a potential aggressor, both rendered advance military planning impossible. Even if concerted military action had been possible—and there is no example of it during the League period—the bureaucratic machinery guaranteed endless delays for fact-finding and various other League conciliation procedures. All of these unprecedented diplomatic stipulations compounded the uneasiness of the countries which considered themselves most threatened. Italy ended up guaranteeing frontiers along the Rhine, which it had never in its history identified with national security. Italy's primary interest in Locarno had been to gain recognition as a Great Power. Having achieved that goal, it saw no reason to run any actual risks, as it would amply demonstrate when the Rhine frontier was challenged ten years later. For Great Britain, Locarno signified the first agreement in which a major power simultaneously guaranteed an erstwhile ally and a recently defeated enemy while pretending to be impartial between them. Locarno represented not so much reconciliation between France and Germany as endorsement of the military outcome of the recent war. Germany had been defeated in the West but had overcome Russia in the East. Locarno in effect confirmed both results and laid the basis for Germany's ultimate assault on the Eastern settlement. Locarno, hailed in 1925 as turning the corner toward permanent peace, in fact marked the beginning of the end of the Versailles international order. From then on, the distinction between victor and vanquished became more and more murky—a situation which could have been beneficial had the victor gained from it a heightened sense of security or the defeated become reconciled to living with a modified settlement. Neither occurred.",

    "text": "France's frustration and sense of impotence grew with every passing year. So did nationalist agitation in Germany. The wartime Allies had all abdicated their responsibilities—America shirked its role in designing the peace, Great Britain renounced its historic role as balancer, and France relinquished its responsibility as guardian of the Versailles settlement. Only Stresemann, leader of a defeated Germany, had a long-range policy, and he inexorably moved his country to the center of the international stage. The sole remaining hope for a peaceful new world order was that the emotional lift of the agreement itself and the expectations it produced, as summed up in the slogan 'the spirit of Locarno,' might overcome its structural failings. Contrary to Wilson’s teachings, it was not the broad masses which promoted this new atmosphere but the foreign ministers—Chamberlain, Briand, and Stresemann—of the countries whose suspicions and rivalries had produced the war and prevented the consolidation of the peace. Since there was no geopolitical basis for the Versailles order, the statesmen were driven to invoking their personal relationships as a means of maintaining it—a step none of their predecessors had ever taken. The aristocrats who had conducted foreign policy in the nineteenth century belonged to a world in which intangibles were understood in the same way. Most of them were comfortable with each other. Nevertheless, they did not believe that their personal relations could influence their assessments of their countries' national interests. Agreements were never justified by the 'atmosphere' generated, and concessions were never made to sustain individual leaders in office. Nor did leaders address each other by their first names as a way of underlining their good relations with each other for the sake of their publics' opinions. That style of diplomacy changed after World War I. Since then, the trend toward personalizing relations has accelerated. When Briand welcomed Germany to the League, he stressed Stresemann's human qualities, and Stresemann responded in kind. Similarly, Austen Chamberlain's alleged personal predilection for France caused Stresemann to accelerate his policy of fulfillment and to recognize Germany’s Western border when Chamberlain replaced the more pro-German Lord Curzon as foreign secretary in 1924. Austen Chamberlain was the scion of a distinguished family. The son of the brilliant and mercurial Joseph Chamberlain, advocate of an alliance with Germany early in the century, he was the half-brother of Neville Chamberlain, who was to make the Munich settlement. Like his father, Austen wielded massive power in Great Britain's coalition governments. But, also like his father, he never reached the highest office; indeed, he was the only leader of the Conservative Party in the twentieth century who did not become prime minister. As one quip had it, Austen \"always played the game, and always lost it.\" Harold Macmillan said of Austen Chamberlain: \"He spoke well, but never in the grand style. He was clear, but not incisive. He was respected, but never feared.\" Chamberlain's major diplomatic accomplishment was his role in forging the Locarno Pact. Because Chamberlain was known to be a Francophile, having once remarked that he \"loved France like a woman,\" Stresemann feared an incipient Franco-English alliance. It was this fear that moved Stresemann to originate the process that led to Locarno. In retrospect, the weakness of the policy of creating two classes of frontiers in Europe has become obvious. But Chamberlain viewed it as a crucial extension of Great Britain’s strategic commitments, which went to the limit of what the British public would support. Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, Great Britain's security frontier had been at the Channel. Throughout the nineteenth century, the security frontier had been at the borders of the Low Countries. Austen Chamberlain tried to extend it to the Rhine, where, in the end, it was not supported when Germany challenged it in 1936. A guarantee to Poland was beyond the ken of British statesmen in 1925.",

    "text": "the premises of the Preparatory Commission, the more pressure it generated itself. In the end, all the various French maneuvers served primarily to magnify the Anglo-Saxons conviction that France was the real obstacle to disarmament and therefore to peace. The poignancy of the French dilemma was that; after Locarno, France was no longer in a position to pursue its convictions and had to settle for mitigating its fears. French policy grew increasingly reactive and defensive: Symbolic of this state of mind was that France began to construct the Maginot Line within two years of Locarno_~at a time when Germany was still disarmed and the independence of the new states of Eastern Europe depended on France's ability to come to their aid. In the event of German aggression; Eastern Europe could only be saved if France adopted an offensive strategy centered on its using the demilitarized Rhineland as a hostage. Yet the Maginot Line indicated that France intended to on the defensive inside its own borders, thereby liberating Germany to work its will in the East. French political and military strategies were no longer in step.\n\nConfused leaders have a tendency to substitute public relations maneuvers for a sense of direction. Driven by the desire to be perceived as doing something, Briand used the occasion of the tenth anniversary of America's entry into the war to submit in June 1927 a draft treaty to Washington according to which the two governments would renounce war in their relations with each other and agree to settle all their disputes by peaceful means The American Secretary of State, Frank B did not know how to respond to a document which renounced what no one feared and offered what everyone took for granted The approach of the election year of 1928 helped to clear Kellogg's mind; 'peace was popular, and Briand's draft had the advantage of not involving any practical consequence; In early 1928, Secretary Kellogg ended his silence and accepted the draft treaty. But he went Briand one better, proposing that the renunciation of war include as many other nations aS possible. The offer proved aS irresistible as it was meaningless On August 27, 1928,the Pact of Paris (popularly known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact), renouncing war as an instrument of national policy, was signed with fanfare by fifteen nations. It was quickly ratified by practically all the countries of the world, including Germany, Japan, and Italy, the nations whose aggressions would blight the next decade:\n\nNo sooner was the Pact signed than second thoughts began to seize the world's statesmen; France qualified its original proposal by inserting a clause legalizing wars of self-defense and wars to honor obligations arising out of the League Covenant; the Locarno guarantees, and all of France's alliances This brought matters back to their starting point; for the exceptions encompassed every conceivable practical case: Next; Great Britain insisted on freedom of action in order to defend its empire; America's reservations were the most sweeping of all; it invoked the Monroe Doctrine, the right of self-defense, and the stipulation that each nation be its own judge of the requirements of self-defense: Retaining every possible loophole, the United States rejected participation in enforcement action as well. In testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee a few months later; Kellogg presented the extraordinary theory that the United States had no obligation under the Pact to help victims of aggression; since such aggression would already have proved that the Pact had been (( abrogated. 'Supposing some other nation does break this treaty; why should we interest ourselves in any it?' asked Senator Walsh from Montana \"There is not a bit of reason; replied the Secretary of State Kellogg had reduced the treaty to the tautology that the Pact of Paris would preserve the peace as long as the peace was being preserved War was banned in all circumstances except those which were foreseeable:",

    "text": "No wonder that D. W. Brogan had this to say about the Kellogg-Briand Pact: \"'The United States, which had abolished the evils of drink by the Eighteenth Amendment; invited the world to abolish war by taking the pledge. The world, not daring to believe Or doubt; obeyed. In the event; Briand's original idea was transformed by his erstwhile allies into a new means of putting pressure on France. Henceforth it was widely argued that; with war outlawed; France had an obligation to accelerate its own disarmament, To symbolize the era of goodwill, the Allies ended the occupation of the Rhineland in 1928, five years ahead of schedule. Concurrently; Austen Chamberlain let it be known that; as far aS Great Britain was concerned; the Polish border with Germany could, and indeed should, be modified; if only the Germans were civilized about it: 'If she [Germany] comes into the League and plays her part there in a friendly and conciliatory spirit I myself believe that within a reasonable number of years she will find herself in a position where her economic and commercial support is so necessary and her political friendship so desirable to Poland that; without having recourse to the League machinery, she will be able to make a friendly arrangement On her own account directly with the Poles. If the German public and press could be restrained from talking so much about the eastern frontiers, they might get more quickly to a solution.' Stresemann skillfully used Germany’s entry into the League both to increase his options toward the Soviet Union and to intensify German pressure on France for parity in armaments. For example, Stresemann asked for and was granted an exemption permitting German participation in the enforcement provisions of the League Charter (Article 16) on the ground that a disarmed Germany was in no position to face the risks of sanctions. Next; in Bismarckian fashion; Stresemann notified Moscow that his request for the exemption had been due to Germany’s reluctance to join any anti-Soviet coalition. Moscow took the hint. Within a year of Locarno, in April 1926, a treaty of neutrality between the Soviet Union and Germany was signed in Berlin: Each party agreed to remain neutral if the other was attacked; each agreed not to join any political combination or economic boycott aimed at the other—presumably regardless of the issue. In effect; this meant that the two countries excluded themselves from the application of collective security against each other: And Germany had already exempted itself from sanctions against anyone else. Berlin and Moscow were united in hostility to Poland; as German Chancellor Wirth told his Ambassador to Moscow, Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau: “One thing I tell you frankly; Poland must be eliminated. I do not conclude any treaty which might strengthen Poland.” Nevertheless, French leaders, especially Briand; concluded that the fulfillment policy remained France's only realistic option: If France's worst fears came to pass and Germany resumed a bellicose policy, the hope of eventually gaining British support and maintaining America's goodwill would surely be jeopardized if France could be blamed for having wrecked conciliation. Gradually, Europe's center of gravity shifted to Berlin.",

    "text": "Hitler’s advent to power marked one of the greatest calamities in the history of the world. But for him, the collapse of the house of cards which represented the Versailles international order might have proceeded in a peaceful, or at least noncatastrophic, fashion. That Germany would emerge from that process as the strongest nation on the Continent was inevitable; the orgy of killing and devastation that it unleashed was the work of one demonic personality.\n\nHitler attained eminence through his oratory. Unlike other revolutionary leaders, he was a solitary political adventurer representing no major school of political thought. His philosophy, as expressed in Mein Kampf, ranged from the banal to the fantastic and consisted of a popularized repackaging of right-wing, radical, conventional wisdom. Standing alone, it could never have launched an intellectual current that culminated in revolution, as had Marx’s Das Kapital or the works of the philosophers of the eighteenth century. Demagogic skill catapulted Hitler to the leadership of Germany and remained his stock in trade throughout his career. With the instincts of an outcast and an unerring eye for psychological weaknesses, he shunted his adversaries from disadvantage to disadvantage, until they were thoroughly demoralized and ready to acquiesce to his domination. Internationally, he ruthlessly exploited the democracies’ guilty conscience about the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nAs the head of government, Hitler operated by instinct rather than analysis. Fancying himself an artist, he resisted sedentary habits and was constantly and restlessly on the move. He disliked Berlin and found solace in his Bavarian retreat, to which he would repair for months at a time, though he quickly grew bored even there. Since he disdained orderly work procedures and his ministers found it difficult to gain access to him, policymaking occurred in fits and starts. Anything consistent with his flashes of frenetic activity thrived; anything requiring sustained effort tended to languish.\n\nThe essence of demagoguery resides in the ability to distill emotion and frustration into a single moment. Gratifying that moment and achieving a mesmeric, nearly sensual relationship with his entourage and the public at large became Hitler’s specialties. Abroad, Hitler was most successful when the world perceived him as pursuing normal, limited objectives. All his great foreign policy triumphs occurred in the first five years of his rule, 1933–38, and were based on his victims’ assumption that his aim was to reconcile the Versailles system with its purported principles. Once Hitler abandoned the pretense of rectifying injustice, his credibility vanished. Embarking on naked conquest for its own sake made him lose his touch. There were still occasional flashes of intuition, as in his design of the campaign against France in 1940 and in his refusal to permit a retreat in front of Moscow in 1941, which would almost certainly have caused a collapse of the German army. However, Hitler’s seminal experience seems to have been Germany’s defeat in World War I. He never ceased to recount how he first learned of it while bedridden in a military hospital, partially blinded by mustard gas.",

    "text": "Ascribing Germany’s collapse to treachery, a Jewish conspiracy, and lack of will, he would for the rest of his life insist that Germany could be defeated only by itself, not by foreigners. This line of thinking transmuted the defeat of 1918 into treason, while the failure on the part of Germany’s leaders to fight to the end became a staple of Hitler’s obsessive rhetoric and mind-numbing monologues. Hitler always seemed strangely unfulfilled by his victories; in the end, he only seemed able to realize his image of himself by overcoming imminent collapse through sheer willpower. Psychologists may find therein one explanation for his conducting the war in a manner that seemed to lack a strategic or political rationale until Germany’s resources had been squandered and Hitler could finally, and still unyieldingly, fulfill himself by defying the world in a bomb shelter in the encircled capital of his almost completely occupied country.\n\nDemagogic skill and egomania were two sides of the same coin. Hitler was incapable of normal conversation, and either engaged in monologues or lapsed into bored silences when some interlocutor managed to seize the floor and at times even dozed off.[1] Hitler was wont to ascribe his, in truth, nearly miraculous rise from Vienna’s netherworld to unchallenged rule over Germany to personal qualities unrivaled by any contemporary. Thus, a recital of his rise to power entered the deadening liturgy of Hitler’s “table talks” as transcribed by his disciples.[2] Hitler’s egomania had deadlier consequences as well; he had convinced himself—and, what is more significant, his entourage—that, because his faculties were so unique, all his goals had to be accomplished in his own lifetime. Since, on the basis of his family history, he had estimated that his life would be relatively short, he was never able to permit any of his successes to mature, and pushed forward according to a timetable established by his assessment of his physical powers. History offers no other example of a major war started on the basis of medical conjecture.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Hitler’s startling early successes amounted to an accelerated harvesting of opportunities which had been created by the policies of the predecessors he despised, especially Stresemann. Like the Peace of Westphalia, the Treaty of Versailles left a powerful country confronting a group of much smaller and unprotected states on its eastern border. The difference, however, was that while this had been intentional at Westphalia, quite the opposite was true of Versailles. Versailles and Locarno had smoothed Germany’s road into Eastern Europe, where a patient German leadership would in time have achieved a preponderant being.",
