    "text": "Unrestricted Warfare is the People’s Liberation Army manual for asymmetric warfare and the waging of war, strategically and tactically, using weapons not limited to bullets, bombs, missiles, and artillery shells. The two PLA officers who advocated the strategy set forth in the following pages argue that modern warfare, in ways not too dissimilar from Sun Tzu’s Art of War, is about impeding the enemy’s ability to wage war and to defend itself against a barrage of attacks against its economy, its civil institutions, its governmental structures, and its actual belief system. This is not a manual for achieving an overnight victory. Rather, it is a recipe for a slow but inexorable assault on an enemy’s institutions, often without the enemy’s knowledge that it is even being attacked. As Sun Tzu once wrote, “If one party is at war with another, and the other party does not realize it is at war, the party who knows it’s at war almost always has the advantage and usually wins.” And this is the strategy set forth in Unrestricted Warfare, waging a war on an adversary with methods so covert at first and seemingly so benign that the party being attacked does not realize it’s being attacked. For example, the PLA authors propose, China has the power to attack the United States economically in such a way that while the United States believes it is benefiting from trade relations with China, the ultimate results are so detrimental to the United States, its very greed at extolling the benefits of trading with China are its undoing. China can manipulate its currency to put its products at a distinct advantage with the United States; China can restrict its markets to American goods while dumping its products below cost in the United States so as to force a large trade imbalance in its favor; China can pump propaganda into the American media while restricting American media’s access to the Chinese media landscape; and China, using a nineteenth-century strategy, can force the United States to fight proxy wars with Chinese allies, thus draining American resources. It does not take much stretch of a reader’s imagination to see that this is happening right now, that the strategies and tactics advocated in this manual are happening right before our eyes and not even only to the advantage of China, but of Russia as well.",

    "text": "For example, Sun Tzu advocates the exploitation of an enemy’s vulnerability, especially when the enemy believes that vulnerability is its strength. Applied to the international chess game being played out in 2017, consider how many American products are manufactured in Chinese factories by low-wage workers who undercut American labor. Now consider how many other countries, often under the protection of international trade agreements, are also undercutting American labor. While the American consumer might be thrilled at the low prices of goods coming into the United States, the American labor market suffers, thus causing dissatisfaction among a vital voting constituency. This dissatisfaction, this unrest, plays into an enemy’s hands, particularly in a free society where elections determine government policy. A country waging an economic war that is savvy about its enemy population’s proclivities can tailor its policies to engender unrest in that population so as to propel the election of that country’s leaders who might be more easily manipulated. We saw this in the 2016 presidential election when Donald Trump ran, in part, against Chinese economic and currency policies while he and his own family were pursuing manufacturing their branded products in China and seeking trademark agreements with the Chinese government. In the age of the worldwide internet, what seems like the free flow of information is also an open door policy for one country to insert its propaganda into the thinking and belief systems of its enemy. Do we consider Vladimir Putin’s Russia to be a friend to the United States? Are we really that naïve? Voting constituencies might have very legitimate reasons to support the politicians of their choice, but when those choices are based on the flow of absolutely false information inimical to the best interests of that population, it is an example of the success of asymmetric or unrestricted warfare, in essence, propaganda war. The Russians have been experts at this since the days of the czar, and since the experiments of Pavlov and his dogs have mastered the art of getting the responses they want from the stimuli they inject into their subjects’ thought patterns. In this past election cycle, it worked. As you read the following pages, a manual for the military humbling of the United States through nonmilitary means that most Americans will not even realize, you should understand that this is not just a “what if,” but a reality. It is happening now even as North Korea’s Kim blusters about sending missiles towards Guam and Donald Trump responds by rattling his own saber in its scabbard. China, meanwhile, watches while its enemy is engaged with a tiny country that has the means to send nuclear tipped ICBMs to American cities. If North Korea attacks Guam or Pearl Harbor and the United States responds, who benefits? Not North Korea, not South Korea, not the United States. China benefits when U.S. Naval facilities on Guam or at Pearl Harbor are damaged so that the American presence in the Pacific is diminished to the point of incapacity. Was this not the Japanese strategy at Pearl Harbor in 1941? To eliminate the threat of the U.S. Pacific Fleet so that America could not prosecute a war across the Pacific? It didn’t work, of course, but only because President Roosevelt, a canny tactician in his own right, had goaded the Japanese Imperial war party into an attack he knew was coming so as to get America into a war with the Axis powers and then let the Soviet Union bear the full brunt of the Nazi Wehrmacht while the Japanese, prevented from reaching the Southeast Asian oil fields, simply ran out of fuel at the end.",

    "text": "China will not make that same mistake. China learned to play the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century game of creating economic spheres of influence. Hence, it is establishing sources of raw materials, especially petroleum, lithium, and coal from countries where it is wielding its economic influence, as it is doing in mineral-rich Africa, an influence borne out of its luring manufacturing to its shores. Is it paying a price? Absolutely. Look at smog-enshrouded Beijing. But the Chinese communist government, playing a capitalist long game, knows that thinking in decades rather than four-year election cycles plays to its benefit. Readers, therefore, should take this little manual as a dire warning. Complacency cripples. Hubris kills. And blindness without guidance usually leads one into the nearest wall if not hurtling down a flight of stairs. Thus, although this book was written almost twenty years ago, it should be regarded as the playbook for the destruction of not only the United States, but of western democracies in general. Be afraid. Be very afraid.",

    "text": "The history of how this 2017 version of a Filament ebook came to be is also a study in becoming a more active and informed citizen in the current United States. One sound survival technique is finding and reading accurate historical narratives. This is one of them. I scanned and OCR-processed the paperback version of the book in the summer of 2004, while living onboard an antique sailboat in Marina Del Rey, California. We were living on a boat because of the events of 9/11, which had shaken us to the core and making a quick exit from the continental U.S. made a certain mad sense at that time. From the Wikipedia: “The English translation of the book was made available by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service on the internet in 1999. Reportedly, the United States Naval Academy wrote to the authors to ask for permission to use this book.[citation needed] The book was then published in English by a previously unknown Panamanian publisher, with the subtitle ‘China's Master Plan to Destroy America” and a picture of the burning World Trade Center on the cover. These additions were thought to be misinterpretations of the text, not intended by the original authors. A French translation was published in 2003.” More time has passed, but this book still makes interesting reading. For this version’s cover, I’ve chosen a classic 1917 poster from the World War I era by James Montgomery Flagg. Some background: “Americans were not eager to enter the war, and Americans of German ancestry tended to support Germany, not Britain and France. The government’s first task was to convince citizens that they must support the war effort without reservation. Here, a woman clad in the stars and stripes represents America and American liberty.” The original: One hundred years, and counting; now, more than ever.",

    "text": "The following editor’s note was offered by the translators who prepared this manuscript in English for review by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and other U.S. national security departments. Please note: The following selections are taken from Unrestricted Warfare, a book published in China in February 1999 which proposes tactics for developing countries, in particular China, to compensate for their military inferiority vis-a-vis the United States during a high-tech war. The selections include the table of contents, preface, afterword, and biographical information about the authors printed on the cover. The book was written by two PLA senior colonels from the younger generation of Chinese military officers and was published by the PLA Literature and Arts Publishing House in Beijing, suggesting that its release was endorsed by at least some elements of the PLA leadership. This impression was reinforced by an interview with Qiao and laudatory review of the book carried by the party youth league’s official daily, Zhongguo Qingnian Bao, on 28 June. Published prior to the bombing of China’s embassy in Belgrade, the book has recently drawn the attention of both the Chinese and Western press for its advocacy of a multitude of means, both military and particularly non- military, to strike at the United States during times of conflict. Hacking into websites, targeting financial institutions, using the media, and conducting terrorism and urban warfare are among the methods proposed. In the Zhongguo Qingnian Bao interview, Qiao was quoted as stating that “the first rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules, with nothing forbidden.” Elaborating on this idea, he asserted that strong countries would not use the same approach against weak countries because “strong countries make the rules while rising ones break them and exploit loopholes … . The United States breaks [UN rules] and makes new ones when these rules don’t suit [its purposes], but it has to observe its own rule or the whole world will not trust it.” (see FBI’s translation of the interview, OW2807114599). Pan American Publisher’s edition: This original translation of Unrestricted Warfare contains inconsistencies in style and spelling. Adhering to the translation as closely as possible, the editor has made changes only where necessary to clarify or to correct egregious misspellings.

    "text": "Everyone who has lived through the last decade of the 20th century will have a profound sense of the changes in the world. We don’t believe that there is anyone who would claim that there has been any decade in history in which the changes have been greater than those of this decade. Naturally, the causes behind the enormous changes are too numerous to mention, but there are only a few reasons that people bring up repeatedly. One of those is the Gulf War. One war changed the world. Linking such a conclusion to a war which occurred one time in a limited area and which only lasted 42 days seems like something of an exaggeration. However, that is indeed what the facts are, and there is no need to enumerate one by one all the new words that began to appear after 17 January 1991. It is only necessary to cite the former Soviet Union, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, cloning, Microsoft, hackers, the Internet, the Southeast Asian financial crisis, the Euro, as well as the world’s final and only superpower—the United States. These are sufficient. They pretty much constitute the main subjects on this planet for the past decade. However, what we want to say is that all these are related to that war, either directly or indirectly. However, we definitely do not intend to mythicize war, particularly not a lopsided war in which there was such a great difference in the actual power of the opposing parties. Precisely the contrary. In our in-depth consideration of this war, which changed the entire world in merely half a month, we have also noted another fact, which is that war itself has now been changed. We discovered that, from those wars which could be described in glorious and dominating terms, to the aftermath of the acme of what it has been possible to achieve to date in the history of warfare, that war, which people originally felt was one of the more important roles to be played out on the world stage, has at one stroke taken the seat of a B actor. A war which changed the world ultimately changed war itself. This is truly",

    "text": "fantastic, yet it also causes people to ponder deeply. No, what we are referring to are not changes in the instruments of war, the technology of war, the modes of war, or the forms of war. What we are referring to is the function of warfare. Who could imagine that an insufferably arrogant actor, whose appearance has changed the entire plot, suddenly finds that he himself is actually the last person to play this unique role. Furthermore, without waiting for him to leave the stage, he has already been told that there is no great likelihood that he will again handle an A role, at least not a central role in which he alone occupies center stage. What kind of feeling would this be? Perhaps those who feel this most deeply are the Americans, who probably should be counted as among the few who want to play all the roles, including savior, fireman, world policeman, and an emissary of peace, etc. In the aftermath of “Desert Storm,” Uncle Sam has not been able to again achieve a commendable victory. Whether it was in Somalia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, this has invariably been the case. In particular, in the most recent action in which the United States and Britain teamed up to carry out air attacks on Iraq, it was the same stage, the same method, and the same actors, but there was no way to successfully perform the magnificent drama that had made such a profound impression eight years earlier. Faced with political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, ethnic, and religious issues, etc., that are more complex than they are in the minds of most of the military men in the world, the limitations of the military means, which lad heretofore always been successful, suddenly became apparent. However, in the age of “might makes right”—and most of the history of this century falls into this period—these were issues which did not constitute a problem. The problem is that the U.S.- led multinational forces brought this period to a close in the desert region of Kuwait, thus beginning a new period. At present it is still hard to see if this age will lead to the unemployment of large numbers of military personnel, nor will it cause war to vanish from this world. All these are still undetermined. The only point which is certain is that, from this point on, war will no longer be what it was originally. Which is to say that, if in the days to come mankind has no choice but to engage in war, it can no longer be carried out in the ways with which we are familiar. It is impossible for us to deny the impact on human society and its soul of the new motivations represented by economic freedom, the concept of human rights, and the awareness of environmental protection, but it is certain that the metamorphosis of warfare will have a more complex backdrop. Otherwise, the immortal bird of warfare will not be able to attain nirvana when it is on the verge of decline: When people begin to lean toward and rejoice in the reduced use of military force to resolve conflicts, war will be reborn in another form and in another arena, becoming an instrument of enormous power in the hands of all those who harbor intentions of controlling other countries or regions. In this sense, there is reason for us to maintain that the financial attack by George Soros on East Asia, the terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy by Osama Bin Laden, the gas attack on the Tokyo subway by the disciples of the Aum Shinri Kyo, and the havoc wreaked by the likes of Morris Jr. on the Internet, in which the degree of destruction is by no means second to that of a war, represent semi-warfare, quasi-warfare, and sub- warfare, that is, the embryonic form of another kind of warfare. But whatever you call them, they cannot make us more optimistic than in the past. We have no reason for optimism. This is because the reduction of the functions of warfare in a pure sense does not mean at all that war has ended. Even in the so-called postmodern, post-industrial age, warfare will not be totally dismantled. It has only reinvaded human society in a more complex, more extensive, more concealed, and more subtle manner. It is as Byron said in his poem mourning Shelley, “Nothing has happened, he has only undergone a sea change.” War which has undergone the changes of modern technology and the market system will be launched even more in atypical forms. In other words, while we are seeing a relative reduction in military violence, at the same time we definitely are seeing an increase in political, economic, and technological violence. However, regardless of the form the violence takes, war is war, and a change in the external appearance does not keep any war from abiding by the principles of war. If we acknowledge that the new principles of war are no longer “using armed force to compel the enemy to submit to one’s will,” but rather a “using all means, including armed force or non-armed force, military or non- military, and lethal and non-lethal means to compel the enemy to accept one’s interests.” This represents change. A change in war and a change in the mode of war occasioned by this. So, just what has led to the change? What kind of changes are they? Where are the changes headed? How does one face these changes? This is the topic that this book attempts to touch on and shed light on, and it is also our motivation in deciding to write this book. (Written on 17 January 1999, the 8th anniversary of the outbreak of the Gulf War.)",

    "text": "Although ancient states were great, they inevitably perished when they were fond of war. SIMA RANGJU Technology is the totem of modern man.1 OSWALD SPENGLER Stirred by the warm breeze of utilitarianism, it is not surprising that technology is more in favor with people than science is. The age of great scientific discoveries had already been left behind before Einstein’s time. However, modern man is increasingly inclined to seeing all his dreams come true during his lifetime. This causes him, when betting on his own future, to prostrate himself and expect wonders from technology through a thousand- power concave lens. In this way, technology has achieved startling and explosive developments in a rather short period of time, and this has resulted in innumerable benefits for mankind, which is anxious for quick success and instant rewards. However, we proudly term this technological progress, not realizing that at this time we have already consigned ourselves to a benighted technological age in which we have lost our hearts.2 Technology today is becoming increasingly dazzling and uncontrollable. Bell Labs and Sony continue to put out novel toys, Bill Gates opens new “Windows” each year, and “Dolly,” the cloned sheep, proves that mankind is now planning to take the place of God the Creator. The fearsome Russian- built SU-27 fighter has not been put to use on any battlefield, and already the SU-35 has emerged to strike a pose,3 but whether or not, once it has exhausted its time in the limelight, the SU-35 will be able to retire having rendered meritorious service is still a matter of considerable doubt. Technology is like “magic shoes” on the feet of mankind, and after the spring has been wound tightly by commercial interests, people can only dance along with the shoes, whirling rapidly in time to the beat that they set. The names Watt and Edison are nearly synonymous with great technical inventions, and using these great technological masters to name the age may be said to be reasonable. However, from then on, the situation changed, and the boundless and varied technological discoveries of the past 100 years or so makes it difficult for the appearance of any new technology to take on any self-importance in the realm of human life. While it may be said that the formulations of “the age of the steam engine” and “the age of electrification” can be said to be names which reflect the realities of the time, today, with all kinds of new technology continuously beating again the banks of the age so that people scarcely have the time to accord them brief acclaim while being overwhelmed by an even higher and newer wave of technology, the age in which an era could be named for a single new technology or a single inventor has become a thing of the past. This is the reason why, if one calls the current era the “nuclear age” or the “information age,” it will still give people the impression that you are using one aspect to typify the whole situation. There is absolutely no doubt that the appearance of information technology has been good news for human civilization. This is because it is the only thing to date that is capable of infusing greater energy into the technological “plague” that has been released from Pandora’s box, and at the same time it also provides a magic charm: a means of controlling it [technology]. It is just that, at present, there is still a question of who in turn will have a magic charm with which to control [information technology]. The pessimistic viewpoint is that, if this technology develops in a direction which cannot be controlled by man, ultimately it will turn mankind into its victim.4 However, this frightening conclusion is totally incapable of reducing people’s ardor for it. The optimistic prospects that it displays itself are intensely seductive for mankind, which has a thirst for technical progress. After all, its unique features of exchanging and sharing represent the light of intelligence which we can hope will lead mankind out of the barbarism of technology, although this is still not sufficient to make us like those futurists who cannot see the forest for the trees, and who use its name to label the entire age. Its characteristics are precisely what keep it from being able to replace the various technologies that we already have in great quantity, that are just emerging, or which are about to be born; particularly those such as biotechnology, materials technology, and nanotechnology, these technologies which have a symbiotic relationship with information technology in which they rely on and promote one another.",

    "section": "Chapter 1: The Weapons Revolution Which Invariably Comes First",
    "text": "As soon as technological advances may be applied to military goals, and furthermore are already used for military purposes, they almost immediately seem obligatory, and also often go against the will of the commanders in triggering changes or even revolutions in the modes of combat.\n\nTHE WEAPONS REVOLUTION invariably precedes the revolution in military affairs by one step, and following the arrival of a revolutionary weapon, the arrival of the revolution in military affairs is just a matter of time. The history of warfare is continually providing this kind of proof: bronze or iron spears resulted in the infantry phalanx, and bows and arrows and stirrups provided new tactics for cavalry. Black powder cannons gave rise to a full complement of modern warfare modes … from the time when conical bullets and rifles took to the battlefield as the vanguard of the age of technology, weapons straightaway stamped their names on the chest of warfare. First, it was the enormous steel-clad naval vessels that ruled the seas, launching the “age of battleships,” then its brother the “tank” ruled land warfare, after which the airplane dominated the skies, up until the atomic bomb was born, announcing the approach of the “nuclear age.” Today, a multitude of new and advanced technology weapons continues to pour forth, so that weapons have solemnly become the chief representative of war. When people discuss future warfare, they are already quite accustomed to using certain weapons or certain technologies to describe it, calling it “electronic warfare,” “precision-weapons warfare,” and “information warfare.” Coasting along in their mental orbit, people have not yet noticed that a certain inconspicuous yet very important change is stealthily approaching.\n\nNO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO LABEL WARFARE\n\nThe weapons revolution is a prelude to a revolution in military affairs. What is different than in the past is that the revolution in military affairs that is coming will no longer be driven by one or two individual weapons. In addition to continuing to stimulate people to yearn for and be charmed by new weapons, the numerous technological inventions have also quickly eradicated the mysteries of each kind of weapon. In the past, all that was needed was the invention of a few weapons or pieces of equipment, such as the stirrup and the Maxim machine gun, and that was sufficient to alter the form of war, whereas today upwards of 100 kinds of weapons are needed to make up a certain weapons system before it can have an overall effect on war. However, the more weapons are invented, the smaller an individual weapon’s role in war becomes, and this is a paradox that is inherent in the relationship between weapons and war. Speaking in that sense, other than the all-out use of nuclear weapons, a situation which is more and more unlikely and which may be termed nuclear war, none of the other weapons, even those that are extremely revolutionary in nature, possesses the right to label future warfare. Perhaps it is precisely because people recognize this point that we then have formulations such as “high-tech warfare” and “information warfare,” whose intent is to use the broad concept of technology to replace the concept of specific weapons, using a fuzzy-learning approach to resolve this knotty problem. However, it seems that this still is not the way to resolve the problem. When one delves deeply into this, the term “high technology,” which first appeared in the architectural industry in the United States, is in fact a bit vague. What constitutes high technology? What does it refer to? Logically speaking, high and low are only relative concepts. However, using an extremely mutable concept in this irrational manner to name warfare, which is evolving endlessly, in itself constitutes a considerable problem. When one generation’s high technology becomes low technology with the passage of time, are we still prepared to again dub the new toys that continue to appear as being high tech? Or is it possible that, in today’s technological explosion, this may result in confusion and trouble for us in naming and using each new technology that appears? Not to mention the question of just what should be the standard",

    "text": "to determine whether something is high or not? With regard to technology itself, each technology has specific aspects, which therefore means that each has its time limits. Yesterday’s “high” is very possibly today’s “low,” while today’s “new” will in turn become tomorrow’s “old.” Compared to the M-60 tank, the “Cobra” helicopter, and the B-52, the main battle weapons of the ’60s-’70s, the “Abrams” tank, the “Apache” helicopter gunship, the F-117, the “Patriot” missiles, and the “Tomahawk” cruise missiles are high tech. However, faced with the B-2, the F-22, the “Comanche” helicopter, and the “J-Stars” joint-surveillance target-attack radar system, they in turn seem outmoded. It is as if to say there is the concept of high-tech weapons, which is a variable throughout, and which naturally becomes the title of the “bride.” Then, as the “flowers bloom each year, but the people change,” all that is left is the empty shell of a name, which is continually placed on the head of the girl who is becoming the next “bride.” Then, in the chain of warfare with its continuous links, each weapon can go from high to low and from new to old at any time and any place, with time’s arrow being unwilling to stop at any point; nor can any weapon occupy the throne of high technology for long. Since this is the case, just what kind of high technology does this so-called high-tech warfare refer to? High technology, as spoken of in generalities, cannot become a synonym for future warfare, nor is information technology—which is one of the high technologies of the present age and which seems to occupy an important position in the makeup of all modern weapons—sufficient to name a war. Even if in future wars all the weapons have information components embedded in them and are fully computerized, we can still not term such war information warfare, and at most we can just call it computerized warfare. This is because, regardless of how important information technology is, it cannot completely supplant the functions and roles of each technology per se. For example, the F-22 fighter, which already fully embodies information technology, is still a fighter, and the “Tomahawk” missile is still a missile, and one cannot lump them all together as information weapons, nor can war which is conducted using these weapons be termed information warfare. Computerized warfare in the broad sense and information warfare in the narrow sense are two completely different things. The former refers to the various forms of warfare which are enhanced and accompanied by information technology, while the latter primarily refers to war in which information technology is used to obtain or suppress information. In addition, the contemporary myth created by information worship has people mistakenly believing that it is the only rising technology, while the sun has already set on all the others. This kind of myth may put more money in the pockets of Bill Gates, but it cannot alter the fact that the development of information technology similarly relies on the development of other technology, and the development of related materials technology is a direct constraint on information technology breakthroughs. For example, the development of biotechnology will determine the future fate of information technology. Speaking of bio-information technology, we may as well return to a previous topic and again make a small assumption: If people use information-guided bio-weapons to attack a bio-computer, should this be counted as bio-warfare or information warfare? I fear that no one will be able to answer that in one sentence, but this is something which is perfectly capable of happening. Actually, it is basically not necessary for people to wrack their brains over whether or not information technology will grow strong and unruly today, because it itself is a synthesis of other technologies, and its first appearance and every step forward are all a process of blending with other technologies, so that it is part of them, and they are part of it, and this is precisely the most fundamental characteristic of the age of technological integration and globalization. Naturally, like the figures from a steel seal, this characteristic may leave its typical imprint on each modern weapon. We are by no means denying that, in future warfare, certain advanced weapons may play a leading role. However, as for determining the outcome of war, it is now very difficult for anyone to occupy an unmatched position. It may be leading, but it will not be alone, much less never- changing. Which is also to say that there is no one who can unblushingly stamp his own name on a given modern war.\n\nFIGHTING THE FIGHT THAT FITS ONE’S WEAPONS AND MAKING THE WEAPONS TO FIT THE FIGHT\n\nThese two sentences, “fight the fight that fits one’s weapons” and",

    "section": "Part 1: Adapting Weapons and Tactics",
    "text": "“build the weapons to fit the fight,” show the clear demarcation line between traditional warfare and future warfare, as well as pointing out the relationship between weapons and tactics in the two kinds of war. The former reflects the involuntary or passive adaptation of the relationship of man to weapons and tactics in war which takes place under natural conditions, while the latter suggests the conscious or active choice that people make regarding the same proposition when they have entered a free state. In the history of war, the general unwritten rule that people have adhered to all along is to “fight the fight that fits one’s weapons.” Very often it is the case that only after one first has a weapon does one begin to formulate tactics match it. With weapons coming first, followed by tactics, the evolution of weapons has a decisive constraining effect on the evolution of tactics. Naturally, there are limiting factors here involving the age and the technology but neither can we say that there is no relationship between this and the linear thinking in which each generation of weapons-making specialists only thinks about whether or not the performance of the weapon itself is advanced, and does not consider other aspects. Perhaps this is one of the factors why a weapons revolution invariably precedes a revolution in military affairs. Although the expression “fight the fight that fits one’s weapons” is essentially negative in nature because what it leaves unsaid reflects a kind of helplessness, we have no intention of belittling the positive meaning that it has today, and this positive meaning is seeking the optimum tactics for the weapons one has. In other words, seeking the combat mode which represents the best match for the given weapons, thereby seeing that they perform up to their peak values. Today, those engaged in warfare have now either consciously or unconsciously completed the transition of this rule from the negative to the positive. It is just that people still wrongfully believe that this is the only initiative that can be taken by backward countries in their helplessness. They hardly realize that the United States, the foremost power in the world, must similarly face this kind of helplessness. Even though she is the richest in the world, it is not necessarily possible for her to use up her uniform new and advanced technology weapons to fight an expensive modern war.9 It is just that she has more freedom when it comes to the selection and pairing up of new and old weapons. If one can find a good point of agreement, which is to say, the most appropriate tactics, the pairing up and use of new and older generation weapons not only makes it possible to eliminate the weakness of uniform weaponry, it may also become a “multiplier” to increase the weapons’ effectiveness. The B-52 bomber, which people have predicted on many occasions is long since ready to pass away peacefully, has once again become resplendent after being coupled with cruise missiles and other precision guided weapons, and its wings have not yet rested to date. By the use of external infrared guided missiles, the A-10 aircraft now has night-attack capabilities that it originally lacked, and when paired with the Apache helicopter, they complement each other nicely, so that this weapons platform which appeared in the mid-’70s is very imposing. Obviously, “fight the fight that fits one’s weapons” by no means represents passive inaction. For example, today’s increasingly open weapons market and multiple supply channels have provided a great deal of leeway with regard to weapons selection, and the massive coexistence of weapons which span multiple generations has provided a broader and more functional foundation for transgeneration weapons combinations than at any age in the past, so that it is only necessary to break with our mental habit of treating the weapons’ generations, uses, and combinations as being fixed to be able to turn something that is rotten into something miraculous.",

    "text": "If one thinks that one must rely on advanced weapons to fight a modern war, being blindly superstitious about the miraculous effects of such weapons, it may actually result in turning something miraculous into something rotten. We find ourselves in a stage where a revolutionary leap forward is taking place in weapons, going from weapons systems symbolized by gunpowder to those symbolized by information, and this may be a relatively prolonged period of alternating weapons. At present we have no way of predicting how long this period may last, but what we can say for sure is that, as long as this alternation has not come to an end, fighting the kind of battle that fits one’s weapons will be the most basic approach for any country in handling the relationship between weapons and combat, and this includes the United States, the country which has the most advanced weapons. What must be pointed out is that the most basic thing is not the thing with the greatest future. Aggressive initiatives under negative preconditions is only a specific approach for a specific time, and by no means constitutes an eternal rule. In man’s hands, scientific progress has long since gone from passive discovery to active invention, and when the Americans proposed the concept of “building the weapons to fit the fight,” it triggered the greatest single change in the relationship between weapons and tactics since the advent of war. First determine the mode of combat, then develop the weapons, and in this regard, the first stab that the Americans took at this was “air-land battle,” while the currently popular “digitized battlefield” and “digitized units“10 which have given rise to much, discussion represent their most recent attempt. This approach indicates that the position of weapons in invariably preceding a revolution in military affairs has now been shaken, and now tactics come first and weapons follow, or the two encourage one another, with advancement in a push-pull manner becoming the new relationship between them. At the same time, weapons themselves have produced changes with epoch-making significance, and their development no longer looks only to improvements in the performance of individual weapons, but rather to whether or not the weapons have good characteristics for linking and matching them with other weapons. As with the F-111, which was in a class by itself at the time because it was too advanced, there was no way to pair it up with other weapons, so all they could do was shelve it. That lesson has now been absorbed, and the thinking that tries to rely on one or two new and advanced-technology weapons to serve as “killer weapons” which can put an end to the enemy is now outmoded. “Building the weapons to fit the fight,” an approach which has the distinctive features of the age and the characteristics of the laboratory, may not only be viewed as a kind of active choice, it can also be taken as coping with shifting events by sticking to a fundamental principle, and in addition to being a major breakthrough in the history of preparing for war, it also implies the potential crisis in modern warfare: Customizing weapons system to tactics which are still being explored and studied is like preparing food for a great banquet without knowing who is coming, where the slightest error can lead one far astray. Viewed from the performance of the U.S. military in Somalia, where they were at a loss when they encountered Aidid’s forces, the most modern military force does not have the ability to control public clamor, and cannot deal with an opponent who does things in an unconventional manner. On the battlefields of the future, the digitized force may very possibly be like a great cook who is good at cooking lobsters sprinkled with butter: when faced with guerrillas who resolutely gnaw corncobs, they can only sigh in despair. The “generation gap“11 in weapons and military forces is perhaps an issue that requires exceptional attention. The closer the generation gap is, the more pronounced are the battle successes of the more senior generation, while the more the gap opens, the less each party is capable of dealing with the other, and it may reach the point where no one can wipe out the other. Looking at the specific examples of battle that we have, it is difficult for high-tech troops to deal with unconventional warfare and low-tech warfare, and perhaps there is a rule here, or at least it is an interesting phenomenon which is worth studying.12",

    "section": "Part 3: New Concept Weapons and New Concepts of Weapons",
    "text": "WEAPONS OF NEW CONCEPTS AND NEW CONCEPTS OF WEAPONS Compared to new-concept weapons, nearly all the weapons that we have known so far may be termed old-concept weapons. The reason they are called old is because the basic functions of these weapons were their mobility and lethal power. Even things like precision-guided bombs and other such high- tech weapons really involve nothing more than the addition of the two elements of intelligence and structural capabilities. From the perspective of practical applications, no change in appearance can alter their nature as traditional weapons; that is, their control throughout by professional soldiers and their use on certain battlefields. All these weapons and weapons platforms that have been produced in line with traditional thinking have without exception come to a dead end in their efforts to adapt to modern warfare and future warfare. Those desires of using the magic of high technology to work some alchemy on traditional weapons so that they are completely remade have ultimately fallen into the high-tech trap involving the endless waste of limited funds and an arms race. This is the paradox that must inevitably be faced in the process of the development of traditional weapons: To ensure that the weapons are in the lead, one must continue to up the ante in development costs; the result of this continued raising of the stakes is that no one has enough money to maintain the lead. Its ultimate result is that the weapons to defend the country actually become a cause of national bankruptcy. Perhaps the most recent examples are the most convincing. Marshal Orgakov, the former chief of the Soviet general staff, was acutely aware of the trend of weapons development in the “nuclear age,” and when, at an opportune time, he proposed the brand-new concept of the “revolution in military technology,” his thinking was clearly ahead of those of his generation. But being ahead of time in his thinking hardly brought his country happiness, and actually brought about disastrous results.13 As soon as this concept—which against the backdrop of the Cold War was seen by his colleagues as setting the pace for the time-was proposed, it further intensified the arms race which had been going on for some time between the United States and the Soviet Union. It was just that at that time no one could predict that it would actually result in the breakup of the Soviet Union and its complete elimination from the superpower contest. A powerful empire collapsed without a single shot being fired, vividly corroborating the lines of the famous poem by Kipling, “When empires perish, it is not with a rumble, but a snicker.” Not only was this true for the former Soviet Union, today the Americans seem to be following in the footsteps of their old adversary, providing fresh proof of the paradox of weapons development that we have proposed. As the outlines of the age of technology integration become increasingly clear, they are investing more and more in the development of new weapons, and the cost of the weapons is getting higher and higher. The development of the F-14 and F-15 in the ’60s-’70s cost $1 billion, while the development of the B-2 in the ’80s cost over $10 billion, and the development of the F-22 in the ’90s has exceeded $13 billion. Based on weight, the B-2,14 which runs $13-$15 billion each, is some three times more expensive than an equivalent weight of gold.15 Expensive weapons like that abound in the U.S. arsenal, such as the F- 117A bomber, the F-22 main combat aircraft, and the Comanche helicopter gunship. The cost of each of these weapons exceeds or approaches $100 million, and this massive amount of weapons with unreasonable cost- effectiveness has covered the U.S. military with increasingly heavy armor, pushing them step by step toward the high-tech weapons trap where the cost stakes continue to be raised. If this is still true for the rich and brash United States, then how far can the other countries, who are short of money, continue down this path? Obviously, it will be difficult for anyone to keep going. Naturally, the way to extricate oneself from this predicament is to develop a different approach. Therefore, new-concept weapons have emerged to fill the bill. However, what seems unfair to people is that it is again the Americans who are in the lead in this trend. As early as the Vietnam War, the silver iodide powder released over the “Ho Chi Minh Trail” that resulted in torrential rains and the defoliants scattered over the subtropical forests put the “American devils” in the sole lead with regard to both the methods and ruthlessness of new- concept weapons. Thirty years later, with the dual advantages of money and technology, others are unable to hold a candle to them in this area. However, the Americans are not necessarily in the sole lead in everything. The new concepts of weapons, which came after the weapons of new concepts and which cover a wider area, were a natural extension of this. However, the Americans have not been able to get their act together in this area. This is because proposing a new concept of weapons does not require relying on the springboard of new technology, it just demands lucid and incisive thinking. However, this is not a strong point of the Americans, who are slaves to technology in their thinking. The Americans invariably halt their thinking at the boundary where technology has not yet reached. It cannot be denied that man-made earthquakes, tsunamis, weather disasters, or subsonic wave and new biological and chemical weapons all constitute new concept weapons,16 and that they have tremendous differences with what we normally speak of as weapons, but they are still all weapons whose immediate goal is to kill and destroy, and which are still related to military affairs, soldiers, and munitions. Speaking in this sense, they are nothing more than non-traditional weapons whose mechanisms have been altered and whose lethal power and destructive capabilities have been magnified several times over. However, a new concept of weapons is different. This and what people call new-concept weapons are two entirely different things. While it may be said that new-concept weapons are weapons which transcend the domain of traditional weapons, which can be controlled and manipulated at a technical level, and which are capable of inflicting material or psychological casualties on an enemy, in the face of the new concept of weapons, such weapons are still weapons in a narrow sense. This is because the new concept of weapons is a view of weapons in the broad sense, which views as weapons all means which transcend the military realm but which can still be used in combat operations. In its eyes, everything that can benefit mankind can also harm",

    "text": "This is to say that there is nothing in the world today that cannot become a weapon, and this requires that our understanding of weapons must have an awareness that breaks through all boundaries. With technological developments striving to increase the types of weapons, a breakthrough in our thinking can open up the domain of the weapons kingdom at one stroke. As we see it, a single man-made stock-market crash, a single computer virus invasion, or a single rumor or scandal that results in a fluctuation in the enemy country’s exchange rates or exposes the leaders of an enemy country on the Internet, all can be included in the ranks of new-concept weapons. A new concept of weapons provides direction for new-concept weapons, while the new-concept weapons give fixed forms to the new concept of weapons. With regard to the flood of new-concept weapons, technology is no longer the main factor, and the true underlying factor is a new concept regarding weapons. What must be made clear is that the new concept of weapons is in the process of creating weapons that are closely linked to the lives of the common people. Let us assume that the first thing we say is: The appearance of new-concept weapons will definitely elevate future warfare to a level which is hard for the common people—or even military men—to imagine. Then the second thing we have to say should be: The new concept of weapons will cause ordinary people and military men alike to be greatly astonished at the fact that commonplace things that are close to them can also become weapons with which to engage in war. We believe that some morning people will awake to discover with surprise that quite a few gentle and kind things have begun to have offensive and lethal characteristics.",

    "text": "THE TREND TO “KINDER” WEAPONS Before the appearance of the atom bomb, warfare was always in a “short-age age” with respect to lethal power. Efforts to improve weapons have primarily been to boost their lethal power, and from the “light-kill weapons” represented by cold steel weapons and single-shot firearms to the “heavy kill weapons” represented by various automatic firearms, the history of the development of weapons has almost always been a process of continuing to boost the lethal power of weapons. Prolonged shortages resulted in a thirst among military men for weapons of even greater lethal power that was difficult to satisfy. With a single red cloud that arose over the wasteland of New Mexico in the United States, military men were finally able to obtain a weapon of mass destruction that fulfilled their wishes, as this could not only completely wipe out the enemy, it could kill them 100 or 1,000 times over. This gave mankind lethal capabilities that exceeded the demand, and for the first time, there was some room to spare with regard to lethal power in war. Philosophical principles tell us that, whenever something reaches an ultimate point, it will turn in the opposite direction. The invention of nuclear weapons, this “ultra-lethal weapon” which can wipe out all mankind, has plunged mankind into an existential trap of its own making. Nuclear weapons have become a sword of Damocles hanging over the head of mankind which forces it to ponder: Do we really need “ultra-lethal weapons”? What is the difference between killing an enemy once and killing him 100 times? What is the point of defeating the enemy if it means risking the destruction of the world? How do we avoid warfare that results in ruin for all? A “balance of terror” involving “mutually assured destruction” was the immediate product of this thinking, but its by-product was to provide a braking mechanism for the runaway express of improving the lethal capabilities of weapons, which was continually picking up speed, so that the development of weapons was no longer careening crazily down the light-kill weapons-heavy-kill weapons-ultra-lethal weapons expressway, with people trying to find a new approach to weapons development which would not only be effective but which could also exercise control over the lethal power of the weapons.",

Navy Lieutenant Robert Guerli identifies seven areas of misunderstanding: overuse of analogies, threat exaggeration, overestimation of strength, historical inaccuracies, avoiding criticism of flawed attempts, unfounded assumptions, and nonstandard definitions. Air Force Major Yulin Whitehead argues that information is not all-powerful.  The U.S. Air Force distinguishes between “warfare in the information age” (using computerized weapons) and “information warfare” (treating information as a weapon).

Excessive military spending exceeding a nation's capacity can lead to falling behind in usable military forces. The B-2 bomber program exemplifies cost overruns, with one unit costing three times its weight in gold. Analysis of the 1993 Iraq air attack revealed limitations of high-tech weapons, with combined effect bombs sometimes outperforming precision bombs.  New-concept weapons include kinetic-energy, directed-energy, subsonic, geophysical, meteorological, solar energy, and gene weapons. \"Ultra-lethal weapons\" emphasizes lethality exceeding warfare needs. \"Kinder weapons\" aim to reduce casualties. The U.S. researched non-lethal weapons (optical, microwave, acoustic, and lasers) and established a research group for their development and deployment.",

Clausewitz's dictum, \"War is a continuation of politics,\" reflects this. Historical examples include wars fought over resources, religious beliefs, or even love affairs. Later, justifications became more complex, like Hitler's \"living space\" or Japan's \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,\" yet still centered on power and influence.  However, post-Cold War, motives have become blurred. Traditional alliances shift, and former enemies become partners. The Gulf War exemplifies this, with stated goals of restoring justice in Kuwait potentially masking other agendas. The increasing complexity of international relations makes it difficult to discern clear motives for conflict.",

The Western powers fought for their oil supply, the Americans for a new world order, the Saudis to eliminate an immediate threat, the British to repay a debt, and the French to maintain their regional influence.  This aggregate of self-interests transforms modern war into a race for individual gain under a shared banner. The 'common interest' becomes the largest common denominator acceptable to all parties. Consequently, understanding the diverse agendas of participating nations and even domestic interest groups is crucial for successful joint operations. A key difference between contemporary and past wars is the divergence between overt and covert goals – a principle well-known to statesmen, but often missed by soldiers.",

From compact spaces of hand-to-hand combat, firearms introduced dispersed formations, culminating in the extensive trench warfare of World War I. Technology, coupled with strategic innovation (like Fuller's tank doctrine, Douhet's air power theory, and Tukhachevsky's deep operations), propelled the battlefield into three dimensions.  Ludendorff's concept of 'total war,' blurring the lines between battlefield and non-battlefield, foreshadowed future developments.  Hitler, with access to long-range weapons, further diminished this distinction, though he failed to fully grasp its revolutionary implications. Technological advancements, from satellites and submarines to ballistic missiles and electronic warfare, are stretching the battlespace to seemingly infinite proportions, even encroaching on the human psyche through psychological operations. This expansion goes beyond simply increasing the physical area of conflict.  The emergence of 'non-natural spaces,' like the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace, creates entirely new arenas for warfare, dependent on technology and transcending traditional notions of physical dimensions.  Emerging concepts like 'network space' and 'nanometer space' hint at future wars fought without direct human involvement, potentially alongside traditional forms of combat, creating a complex, multi-dimensional battlespace.",

Maintaining large, industrialized militaries becomes less efficient in this new era.  The focus shifts to quality over quantity, prioritizing technological advancement and updated warfighting theory.  The ideal soldier is no longer the 'strong and brave' warrior, but potentially a 'pasty-faced scholar' adept at using technology. The story of a lieutenant crippling a naval division with a modem exemplifies this shift. Modern soldiers, influenced by technological advancements and pop culture, contrast sharply with their predecessors in both physical and intellectual capabilities.  Despite rigorous training, they retain a gentleness ingrained in contemporary society.  Modern weapon systems further distance them from direct combat.",

The digital fighter, unlike the traditional \"blood and iron\" warrior, operates from afar. This civilianization of warfare, driven by technological elites, challenges the traditional military structure and blurs the lines between civilian and soldier.\n\nThe emergence of computer hackers exemplifies this shift. These individuals, often without military training, can significantly compromise national security. The example of a 16-year-old hacker infiltrating U.S. military systems demonstrates the potential impact of such actors. The difficulty lies in distinguishing between harmless hacking and acts of war.  The diverse nature of hackers, ranging from curious students to network terrorists, further complicates the issue.\n\nBeyond hackers, non-state organizations, driven by extreme ideologies, pose a significant threat. Their disregard for rules and willingness to engage in unlimited warfare present a challenge to traditional military forces.\n\nA new type of non-military war is also emerging, waged by individuals like systems analysts, financiers, or media moguls.  These actors, often with strong beliefs, utilize non-military means to achieve their objectives.

    "section": "Financial Warfare",
    "text": "Economic prosperity that once excited the constant admiration of the Western world changed to a depression. After just one round of fighting, the economies of a number of countries had fallen back ten years. What is more, such a defeat on the economic front precipitates a near collapse of the social and political order. The casualties resulting from the constant chaos are no less than those resulting from a regional war, and the injury done to the living social organism even exceeds the injury inflicted by a regional war. Non-state organizations, in this their first war without the use of military force, are using non-military means to engage sovereign nations. Thus, financial war is a form of non-military warfare which is just as terribly destructive as a bloody war, but in which no blood is actually shed. Financial warfare has now officially come to war’s center stage—a stage that for thousands of years has been occupied only by soldiers and weapons, with blood and death everywhere. We believe that before long, “financial warfare” will undoubtedly be an entry in the various types of dictionaries of official military jargon. Moreover, when people revise the history books on twentieth-century warfare in the early 21st century, the section on financial warfare will command the reader’s utmost attention. The main protagonist in this section of the history book will not be a statesman or a military strategist; rather, it will be George Soros. Of course, Soros does not have an exclusive monopoly on using the financial weapon for fighting wars. Before Soros, Helmut Kohl used the deutsche mark to breach the Berlin Wall—a wall that no one had ever been able to knock down using artillery shells. After Soros began his activities, Li Denghui used the financial crisis in Southeast Asia to devalue the New Taiwan dollar, so as to launch an attack on the Hong Kong dollar and Hong Kong stocks, especially the “red-chip stocks.” In addition, we have yet to mention the crowd of large and small speculators who have come en masse to this huge dinner party for money gluttons, including Morgan Stanley and Moody’s, which are famous for the credit rating reports that they issue, and which point out promising targets of attack for the benefit of the big fish in the financial world. These two companies are typical of those entities that participate indirectly in the great feast and reap the benefits. In the summer of 1998, after the fighting in the financial war had been going on for a full year, the war’s second round of battles began to unfold on an even more extensive battlefield, and this round of battles continues to this day. This time, it was not just the countries of Southeast Asia (which had suffered such a crushing defeat during the previous year) that were drawn into the war. Two titans were also drawn in-Japan and Russia. This resulted in making the global economic situation even more grim and difficult to control. The blinding flames even set alight the fighting duds of those who ventured to play with fire in the first place. It is reported that Soros and his “Quantum Fund” lost not less than several billion dollars in Russia and Hong Kong alone. Thus we can get at least an inkling of the magnitude of financial war’s destructive power. Today, when nuclear weapons have already become frightening mantelpiece decorations that are losing their real operational value with each passing day, financial war has become a “hyperstrategic” weapon that is attracting the attention of the world. This is because financial war is easily manipulated and allows for concealed actions, and is also highly destructive. By analyzing the chaos in Albania not long ago, we can clearly see the role played by various types of foundations that were set up by transnational groups and millionaires with riches rivaling the wealth of nation states. These foundations control the media, control subsidies to political organizations, and limit any resistance from the authorities, resulting in a collapse of national order and the downfall of the legally authorized government. Perhaps we could dub this type of war “foundation-style” financial war. The greater and greater frequency and intensity of this type of war, and the fact that more and more countries and non-state organizations are deliberately using it, are causes for concern and are facts that we must face squarely.",

    "section": "New Terror War",
    "text": "Due to the limited scale of a traditional terror war, its casualties might well be fewer than the casualties resulting from a conventional war or campaign. Nevertheless, a traditional terror war carries a stronger flavor of violence. Moreover, in terms of its operations, a traditional terror war is never bound by any of the traditional rules of the society at large. From a military standpoint, then, the traditional terror war is characterized by the use of limited resources to fight an unlimited war. This characteristic invariably puts national forces in an extremely unfavorable position even before war breaks out, since national forces must always conduct themselves according to certain rules and therefore are only able to use their unlimited resources to fight a limited war. This explains how a terrorist organization made up of just a few inexperienced members can nevertheless give a mighty country like the U.S. headaches, and also why “using a sledgehammer to kill an ant” often proves ineffective. The most recent proof is the case of the two explosions that occurred simultaneously at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The advent of bin Laden-style terrorism has deepened the impression that a national force, no matter how powerful, will find it difficult to gain the upper hand in a game that has no rules. Even if a country turns itself into a terrorist element, it will not necessarily be able to achieve success. Be that as it may, if all terrorists confined their operations simply to the traditional approach of bombings, kidnappings, assassinations, and plane hijackings, this would represent less than the maximum degree of terror. What really strikes terror into people’s hearts is the rendezvous of terrorists with various types of new, high technologies that possibly will evolve into new superweapons. We already have a hint of what the future may hold—a hint that may well cause concern. When Aum Shinrikyo followers discharged “Sarin” poison gas in a Tokyo subway, the casualties resulting from the poison gas accounted for just a small portion of the terror. This affair put people on notice that modern biochemical technology had already forged a lethal weapon for those terrorists who would try to carry out the mass destruction of humanity. In contradistinction to masked killers that rely on the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people to produce terror, the “Falange Armed Forces” group in Italy is a completely different class of high-tech terrorist organization. Its goals are explicit and the means that it employs are extraordinary. It specializes in breaking into the computer networks of banks and news organizations, stealing stored data, deleting programs, and disseminating disinformation. These are classic terrorist operations directed against networks and the media. This type of terrorist operation uses the latest technology in the most current fields of study, and sets itself against humanity as a whole. We might well call this type of operation “new terror war.”",

By methods such as causing earthquakes and altering precipitation patterns, the atmospheric temperature, the composition of the atmosphere, sea level height, and sunshine patterns, the earth’s physical environment is damaged or an alternate local ecology is created. Perhaps before very long, a man-made El Nino or La Nina effect will become yet another kind of superweapon in the hands of certain nations and or non-state organizations. It is more likely that a nonstate organization will become the prime initiator of ecological war, because of its terrorist nature, because it feels it has no responsibility to the people or to the society at large, and because non-state organizations have consistently demonstrated that they unwilling to play by the rules of the game. Moreover, since the global ecological environment will frequently be on the borderline of catastrophe as nations strive for the most rapid development possible, there is a real danger that the slightest increase or decrease in any variable would be enough to touch off an ecological holocaust.",

    "section": "Other Non-Military Warfare Methods",
    "text": "Aside from what we have discussed above, we can point out a number of other means and methods used to fight a non-military war, some of which already exist and some of which may exist in the future. Such means and methods include psychological warfare (spreading rumors to intimidate the enemy and break down his will); smuggling warfare (throwing markets into confusion and attacking economic order); media warfare (manipulating what people see and hear in order to lead public opinion along); drug warfare (obtaining sudden and huge illicit profits by spreading disaster in other countries); network warfare (venturing out in secret and concealing one’s identity in a type of warfare that is virtually impossible to guard against); technological warfare (creating monopolies by setting standards independently); fabrication warfare (presenting a counterfeit appearance of real strength before the eyes of the enemy); resources warfare (grabbing riches by plundering stores of resources); economic aid warfare (bestowing favor in the open and contriving to control matters in secret, cultural warfare (leading cultural trends along in order to assimilate those with different views); and international law warfare (seizing the earliest opportunity to set up regulations), etc., etc. In addition, there are other types of non-military warfare which are too numerous to mention. In this age, when the plethora of new technologies can in turn give rise to a plethora of new means and methods of fighting war (not to mention the cross combining and creative use of these means and methods), it would simply be senseless and a waste of effort to list all of the means and methods one by one. What is significant is that all of these warfighting means, along with their corresponding applications, that have entered, are entering, or will enter the ranks of warfighting means in the service of war, have already begun to quietly change the view of warfare held by all of mankind. Faced with a nearly infinitely diverse array of options to choose from, why do people want to enmesh themselves in a web of their own making and select and use means of warfare that are limited to the realm of the force of arms and military power? Methods that are not characterized by the use of the force of arms, nor by the use of military power, nor even by the presence of casualties and bloodshed, are just as likely to facilitate the successful realization of the war’s goals, if not more so. As a matter of course, this prospect has led to revision of the statement that “war is politics with bloodshed,” and in turn has also led to a change in the hitherto set view that warfare prosecuted through force of arms is the ultimate means of resolving conflict. Clearly, it is precisely the diversity of the means employed that has enlarged the concept of warfare. Moreover, the enlargement of the concept of warfare has, in turn, resulted in enlargement of the realm of war-related activities. If we confine ourselves to warfare in the narrow sense on the traditional battlefield now, it will very difficult for us to regain our foothold in the future. Any war that breaks out tomorrow or further down the road will be characterized by warfare in the broad sense—a cocktail mixture of warfare prosecuted through the force of arms and warfare that is prosecuted by means other than the force of arms. The goal of this kind of warfare will encompass more than merely “using means that involve the force of arms to force the enemy to accept “ones own will.” Rather, the goal should be “to use all means whatsoever—means that involve the force of arms and means that do not involve the force of arms, means that involve military power and means that do not involve military power, means that entail casualties and means that do not entail casualties—to force the enemy to serve one’s own interests.",

There are similar stories, and some military experts believe these represent a new reality.  Alvin and Heidi Toffler, in their book *War and Anti-War*, argued that if the tools of warfare are computer viruses and microrobots, then nations are no longer the only armed groups, nor soldiers the only possessors of these tools.  Japanese Self-Defense Forces Colonel Shoichi Takama, in his article “What the Revolution in Military Affairs is Bringing—The Form War Will Take in 2020,” noted the civilianization of war as a key characteristic of 21st-century warfare.  Many hackers are adopting “network guerrilla warfare” tactics. Precision warfare, combining increased weapons accuracy with increased battlefield transparency, is another new form of warfighting.  (See “From Gettysburg to the Gulf and Beyond,” by Colonel Richard J. Dunn III, quoted in *World Military Affairs Yearbook for 1997*).",

    "text": "Sixty years ago, during combat with Japan, MacArthur and Nimitz each developed their own Pacific strategies, creating challenges for President Roosevelt.  Thirty years later, US aircraft bombing Vietnam had to follow commands from four different headquarters.  Until about fifteen years ago, separate and independent command systems created confusion and had disastrous consequences, such as the loss of approximately 200 Marines in Beirut.  General Norman Schwarzkopf experienced this problem firsthand in Grenada, where each service arm acted independently.  Ironically, this decades-old problem was solved not by seasoned generals or statesmen, but by two congressmen, Goldwater and Nichols.  Their 1986 DoD Reorganization Act mandated unified command during joint combat operations.  The Gulf War provided a timely opportunity to test the Act’s effectiveness.  Powell, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gained clear authority as the President’s chief military advisor, able to issue direct orders to the services. Schwarzkopf, as battlefield commander, held true power, free from Pentagon interference.  He exercised his trans-service authority, vetoing a Marine amphibious landing request in favor of his “Left Hook” plan.  The Act’s successful implementation in the Gulf War demonstrated the contractual mentality of American legal society. The new command pattern reduced command levels, implemented true entrusted command, and shifted from a tree-structure to a network structure, enabling better information sharing.  The reorganization was timely, addressing the demands of a new age by recombining dispersed service arm authority into a super-authority focused on temporary goals, ensuring battlefield success.  Any nation hoping to win wars in the 21st century must face the choice of reorganizing or being defeated.",

    "text": "The \"Air-Land Battle\" doctrine, designed to counter Warsaw Pact tank formations in Europe, found an unexpected testing ground in the Gulf War.  The “Desert Storm” air campaign far exceeded pre-war expectations, rendering the ground war almost an afterthought.  Douhet’s airpower theories were seemingly validated, but the Gulf War’s air campaign was far more complex, incorporating reconnaissance, early warning, bombing, dogfights, communications, electronic strikes, command and control, and the struggle for space and cyberspace.  The US military’s approach had moved beyond Douhet and even beyond “Air-Land Battle,” toward an integrated, “omni-dimensional combat” approach.  Key to this evolution was the “air tasking order,” a daily 300-page document drafted jointly by the Army, Navy, and Air Force.  This order enabled Schwarzkopf to command the entire allied air force, selecting optimal strike targets for over 1,000 aircraft launching trans-service, transborder air strikes. Though the Navy felt the order was “Air Force-oriented,” it successfully organized the most massive and complex air campaign in history, serving as a model for future combat operations. The “air tasking order” demonstrated the potential for complex transnational combinations, exceeding the vision of the “Air-Land Battle” theorists and unintentionally ushering in a new era of warfare.",

This type of thinking lagging behind action is regrettably common in military history. Similarly, despite successfully using helicopters against Iraqi armored units in the Gulf War, the US Army reverted to pre-war thinking, prioritizing tanks over helicopters.  The Gulf War provided helicopters a chance to demonstrate their potential. The US deployed 1,600 helicopters, enough to form a helicopter army, but used them as attachments to other units, mirroring the French use of tanks in WWII.  Fortunately, the helicopters’ performance shone through.  They destroyed Iraqi early-warning radar, enabling safe passage for bombers, and performed numerous support roles, including supply transport, medical evacuation, reconnaissance, and electronic countermeasures. In the battle of Khafji, helicopters were instrumental in repelling the Iraqi offensive. “Operation Cobra,” where the 101st Airborne Division used over 300 helicopters for a deep penetration into Iraq, showcased the helicopter’s potential. Though underappreciated amidst the hype surrounding other weapons systems, the helicopters provided invaluable service in Desert Storm.",

    "text": "Euphrates River valley as well as intercepting the Iraqi troops fleeing along the Hamal dike road. This was definitely the most deeply significant tactical operation of the ground war. It proclaimed that, from this point, helicopters were perfectly capable of conducting large-scale operations independently. When the throngs of Iraqi soldiers ran from the fortifications destroyed by the helicopters and knelt to beg to surrender, they were in turn herded into a group by the helicopters just like a cattle drive, and the view that “only the infantry can ultimately resolve a battle” has now been radically shaken by these American “flying cowboys.” Originally, the initial intent of the leapfrog operation by the helicopters was just to provide support for the armored units that were to handle the main offensive, but the unexpected success of the helicopter units caused the plan to fall far behind the developments in the battle situation. Because of this, Schwarzkopf had to order the VII Corps to attack 15 hours ahead of time, and although under the command of General Franks the speed of the advance of the VII Corps through the desert was far faster than that of Gudarian, who became famous for launching tank blitzkriegs, he did not win the good “blitzkrieg” reputation, but actually was rebuked for “moving forward slowly, one step at a time, like an old lady.” Following the war, General Franks refuted the criticism that came from the allied headquarters in Riyadh, based on the reason that the Iraqi military still had fighting capabilities.\nIn reality, neither the critics nor those who refuted them had grasped the essence of the problem. The reason that the mobility of the tanks under General Franks’ command was criticized was precisely because of the comparison with the helicopters. To this day, there has still been no example of combat which has demonstrated that any kind of tanks can keep up with the combat pace of helicopters. Actually, this did not just involve mobility. As the former “kings of land warfare,” the tanks are being challenged by the helicopters on all fronts. Compared to the tanks, which have to constantly labor to overcome the coefficient of friction of the earth’s surface, the helicopters’ battlespace is at treetop level, so they are totally unaffected by any surface obstacles and their excellent mobility is sufficient to cancel out the flaw of not having heavy armor. Similarly, as mobile weapons platforms, their firepower is by no means inferior to that of the tanks, and this represents the greatest crisis encountered by tanks since they ascended the stage of warfare. What is even tougher for the tanks is the energy required to organize a sizable tank group assault (transporting a given number of tanks to a staging area alone is a massive headache) and the risks one runs (when tanks are massed, they are extremely vulnerable to preemptive strikes by the enemy), so they really have no advantages to speak of when compared to helicopters, which are good at dispersed deployment and concentrated strikes, and which can be massed to engage in conventional warfare or dispersed to fight guerrilla warfare. In fact, tanks and helicopters are natural enemies, but the former is far from a match for the latter, and even the outmoded AH-1 “Cobra” helicopters, not to mention the AH-64 “tank-killer” helicopters, destroyed upwards of 100 tanks during the Gulf War while sustaining no casualties at all of their own. Faced with the powerful strike capabilities of the helicopters, who can still maintain that “the best weapon to deal with tanks are tanks?” We can now say that helicopters are the true tank terminators. This new star, which rose gradually over the waves of the Gulf, is in the process of achieving its own coronation through the illustrious battle achievements during the Gulf War, and there is no doubt that it is just a question of time before it drives the tank from the battlefield. It may not take very long before “winning a land battle from the air” is no longer an overdramatized slogan, and more and more ground force commanders are reaching a consensus on this point. Furthermore, the new concepts of a “flying army” and “flying ground warfare” in which the helicopter is the main battle weapon may become standard military jargon and appear in every military dictionary.",

    "section": "The Media War",
    "text": "Leaving aside the point that as commander in chief of the three services Bush certainly knew the time the attack was to begin, when viewed simply in terms of the CNN television broadcasts, the whole world was the same as the U.S. president in that they saw at the same time the soul-stirring start of the war. In the information-sharing age, a president doesn’t really have much more in the way of special privileges than an ordinary citizen. This is where modern warfare differs from any wars of the past, with realtime or near real-time reports turning warfare into a new program that ordinary people can monitor directly via the media, and thus the media has become an immediate and integral part of warfare, and no longer merely provides information coming from the battlefield. Unlike a direct broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, everything that people saw, other than that which was first limited by the subjective perspective of the television reporters (the 1,300 reporters sent to the front lines were all aware of the “Revised Regulations Regarding Gulf War News Reports” that had just been issued by the Pentagon, so each person in his own mind exercised restraint about what could and could not be reported), also had to go through the security reviews at the joint news offices set up in Dhahran and Riyadh. Perhaps U.S. military circles and the media had both learned the lesson during the Vietnam War when the discord between the two was so great, but this time the news agencies and the military got along very well. There is one figure that perhaps can illustrate this issue very well. Of the more than 1,300 news items released throughout the entire period of the war, only five were sent to Washington for review, and of these four received approval within several hours, while the remaining item was canceled by the press unit itself. With the concerted assistance of the news reporters, the battlefield commanders successfully influenced the eyes and ears of the entire world, getting people to see everything that the military wanted them to see, while no one was able to see anything that they did not want people to know. The U.S. press uniformly abandoned its vaunted neutrality, enthusiastically joining the anti-Iraq camp and coordinating with the U.S. military just like an outstanding two-man comic act, quite tacitly and energetically arriving at the same script for the war, with the force of the media and that of the allied army forming a joint force regarding the attack on Iraq. Not long after Iraq invaded Kuwait, reports quickly appeared in the various media that a massive U.S. force was streaming into Saudi Arabia, causing the Iraqi military on the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border to flinch and quietly creating the necessary momentum for a “hobbling” operation. The day before the start of “Desert Storm,” the Western media again trumpeted the news of a U.S. carrier fleet passing through the Suez Canal, which served to confuse Saddam and have him believe that, with disaster looming, the U.S. forces had still not completed their deployment. Similarly, without the support of the embellishment by the media, none of the so-called high-tech weapons sent to be used in the Gulf War would have been as awesome as people believed. In the upwards of 98 press conferences held throughout the entire course of the war, people saw images of how the precision-guided missiles could penetrate the air vents in a building and explode, of “Patriots” intercepting “Scuds,” and numerous other shots that left a profound impression. All these things represented an intense visual shock to the entire world, including the Iraqis, and it was from this that the myth about the unusual powers of the U.S.-made weapons was born, and it was here that the belief was formed that “Iraq would inevitably lose, and the U.S. was bound to win.” Obviously, the media helped the Americans enormously. We might as well say that, intentionally or otherwise, the U.S. military and the Western media joined hands to form a noose to hang Saddam’s Iraq from the gallows. In the “Operational Outline” that was revised after the war, the Americans took pains to suggest that “the force of the media reports was able to have a dramatic effect on the strategic direction and the scope of the military operations,” while the newly drafted field manual FM10O-6 (Information Operations) goes even farther in using the example of the media war during the Gulf War. It would appear that, in all future wars, in addition to the basic method of military strikes, the force of the media will increasingly be another player in the war and will play a role comparable to that of military strikes in promoting the course of the war. Unlike battlefield propaganda, which has an excessively subjective tinge and is easily rejected by an opponent or neutral individuals, because it is cleverly cloaked as objective reporting the media has a quiet impact that is hard to gauge. In the Gulf, in the same manner that the U.S.-led allied forces deprived Iraq of its right to speak militarily, the powerful Western media deprived it politically of its right to speak, to defend itself, and even of its right to sympathy and support, and compared to the weak voice of Iraqi propaganda, which portrayed Bush as the “great Satan” who was wicked beyond redemption, the image of Saddam as a war-crazed aggressor was played up in a much more convincing fashion. It was precisely the lopsided media force together with the lopsided military force that dealt a vicious one-two blow to Iraq on the battlefield and morally, and this sealed Saddam’s defeat. However, the effects of the media have always been a two-edged sword. This means that, while it is directed at the enemy, at the same time on another front it can similarly be a sharp sword directed at oneself. Based on information that was disclosed following the war, the reason that the ground war abruptly came to a halt after 100 hours was actually because Bush, influenced by a hasty assessment of the course of the war that was issued on television by a battlefield news-release officer, later came to a similarly hasty decision of his own, “dramatically shortening the time from strategic decision-making to concluding the war.” As a result, Saddam, whose days were numbered, escaped certain death, and it also left a string of “desert thunder” operations, which were ultimately duds, for Clinton, who came to power later. The impact of the media on warfare is becoming increasingly widespread and increasingly direct, to the point where even major decisions by the president of a superpower such as this one involving the cessation of hostilities are to a very great extent rooted in the reaction to a single television program. From this, one can perceive a bit of the significance that the media carries in social life today. One can say entirely without exaggeration that an uncrowned king has now become the major force to win any battle. After “Desert Storm” swept over the Gulf, no longer would it be possible to rely on military force alone without the involvement of the media to achieve victory in a war.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 4 WHAT DO AMERICANS GAIN BY TOUCHING THE ELEPHANT? Aerial combat was the decisive factor for victory in the war against Iraq. High technology weapons were effectively used, and not only were they the key reason that air and ground troops demonstrated remarkably in combat, they also were the key reason United Nations forces were able keep their casualties and fatalities so low. LES ASPIN THE GULF WAR has been the United States military’s biggest war catch in the past few decades. When the war had just ended, the American military, members of Congress, and various civic organizations began to carry out a detailed examination of this catch from different points of view. From each of the reports submitted by them and each of the steps subsequently taken by the American military, the tremendous achievements of this examination can be seen. These achievements, moreover, are all extremely valuable to armies and military personnel throughout the world, and there must be no delay in looking at them. Because the nationalistic instincts of the Americans I especially admire are particularly prominent in the longstanding sectarianism that exists among the military services, theoretical blind spots and thought errors are bound to occur in the research, to the extent that a grand warfare investigation has been turned into a blind person trying to size up an elephant. This is a topic that requires our clear reexamination and should not be treated as an excuse to deny its value. But what is it, after all, that Americans want to feel on this big beast? Let’s first take a look at it. HAND EXTENDED UNDER THE MILITARY FENCE (EACH ARMED SERVICE VIEWS WAR DIFFERENTLY) The fence erected between the U.S. Army and the Navy since the time of the Civil War not only could not be eliminated after the birth of the U.S. Air Force, it instead became the fence separating the three branches of the military. It became the historical chronic disease giving headaches to the president and the Pentagon. Even though there was an effective “reorganization method” during the Gulf War, it was not so much a clever way for getting to the root of the problem as it was an expedient measure for bringing about a temporary solution in light of this invisible obstacle. As soon as things had settled down and all the troops had returned home, the doors were closed as before and everyone went their own way. Nevertheless, the high-ranking officers at the head of each of the three military branches certainly not a mediocre generation of stupidly unchanging leaders. The course and outcome expected from the Gulf War at the time when it shocked the whole world also deeply shook these “Desert Storm” policymakers. The dumbfounded feelings of having lost an adversary that came as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union along with the renewed motivation to establish the United States at the forefront of the new world order made these leaders clearly realize the urgency with which they must reform the armed forces even though they still had no intention of abandoning their prejudices. In view of each of the successive military combat regulations in the 1990s, its starting points have without exception been established on the basis of the many fresh experiences and lessons gained in the Gulf War. Just as “in the eyes of a thousand people, there are a thousand views,” what unfolded in the eyes of the three branches of the U.S. military were three different Gulf Wars. In this war, which not only was the last war of old times, but also the inaugural war of modern times, each of the three branches stuck to its own arguments and made every effort to find the evidence most advantageous to its respective branch, hardly realizing that the hand outstretched from behind the military wall could not possibly make heads or tails of such a big elephant as the Gulf War. General Sullivan felt what may have",

    "text": "Though the U.S. Army performed adequately in Desert Storm, its showing was not considered outstanding, especially compared to the Air Force's bombing campaign. General Sullivan, recognizing the potential for stagnation after the Cold War, initiated plans for a \"21st Century Army,\" focusing on digitization and information warfare. This initiative, while ostensibly aimed at modernization, also served to secure a larger share of the shrinking military budget. His successor, General Reimer, continued this strategy, using the \"digitized force\" as a justification for increased funding.  However, the rapid pace of technological change made it difficult to finalize designs and establish a stable force. The dependence on a single technology also raised concerns about creating an \"electronic Maginot Line.\"  The Air Force, emboldened by its success in the Gulf War, sought to assert its dominance within the armed forces. Generals McPeak and Fogleman aimed to capitalize on their proven air power capabilities, reorganizing their forces and establishing an expeditionary force capable of rapid deployment.  They also prioritized electronic and information warfare, establishing a dedicated center. However, inter-service rivalry, particularly with the Army over operational command, hampered the effective sharing of lessons learned from the Gulf War.  The Navy, having played a minimal role in Desert Storm, underwent a significant strategic shift.  Moving away from Mahan's doctrine of commanding the seas, the Navy embraced a new focus on supporting coastal and land-based operations, as outlined in the white paper \"From Sea to Land.\"  This transformation, further emphasized in subsequent documents, aimed to secure the Navy's relevance and budgetary share.  Admiral Boorda and his successor, Admiral Johnson, championed this new direction, arguing that the Navy's unique global reach made it the ideal core of a joint combat force.  This strategy proved successful, with the Navy experiencing minimal budget cuts compared to other branches.",

    "text": "Large-scale use of costly weapons to reduce casualties without counting costs—this kind of warfare, waged by the wealthy, is a game the American military excels at. “Desert Storm” showcased American extravagance, becoming an addiction.  Expensive aircraft conducted indiscriminate bombings, destroying targets with costly missiles and precision-guided bombs. Even if aware of the unnecessary expense of this \\$61 billion banquet, their extravagance was unchecked. An American bomber, more costly than many targets, raises suspicions.  For 161 days, personnel and materials were transported, including unnecessary items like sun hats and rotting fruit. This extravagant logistical operation was deemed “historically unheard of.”  Only Americans would consider this necessary to win a war. The Pentagon, remolded by McNamara’s commercial spirit, focuses on the costs of luxury warfare. Even the House Armed Services Committee remained silent on the astonishing expenditures.  High-technology weaponry received high praise, with Secretary of Defense Cheney boasting of a generational lead in weapons technology. This wasn't just pride in achieving objectives; it reflects a national unwillingness to pay the price of life, always vying for victory at all costs. High-technology weaponry satisfies this extravagant hope.  During the Gulf War, casualty numbers were remarkably low.  Since Vietnam, both the military and society have become sensitive, almost morbid, about casualties. Reducing casualties and achieving war objectives are equally weighted. American soldiers have become precious commodities.  Opponents have learned that if they cannot defeat the force, they should target the soldiers. The Congressional Report confirms, “reducing casualties is the highest objective.” The pursuit of zero casualties motivates American-style extravagant warfare.  The unchecked use of advanced weaponry and tactics prioritizes minimizing casualties, even if it means using disproportionate force.  This warfare is like killing a chicken with a bull knife. High-technology, high-investment, and high-expenditure reduce the need for sophisticated strategy and skill. This war became a showcase of high-tech weaponry, spreading American-style extravagance globally.  As the world’s leading arms dealers, Americans are overjoyed. This high-tech, dull, and expensive war, like a Hollywood movie with a simple plot and complex special effects, left many believing this is how modern warfare is fought, creating a yearning for high-technology weapons. Americans, skilled in machinery and infatuated with luxuries, have a penchant for turning technology into luxury, including weapons.  This infatuation leads to blind faith in technology, believing it holds the key to victory. They constantly strive to maintain their technological lead, producing newer, more complex weapons.  This prioritization of weaponry over strategy and courage makes them view war as a technological race rather than a test of morale and wisdom.  Their self-confidence makes them forget that war is not a fixed race course but a dynamic field with unpredictable factors. While they benefited from the Gulf War’s technological victory, they remain resolute in maintaining their technological edge, despite funding difficulties.  The list of extravagant weapons will grow, but the casualty count in future wars may not remain zero.",

    "text": "The U.S. Army has grappled with the question of its 21st-century needs. The Gulf War highlighted the contrast between the Army's mediocre performance and the impact of high-technology weapons. This spurred the need for reform, with resistance coming not from the upper echelon but from newly promoted division commanders.  The “brigade faction,” however, believed the Army troops needed an overhaul, advocating for programs like “crack troops,” “model troops,” and “primary brigade.”  General Sullivan, despite supporting these new ideas, couldn't convince the majority of generals. After his departure, a compromise led to the creation of a new experimental brigade based on the Fourth Mechanized Unit. The “divisional faction” prevailed. The “brigade faction” persisted, arguing against a cumbersome military force, advocating for smaller, more agile combat troops.  Amidst this debate, Lieutenant Colonel Maigeleige proposed abandoning both division and brigade systems in favor of 5,000-man battle groups. This flexible, mission-oriented approach resonated, with General Reimer requiring all generals to read Maigeleige’s book. The concept of a “group” wasn't new, but previous attempts were unsuccessful.  Maigeleige argued that modern weaponry empowers smaller forces, and the C4I system enables united action, making traditional divisional or brigade systems obsolete.  While technological advancement doesn’t automatically translate to advanced military thought, Maigeleige’s “group” concept challenged established structures, representing a new wave of thinking in U.S. Army reform.  Unlike the Army, the Air Force and Navy, lacking entrenched traditions, adapted more readily.",

This involved deploying a nimble force of 1,175 personnel and 34 aircraft within 48 hours, capable of maintaining air combat throughout a conflict.  Three such forces were established and deployed in operations like \"Southern Watch\" and \"Desert Thunder.\" The Navy, guided by the \"Forward Position … From Sea to Land\" strategy, pursued a similar approach. Through exercises like \"Ocean Risk,\" \"Double Assault,\" and \"Silent Killer,\" and real-world operations such as \"Southern Watch\" and \"Hope Renewal,\" the Navy refined its expeditionary force concept. This force, comprising a battleship group, an amphibious guard force, and Marine Corps task forces, aimed to rapidly control seas and engage in coastal combat.  These reforms impacted weapons development, tactics, and even national strategy. The small, flexible expeditionary forces, suitable for both combat and non-combat tasks, became a favored tool for the U.S. government, leading to an increased reliance on force in international affairs.",

    "text": "While American military technology leads, its theory sometimes lags.  The Gulf War highlighted the need to align military thinking with technological advancements. The U.S. military engaged in \"thought exchange transfusion,\" focusing on \"joint campaign\" and \"total dimensional warfare\" concepts.  The \"joint campaign\" concept, originating from the \"United States Armed Forces Joint Operations\" regulations, emphasized centralized command, equality of armed forces, complete unification, and total depth in battle.  This aimed to improve inter-service cooperation and unified operations. However, internal resistance persisted, with branches prioritizing their core functions and seeking clearly defined roles and authorities.  Despite Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili's efforts, skepticism remained, particularly within the Marine Corps and Air Force, who valued service distinctiveness and flexibility. The \"joint campaign\" concept, while valuable in promoting interoperability, remained limited by its focus on armed forces rather than a broader understanding of conflict.  The 1993 U.S. Army publication \"The Essentials of War\" introduced the concept of \"non-combat military operations,\" hinting at total positional warfare and \"total dimensional warfare.\" This concept emphasized total depth, height, frontage, time, frequency, and multiple methods.  However, this revolutionary idea faced internal opposition, with some arguing against differentiating between combat and non-combat operations. This resistance ultimately led to the discontinuation of this line of thinking within the Army.",

    "section": "Doctrine Evolution and Critique",
    "text": "The Army Training and Doctrine Headquarters, under General Hartzog and General Holder, along with the editorial group for the 1998 publication of *The Essentials of War*, implemented a significant amendment. This amendment established “a single principle covering all types of the Army’s military operations.”  They moved away from distinguishing between non-combat and general military operations, instead classifying battle operations into four types: attack, defense, stabilization, and support.  Traditional non-combat operations like rescue, protection, and reassembly were re-categorized. This aimed to streamline combat principles and discard the concept of “total dimensional warfare.”\n\nWhile seemingly a simplification, this revision was arguably flawed. Eliminating the confusing “non-combat military operations” concept also discarded valuable associated insights.  This mirrors a common pattern of progress followed by regression.  However, criticizing the U.S. Army's approach doesn't invalidate critiques of “total dimensional warfare.”  The theory has flaws in both denotation and connotation.  While “total dimensional war” broadens the understanding of battle beyond previous theories, it remains confined within the “military” category.\n\nThe concept of “non-military combat operations” surpasses military combat operations, encompassing realms beyond the scope of American military thinking. This is a fertile ground for future strategists to explore. Consequently, “total dimensional warfare” falls short of its implied comprehensiveness. The U.S. Army's definition lacks clarity on the number of dimensions involved and their interrelationships.  Without a clear understanding of the dimensions, the relationships between them—a concept with significant potential—cannot be fully developed.\n\nPractically, no war can encompass all dimensions, including time and non-physical elements.  Every war has specific focuses and operates within limited dimensions. In the future, military operations will constitute only one dimension of war. Even including “non-combat military operations” doesn’t achieve total dimensionality.  Only by incorporating all “non-military combat operations” can the full meaning of total dimensional war be realized. This crucial concept has been absent from U.S. military theoretical research since the Gulf War.  Despite the innovative ideas in “non-combat military operations” and “total dimensional warfare” approaching a military ideological revolution stemming from the technological revolution, the Americans halted their progress just short of a breakthrough.",

This integration encompasses battle theory, organization, training, leadership development, equipment, personnel, and base facilities. The U.S. Army generally considers the 21st-century force as the current force engaged in information-age operations experiments, research, and equipment acquisition to prepare ground troops for missions up to 2010. General Dennis J. Reimer positions “The 2010 Army Concept” as the theoretical link between “The 21st Century Army” (current plan) and “The Army of Tomorrow” (long-range plan), ensuring coordinated development.\n\nTechnological advancement outpaces weaponry development, creating disparities and potentially causing leaders to fall behind. This poses a challenge for professional militaries and large-scale information technology industries. Consequently, the U.S. is sensitive to the proliferation of new military and even civilian technologies. Some, like Colonel Allen Campen, caution against hastily adopting untested tactics, warning of potential risks to national security.\n\nThe Gulf War highlighted the importance of air power, with General Charles Horner's Joint Force Air Squadron Headquarters gaining significant publicity despite being under Schwarzkopf's command. The Air Force's post-Cold War strategic plan, *Global Arrival, Global Power* (June 1990), was validated by the Gulf War.  Inter-service cooperation is emphasized, with joint Army-Air Force war exercises being conducted. In 1997, the Air Force unveiled *Global Participation—The Plan for the United States Air Force in the 21st Century*, aiming to establish a globally present air and space force. Despite the official cancellation of “Star Wars,” space militarization continues, with the Air Force prioritizing transformation into an air and space force. The space flight headquarters focuses on space troop functionality, and the “Tentative Plan For 2020” outlines war concepts like space control, global war, force consolidation, and global cooperation. By 2020, space control objectives include ensuring access to space, surveillance, protection of U.S. and allied space systems, and preventing enemy use of space assets.\n\nThe Navy and Marine Corps shifted their strategic focus with the 1992 White Paper, *From the Sea to Land*, emphasizing forward deployment.  Admiral J. M. Boorda also advocated for prioritized naval budgeting. The Department of Defense's reports detail budgetary requirements and technological advancements.  The Gulf War experience led to a focus on cost-effectiveness and minimizing casualties, influenced by McNamara's business-oriented approach.  However, some, like Colonel Xiaochaersi Denglapu, warn that enemies might exploit this focus by inflicting casualties through reckless attacks.",

Because of budgetary limitations, the U.S. Navy plans to wait until 2001 to apply for allocation for this ship … the Navy originally decided to put off requesting allocation to build the first LPD-17 amphibious dock transport until the 1998 fiscal year rather than 1996. However, What exceeded expectations was that Congress voted to approve allocation of U.S. $974 million for this warship.”\n\nIn 1993, the United States Report on the Complete Investigation of Defense proposed, “The following troop ‘package’ is enough to handle a large-scale regional conflict: four to five Army units; four to five ground force expeditionary units; 10 Air Force combat mechanized forces; 100 Air Force heavy bombers; four to five Naval warship combat troops; special combat forces … other than this, we have proposed a new concept for troops abroad—‘self-adapted special establishment unified troops.’ According to the requirements of the battle zone command, it is organized from specially designated Air Force troops, ground troops, and special type combat troops and Navy troops.”\n\nFor the “Joint Doctrine for 2010” put forward in 1996 by the United States joint military meeting, see Joint Force Quarterly, Summer 1996. In the Winter 1996 edition of Joint Force Quarterly, Naval War Commander Johnson and Air Force Chief of Staff Fogleman both expressed support for the “Joint Doctrine for 2010.” Army Chief of Staff Reimer also immediately put forward the “Army Concept for 2010” in response to the “Joint Doctrine for 2010.”\n\nSee the article, “Reform Will Not Be Smooth Sailing,” by Commander Huofuman in the United States Naval Institute Journal, January 1998.\n\nThere is a detailed introduction to “Total Dimensional Warfare” in the 1997 World Military Almanac. (pp. 291-294).\n\nAccording to the article “Changes to the Newly Published Draft of ‘Essentials of War,’” by Xiaoen Neile in the United States Army Times, August 18, 1997.\n\nThere probably is only the article, “A Military Theoretical Revolution: The Various Mutually Active Dimensions of War,” by Antuli’ao Aiqieweiliya, that has pointed out that the “various dimensions” of war should not be such things as length, breadth, and depth indicated in geometric and space theory. Instead, it is such factors that are intimately related to war as politics, society, technology, combat, and logistics. It is too bad, however, that he still centers on the military axis to look at war and has not formed a breakthrough in war denotation.\n\nAt the Strategy Conference held by the United States Army War College in April 1996, Army Lieutenant Colonel Lonnie Henley wrote a paper for a report entitled “21st Century China: Strategic Partner … or Opponent.” The conclusion was: “In at least the first 25 years of the next century, China will be unable to carry out a military revolution.” (See the Foreign Military Data of the Military Science Academy Foreign Military Research Department, June 1997).",

    "text": "Therefore, soldiers do not have a constant position, water does not have a constant shape, and to be able to attain victory in response to the changes of the enemy is called miraculous. SUN ZI\n\nThe direction of warfare is an art similar to a physician seeing a patient. FU LE\n\nThe expression of “military revolution” is as fashionable as Jordan’s NBA fans. Aside from the appearance of each new thing having its factors of necessity, I am afraid that even more essential is that it is related to Americans being adept at creating fashions. The Americans, who have always liked to hold a leading position in the world in terms of various questions, are very good at putting pretty packaging on each prospective thing and then afterwards dumping it on the whole world. Even though many nations have been anxious about and resisted the invasion of American culture, yet most have followed suit and completely imitated their views in terms of the issue of the military revolution. The results are not difficult to predict, and so when the Americans catch a cold, the entire world sneezes. Because Perry, the former Secretary of the Department of Defense of the United States, emphasized stealth technology and was renowned as the “father of the stealth,” when answering the question, “what have been the important achievements and theoretical breakthroughs in the military revolution of the United States” that was posed by a visiting scholar from China, he answered without thinking, “it is naturally stealth and information technology.” Perry’s answer represented the mainstream view of American military circles-the military revolution is the revolution in military technology. From the view of those like Perry, it is only necessary to resolve the problem from the technical standpoint of allowing the soldiers in front of the mountain to know “what was in back of the mountain” and then this is equivalent to accomplishing this military revolution. Observing, considering, and resolving problems from the point of view of technology is typical American thinking. Its advantages and disadvantages are both very apparent, just like the characters of Americans. This type of idea which equates the technology revolution with the military revolution was displayed through the form of the Gulf War and had a powerful impact and effect on the militaries throughout the world. There were hardly any people who were able to maintain sufficient calm and clarity within this situation, and naturally there could also not be any people who discovered that the misunderstanding begun by the Americans is now causing a misunderstanding by the entire world of a widespread global revolution. The slogan of “building the military with high technology” is like a typhoon of the Pacific Ocean, wherein it lands in more and more countries, and even China, which is on the western coast of the Pacific, also appears to have splashed up a reverberation during the same period. It cannot be denied that the military technology revolution is the cornerstone of the military revolution, and yet it is unable to be viewed as the entirety of the military revolution, for at best it is the first step of this wild whirlwind entering the course. The highest embodiment and final completion of the military revolution is summed up in the revolution of military thought, for it cannot stay on this mundane level of the transformation of military technology and system formulation. The revolution in military thought is, in the final analysis, a revolution in fighting forms and methods. The revolution of military technology is fine, as is the reform of the formulated system, but their final results are based upon changes in fighting forms and methods. Only the completion of this change will be able to signify the maturation of the military revolution. If the revolution of military technology is called the first stage of the military revolution, then we are now in the essentially important second stage of this revolution. Approaching the completion of the revolution of military technology is to a very large degree a foreshadowing of the beginning of the new stage, which also to a very great extent presents problems in carrying out ideological work in the first stage: while the revolution of military technology has allowed one to be able to select measures within a larger range, it has also made it so that one is threatened by these measures within the same range (this is because the monopolizing of one type of technology is far more difficult than inventing a type of technology). These threats have never been like they are today because the measures are diverse and infinitely changing, and this really gives one a feeling of seeing the enemy behind every tree.",

    "text": "The national strategy for ensuring national security, or grand strategy, requires adjustments beyond military and political strategies. It considers all aspects of national interest, including political will, values, economic factors, culture, foreign relations, technology, environment, natural resources, and demographics. This creates an “extended domain” encompassing both national interests and security.  This complex landscape requires more than just military means.  Clausewitz's “blood letting politics” cannot solve a financial crisis, nor can traditional methods address cyberattacks.  National security requires a composite force across all areas of national interest, a “grand warfare method” combining military and non-military dimensions. This new form of warfare surpasses all dimensions influencing national security. This method is based on combination, increasing the means of modern warfare infinitely.  This changes the definition of modern warfare from simply using modern weapons to a broader concept.  Traditional aspirations of military victory are insufficient in this new era where the battlefield is greatly expanded. Military leaders and politicians must broaden their perspectives and adopt this grand warfare method, abandoning traditional views of war.",

    "text": "1. Senior Colonel Chen Bojiang learned from William Perry that the key breakthroughs of the American military revolution are stealth technology and information technology, the latter solving the age-old problem of battlefield visibility. 2. The 1997 World Military Affairs Yearbook highlighted major nations' emphasis on high-technology military development, citing examples like the US pursuing battlefield digitization, Japan seeking a “highly technological crack military force,” and other nations acquiring advanced weapons. 3. The military revolution is seen as a combination of new technology, military organization, and thought.  Steven Maizi and Thomas Kaiweite define it as simultaneous changes in technology, weapons systems, combat methods, and troop organization, leading to a leap in fighting efficiency. A research report similarly attributes it to multiple factors.  Toffler’s equation of military revolution with civilizational shift is considered impractical. 4.  Reference to Zhao Ying’s *The New View of National Security*. 5. Examples of diverse security threats include financial speculator George Soros, terrorist bin Laden, drug smuggler Escobar, cult leader Matsumoto, and hacker Kevin Mitnick. 6. US National Defense Reports acknowledge various threats but primarily focus on traditional military threats. A 1997 report anticipates a potential rival nation emerging after 2015, possibly Russia or China, while acknowledging “unknown factors.” 7. Australian Xiaomohan Malike identifies seven tendencies influencing 21st-century national security: globalized economy and technology, democratic tide, polarized international politics, changing international systems and security concepts, and shifting conflict focal points. These lead to both traditional (hegemony struggles, nationalism, territorial disputes, etc.) and new (declining-nation nationalism, cultural/religious conflicts, light weapons proliferation, resource disputes, refugee flows, ecological disasters, terrorism) sources of conflict, posing multiple threats to nations.",

We are in an age of revolution in operating methods, driven by technological explosions, weapon replacements, evolving security concepts, shifting strategic targets, blurred battlefield boundaries, and expanded non-military involvement. This revolution seeks a common operating method for all these changes—a new methodology to address the myriad changes of future wars.  No one has seen tomorrow's war, but predictions abound, from space warfare to deep-sea pursuits, precision bombing to cruise missiles.  A representative example is a US digitized unit exercise at Fort Irwin:  The “blue troops” utilized real-time satellite and aircraft data, precision strikes, and interconnected infantry, even calling in fire based on computer-displayed targets. Despite losing most of the exercise rounds against traditionally equipped “red troops,” Secretary of Defense Cohen declared it a “military revolution.”  This reflects the prevailing understanding of future warfare.  While victors tend to repeat past successes, the US military understands that future wars won't simply replicate the Gulf War.  This realization drives ongoing weapon replacements.",

    "text": "cleared, and they also made adjustments to the original combat theories and organizational system. Military people throughout the world saw the framework of the future American military and the concept of American style warfare from The Concept of Joint Forces in the Year 2010 to The Army of the Future. Taking into consideration the loftiness of the hall, then this is quite out of the ordinary [that is, the superiority of the American military force, like a majestic hall, is overwhelming]. It was little imagined that the blind spot in the visual field of the Americans would just appear here. To date, the trends of the development of the weaponry of the United States military, the changes in defense policies, the evolution of combat theories, the renewal of ordinances and regulations, and the views of high- level commanders are all following along quickly on one path. They affirm that military means are the final means for resolving future conflicts, and the disputes between all nations will ultimately end up with two large armies meeting on the battlefield. Given this premise, the American military is requiring itself to nearly simultaneously win wars in two battle areas, and they have done a great deal of preparation for this. The problem is who is there in the Pentagon, like the former Chief of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Bower, who so clearly recognized that the United States was focusing most of its energies in again fighting a “cold type war which would never come again” and was very possibly using its own strength in the wrong direction? This is because the international trend at the end of the 20th century is clearly displayed. As practically existing, the age of wars being a matter of moving weapons and soldiers has still not been translated into history, but as a concept it has already begun to noticeably fall behind. Following the increase in the number of international treaties limiting the arms race and the proliferation of weapons, the United Nations and regional international organizations have enlarged their intervention power in local wars and regional conflicts and relatively decreased the military threat to national security; on the contrary, the springing up of large amounts of new high technology will actually greatly increase the possibility of non-military measures threatening national security, and the international community, which is at a loss of what to do upon being confronted with non-military threats with such destruction no less than that of a war, at the least lacks necessary and effective limitations. This has objectively accelerated the occurrence of non-military wars, and at the same time it has also resulted in the old concepts and systems of national security being on the brink of collapse. Aside from the increasingly intense terrorist attacks, as well as the hacker wars, financial wars and computer virus wars which will dominate the future, there are also the present various types of “new concept wars” to which it is difficult to fix a name and are already sufficient to have the security view of “resisting the enemy outside of one’s national gate” become something of the past in the space of an evening. It is not the case that American military circles have not noticed this advantage of eliminating the enemy against military and non-military threats (we have already referred above to several National Defense Reports for several fiscal years by the Defense Department of the United States), and yet they have pushed the resolution of the latter problem on to the politicians and the Central Intelligence Agency so that they have retreated from the existing all-dimensional wars, noncombatant military operations, and other new views. They have tightened up more and more so that they have shrunk into a watching tree hung full with various types of sophisticated weapon fruits waiting alone for a muddle-headed and idiotic rabbit to come and knock into it. However, after Saddam knocked himself dizzy at the bottom of this tree, who else is there who would become the second type of this rabbit? Given their state of mind of “looking around in the dark with daggers drawn,” the American soldiers who had lost their opponent due to the collapse of the former Soviet Union are vehemently searching for a reason not to allow themselves to be “unemployed.” This is because from the generals to the common soldiers, from the spear of attack to the shield of defense, from major strategies to minor methods of operation, everything that the American military does is done in preparation of gaining victory in a major war. It should not be said that as soon as there were no longer two armies facing off against each other that American military circles and even the American Congress would produce an empty feeling at having lost their goal. The result was that without an enemy, one still had to be created. Therefore, even if it is a tiny area such as Kosovo, they cannot pass up an opportunity to tryout their frosty blades. American military circles, which are digging deeper and deeper into the insoluble problem of either using force or not using any at all, seems, after stretching their own tentacles from war regions to the realm of non-combat military actions, to no longer be willing to extend themselves to a far distance, and are now in the realm of forming non-military warfare.",

    "text": "This is possibly owing to a lack of sensitivity to new things and also possibly a result of work habit, and even more so possibly due to limitations in thinking. Regardless of the reason, the American soldier always locks his own field of vision in the range covered by war clouds, and this is an indisputable fact. Even though the United States bears the brunt of being faced with the threat of this type of non-military war and has been the injured party time after time, yet what is surprising is that such a large nation unexpectedly does not have a unified strategy and command structure to deal with the threat. What makes one even more so wonder whether to laugh or cry is that unexpectedly they have 49 departments and offices responsible for antiterrorist activities, but there is very little coordination and cooperation among them. Other nations are not that much better than the United States in this area. The allocations and basic investment directions of various nations for security needs are still only limited to the military and intelligence and political departments, but there are few and pitiful investments in other directions. Again using the United States as an example, it uses seven billion dollars in funds for antiterrorism, which is only 1/25 of the U.S. $250 billion military expenditure. Regardless of how each nation turns a deaf ear to the pressing threat of non-military warfare, this objective fact is encroaching upon the existence of mankind one step at a time, expanding and spreading based on its own pattern and speed. It is not necessary to point it out as people will discover that when mankind focuses more attention on calling for peace and limiting wars, many of the origins are the things in our peaceful lives which all begin one after another to change into lethal weapons which destroy peace. Even those golden rules and precious precepts which we have always upheld also begin to reveal a contrary tendency and become a means for some nations to be able to launch attacks against other nations or certain organizations and individuals to do so against the entire society. It is similar to [the following scenarios]: when there is a computer then there is a computer virus, and when there is currency there is monetary speculation, freedom of faith and religious extremism and heretical religions, common human rights and national sovereignty, free economics and trade protection, national autonomy and global unification, national enterprises versus transnational corporations, information liberalization and information boundaries, and the sharing of knowledge and the monopoly of technology. It is possible for each field that at any moment tomorrow there will break out a war where different groups of people are fighting at close quarters. The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odor of blood. However, it is war as before, because it accords with the definition of modern warfare: forcing the enemy to satisfy one’s own interests. It is very obvious that none of the soldiers in any one nation possesses sufficient mental preparation against this type of new war which completely goes beyond military space. However, this is actually a severe reality which all soldiers must face. The new threats require new national security views, and new security views then necessitate soldiers who first expand their fields of vision prior to expanding their victories. This is a matter of wiping away the long narrow cloud covering of war cast over one’s eyes. THE DESTRUCTION OF RULES AND THE DOMAIN OF LOSING EFFECTIVENESS As an extreme means for resolving conflicts of survival and interests, war has always been the beast truly tamed by mankind. On the one hand, it is the street cleaner of the ecological chain of society, and on the other hand, it is also the directly formed threat facing the survival of mankind. How can we order it about without being harmed by it? Over the last several thousand years, and especially in the 20th century, during the intervals between the fires of war, there has always been one matter pursued: making efforts to lock the beast in the cage.",

    "text": "It is for this reason that people have formulated innumerable treaties and rules. From the famous Geneva Convention to the United Nations and to the present, they have begun to continuously make various resolutions concerning war, erected one railing after another on the roads of crazy and bloody wars, and have wanted to utilize international laws and regulations to control the harm of war to mankind to the lowest level, from specifically not allowing the use of biochemical weapons, not allowing the indiscriminate killing of civilians, not allowing the mistreatment of prisoners, and limiting the use of land minds, etc. to the widespread opposition to the use of military force or the threat of the use of force in handling national relations issues. All of these regulations are gradually becoming accepted by each nation. The most commendable of these is a series of treaties on nuclear nonproliferation, the banning of nuclear testing, bilateral and multilateral reduction of nuclear weapons, etc., which have to date resulted in mankind avoiding entrance into a nuclear winter. At the conclusion of the Cold War, the entire world was overjoyed and considered that a “fearful peace” was being entered from this. After Schwarzkopf used a “storm” fist to down Saddam on the Gulf fighting stage, President Bush was elated with success: “The new order of the world has already withstood its first test.” He was like Chamberlain returning from Munich announcing that mankind will “get together in a world having the hope of peace.” What was the result? Like Chamberlain, he also boasted too early. Regardless of whether it is the end of the Cold War or the Gulf War, neither was able to bring about the promises of politicians to the world and the new international order anticipated by all of mankind. The collapse of the polarized world resulted in the beasts of local wars roaring out of their cages one by one, drenching the nations and regions of Rwanda, Somalia, Bohei, Chechen, Congo and Kosovo in pools of blood. People had again discovered by this time how the efforts for peace over several thousand years could collapse at one single blow! The appearance of this type of situation is related to the practical attitude embraced by each nation concerning the establishment of international rules. Whether or not each nation acknowledges the rules often depends on whether or not they are beneficial to themselves. Small nations hope to use the rules to protect their own interests, while large nations attempt to utilize the rules to control other nations. When the rules are not in accord with the interests of one’s own nation, generally speaking, the breaking of the rules by small nations can be corrected by large nations in the name of enforcers of the law. However, when large nations break the rules, for example the United States enforcing supra-national laws in Panama, wherein it grabbed the head of another nation and brought him to be tried in their own nation. Another example is India’s disregard of the nuclear test ban treaty, wherein it swallowed up the Himalayan nation of Sikkim, which was a similar action to Iraq swallowing up Kuwait. The international community time and again only sighed in despair, being at a loss of what to do. However, in any matter, there is always its unbeatable rival and natural enemy, which is aptly reflected in the Chinese popular saying: “brine forms the bean curd,” and one thing always overcomes another. In the international community, the participation by large nations, when facing the weak and powerless, in the formulation and the utilization of rules as well as the disregard and even destruction of rules when the rules are not advantageous to them, form a fresh contrast with the springing up of those non-state forces who do not acknowledge any rules and specialize in taking the existing national order as their goal of destruction. As the natural enemy of the international community, and especially large nations, while they threaten the survival of mankind, they also produce minute effects on the balance of society and the ecology. In other words, these non-state forces serve as a type of socially destructive force which both destroys the normal international order and restrains the destruction of the international community by those large nations. For example, there were the warning intrusions of nameless hackers to the web site of the National Defense Ministry of India after it carried out nuclear tests and the terrorist act by the rich Moslem Osama bin Laden because of his dissatisfaction with the presence of the United States in the Middle East. Even though it is still difficult for us now to delineate the positive and negative effects of these actions, yet it can be determined that all of these actions carry irresponsible and destructive characteristics which disregard rules. The direct result of the destruction of rules is that the domains delineated by visible or invisible boundaries which are acknowledged by the international community lose effectiveness. This is because all principals without national power who employ non-military warfare actions to declare war against the international community all use means that go beyond nations, regions and measures. Visible national boundaries, invisible Internet space, international law, national law, behavioral norms, and ethical principles have absolutely no restraining effects on them. They are not responsible to anyone, nor limited by any rules, and there is no disgrace when it comes to the selection of targets, nor are there any means which are not used. Owing to the surreptitious nature of their movements, they have very strong concealment, create widespread damage because of their extreme behavior, and appear unusually cruel as a result of their indiscriminate attacks on civilians. All of this is also broadcast through real time via continuous coverage by the modern media which very much strengthens the effects of terrorism. When carrying out war with these people, there is no declaration of war, no fixed battlefield, no face-to-face fighting and killing, and in the majority of situations, there will be no gunpowder smoke, gun fire, and spilling of blood. However, the destruction",

The popularization of personal computers, and especially the formation of the Internet, has resulted in the malicious acts of hackers increasingly endangering the existing social order. The hackers we speak of here refer to those network killers who steal information, delete and change files, release viruses, transfer capital, and destroy programs on the network.

Afterwards, this type of event began to appear one after another in the Internet connections of nations and regions. Since the United States government began to seriously attack network crimes in 1990, not only have hacker activities not witnessed any decrease, but on the contrary, they have spread globally and have the great force of a forest fire. It is worth noting that following the “Information Warfare” ordinance of the American military, which placed enemy nation armies or world opponents on a par with non-approved users, inside personnel, terrorists, non-national organizations, and foreign intelligence organizations as the six sources of network threats, hackers with national or military backgrounds had already begun to reveal clues.8 This not only greatly strengthened the battle formations of the hackers so that the actions of the disbanded and straggling hackers quickly escalated into national (network tyrant) actions, it also resulted in the increasing enlargement of the Internet threat faced by all nations (including those nations with national or military hackers), and is becoming increasingly difficult to predict and guard against. The only thing which could be predicted was that the damage of this type of threat to the large network nation of the United States would certainly be greater than for other nations. Faced with these prospects, even J. Saiteerdou [as printed 1049 3676 14226757], who is responsible for the investigation of computer crimes in the FBI of the United States, said with both self-confidence and worry: “Give me ten carefully chosen hackers, and within 90 days I would then be able to have this nation lay down its arms and surrender.”",

    "text": "When compared with “network bandits“—these network terrorist hackers-the terror of the bombs of bin Laden are closer to the traditional terrorism in legacy. However, this does not prevent us from considering him to be within the ranks of new terrorism. This is because aside from the religious or even heterodox teaching background and tendency to oppose control by large nations, from the person of bin Laden himself, we can see the shadows of those old fighters who make loud and empty boasts, are so fond of the limelight, and make use of light weapons and a single method, but in other areas they cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Prior to the major bombings at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam which shocked the world, the name of bin Laden was still not listed in the name list of the 30 terrorist organizations published by the International antiterrorist Organization, and even though earlier he already had many murder cases attributed to him, he was only a “nameless hero” in the Islamic world, owing to his having not boasted of them. Even after the Americans had already launched cruise missiles at him and issued an arrest warrant, he still repeatedly denied that he was personally connected with the bombing cases. “Concealing oneself and shielding,” having weightier results, and unexpectedly gaining an undeserved reputation are perhaps the first major characteristics of the new bin Laden-type terrorist organizations. In addition, having learned how to use economic means and taking advantage of the loopholes in the free economics initiated by the West, they set up management-type companies and banks and engage in large-scale drug trafficking and smuggling, the resale of munitions, the printing of large amounts of forged currency, and rely on the contributions of religious followers to attain stable capital resources.9 On this basis, the tentacles of these new terrorist organizations extend to even wider areas, and the means are also diversified, such as widely using religious and heretical organizations to develop their own media for propaganda, setting up antigovernment militia organizations, etc. The easy accomplishment of raising funds guarantees that they will be able to attain and master large amounts of high technology means so that they will be able to kill even more people with great ease. Even though the vast majority of the attacks they have launched to date have been aimed at the rich nations and Western nations, especially the large nations which have the capability to control other nations, yet they are a common threat to the existing order, the destruction of commonly acknowledged rules, and to the international community.",

Although there is still no one at present listing these immaculately dressed and dapper fellows in the ranks of terrorists, yet in terms of their actions and the calamitous consequences they have caused in England, Mexico and Southeast Asia, none of those types, such as the “bandits” and bin Laden, can even hold a candle to them. Taking the big financial crocodiles as represented by Soros, on the strength of a daily business volume exceeding US $120 billion in floating capital, he used financial derivative methods as well as free economic regulations to repeatedly change his attitude and play tricks to foment trouble, so as to bring about one financial upheaval after another. As a result, the area of harmed nations gradually enlarged from Southeast Asia to Russia and then to Japan, and finally to Europe and the United States, which were watching from the sidelines and were also unable to escape by sheer luck, so that the existing world financial system and economic order were fundamentally shaken and it had already become another new disaster threatening human society and international security.10 The typical characteristics of terrorism, including being transnational, concealed, without rules, and tremendously destructive, have given us reason to call it financial terrorism.",

    "text": "Before the tremendous state apparatus, terrorists and their organizations are perhaps not worth mentioning in terms of numbers of peoples and methods, but in fact there is not one country which dares to look at them lightly. The reason is that this is a group of maniacs which does not act according to the rules. A terrorist organization which possesses nuclear weapons is definitely much more dangerous than a nation with the same nuclear weapons. The creed of bin Laden is “If I die, then I will also not let others live,” and therefore, he would then stop at nothing, so that in order to kill over ten Americans he would also drench several thousand innocent people in a pool of blood. Soros’s logic is “I entered the room to steal money because your door was not locked.” In this way, he does not have to be responsible for destroying the economies of other nations and throwing the political order of others into disarray. For bin Laden who hides under the hills of Islamic fundamentalism, Soros who conceals himself within the forests of free economics, and the computer hackers who hide themselves in the green curtains of networks, no national boundaries exist, and borders also are ineffective. What they want to do is carry out wanton destruction within a regulated sphere and act wildly and run amuck within an unregulated sphere. These new terrorist forces have formed an unprecedented serious challenge to the existing world order, and in turn they have made us doubt to a certain degree the logical production of a fixed order. Perhaps those who check the destruction of rules and those who revise the rules are both necessary. This is because any destruction of rules always brings on new problems which need to be rigorously dealt with. In an age when an old order is about to be removed, those in the lead are frequently those who are the first to destroy the rules or those who are the earliest to adapt to this situation. Naturally, in this respect, the new terrorists have already walked to the head of the international community. The most ideal method of operation for dealing with an enemy who pays no regard to the rules is certainly just being able to break through the rules. Recently, in coming to grips with enemies which appear and disappear in the domain of non-military warfare, the Americans have utilized cruise missiles, the Hong Kong government has used foreign currency reserves and administrative measures, and the British government has broken conventions so as to allow their secret service organizations to “legally” assassinate the leaders of foreign nations who they consider to be terrorists. This reveals an updating of the rules and a changing of the methods of operation. However, it also reveals the weaknesses of dullness in thinking and singleness in method. It is said that the Americans have already decided to employ hacking methods to search for and seal up the bank accounts of bin Laden in various nations, so as to basically cut off his source of capital. This is no doubt a breakthrough in method of operation which goes beyond the military domain. However, we must also say that in is area, the new and old terrorists who consistently uphold the principle resorting to every conceivable means are still the best teachers of each nation’s government.",

    "section": "Cocktail in the Great Master's Cup",
    "text": "COCKTAIL IN THE GREAT MASTER’S CUP King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty three thousand years ago and Alexander the Great over two thousand years ago definitely would not have known what a cocktail was, and yet they were both masters of mixing “cocktails” on the battlefield. This is because, like mixing a cocktail, they were adept at ingeniously combining two or more battlefield factors together, throwing them into battle, and gaining victories. 1+1 is the most elementary and also the most ancient combination method. Long spears and round shields can prepare a soldier for both attack and defense and give a basis for advancing and retreating; two people comprise a unit, wherein “soldiers with long weapons are used for defense and those with short weapons are used for holding positions,” a pair of soldiers coordinate with each other, and then form the smallest tactical unit.11 The knight Don Quixote and his attendant Sancho signify that the separation of work of the general and the light soldier had already been formed, and thus the team could set off on a long journey to dispel evil for the imaginary princess. Such a simple combination embodies the profound theory of infinite changes on the battlefield. From cold weapons to hot weapons and then on to nuclear weapons and up to the combination of the so- called high technology weapons of today, the musical instrument in the victorious magical hand has always accompanied the entire history of warfare secretly influencing the outcome of each war. King Wu attacked Zhuo with 300 military vehicles, 3,000 brave warriors, and 45,000 armored soldiers, which was far less than the several hundred thousand foot soldiers of King Zhuo of the Shang Dynasty. However, this small army composed of both vehicles and soldiers became the cornerstone of the Zhou kingdom, because the proper combination greatly strengthened the combat strength in the wilderness war and became the evidence of the earliest combination war which we were able to find 3,120 years later. Given that this was the case in the East, the West was no exception. The reason why Alexander was able to defeat a large army during one decisive battle at Abeila was because he made adaptations just before going into battle, wherein a linear pushing square matrix changed so that the opponent was taken by surprise. His method was very simple. The position of the cavalry shifted back and obliquely along the two flanks of the square matrix forming a “hollow large square matrix,” so that the flexibility of the cavalry and the stability of the foot soldiers achieved the ideal combination in a unique battle array wherein each developed their individual strengths most incisively. The result was naturally that Alexander, whose military force was at a comparative disadvantage, ultimately drank heartily the cup of victory.12 When perusing the military history of both East and West, we never find the expression “combination” in any of the descriptions related to methods of operation. However, all of the great masters of warfare throughout the ages seem to have instinctively known this principle well. The King of Sweden Gustav was the most highly praised military reformer at the beginning of the firearms period. All of the reforms that he carried out in terms of battle array and weapons deployment used the combination method. He very early realized that the falling behind of the lancers and arranging them together in battle array with the firearm soldiers allowed the former to be able to provide cover for the later between shootings. This developed the strengths of each to the greatest limits. He also often had mixed groupings of light cavalry, heavy cavalry and firearm soldiers who took turns initiating charges against the enemy’s skirmish line under the heavy smoke of artillery fire. This king was later called the “first great field artillery expert,” and he understood even better the functions and effects of artillery as the basis for engaging in battles. He took the light artillery as a combination of “regimental artillery” and infantry allowing the heavy artillery to independently form an army, and the seemingly separately deployed light and heavy artillery actually formed a perfectly integrated combination within the entire range of the battlefield. It can truly be said that the effects of the artillery were developed to the ultimate during that period.13 However, all of this occurred prior to the appearance of the expert of artillery technique, Napoleon. When compared with the short Corsican who pushed over 20,000 cannons on to the battlefield, the guns in the hands of Gustav can only be seen as “a small sorcerer in the presence of a great one.” During the period from 1793 to 1814, a total of 20 years, no one understood cannons as completely as did Napoleon. No one was able to understand those under his command more precisely than this commander, and naturally there was no one who could fully combine the lethal",

This machine was used from Austerlitz to Borodino to formulate the myth that Napoleon won nearly every battle.14 General Schwarzkopf, who created the miracle of a major battle in which only over one hundred soldiers were lost cannot be considered to be on the great master level. However, his luck appears to have been as good as all of the masters of military techniques. Actually, what was really important was not luck, but rather that this commander led a large modern army which, like his predecessors, even more so gave importance to the combination of the important elements of warfare. This is because during the 1990s the cards which he held in his hand were many more than those held by his predecessors. For him, the key to driving the Iraqi army out of Kuwait, restoring the lifeline of oil to the West, and regenerating America’s influence in the Middle East, depended on how to ingenuously use the alliance, manipulate the media, use economic blockades, and other methods, along with developing and bringing together various armed services of the army, navy, air force, space, electronics, etc., comprised by the militaries of over 30 nations, and thus jointly becoming an iron fist to pound Saddam. He accomplished this and yet his opponent quite shockingly was not at all aware of this. A great army of several hundred thousand, several thousand tanks, and several hundred aircraft were like unmixed cement, sand and reinforcing steel dispersed on the battle line, penetrating several hundred kilometers and being basically unable to bear the bitter attacks of the American-style “fists” [as printed “loaquan” 5071 2164], which fully combined the rear solid structural components to become as hard as reinforced concrete. In addition, there was first detainment and then release of Western hostages, followed by one mistake after another, and there was poor response in the areas of breaking political isolation and economic blockades.",

    "text": "Regardless of whether the war was 3,000 years ago or at the end of the 20th century, it seems that all of the victories display one common phenomenon: the winner is the one who combined well. While being able to ever increase the means used for warfare, as well as make continuous improvements today so that the denotation of warfare is quickly being amplified, the connotation of this has also begun to deepen. More factors which had never appeared in the warfare of the past have entered the world of warfare through the combination of various different methods. The addition of each new element possibly causes changes in the modality and type of warfare up until the outbreak of military revolution. Looking back upon the history of warfare, regardless of whether it is stirrups, rifles, breechloaders, smokeless gunpowder, field telephones, wireless telegrams, submarines, tanks, aircraft, missiles, atomic bombs, computers, non-lethal weapons, or division troop system, staff systems, “wolfpack tactics,”15 blitz, carpet bombing, electronic countermeasures, and air-land battles, the appearance of all of these elements all combine with earlier key battlefield elements to display hybrid advantages and enrich the present world of warfare to different degrees. Over the last 20 years, information technology, computer viruses, Internet, financial derivation tools, and other sources, as well as the technology of non-military means even more so reveal the difficulties of predicting the prospect for the outcome of tomorrow’s wars. However, to date, for the vast majority of soldiers or high-ranking military officers utilizing the element combination method to carry out warfare is often a non- conscious action. Therefore, their combinations often remain on the level of weapons, deployment methods and the battlefield, and the drawn-up war prospects are also mostly only limited to the military domain and revel in it. Only those trailblazing military geniuses are able to stand alone in breaking convention, breaking through limitations and consciously combining all of the means available at the time to play the ageless masterpiece by changing the tonality of the war. If it is said that combination was only a winning secret formula of a few geniuses, then consciously making combination the trend of a method of operations now is already becoming clearer day after day, and warfare is now being taken into an even broader and even more far-reaching domain; however, all of that provided by the age of technological integration leaves combination with more seemingly infinite possible space. It can be affirmed that whoever is able to mix a tasty and unique cocktail for the future banquet of war will ultimately be able to wear the laurels of success on his own head.",

To a very great extent, war is no longer even war but rather coming to grips on the Internet, and matching the mass media, assault and defense in forward exchange transactions, along with other things which we had never viewed as war, now all possibly causing us to drop our eyeglasses. That is to say, the enemy will possibly not be the originally significant enemy, the weapons will possibly not be the original weapons, and the battlefield will also possibly not be the original battlefield. Nothing is definite. What can be ascertained is not definite. The game has already changed, and what we need to continue is ascertaining a new type of fighting method within various uncertainties. It should not be that type of single prescription for treating the symptoms and not the disease, but rather a hybrid type of learning widely from the strong points of others and gathering advantages so as to allow a pear tree to bear both peaches and apples. This then is combination. We had actually shown this card already above. What we have still not spoken of is another term: addition. Addition is the method of combination. In a boxing arena, a person who from start to finish uses only one type of boxing method to fight with an opponent is naturally not one who can combine straight punches, jabs, swings and hooks to attack his opponent like a storm. The principle of this can be said to be extremely simple: one plus one is greater than one. The problem is that such a simple principle which even a preschooler can understand has been surprisingly unclear to many persons responsible for the success and failure of the security and warfare of nations. These people can excuse themselves saying they are using the method of combination boxing to attack opponents. They have never forgotten the addition of technology with technology, tactics with tactics, weapons with weapons, and measures with measures. Moreover, they can also contemptuously come to conclusions and combinations which cannot be considered to be anything new. This has been done from Alexander to Napoleon and even up to Schwarzkopf. They do not know that their ability to understand or not understand combinations is not the key to the problem. What is truly important is whether or not one understands what goes with what to implement combinations and how to combine. Lastly, but certainly not the least important point, is whether or not one has thought of combining the battlefield and non-battlefield, warfare and non-warfare, military and non- military which is more specifically combining stealth aircraft and cruise missiles with network killers, combining nuclear deterrence, financial wars and terrorist attacks, or simply combining Schwarzkopf + Soros + Xiaomolisi [transliteration 1420 5459 6849 2448] + bin Laden.

There is finally the forceful bearing down by the army, and military means are utilized in gradual stages until the enemy is forced to sign a dishonorable peace treaty. This admittedly does not attain to the domain spoken of by Sun Zi, wherein “the other army is subdued without fighting.” However, it can be considered to be “subduing the other army through clever operations.” It is very clear who was superior and who inferior when comparing these two methods of operation.\n\nThis is, however, only a thought. However, it is certainly a feasible thought. Based on this thought, we need only shake the kaleidoscope of addition to be able to combine into an inexhaustible variety of methods of operation. Military Trans-military Non-military • Atomic warfare • Diplomatic warfare • Financial warfare • Conventional warfare • Network warfare • Trade warfare • Biochemical warfare • Intelligence warfare • Resources warfare • Ecological warfare • Psychological warfare • Economic aid warfare • Space warfare • Tactical warfare • Regulatory warfare • Electronic warfare • Smuggling warfare • Sanction warfare • Guerrilla warfare • Drug warfare • Media warfare • Terrorist warfare • Virtual warfare (deterrence) • Ideological warfare\n\nAny of the above types of methods of operation can be combined with another of the above methods of operation to form a completely new method of operation. Regardless of whether it is intentional or unintentional, the carrying out of combined methods of operation using different methods of operation that go beyond domains and categories has already been applied by many nations in the practice of warfare. For example, the countermeasure used by the Americans against bin Laden is national terrorist warfare + intelligence warfare + financial warfare + network warfare + regulatory warfare; another example is what the NATO nations used to deal with the Southern Alliance Kosovo crisis: deterrence with the use of force + diplomatic warfare (alliance) + regulatory warfare; prior to this, the United Nations under pressure mainly from the United States adopted the methods of operation against Iraq: conventional warfare + diplomatic warfare + sanction warfare + media warfare + psychological warfare + intelligence warfare, etc. We also noticed that the means adopted by the Hong Kong government during the financial security warfare in August of 1998 to deal with financial speculators were: financial warfare + regulatory warfare + psychological warfare + media warfare, and even though they paid a heavy price, yet the results of the war were very good. In addition, the methods for matters, such as the large quantity printing of counterfeit Renminbi in Taiwan, very easily became a warfare measure of financial warfare + smuggling warfare. We can see from these examples the miraculous effects of applying addition- combination in methods of operation. If it is said that, owing to the limitations of technical measures and conditions, those engaged in warfare in the past were still unable to freely combine all factors for winning wars, then today the great explosion of technology led by information technology has already provided us with this type of possibility. Only if we are willing and do not allow subjective intentions to depart from objective laws, will we then be able to arrange the cards in our hand into various types of hands based on need until finally winning the entire game.",

It is not the same as any of the very strongly directed methods of operation of the past, for only when the basket is filled with specific targets and contents does it begin to have directionality and aim. The key to whether or not victory is won in a war is nowhere else but in what things you are able to pack into this basket.\n\nYue Fei, the military strategist during the Song Dynasty in China, stated when discussing how to employ methods of operation that “the subtle excellence of application lies in one- mindedness.” Although this statement sounds very abstruse, yet it is actually the only accurate explanation of the correct application of combination. Only if we understand this point will we then be able to attain a method of operation which goes beyond the multitude of methods of operation. This is then having the myriad methods converge into one. It is even the final stage of methods of operation. Aside from combining the transcendence of being unfettered, you have no way of imagining what other method of operation can transcend the net of combination. The conclusion is thus so simple, and yet it will definitely not arise from a simple brain.",

    "text": "HOWEVER MUCH IS SAID about combination, we still have to say that it is not enough to focus on combination. It is necessary to further sharpen the focus, to see whether there is any secret closer to the core. Without understanding the secret of how to conduct combination, it will be useless to conduct combination 100 times incompetently. In the history of war, there has never been a victory achieved in a smooth manner. Thus, in all its versions, the book Jun Yu [Military Talk] contains such terms as direction of main attack, main targets of striking, feint attack, feint move, and outflank which entail distinguishing between the main and secondary actions. What is behind such terms is not only consideration of the need to deceive the enemy or the sound use of force. There must be some other reasons. In terms of instinct, all those famous generals who have won countless victories, or obscure people, have all realized the existence of something which perhaps should be called “rules of victory.” Those people have also got close to such rules tens of thousands of times. Nevertheless, to this day, no commander or philosopher has ever dared to say: I have found the rules. Not even the job of naming such rules has been completed. But, actually, the rules are hidden in the waves of military practice of mankind. It is proper to say that every classical victory has testified to the rules. However, each time, people either do not want to admit or do not dare to affirm their encounters with rules of victory, but, instead, often attribute the effects of the rules to the favor of some mysterious fate. Many “belated pronouncement” works on military history offer arguments which are difficult for people to grasp because the arguments describe the rules’ effects in an excessively mysterious manner. But rules of victory do exist. They are there. Like an invisible man, they accompany every war of mankind. The party to which their golden fingers point will go through the arch of triumph by stepping on the sorrow of the vanquished. However, even the victors in war have not truly seen their real faces.",

    "section": "The Golden Section in War",
    "text": "Sage Pythagoras unexpectedly encountered a set of mysterious digits: 0.618. As a result, he found the rule of the golden section!  In the 2,500 years since then, this formula has been considered by formative artists as the golden rule of aesthetics. Almost all artistic works considered masterpieces have been close to or in accord with this formula in their basic aesthetic features. People had long marveled at the beauty of the Parthenon Temple of ancient Greece. With measurement and calculation, it was found that the relationship between its vertical lines and horizontal lines were entirely in accord with the 1:0.618 ratio.  Le Corbusier also established his theory of “basic design scale” on the basis of the rule of the golden section. Regrettably, this formula has never moved beyond the realm of artistic creation. It was not until 1953 that J. Kieffer, an American, discovered that seeking experiment points according to the rule of the golden section would make it possible to reach the optimal state the most quickly. His discovery was refined by Hua Luogeng into the “optimum seeking method,” or the 0.618 method. In fact, before this, people had repeatedly applied it to their own spheres of practice on the basis of their instincts, including the military sphere.  We can easily see examples of conforming to this rule everywhere in the military realm, ranging from the arc of the cavalry sword to the apex of the flying trajectory of a ballistic missile and from the optimum bomb-release altitude for an aircraft to the relationship between the length of the supply line and the turning point in a war. In the Yanlin battle, Duke Li of Jin used a portion of his middle army to attack the left army of the Chu force, used another portion to attack the middle army of the Chu force, and used the upper army, lower army, new army, and forces of the lords to attack the right army of the Chu force. The point of attack selected was exactly at the point of the golden section. In the Battle of Arbela, the Macedonians selected the juncture of the left flank and the center of the Persian force as the point of their attack; marvelously, the point was exactly the “golden point” for the entire front.",

    "text": "For hundreds of years, people have found it difficult to understand why the Mongol cavalry of Gengis Khan were able to sweep across the Eurasian continent.  The rule of the golden section showed its miraculous power again: The battle formation of the Mongol cavalry was different from the Western traditional phalanx. In regard to their five-row formation, the ratio of heavy cavalry to light cavalry was 2:3, with 2 for armored heavy cavalry and 3 for fast and mobile light cavalry, that is, another example of the golden section!  It was natural for a force under the command of such a commander to have more striking power than the European forces that it confronted. Christian Europeans were late in coming to understand the application of this rule to other spheres. The Dutch general Maurice, who had been the first to transform the traditional phalanx by mixing similar numbers of musket-armed soldiers and pike-armed soldiers, failed to realize this point. It was King Gustavus of Sweden who adjusted this formation, thereby turning the Swedish army into an army with the strongest combat power in Europe of that time.  He had an additional 96 musket-armed soldiers in addition to the squadron composed of 216 pike-armed soldiers and 198 musket-armed soldiers. This change gave prominence to the use of firearms. We again saw the shining light of the rule of the golden section in the ratio of 198 plus 96 musket-armed soldiers to 216 pike-armed soldiers.",

A month later, the French forces withdrew from Moscow as it snowed heavily. There were three months of victorious advance and two months of declining. It seems that, in terms of the time sequence, the French emperor was standing on the line of the golden section when looking down at the city of Moscow through the burning fire. In another June 130 years later, Nazi Germany started the Barbarossa Plan against the Soviet Union. For as long as two years, German forces maintained their offensive momentum. It was in August 1943 that German forces turned into defense at the conclusion of the Castle action. The battle of Stalingrad, the turning point in the Soviet Patriotic War, happened exactly in the 17th month of the war, November 1942. This was the “golden point” in the time axis encompassing 26 months during which the German forces turned from booming to declining.  In the Gulf War, before the war, military experts estimated that the Republican Guard would lose combat effectiveness when losses reached 30 percent.  When the Desert Sword was taken out of its shield, Iraqi forces had lost 38 percent of their tanks, 32 percent of their armored vehicles, and 47 percent their artillery pieces.  The Desert Storm ground war ended 100 hours later.  Such instances scattered across history demonstrate a rule.",

    "section": "Victor's Grammar: The Side-Principal Rule",
    "text": "In Chinese grammar, there is a basic sentence structure: the side-principal structure.  This structure divides a sentence into two parts: the modifier and the center word. The modifier determines the tendency and features of the center word.  Relative to the center word, the modifier should be considered the center of a sentence or phrase. For instance, 'red apple'. Before being modified by 'red,' 'apple' only refers to a kind of fruit in general.  But 'red' gives this apple specificity.  In the side-principal structure, the 'side' element qualitatively determines the sentence.  The center word is the principal entity, with the modifier serving as the directing element.  The 'principal' element is the body, while the 'side' element is the soul.  The principal entity is subordinate to the directing element.  This side-principal relationship exists extensively beyond language.  The side-principal relationship exists in the movement and development of many things, and the 'side' element often plays the role as the directing element.  For instance, in a country, the people are the principal entity, while government is the directing element; in an armed force, soldiers and middle- and lower-level officers constitute the principal entity, while the command headquarters constitute the directing element; in a nuclear explosion, uranium or plutonium is the principal entity, while the means of bombarding them constitute the directing element; in a financial crisis, the victim countries are the principal entities, while financial speculators are the directing element. Without direction, the principal entity lacks coherence or purpose.",

In the Changshao battle, the Lu army waited for the Qi army's momentum to wane before counterattacking, aligning with the golden ratio. Hannibal's tactics at Cannae similarly exploited the weakening Roman attack.  The German blitzkrieg during WWII, emphasizing tanks and targeting the Ardennes, showcased a side-element focus that revolutionized military thinking.

Increasingly, nations utilize non-military means alongside or instead of military ones, showcasing the side element's influence on the principal element (warfare).  This highlights the growing importance of the side-principal structure in future conflicts, where avoiding direct confrontation is crucial. This principle advocates for targeting the 'side' to achieve victory, emphasizing adaptability and avoiding brute force.",

The 'whole' represents the principal element, while the 'dominant element' acts as the directing side element.  Purpose dictates the dominant-subordinate relationship.  For instance, in bullfighting, horns (side) are subordinate to the bulls (principal), while in sword fighting, the edges (side) are subordinate to the swords (principal).  Changing the objective shifts the dominant element, creating a new side-principal relationship. Understanding this interplay is key to grasping the essence of these rules.  This understanding helps define key relationships in war: dominant weapons vs. all weapons, dominant means (like cyber warfare or economic pressure) vs. all means, dominant services vs. all services, dominant strategies vs. all strategies, and the dominant battlefield vs. all battlefields.",

    "text": "The dominant force and all the forces; the dominant direction and all the directions; and the dominant sphere and all the spheres. The relationship between the five dominant elements and all the elements in the five areas basically represent the side-principal relationship which exists in wars in a widespread manner. Take again the example of the Gulf War. In Operation Desert Storm, the dominant weapons used by the Allied Forces were stealth aircraft, cruise missiles, and precision bombs, with all other weapons playing a subordinate role. The dominant means was the 38 consecutive days of aerial bombardment, with other means playing a supplemental role. The dominant direction was to hit the Republican Guard as the target of focused attacks, with all other battlefield targets serving as secondary targets. The dominant sphere was the military sphere, with all other spheres providing comprehensive support in the forms of economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and media offensives. However, it is not our goal to just clarify such relationships. To people engaged in war, what is the most important is not to clarify things but to grasp and apply such relationships. As we know, all countries’ war resources are limited. Even such a powerful country as the United States still has to continually think about cost-effectiveness (the principal of the “least consumption of energy“) and how to fight wars in a more marvelous way and to produce more splendid war results. Therefore, it is very necessary for any country to use and allocate war resources in a sound and strategic manner. This will require finding a correct method, that is, the issue of how to consciously apply the side-principled rule. In fact, many countries have already subconsciously applied this rule before now. After the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, Russia’s military capability has declined continually. It has not only lost its superpower position of confronting the U.S. forces, but has even found it difficult to maintain national security now. Under such circumstances, the Russian high command has adjusted its future strategy in a timely fashion, despite being in a difficult position, making tactical, or even strategic, nuclear weapons the dominant weapons of first choice if a war is launched against Russia. On the basis of this decision, it has also adjusted the distribution of conventional weapons and nuclear weapons in an overall way. Contrary to Russia being the only superpower in the world, the U.S. Armed Forces have established as their new strategic objectives for the three services a “comprehensively superior” (army), a (navy) “moving from sea to land,” and a “globally engaged” (air force).” On that basis, digitized equipment, new types of amphibious attack vessels, and long-range stealth aircraft have been selected as a new generation of weapons, which appear to be replacing contemporary trump cards like tanks of the M-1 series, aircraft carriers, and F-16 fighters as the dominant weapons in the U.S. arsenal. As can be seen in the strategic adjustments made by Russia and the United States in regard to their respective dominant weapons, it seems that the practice of selecting the dominant weapons on the basis of the magnitude of destructive power is obsolete.",

    "text": "As far as the selection of the dominant weapons is concerned, the destructive power of weapons is but one of many items of technical performance of weapons. What is more important than technical performance is the basic consideration of the war aim, operational objectives, and security environment. Thus, the dominant weapons should be the most effective weapons for accomplishing the above mentioned goals. Furthermore, it is necessary to have them organically combined with other weapons, so as to formulate the dominant element of a complete arms system. Under conditions of modern technology, dominant weapons are no longer individual weapons, but “systems of weapons,” which are also components of larger systems. The emergence of a lot of high and new technology and the continual adjustment of war aims have provided enough space for the selection of dominant weapons and the combination of dominant weapons with other weapons, and have, at the same time, also made the dominant-subordinate relationship between dominant weapons and the other weapons even more complicated. The same factors are also affecting the use of the means of war. It is becoming obsolete to automatically consider military action the dominant means and the other means supporting means in war. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, the military means will be only one of all the available means in wars such as one of fighting terrorist organizations of the bin Laden category. A more effective means that can strike at bin Laden in a destructive way is perhaps not the cruise missile, but a financial suffocation war carried out on the Internet. As means have become more complicated, there has emerged a consequence that is unexpected to all soldiers: the civilianization of war. Therefore, here the issue of the relationship between the dominant force and all forces under discussion here also encompasses the issue of degree of participation of the entire population in war, in addition to the deployment, allocation, and use of military forces in combat operations. As professional soldiers’ war or quasi-war activities have increasingly become an important factor affecting national security, the issue as to which constitute the dominant force in future wars, an issue which has never been a question, has become a question worldwide. For example, the incidents of attacks conducted by “web rascals” on the network centers of the U.S. Defense Department and the Indian Defense Ministry were evidence in this regard. Whether an action is a pure war action, a non-war military action, or a nonmilitary war action, any action of a combat nature will entail an issue of how to accurately select the main direction of operation and the main point of attack, that is, to determine your main orientation in view of all the factors of the war concerned, the battlefields, and the battle fronts. This is the most difficult issue even for all those commanders who are in control of good weapons, a multitude of means, and sufficient manpower. However, Alexander, Hannibal, Nelson, and Nimitz as well as Sun Wu and Sun Bin of ancient China were good at selecting main directions of attack which would surprise enemy forces completely. Liddell Hart also noted this point. He referred to the approach of selecting the line of least resistance and the direction of action least expected by the enemy as the “indirect strategy.”",

Future wars will demand more than battlefield ingenuity; they will be fought and won beyond the traditional battlefield. This requires a complete rethink of military strategy, going beyond the limitations of traditional military thinking.  Modern military figures, even those seemingly contemporary, are not truly \"modern\" in this sense. A chasm has appeared between traditional and modern soldiers, demanding a leap in military thought.

This includes the boundaries between battlefield and non-battlefield, weapon and non-weapon, combatant and non-combatant, state and non-state. It involves breaking free from ideological constraints and selecting the most appropriate means, including extreme measures when necessary. In a technologically integrated era, there are abundant resources available to break through limitations, requiring a more thorough approach to transcending traditional ways of thinking. Modern warfare demands combining all available resources, both material and non-material, and employing them according to the rules of victory. This requires a skilled hand, a concept of “going beyond limits,” surpassing boundaries while conforming to the laws of victory. This leads to a new method of warfare: “modified combined war that goes beyond limits.”",

The nation-state is no longer the sole focus of security; modern countries are increasingly influenced by regional and global organizations, multinational corporations, NGOs, and other non-state actors. This signals a shift from great power politics to supra-national politics. While big powers still play a dominant role, far-sighted nations are leveraging supra-national entities to expand their influence.

Saddam Hussein’s attempt at territorial occupation proved outdated and ineffective.  The United States, in contrast, has historically pursued its interests through supra-national means, gathering allies and avoiding isolated action. In the Gulf War, the US utilized a typical supra-national combination, collaborating with other nations, maneuvering political groups, and securing UN support for intervention and subsequent sanctions against Iraq. This demonstrates the growing trend of supra-national combinations in warfare and conflict resolution. This trend is further fueled by global economic integration, internationalized domestic politics, networked information, rapid technological advancements, concealed cultural conflicts, and the strengthening of non-state organizations.  These factors drive nations, both large and small, to adopt supra-national combinations for problem-solving. Consequently, threats to modern nations often originate from supra-national powers rather than individual countries, making supra-national combinations a crucial countermeasure.",

    "section": "Means and Supra-Means Combinations",
    "text": "A means at one level serves a higher objective, while at the same time being the objective for the means at the next lower level.  The complexity of what a means is still remains. We can examine any object from any angle or level and understand what a means is.  From the perspective of domains, the military, politics, diplomacy, economics, culture, religion, psychology, and the media can often be seen as means.  Domains can be subdivided. For example, in the military domain, strategy and tactics, military deterrence, military alliances, military exercises, arms control, weapons embargoes, armed blockades, right down to the use of force, these are all military means. Economic assistance, trade sanctions, diplomatic mediation, cultural infiltration, media propaganda, formulating and applying international rules, using United Nations resolutions, etc., belong to different domains such as politics, economics, or diplomacy, but are increasingly used as standard military means by statesmen.\n\nFrom the perspective of methods, philosophical methods, technical methods, mathematical methods, scientific methods, and artistic methods can all be used as means in war.  Technology, for instance, with the development of information technology, materials technology, space technology, bioengineering technology, and other new technologies, expands the array of means.  Mathematics influences military terminology: disposition of forces, base figures of ammunition, calculation of trajectories, probabilities of deaths and woundings, combat radii, and explosive yields. Philosophical, scientific, and artistic methods support military wisdom and action, hence the terms military philosophy, military science, and military art.\n\nLiddell Hart defined strategy as “the art of using military means to achieve political objectives.”  The concept of means is broad and multi-layered.  Only by expanding our understanding of means, and grasping the principle that there is nothing which cannot be considered a means, can we avoid being overwhelmed when employing them.\n\nDuring the 1978 Iran hostage crisis, the United States initially considered rash military action. After these failed, it shifted tactics, freezing Iranian assets, imposing an arms embargo, supporting Iraq in its war with Iran, and adding diplomatic negotiations. The crisis ended when all these channels were used together. In a complex world, the form and application of means are constantly changing, and a single means, however effective, is less advantageous than several means used in combination. Supra-means combinations are becoming extremely necessary, yet few countries are aware of this. Non-state organizations, however, are actively pursuing the combined use of means. For example, the Russian Mafia combines assassination, kidnapping, and hacker attacks; terrorist organizations combine bombs, hostage-taking, and network raids; and speculators combine currency, stock, and futures market manipulation with public opinion manipulation to wage financial wars.\n\nThese combined means, while often violent, are not inherently military.  Their combined use offers insights into effective military and non-military means in war. The effectiveness of a means is not determined by its category or moral standing, but by whether it is the best way to achieve the objective.  Supra-means combinations surpass not other means, but the moral standards or normal principles intrinsic to the means themselves.  This is more difficult and complex than simply combining means. We can only achieve true freedom in choosing means—the beyond-limits realm—if we complete our understanding of the beyond-limits concept. We need to find the optimum way to combine different means and create new means to achieve objectives.\n\nIn this era of economic integration, a powerful country attacking another’s economy and defenses cannot rely solely on economic blockades, trade sanctions, military threats, or arms embargoes.  It must adjust its financial strategy, using currency revaluation or devaluation, combined with manipulating public opinion and changing rules to create financial turbulence and economic crisis in the targeted country, weakening its overall power, including its military strength. The Southeast Asian financial crisis, while not intentionally caused by a major power manipulating currency, demonstrates this possibility. Even a quasi-world power like China can jolt the world economy by changing its economic policies. If China had devalued the Renminbi in 1998, it would have worsened the Asian economies and caused a cataclysm in global capital markets, harming even the United States. Such an outcome would be more effective than a military strike.  Information exchange and intertwined interests are broadening the meaning of warfare. Any decisive country has various capabilities to threaten others beyond military means.  The use of single means is becoming less effective, while the advantages of combined means are becoming more evident. This opens the door for supra-means combinations in warfare and quasi-war actions.",

    "text": "When a war becomes history, its course emerges gradually, from small-scale local fights to interconnected campaigns and potentially spreading to intercontinental or global war.  Each level is marked by casualties, victories, defeats, and strategies.  The entire process is an accumulation of outcomes.  We aim to evade the rule of gradual escalation by finding a way to continuously create the decisive moment, rather than waiting for it through accumulation, and establishing this as a strategy.\n\nOur goal is to break down the stages of war and reassemble them at will.  For example, combining a tactical action directly with a strategic action or an action at the level of wars.  We envision warfare like a dragon with interchangeable limbs, torso, and head, freely assembled and maneuverable. This is the method of \"supra-tier combinations.\"\n\nA level is a restriction, similar to national boundaries or limitations on means, which must be surpassed in supra-combination warfare. Herman Kahn's stages of nuclear war, while applicable to other forms of warfare, are too finely delineated and focus on intensity rather than the essential nature of war's levels. We propose dividing the levels of war based on scale and corresponding methods, simplifying to four levels:\n\n*   **Grand War-War Policy:** Supra-national to national level military and non-military actions. The corresponding function is \"war policy\" or \"grand strategy,\" focusing on political stratagems for warfare.\n*   **War-Strategy:** National level military actions, including non-military actions. The corresponding function is \"strategy,\" a country's military or war stratagems.\n*   **Campaigns-Operational Art:** Combat actions below war but above battles.  The corresponding function, lacking a title and often conflated with \"campaigning,\" is termed \"operational art,\" positioned between strategy and tactics.\n*   **Battles-Tactics:** Basic scale combat actions. The corresponding function is \"tactics.\"\n\nTraditional military training focuses on mastering these functions at each level.  However, future soldiers must learn to disrupt these levels, combining factors from supra-national actions to specific battles to win wars.  Supra-tier combinations involve interchangeable roles for war policy, strategy, operational art, and tactics, such as using a strategic non-military method for a tactical mission, or a tactical method for a war policy objective.  The trend of warfare increasingly shows that problems at one level are not solely solvable by means at that level.  Regardless of resource allocation, combining levels and methods is key.",

    "text": "…it is a feasible method so long as it works well. Bin Laden used a tactical level method of only two truckloads of explosives and threatened U.S. national interests on the strategic level, whereas the Americans can only achieve the strategic objective of protecting their own safety by carrying out tactical level retaliation against him. Another example is that in past wars, the smallest combat element was the combination of a man and a machine, and its usefulness would normally not go beyond the scale of battles. In beyond-limits war, by contrast, the man-machine combination performs multiple offensive functions which span the levels from battles to war policy. One hacker + one modem causes an enemy damage and losses almost equal to those of a war. Because it has the breadth and secrecy of trans-level combat, this method of individual combat very easily achieves results on the strategic and even war policy levels. This is the gist and significance of supra-level combinations. In warfare and non-military warfare which is primarily national and supra-national, there is no territory which cannot be surpassed; there is no means which cannot be used in the war; and there is no territory and method which cannot be used in combination. The applicability of the actions of war to the trend of globalization is manifested in the word “beyond.” This word is sufficient to mean using one to apply to ten thousand, but what we mean by ten thousand methods combined as one is precisely covered by the word “beyond.” It must be pointed out once again that combined war that goes beyond limits is first of all a way of thinking, and only afterwards is it a method.\n\nPrinciples are a code of conduct, but not an absolute one. In the history of warfare, the first person credited with using principles to regularize methods of fighting should be Sun Tzu. Principles which he advocated, such as “know the enemy and yourself and in a hundred battles you will never be defeated,” “strike where the enemy is not prepared, take him by surprise,” and “avoid the solid and strike the weak,” are still articles of faith for modern strategists. But in the West, 2,400 years later, Napoleon would reveal his real desire to the world famous Saint-Cyr Military Academy…: “To write a book, describing the principles of war precisely, and provide it to all soldiers.” Unfortunately, when he fought and won wars he had no time to write, and after he was defeated he was no longer in the mood. To a marshal who created nearly 100 victories in his lifetime, this should be neither too big nor too little a regret. But having been born a great man, it was enough for him to leave behind a brilliant record of victories for posterity to scour in search of his path to victory. A hundred years afterwards, from the wars directed by this old enemy who elicited dread from British people both during life and after death, a British general by the name of J. F. C. Fuller induced five principles for directing modern wars. All of the West’s principles of modern warfare are descended from these. Although later military regulations of quite a few countries and several military theorists proposed this or that as a principle of war, all of those things differ only in minor ways with those originated by Fuller. This is because, from the beginning of the Napoleonic wars to the time prior to the Gulf War, apart from the continual increase in lethality and destructiveness, there was no reason for an essential change in the nature of war itself. Now the situation has changed, because of all that happened during and after the Gulf War. The introduction of precision guided weapons, non-lethal weapons, and non-military weapons has derailed warfare from its mad dash down the track toward increased lethality and destructiveness. Events have set in motion the first change of course since the dawn of history. This has laid a new track for war in the next century, and given rise to principles with which professional military people are unfamiliar. No principle can rest on a flimsy platform waiting to collapse. This is even more true of principles of war. Regardless of which military thinker produced them, or whatever military headquarters “regulations they come from, the principles are all undoubtedly the product of repeated tempering in the furnace and on the anvil of war. If there had been no wars in the Spring and Autumn period there would be no principles of Sun Tzu. If there had been no Napoleonic wars, there would be no principles of Fuller.",

    "section": "Principles of Beyond-Limits Combined War",
    "text": "Wars throughout the world before and after the Gulf War have spurred new concepts like the Americans’ “full-dimensional operations” and our “beyond-limits combined war.” While “full-dimensional operations” theory did not flourish, we are determined that “beyond-limits combined war” will have practical application.  The core intent of “beyond limits” is to break through all restrictions, but one constraint remains: adhering to essential principles during combat, deviating only in exceptional circumstances. When strategic thought solidifies into a combat method, a principle is born. Whether these untested methods and principles will lead to victory is uncertain, but proposing them is essential for perfecting combat methods.\n\nHere are the key principles:\n• Omnidirectionality\n• Synchrony\n• Limited objectives\n• Unlimited measures\n• Asymmetry\n• Minimal consumption\n• Multidimensional coordination\n• Adjustment and control of the entire process\n\nOmnidirectionality is the foundation of “unrestricted war.” It demands comprehensive consideration of all factors related to a war, observing the battlefield (or potential battlefield) with no blind spots. In beyond-limits warfare, the battlefield expands beyond physical spaces (ground, sea, air, space) to include social spaces (military, politics, economics, culture, psyche) and the technological space linking them. Warfare transcends traditional boundaries, encompassing military and non-military, violent and non-violent actions, involving professional soldiers and non-traditional forces. Omnidirectionality applies to every level of beyond-limits combined war: from grand strategy involving supra-national powers to tactical operations of a single unit. It emphasizes grasping the combat situation from all angles.\n\nSynchrony is critical in modern warfare due to advancements in information technology, long-range warfare, and the integration of diverse forces.  It emphasizes bringing dispersed factors to bear within the same designated timeframe for a combined attack, achieving surprise and effectiveness. A single, synchronized action can decide a war’s outcome. “Synchrony” here means “within the same time period,” not absolute simultaneity. The US military, with its advanced information and long-range attack systems, is closest to achieving this level of “designated time warfare.” However, their current thinking seems limited to military action, not encompassing broader spheres.\n\nLimited objectives are crucial. Objectives must always be smaller than the measures available.  Consider feasibility and avoid unrestricted aims. Limitations provide clarity, practicality, and the resilience to pursue subsequent objectives. Avoid craving great successes and instead focus on achievable, limited objectives. Exceeding the limits of available resources, as MacArthur did in Korea, the US in Vietnam, and the Soviets in Afghanistan, guarantees defeat.  The 1996 US Department of Defense Report, citing President Clinton, highlights the risk of conflating national interests with broader values – the latter being an objective beyond American power to achieve outside its territory.",

    "text": "Unlimited measures are related to limited objectives.  The trend toward “no limits” means expanding the range of measures and methods, not their intemperate or absolutist use. Unlimited measures serve limited objectives. Measures cannot be divorced from objectives.  Atomic weapons were considered absolute measures because they violated this principle. Unrestricted measures must, as Confucius said, be “as one pleases but not beyond the rules,” where “rules” are the objectives. Beyond-limits ideology expands options for employing measures beyond restrictions to achieve limited objectives. Conversely, limiting measures due to limited objectives can lead to failure. Sherman’s march to Savannah, employing destruction to cripple the Confederate economy and achieve the North’s war objective, exemplifies the successful use of unlimited measures for a limited objective.  In contrast, Egypt’s limited measures in the Yom Kippur War almost cost them victory.\n\nAsymmetry is key to disrupting conventional thinking. It focuses on developing actions contrary to the balance of symmetry, considering asymmetrical factors in force deployment, attack strategy, and weapon allocation. Asymmetry allows exploitation of enemy vulnerabilities. Weaker actors consistently employ asymmetrical methods (guerrilla warfare, terrorism, protracted war, network war) against stronger adversaries, targeting unexpected areas and aiming for psychological shock. This approach can neutralize a stronger opponent's conventional advantages, rendering them ineffective.\n\nMinimal Consumption emphasizes using the least amount of resources to achieve objectives.",

    "text": "OBJECTIVE The principle of minimal consumption is, first of all, that rationality is more important than thrift; second, the size of combat consumption is decided by the form of combat; and third, use “more” (more measures) to pursue “less” (lower consumption). Rationality involves two aspects, the rational designation of objectives and the rational use of resources. Rational designation of objectives, besides specifying objectives that fall within the circle of the measures to be used, also refers to the need to compress the objectives’ load, and as much as possible make them simple and concise. Rational use of resources obviously means using the most appropriate method to accomplish an objective, and not just imposing a single-minded requirement to economize. Economizing, that is, using the minimum amount of resources, has meaning only if the prerequisites for accomplishing an objective are met. More important than perfect familiarity with principles is how the principles are applied. Whether or not the minimum amount of combat resources is used to accomplish an objective depends on what form of combat operation is selected. The Verdun campaign is called by war historians a meat grinder, because both sides waged a senseless war of attrition. By contrast, the reason Germany was able to sweep away the joint British-French force after crossing the Maginot Line was because it combined the shortest length of time, the optimum route, and the most powerful weapons in a blitzkrieg. So it can be seen that the key to truly achieving “minimal consumption” is to find a combat method which makes rational use of combat resources. Today, with objectives and the measures to accomplish them assuming many complex forms as never before, confronting a complex objective in just one sphere and with just one measure will definitely fall short of the mark. The result of a mismatch between measures and objectives is inevitably high consumption and low effectiveness. The line of thought leading out of these difficulties is to use “more” to attain “less.” That is, to combine the superiorities of several kinds of combat resources in several kinds of areas to form up a completely new form of combat, accomplishing the objective while at the same time minimizing consumption.",

    "text": "MULTIDIMENSIONAL COORDINATION—COORDINATING AND ALLOCATING ALL THE FORCES WHICH CAN BE MOBILIZED IN THE MILITARY AND NON-MILITARY SPHERES COVERING AN OBJECTIVE “Multidimensional” here is another way of saying multiple spheres and multiple forces. It has nothing to do with the definition of dimensionality in the sense of mathematics or physics. “Multidimensional coordination” refers to coordination and cooperation among different forces in different spheres in order to accomplish an objective. On the face of it, this definition is not at all novel. Similar explanations are to be found in many combat regulations, both obsolete and newly published. The only difference between it and similar explanations is, and this is a great difference, the introduction of non-military and non-war factors into the sphere of war directly rather than indirectly. In other words, since any sphere can become a battlefield, and any force can be used under combat conditions, we should be more inclined to understand multidimensional coordination as the coordination of the military dimension with various other dimensions in the pursuit of a specific objective. It is not the case that in all wars military action must be considered as the primary form of action. With warfare facing the equalization of the various dimensions, this concept will become a formula for addressing the questions of future wars. The concept of multidimensional coordination can only be established within the context of a specific objective. Without an objective, we cannot speak of multidimensional coordination. But the size of an objective determines the breadth and depth of the coordination of each dimension. If the set objective is to win a war at the war policy level, the spheres and forces needing coordination may involve the entire country, or may even be supra- national. From this we can generalize that in any military or non-military action, no matter what the depth of the spheres and the quantity of forces it involves, coordination among the various dimensions is absolutely necessary. This certainly does not imply that in each action the more measures mobilized the better. Instead, the limit is what is necessary. The employment of an excessive or an insufficient amount in each dimension will only cause the action to sway between edema and shriveling, and finally the objective itself will be in jeopardy. The bit of Eastern wisdom, “going beyond the limit is as bad as falling short,” is helpful to our understanding and our application of this principle. In addition, we urgently need to expand our field of vision regarding forces which can be mobilized, in particular non-military forces. Besides, as in the past, paying attention to conventional, material forces, we should also pay particular attention to the employment of intangible “strategic resources” such as geographical factors, the role of history, cultural traditions, sense of ethnic identity, dominating and exploiting the influence of international organizations, etc.",

    "text": "ADJUSTMENT AND CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS— DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE OF A WAR, FROM ITS START, THROUGH ITS PROGRESS, TO ITS CONCLUSION, CONTINUALLY ACQUIRE INFORMATION, ADJUST ACTION, AND CONTROL THE SITUATION Warfare is a dynamic process full of randomness and creativity. Any attempt to tie a war to a set of ideas within a predetermined plan is little short of absurdity or naiveté. Therefore, it is necessary to have feedback and revisions throughout the entire course of a war while it is actually happening, in order to keep the initiative within one’s grasp. This is what is meant by “adjustment and control of the entire process.” Because of the addition of the principle of synchrony, we cannot understand the adjusted and controlled “entire course” to be a prolonged one. With modern, high-tech measures, this process may take the blink of an eye. As we said before, the time it takes to fight one battle can be sufficient to wind up a whole war. This may make the entire course of a war extremely short, and incidentally make adjusting and controlling it much more difficult. Today, with information technology welding the entire world together into a network, the number of factors involved in a war is much, much greater than in past wars. The ability of these factors to cloud the issues of war, and their intense influence on war, means that loss of control over anyone link can be like the proverbial loss of a horseshoe nail which led to the loss of an entire war. So, faced with modern warfare and its bursts of new technology, new measures, and new arenas, adjustment and control of the entire process is becoming more and more of a skill. It is not a kind of technology. What is needed to grasp the ever-changing battlefield situation is greater use of intuition, rather than mathematical deduction. More important than constant changes in force dispositions and continual updating of weapons is the whole set of combat rules which are the result of the shift of the battlefield to non-military spheres. The outcome of all this is that one will be sent to an unexplored battlefield to wage an unfamiliar war against an unknown enemy. Nevertheless, one must adjust and control this entire unfamiliar process if he is to win. “Beyond-limits combined war” is this use of strange, completely new methods of combat to wage war. All of the above principles are applicable to any beyond-limits combined war. Victory is certainly not in the bag just because a side adheres to the above principles, but violating them no doubt leads to defeat. Principles are always essential conditions for victory in war, but they are not the only conditions. In the absence of a principle that victory is certain, there are only essential principles. We should always remember this point.",

Global integration is comprehensive and profound. Through its ruthless enlightenment, those things which must inevitably be altered or even dispelled are the positions of authority and interest boundaries in which nations are the principal entities. The modern concept of “nation states” which emerged from the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 is no longer the sole representative occupying the top position in social, political, economic and cultural organizations. The emergence of large numbers of metanational, transnational, and non-national organizations, along with the inherent contradictions between one nation and another, are presenting an unprecedented challenge to national authority, national interests, and national will.\nAt the time of the emergence of the early nation states, the births of most of them were assisted by blood-and-iron warfare. In the same way, during the transition of nation states to globalization, there is no way to avoid collisions between enormous interest blocs. What is different is that the means that we have today to untie the “Gordian Knot“ are not merely swords, and because of this we no longer have to be like our ancestors who invariably saw resolution by armed force as the last Court of appeals. Any of the political, economic, or diplomatic means now has sufficient strength to supplant military means. However, mankind has no reason at all to be gratified by this, because what we have done is nothing more than substitute bloodless warfare for bloody warfare as much as possible. As a result, while constricting the battlespace in the narrow sense, at the same time we have turned the entire world into a battlefield in the broad sense. On this battlefield, people still fight, plunder, and kill each other as before, but the weapons are more advanced and the means more sophisticated, so while it is somewhat less bloody, it is still just as brutal. Given this reality, mankind’s dream of peace is still as elusive as ever. Even speaking optimistically, war will not be wiped out rapidly within the foreseeable future, whether it is bloody or not.",

    "text": "Since things which should happen will ultimately come to pass, what we can and must focus on at present is how to achieve victory. Faced with warfare in the broad sense that will unfold on a borderless battlefield, it is no longer possible to rely on military forces and weapons alone to achieve national security in the larger strategic sense, nor is it possible to protect these stratified national interests. Obviously, warfare is in the process of transcending the domains of soldiers, military units, and military affairs, and is increasingly becoming a matter for politicians, scientists, and even bankers. How to conduct war is obviously no longer a question for the consideration of military people alone. As early as the beginning of this century, Clemenceau stated that “war is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military.” However, the history of the past 100 years tells us that turning over warfare to the politicians is not the ideal way to resolve this important issue, either. People are turning to technical civilization, hoping to find in technological developments a valve which will control war. But what makes people despair is that the entire century is just about gone, and while technology has made great strides, war still remains an unbroken mustang. People still expect wonders from the revolution in military affairs, hoping that high-tech weapons and non-lethal weapons can reduce civilian and even military casualties in order to diminish the brutality of war. However, the occurrence of the revolution in military affairs, along with other revolutions, has altered the last decade of the 20th century. The world is no longer what it was originally, but war is still as brutal as it has always been. The only thing that is different is that this brutality has been expanded through differences in the modes in which two armies fight one other. Think about the Lockerbie air disaster. Think about the two bombs in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Then think about the financial crisis in East Asia. It should not be difficult to understand what is meant by this different kind of brutality. This, then, is globalization. This is warfare in the age of globalization. Although it is but one aspect, it is a startling one. When the soldiers standing at the crossroads of the centuries are faced with this aspect, perhaps each of them should ask himself, what can we still do? If those such as Morris, bin Laden, and Soros can be considered soldiers in the wars of tomorrow, then who isn’t a soldier? If the likes of Powell, Schwarzkopf, Dayan, and Sharon can be considered politicians in uniform, then who isn’t a politician? This is the conundrum that globalization and warfare in the age of globalization has left for the soldiers. Although the boundaries between soldiers and non-soldiers have now been broken down, and the chasm between warfare and non-warfare nearly filled up, globalization has made all the tough problems interconnected and interlocking, and we must find a key for that. The key should be able to open all the locks, if these locks are on the front door of war. And this key must be suited to all the levels and dimensions, from war policy, strategy, and operational techniques to tactics; and it must also fit the hands of individuals, from politicians and generals to the common soldiers. We can think of no other more appropriate key than “unrestricted warfare.”",

One war changed the world. Linking such a conclusion to a war which occurred one time in a limited area and which only lasted 42 days seems like something of an exaggeration. However, that is indeed what the facts are, and there is no need to enumerate one by one all the new words that began to appear after 17 January 1991. It is only necessary to cite the former Soviet Union, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, cloning, Microsoft, hackers, the Internet, the Southeast Asian financial crisis, the euro, as well as the world's final and only superpower -- the United States. These are sufficient. They pretty much constitute the main subjects on this planet for the past decade.

A war which changed the world ultimately changed war itself. This is truly fantastic, yet it also causes people to ponder deeply. No, what we are referring to are not changes in the instruments of war, the technology of war, the modes of war, or the forms of war. What we are referring to is the function of warfare. Who could imagine that an insufferably arrogant actor, whose appearance has changed the entire plot, suddenly finds that he himself is actually the last person to play this unique role. Furthermore, without waiting for him to leave the stage, he has already been told that there is no great likelihood that he will again handle an A role, at least not a central role in which he alone occupies center stage. What kind of feeling would this be? Perhaps those who feel this most deeply are the Americans, who probably should be counted as among the few who want to play all the roles, including savior, fireman, world policeman, and an emissary of peace, etc. In the aftermath of \"Desert Storm,\" Uncle Sam has not been able to again achieve a commendable victory. Whether it was in Somalia or Bosnia-Herzegovina, this has invariably been the case. In particular, in the most recent action in which the United States and Britain teamed up to carry out air attacks on Iraq, it was the same stage, the same method, and the same actors, but there was no way to successfully perform the magnificent drama that had made such a profound impression eight years earlier. Faced with political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, ethnic, and religious issues, etc., that are more complex than they are in the minds of most of the military men in the world, the limitations of the military means, which had heretofore always been successful, suddenly became apparent.",

The age of great scientific discoveries had already been left behind before Einstein's time. However, modern man is increasingly inclined to seeing all his dreams come true during his lifetime. This causes him, when betting on his own future, to prostrate himself and expect wonders from technology through a 1000-power concave lens. In this way, technology has achieved startling and explosive developments in a rather short period of time, and this has resulted in innumerable benefits for mankind, which is anxious for quick success and instant rewards. However, we proudly term this technological progress, not realizing that at this time we have already consigned ourselves to a benighted technological age in which we have lost our hearts [2].

Bell Labs and Sony continue to put out novel toys, Bill Gates opens new \"Windows\" each year, and \"Dolly,\" the cloned sheep, proves that mankind is now planning to take the place of God the Creator. The fearsome Russian-built SU-27 fighter has not been put to use on any battlefield, and already the SU-35 has emerged to strike a pose [3], but whether or not, once it has exhausted its time in the limelight, the SU-35 will be able to retire having rendered meritorious service is still a matter of considerable doubt. Technology is like \"magic shoes\" on the feet of mankind, and after the spring has been wound tightly by commercial interests, people can only dance along with the shoes, whirling rapidly in time to the beat that they set.",

    "text": "9 The names Watt and Edison are nearly synonymous with great technical inventions, and using these great technological masters to name their age may be said to be reasonable. However, from then on, the situation changed, and the countless and varied technological discoveries of the past 100 years or so makes it difficult for the appearance of any new technology to take on any self- importance in the realm of human life. While it may be said that the formulations of \"the age of the steam engine\" and \"the age of electrification\" can be said to be names which reflect the realities of the time, today, with all kinds of new technology continuously beating against the banks of the age so that people scarcely have the time to accord them brief acclaim while being overwhelmed by an even higher and newer wave of technology, the age in which an era could be named for a single new technology or a single inventor has become a thing of the past. This is the reason why, if one calls the current era the \"nuclear age\" or the \"information age,\" it will still give people the impression that you are using one aspect to typify the whole situation. There is absolutely no doubt that the appearance of information technology has been good news for human civilization. This is because it is the only thing to date that is capable of infusing greater energy into the technological \"plague\" that has been released from Pandora's box, and at the same time it also provides a magic charm as a means of controlling it [technology]. It is just that, at present, there is still a question of who in turn will have a magic charm with which to control it [information technology]. The pessimistic viewpoint is that, if this technology develops in a direction which cannot be controlled by man, ultimately it will turn mankind into its victim [4]. However, this frightening conclusion is totally incapable of reducing people's ardor for it. The optimistic prospects that it displays itself are intensely seductive for mankind, which has a thirst for technical progress. After all, its unique features of exchanging and sharing represent the light of intelligence which we can hope will lead mankind out of the barbarism of technology, although this is still not sufficient to make us like those futurists who cannot see the forest for the trees, and who use its name to label the entire age. Its characteristics are precisely what keep it from being able to replace the various technologies that we already have in great quantity, that 10 are just emerging, or which are about to be born, particularly those such as biotechnology, materials technology, and nanotechnology, these technologies which have a symbiotic relationship with information technology in which they rely on and promote one another. Over the past 300 years, people have long since become accustomed to blindly falling in love with the new and discarding the old in the realm of technology, and the endless pursuit of new technology has become a panacea to resolve all the difficult questions of existence. Infatuated with it, people have gradually gone astray. Just as one will often commit ten other mistakes to cover up one, to solve one difficult problem people do not hesitate to bring ten more on themselves [5]. For example, for a more convenient means of transportation, people invented cars, but a long string of problems followed closely on the heels of the automobile -- mining and smelting, mechanical processing, oil extraction, rubber refining, and road-building, etc., which in turn required a long string of technical means to solve, until ultimately it led to pollution of the environment, destroying resources, taking over farmland, traffic accidents, and a host of thornier problems. In the long run, comparing the original goal of using cars for transportation with these derivative problems, it almost seems unimportant. In this way, the irrational expansion of technology causes mankind to continually lose his goals in the complex ramifications of the tree of technology, losing his way and forgetting how to get back. We may as well dub this phenomenon the \"ramification effect.\"",

    "text": "“As soon as technological advances may be applied to military goals, and furthermore are already used for military purposes, they almost immediately seem obligatory, and also often go against the will of the commanders in triggering changes or even revolutions in the modes of combat” -- Engels\n\nThe weapons revolution invariably precedes the revolution in military affairs by one step, and following the arrival of a revolutionary weapon, the arrival of the revolution in military affairs is just a matter of time. The history of warfare is continually providing this kind of proof: bronze or iron spears resulted in the infantry phalanx, and bows and arrows and stirrups provided new tactics for cavalry. Black powder cannons gave rise to a full complement of modern warfare modes....from the time when conical bullets and rifles took to the battlefield as the vanguard of the age of technology, weapons straightaway stamped their names on the chest of warfare. First, it was the enormous steel-clad naval vessels that ruled the seas, launching the “age of battleships,” then its brother the “tank” ruled land warfare, after which the airplane dominated the skies, up until the atomic bomb was born, announcing the approach of the “nuclear age.” Today, a multitude of new and advanced technology weapons continues to pour forth, so that weapons have solemnly become the chief representative of war. When people discuss future warfare, they are already quite accustomed to using certain weapons or certain technologies to describe it, calling it “electronic warfare,” “precision-weapons warfare,” and “information warfare.” Coasting along in their mental orbit, people have not yet noticed that a certain inconspicuous yet very important change is stealthily approaching.\n\nNo One Has the Right to Label Warfare\n\nThe weapons revolution is a prelude to a revolution in military affairs. What is different than in the past is that the revolution in military affairs that is coming will no longer by driven by one or two individual weapons. In addition to continuing to stimulate people to yearn for and be charmed by new weapons, the numerous technological inventions have also quickly eradicated the mysteries of each kind of weapon. In the past, all that was needed was the invention of a few weapons or pieces of equipment, such as the stirrup and the Maxim machine gun, and that was sufficient to alter the form of war, whereas today upwards of 100 kinds of weapons are needed to make up a certain weapons system before it can have an overall effect on war. However, the more weapons are invented, the smaller an individual weapon’s role in war becomes, and this is a paradox that is inherent in the relationship between weapons and war. Speaking in that sense, other than the all-out use of nuclear weapons, a situation which is more and more unlikely and which may be termed nuclear war, none of the other weapons, even those that are extremely revolutionary in nature, possesses the right to label future warfare.",

    "text": "Perhaps it is precisely because people recognize this point that we then have formulations such as “high-tech warfare” and “information warfare”, whose intent is to use the broad concept of technology to replace the concept of specific weapons, using a fuzzy-learning approach to resolve this knotty problem. However, it seems that this still is not the way to resolve the problem. When one delves deeply into this, the term “high-technology”, which first appeared in the architectural industry in the United States, is in fact a bit vague. What constitutes high technology? What does it refer to? Logically speaking, high and low are only relative concepts. However, using an extremely mutable concept in this irrational manner to name warfare, which is evolving endlessly, in itself constitutes a considerable problem. When one generation’s high technology becomes low technology with the passage of time, are we still prepared to again dub the new toys that continue to appear as being high tech? Or is it possible that, in today’s technological explosion, this may result in confusion and trouble for us in naming and using each new technology that appears? Not to mention the question of just what should be the standard to determine whether something is high or not? With regard to technology itself, each technology has specific aspects, which therefore means that each has its time limits. Yesterday’s “high” is very possibly today’s “low,” while today’s “new” will in turn become tomorrow’s “old.” Compared to the M-60 tank, the “Cobra” helicopter, and the B-52, the main battle weapons of the 60s-70s, the “Abrams” tank, the “Apache” helicopter gunship, the F-117, the “Patriot” missiles, and the “Tomahawk” cruise missiles are high tech. However, faced with the B-2, the F-22, the “Comanche” helicopter, and the “J-Stars” joint-surveillance target-attack radar system, they in turn seem outmoded. It is as if to say there is the concept of high-tech weapons, which is a variable throughout, and which naturally becomes the title of the “bride.” Then, as the “flowers bloom each year, but the people change,” all that is left is the empty shell of a name, which is continually placed on the head of the girl who is becoming the next “bride.” Then, in the chain of warfare with its continuous links, each weapon can go from high to low and from new to old at any time and any place, with time’s arrow being unwilling to stop at any point; nor can any weapon occupy the throne of high technology for long. Since this is the case, just what kind of high technology does this so-called high-tech warfare refer to? High technology, as spoken of in generalities, cannot become a synonym for future warfare, nor is information technology -- which is one of the high technologies of the present age and which seems to occupy an important position in the makeup of all modern weapons -- sufficient to name a war.",

    "text": "Most advanced weapons... are not necessarily those with the greatest future. Aggressive initiatives under negative preconditions are context-specific, not eternal rules. Scientific progress has shifted from passive discovery to active invention. The American concept of \"building the weapons to fit the fight\" revolutionized the relationship between weapons and tactics.  This approach prioritizes defining combat modes *before* developing weapons, as exemplified by \"Air-Land Battle,\" the \"digitized battlefield,\" and \"digitized units.\" This signifies a shift from weapons driving military revolutions to tactics taking the lead, with both influencing each other in a push-pull dynamic. Weapons development now emphasizes interconnectedness and compatibility, rather than solely individual weapon performance.  The F-111, while advanced, lacked compatibility and was ultimately shelved.  The reliance on singular \"killer weapons\" is obsolete. \"Building the weapons to fit the fight\" is an active choice and a response to evolving circumstances, marking a significant shift in war preparation. However, this approach also presents a potential crisis: tailoring weapon systems to still-developing tactics is risky. The US military's struggles in Somalia against Aidid's forces demonstrate that even the most modern forces can be ineffective against unconventional opponents. Future digitized forces might face similar challenges against unconventional, low-tech adversaries. The \"generation gap\" in weapons and forces demands attention. A narrow gap favors the more advanced generation, while a wider gap can lead to a stalemate. High-tech forces often struggle against unconventional, low-tech warfare, a phenomenon worthy of further study.",

    "text": "Compared to new-concept weapons, most existing weapons can be classified as \"old-concept,\" focusing on mobility and lethality. Even advanced weapons like precision-guided bombs merely add intelligence and structural capabilities. These traditional weapons, controlled by professional soldiers and used on conventional battlefields, have reached a developmental dead end in adapting to modern and future warfare. Attempts to revolutionize traditional weapons through high technology have led to escalating costs and an arms race. This paradox necessitates continuous development to maintain a leading edge, but the resulting costs become unsustainable, potentially leading to national bankruptcy. Marshal Orgakov's concept of a \"revolution in military technology,\" while prescient, intensified the arms race and arguably contributed to the Soviet Union's collapse.  The US now faces a similar paradox, with escalating weapons costs exemplified by the F-14, F-15, B-2, and F-22. The exorbitant cost of these weapons, such as the B-2 exceeding the price of gold by weight, highlights the unsustainable nature of this approach.  This predicament necessitates alternative approaches, leading to the emergence of new-concept weapons, again pioneered by the Americans, who demonstrated their potential, albeit ruthlessly, in the Vietnam War.  However, the US does not hold a monopoly on innovation. New *concepts* of weapons represent a broader evolution beyond specific technologies, requiring insightful thinking rather than technological prowess, an area where the US, often constrained by technology-driven thinking, might lag.",

    "text": "Before the atom bomb, warfare was characterized by a constant pursuit of greater lethality, progressing from \"light-kill\" weapons like swords and single-shot firearms to \"heavy-kill\" weapons like automatic firearms. The atom bomb, an \"ultra-lethal weapon,\" fulfilled this desire for ultimate destructive power, exceeding the demand for lethality and forcing a reevaluation of its role. This overabundance of destructive potential, exemplified by nuclear weapons, created an existential trap, leading to questions about the necessity of such power.  The concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" emerged as a control mechanism, slowing the relentless pursuit of increased lethality and prompting the search for alternative approaches to weapons development that balance effectiveness with control.  The 1948 \"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\" and subsequent pacts further influenced this shift, establishing international human rights standards that condemned the use of weapons of mass destruction as violations of the \"right to life\" and \"crimes against mankind.\" Human rights, alongside new political concepts, and the potential for global annihilation, contributed to a shift away from maximizing lethality toward controlled and potentially less destructive forms of warfare.",

    "text": "integration trend in international economics, the interlocking demands and political positions involving the interests of various social and political forces, the proposal of the concept of \"ultimate concern\" for the ecological environment, and particularly the value of human life, have resulted in misgivings about killing and destruction, forming a new value concept for war and new ethics for warfare. The trend to \"kinder\" [18] weapons is nothing other than a reflection in the production and development of weapons of this great change in man's cultural background. At the same time, technological progress has given us the means to strike at the enemy's nerve center directly without harming other things, giving us numerous new options for achieving victory, and all these make people believe that the best way to achieve victory is to control, not to kill. There have been changes in the concept of war and the concept of weapons, and the approach of using uncontrolled slaughter to force the enemy into unconditional surrender has now become the relic of a bygone age. Warfare has now taken leave of the meat-grinder age of Verdun-like campaigns. The appearance of precision-kill (accurate) weapons and non-lethal (non-fatal) weapons is a turning point in the development of weapons, showing for the first time that weapons are developing in a \"kinder,\" not a \"stronger\" direction. Precision-kill weapons can hit a target precisely, reducing collateral casualties, and like a gamma knife which can excise a tumor with hardly any bleeding, it has led to \"surgical\" strikes and other such new tactics, so that inconspicuous combat actions can achieve extremely notable strategic results. For example, by merely using one missile to track a mobile telephone signal, the Russians were able to still forever the tough mouth of Dudayev, who was a headache, and at the same time eased the enormous trouble that had been stirred up by tiny Chechnya. Non-lethal weapons can effectively eliminate the combat capabilities of personnel and equipment without loss of life [19]. The trend that is embodied in these weapons shows that mankind is in the process of overcoming its own extreme thinking, beginning to learn to control the lethal power that it already has but which is increasingly excessive. In the massive bombing that lasted more than a month during the Gulf War, the loss of life among civilians in Iraq only numbered in the thousands [20], far less than in the massive bombing of Dresden during World War II. Kinder weapons represent the latest conscious choice of mankind among various options in the weapons arena by which, after the weapons are infused with the element of new technology, the human component is then added, thereby giving warfare an unprecedented kind-hearted hue. However, a kinder weapon is still a weapon, and it does not mean that the demands of being kinder will reduce the battlefield effectiveness of the weapon. To take away a tank's combat capabilities one can use cannons or missiles to destroy it, or a laser beam can be used to destroy its optical equipment or blind its crew. On the battlefield, someone who is injured requires more care than someone who is killed, and unmanned weapons can eliminate increasingly expensive protective facilities. Certainly those developing kinder weapons have already done cold cost-effectiveness calculations of this. Casualties can strip away an enemy's combat capabilities, causing him to panic and lose the will to fight, so this may be considered an extremely worthwhile way to achieve victory. Today, we already have enough technology, and we can create many methods of causing fear which are more effective, such as using a laser beam to project the image of injured followers against the sky, which would be sufficient to frighten those soldiers who are devoutly religious. There are no longer any obstacles to building this kind of weapon, it just requires that some additional imagination be added to the technical element. Kinder weapons represent a derivative of the new concept of weapons, while information weapons are a prominent example of kinder weapons.",

They represent a change with the most profound implications in the history of human warfare to date, and are the watershed between the old and the new forms of war. This is because their appearance has been sufficient to put all the wars in the age of cold and hot weapons into the \"old\" era. Nonetheless, we still cannot indulge in romantic fantasies about technology, believing that from this point on war will become a confrontation like an electronic game, and even simulated warfare in a computer room similarly must be premised upon a country's actual overall capabilities, and if a colossus with feet of clay comes up with ten plans for simulated warfare, it will still not be sufficient to deter an enemy who is more powerful with regard to actual strength. War is still the ground of death and life, the path of survival and destruction, and even the slightest innocence is not tolerated. Even if some day all the weapons have been made completely humane, a kinder war in which bloodshed may be avoided is still war. It may alter the cruel process of war, but there is no way to change the essence of war, which is one of compulsion, and therefore it cannot alter its cruel outcome, either.",

When tanks traversed trenches, airplanes were already equipped with machine guns and bombs were dropped from zeppelins. Technological advancements alone do not change warfare; strategic innovation is crucial.  Figures like General J.F.C. Fuller, Giulio Douhet, and Mikhail Tukhachevsky conceptualized three-dimensional warfare. Erich Ludendorff's theory of \"total war,\" though unsuccessful, foreshadowed future military thought.  Limited by the technology of his time, Ludendorff could only envision battles within the range of artillery. Hitler, with access to long-range weapons, blurred the lines between front and rear but didn't fully grasp the revolutionary implications. Technology continues to outpace military thinking.  Satellites, submarines, ballistic missiles, and electronic warfare extend the battlespace. Even the human psyche is vulnerable to psychological operations.  Current concepts of operational space are becoming obsolete. The battlespace expands with human imagination and technological mastery.",

Modern soldiers, influenced by technology and pop culture, are less inclined towards direct combat. Digital fighters are supplanting traditional warriors.

Around the same time, hackers protesting India's nuclear tests infiltrated the Bhabha Atomic Research Center's network. These incidents highlight the growing influence of non-state actors in the information age. More dangerous than hackers are non-state organizations with military leanings, often driven by extreme ideologies, such as Islamic extremist groups, Caucasian militias, Aum Shinrikyo, and Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization.  These groups' destructive acts represent a new breeding ground for contemporary wars.  Nation-states and traditional armed forces, bound by rules and limitations, struggle against these organizations, unbound by rules and willing to wage unlimited war. Concurrent with these developments, a non-military type of war emerged, waged by non-professional warriors who are not hackers or members of quasi-military organizations. These individuals are systems analysts, software engineers, financiers, stock speculators, media moguls, or influential columnists. They possess strong philosophies and are not afraid to engage in conflict.  George Soros, for example, could be considered a financial terrorist. Modern technology is blurring the lines of who participates in war. Soldiers no longer hold a monopoly, as non-professional warriors and non-state organizations pose an increasing threat to sovereign nations, becoming formidable adversaries for professional armies, which are likened to dinosaurs facing off against highly adaptable rodents.",

    "text": "The American perspective on future warfare is crucial, not just because of U.S. dominance, but due to their forward-thinking approach. They identify four main forms of future warfare: information warfare, precision warfare, joint operations, and military operations other than war (MOOTW).  Except for joint operations, these forms are products of new military thinking. General Gordon R. Sullivan emphasized information warfare and precision warfare, recognizing the importance of information processing and stealthy long-range attacks.  Precision warfare, or \"non-contact attack,\" utilizes high-tech weaponry like precision-guided weapons, GPS, C4I systems, and stealth airplanes to achieve quick, effective outcomes with minimal casualties.  The concept of MOOTW, though potentially overreaching, expands the understanding of war beyond the battlefield to encompass peacekeeping, drug suppression, riot control, military aid, arms control, disaster relief, and counterterrorism. This broader concept paves the way for a more revolutionary idea: \"non-military war operations,\" which recognizes that war extends to all human endeavors, as individuals utilize every means to achieve their objectives.  While the U.S. didn't originate this concept, their pragmatism and technological advancements contributed to its emergence.  The question becomes: which unconventional means will be favored in these increasingly frequent \"non-military war operations\"?",

Methods include manipulating domestic trade laws internationally, erecting and dismantling tariff barriers, imposing trade sanctions and technology embargoes, utilizing Special Section 301, and leveraging most-favored-nation status. The eight-year embargo against Iraq serves as a prime example of trade war's destructive potential. The Asian financial crisis demonstrated the devastating impact of financial war, as international mobile capital owners orchestrated attacks that crippled economies once lauded as \"tigers\" and \"dragons.\"  This form of warfare, without bloodshed, inflicts casualties and societal damage comparable to, or even exceeding, regional wars.  Financial war has taken center stage in the realm of conflict, traditionally occupied by soldiers and weapons. Future historical accounts of 20th-century warfare will undoubtedly highlight financial warfare, with figures like George Soros playing prominent roles.  Soros is not alone in wielding finance as a weapon. Helmut Kohl used the deutsche mark to breach the Berlin Wall, and Li Denghui exploited the Southeast Asian crisis to attack the Hong Kong dollar and stock market.  Large and small speculators, including Morgan Stanley and Moody's, contribute to this financial warfare landscape. The 1998 escalation of the financial war engulfed Japan and Russia, worsening the global economic situation and even impacting those who initiated the conflict, with Soros reportedly losing billions. This illustrates the immense destructive power of financial warfare.",

These foundations control the media, control subsidies to political organizations, and limit any resistance from the authorities, resulting in a collapse of national order and the downfall of the legally authorized government.

    "text": "New Terror War in Contrast to Traditional Terror War: Due to the limited scale of a traditional terror war, its casualties might well be fewer than the casualties resulting from a conventional war or campaign. Nevertheless, a traditional terror war carries a stronger flavor of violence. Moreover, in terms of its operations, a traditional terror war is never bound by any of the traditional rules of the society at large. From a military standpoint, then, the traditional terror war is characterized by the use of limited resources to fight an unlimited war. This characteristic invariably puts national forces in an extremely unfavorable position even before war breaks out, since national forces must always conduct themselves according to certain rules and therefore are only able to use their unlimited resources to fight a limited war. This explains how a terrorist organization made up of just a few inexperienced members who are still wet behind the ears can nevertheless give a mighty country like the U.S. headaches, and also why \"using a sledgehammer to kill an ant\" often proves ineffective. The most recent proof is the case of the two explosions that occurred simultaneously at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. The advent of bin Ladin-style terrorism has deepened the impression that a national force, no matter how powerful, will find it difficult to gain the upper hand in a game that has no rules. Even if a country turns itself into a terrorist element, as the Americans are now in the process of doing, it will not necessarily be able to achieve success.",

This affair put people on notice that modern biochemical technology had already forged a lethal weapon for those terrorists who would try to carry out the mass destruction of humanity. In contradistinction to masked killers that rely on the indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people to produce terror, the \"Falange Armed Forces\" group in Italy is a completely different class of high-tech terrorist organization. Its goals are explicit and the means that it employs are extraordinary. It specializes in breaking into the computer networks of banks and news organizations, stealing stored data, deleting programs, and disseminating disinformation. These are classic terrorist operations directed against networks and the media.

Such means and methods include psychological warfare (spreading rumors to intimidate the enemy and break down his will); smuggling warfare (throwing markets into confusion and attacking economic order); media warfare (manipulating what people see and hear in order to lead public opinion along); drug warfare (obtaining sudden and huge illicit profits by spreading disaster in other countries); network warfare (venturing out in secret and concealing one's identity in a type of warfare that is virtually impossible to guard against); technological warfare (creating monopolies by setting standards independently); fabrication warfare (presenting a counterfeit appearance of real strength before the eyes of the enemy); resources warfare (grabbing riches by plundering stores of resources); economic aid warfare (bestowing favor in the open and contriving to control matters in secret); cultural warfare (leading cultural trends along in order to assimilate those with different views); and international law warfare (seizing the earliest opportunity to set up regulations), etc., etc In addition, there are other types of non-military warfare which are too numerous to mention. In this age, when the plethora of new technologies can in turn give rise to a plethora of new means and methods of fighting war, (not to mention the cross-combining and creative use of these means and methods), it would simply be senseless and a waste of effort to list all of the means and methods one by one. What is significant is that all of these warfighting means, along with their corresponding applications, that have entered, are entering, or will enter, the ranks of warfighting means in the service of war, have already begun to quietly change the view of warfare held by all of mankind. Faced with a nearly infinitely diverse array of options to choose from, why do people want to enmesh themselves in a web of their own making and select and use means of warfare that are limited to the realm of the force of arms and military power? Methods that are not characterized by the use of the force of arms, nor by the use of military power, nor even by the presence of casualties and bloodshed, are just as likely to facilitate the successful realization of the war's goals, if not more so. As a matter of course, this prospect has led to revision of the statement that \"war is politics with bloodshed,\" and in turn has also led to a change in the hitherto set view that warfare prosecuted through force of arms is the ultimate means of resolving conflict. Clearly, it is precisely the diversity of the means employed that has enlarged the concept of warfare. Moreover, the enlargement of the concept of warfare has, in turn, resulted in enlargement of the realm of war-related activities. If we confine ourselves to warfare in the narrow sense on the traditional battlefield now, it will very difficult for us to regain our foothold in the future. Any war that breaks out tomorrow or further down the road will be characterized by warfare in the broad sense--a cocktail mixture of warfare prosecuted through the force of arms and warfare that is prosecuted by means other than the force of arms. The goal of this kind of warfare will encompass more than merely \"using means that involve the force of arms to force the enemy to accept one's own will.\" Rather, the goal should be \"to use all means whatsoever--means that involve the force of arms and means that do not involve the force of arms, means that involve military power and means that do not involve military power, means that entail casualties and means that do not entail casualties--to force the enemy to serve one's own interests.\"",

    "text": "\"Did the special nature of the Gulf War...trigger 'a revolution in military affairs' or not? This is ultimately a question of perspective.\" -- Anthony H. Cordesman, Abraham R. Wagner.\nCompared to any war in history, the Gulf War can be considered a major war. More than 300 warships from six carrier groups, 4,000 aircraft, 12,000 tanks and 12,000 armored vehicles, and nearly two million soldiers from more than 30 nations took part in the war. Of the 42-day war, 38 days were air strikes, while the ground war lasted only 100 hours. The U.S.-led multinational force crushed 42 Iraqi divisions, and the Iraqi forces suffered 30,000 casualties and 80,000 prisoners; 3,847 tanks, 1,450 armored vehicles, and 2,917 artillery pieces were destroyed, while the U.S. forces only lost 184 people, but incurred the enormous cost of $61 billion. [1]\nPerhaps because victory was achieved so easily, to this day there are very few people in Uncle Sam's wildly jubilant group that have accurately evaluated the significance of the war. Some hotheads used this to ceaselessly fabricate the myth that the United States was invincible, while some who could still be considered cool-headed -- most of whom were commentators and generals unable to take part in \"Desert Storm\" in a complex and subtle frame of mind -- believed that \"Desert Storm\" was not a typical war [2] and that a war conducted under such ideal conditions cannot serve as a model. When one listens to such talk it smacks somewhat of sour grapes. Actually, viewed from a traditional perspective, \"Desert Storm\" was not a classic war in the typical sense but [since it was a war conducted just as the greatest revolution in military affairs in the history of man to date was arriving it cannot be measured with traditional or even outmoded standards. At a time when new warfare required a new classic, the U.S.-led allied forces created it right on time in the Gulf, and only those who were fettered by the old conventions could not see its classic significance for future warfare. This is because the classics for future warfare can only be born by departing from traditional models. We have no intention of helping the Americans create a myth, but when \"Desert Storm\" unfolded and concluded for all to see, with its many combatant countries, enormous scale, short duration, small number of casualties, and glorious results startling the whole world, who could say that a classic war heralding the arrival of warfare in the age of technical integration-globalization had not opened wide the main front door to the mysterious and strange history of warfare - even though it was still just a classic created by U.S. technology and the U.S. style of fighting? When we attempt to use wars that have already occurred to discuss what constitutes war in the age of technical integration-globalization, only \"Desert Storm\" can provide ready-made examples. At present, in any sense it is still not just the only [example], but the classic [example], and therefore it is the only apple that is worthy of our close analysis [the author returns to the analysis of analyzing an apple later in the chapter].",

    "text": "The \"Overnight\" Alliance\nFrom Saddam's perspective, annexing Kuwait seemed more like a household matter in the extended Arab family compared to the taking of American hostages during the Iranian revolution, and besides, he had given notice ahead of time. However, he overlooked the differences between the two. When Iran took the hostages, it was certainly a slap in the Americans' face, but Iraq had seized the entire West by the throat. Lifelines are naturally more important than face, and the United States had no choice but to take it seriously, while other countries which felt threatened by Iraq also had to take it seriously. In their alliance with the United States, what most of the Arab countries had in mind was rooting out the Islamic heresy represented by Saddam to keep him from damaging their own interests were he to grow stronger unopposed, and it is very difficult to really say that they wanted to extend justice to Kuwait. [3] The common concerns about their interests enabled the United States to weave an allied network to catch Iraq very quickly. The Western powers are already thoroughly familiar with modern international political skills, and the anti-Iraq alliance was assembled under the United Nations banner. The halo of justice successfully dispelled the Arab people's religious complex, so that Saddam was playing the role of a modern-day Saladin, whose plan to launch a \"holy war\" against the Christians fell through. Numerous countries volunteered to be responsible nodes in this alliance network. Although they were unwilling, Germany and Japan finally seemed actually happy to open their purses, and what was more important than providing money was that neither of them lost the opportunity to send their own military personnel, thereby taking a stealthy and symbolic step toward again becoming global powers. Egypt persuaded Libya and Jordan to be neutral in the war and no longer support Iraq, so that Saddam became thoroughly isolated. Even Gorbachev, who wanted to get the Americans' support for his weak position domestically, ultimately tacitly recognized the military strikes of the multinational forces against his old ally. Even powers such as the United States must similarly rely on the support of its allies, and this support was primarily manifested in providing legitimacy for its actions and in logistical support, not in adding so many troops. The reason that President Bush's policies were able to get widespread approval from the American public was to a great extent due to the fact that he had established an international alliance, thereby getting the people to believe that this was not a case of pulling someone else's chestnuts out of the fire, and it was not just the Americans who were funding the war and preparing to have their blood spilled. They went so far as to send the VII Corps from Germany to Saudi Arabia, mobilizing 465 trains, 312 barges, and 119 fleets from four NATO countries. At the same time, Japan also provided the electronics parts urgently needed by U.S. military equipment, and this further demonstrated the increasing reliance of the United States on its allies. In the new age, \"going it alone\" is not only unwise, it is also not a realistic option. [4]",

    "text": "For example, the alliance formed a kind of common need. From the Security Council's Resolution 660 calling for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait to Resolution 678 which authorized the member countries to take any actions, international society broadly identified itself with the alliance which was temporarily cobbled together. One hundred and ten countries took part in the embargo against Iraq, and more than 30 countries took part in the use of force, including numerous Arab countries! Obviously, every country had fully estimated where its interests were prior to this action. The full-scale intervention of the United Nations was not sufficient to make it possible for this fragile and dew-laden spider-web like alliance, which was formed in a very short period of time, to easily withstand the impact of a war. It can be said that, as far as the politicians were concerned, the alliance was only a single high-level meeting following a careful weighing of interests, a single contract signing, or even a verbal promise via a hot-line. However, for the troops carrying out the allied warfare, no detail could be overlooked. To avoid having U.S. soldiers violate Muslim commandments, in addition to stipulating that they must abide strictly by the customs of the country in which they were stationed, the U.S. military even leased a \"Cunard Princess\" yacht and anchored it at sea to provide Western-style amusements for the U.S troops. To prevent the Israelis from retaliating against the \"Scud\" missile attacks and throwing the camp which was assaulting Iraq into disorder, the United States made a tremendous effort to provide the Israelis with air support, taking great pains to look after the alliance network. More profoundly, the appearance of the \"overnight\" alliance brought an era to a close. That is, the age of fixed-form alliances which had begun with the signing of the military alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879. Following the Cold War, the period in which alliances were formed on the basis of ideology faded away, while the approach in which alliances are built on interests rose to primacy. Under the general banner of realpolitik, in which national interests are paramount, any alliance can only be focused more nakedly on interests, and at times they don't even feel like raising the banner of morality. Without a doubt, the alliance phenomenon will continue to exist, but in more cases they will be loose and short-term interest coalitions. Which is also to say that there will no longer be any alliances where only morality, not interests, are involved. Different periods have different interests and goals, and that will be what determines whether there are alliances or not. Increasingly pragmatic and unconstrained by any moral fetters, this is the characteristic feature of modern alliances. All forces are united by a network of interests, and they may be very short-lived but extremely effective. The interest relationships of modern states, as well as among trans-national organizations and even among regional forces have thus begun to be increasingly transitory. As the rock and roll singer Cui Jian sings, \"It's not that I don't understand, it is that this world is rapidly changing.\" Today's mode of ever-changing combinations of force, along with the age of ever-changing technological integration and globalization, has given rise to certain tacit alliances which are by no means fortuitous. Therefore, the \"overnight\" alliance that was formed by the Gulf War formally opened the curtain to a new alliance era. Timely \"Reorganization Act\" The supercilious Americans often engage in actions which cause them to reflect on their mistakes, and this disposition, which would seem to be a contradiction, time and again amazes those who want to witness the presumptuous Americans suffering. At the same time it also enables the Americans to time and again reap considerable benefits. It truly seems as if the Americans are always able to find the key to open the door of the next military action among the lessons of each military action. Struggles between the views and interests of factions in the armed services have been around for a long time, and this is so in every country. The competition by the various armed services in the U.S. military to protect their own interests and strive for glory is well known to all, and they are not equaled in this respect.",

    "text": "Two of the most powerful generals in American warfare history, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Powell and battlefield commander Schwarzkopf, held unprecedented authority during the Gulf War. Powell, as the President's chief military adviser, issued direct orders to the services, bypassing inter-service disputes. Schwarzkopf, free from Pentagon interference, commanded all forces in the Gulf, exercising trans-service authority granted by the \"DOD Reorganization Act.\"  This allowed him to prioritize his \"Left Hook\" strategy, vetoing Marine amphibious landing requests. The Act's successful implementation showcased the contractual mentality of American legal society and established a new command pattern.  This streamlined command structure, reducing levels and implementing true entrusted command, facilitated information sharing among combat units and marked a shift from a tree-structure to a network-structured command system.  The \"Reorganization Act\" was not coincidental but a timely response to the demands of modern warfare. By recombining and overriding dispersed service arm authority with a temporary super-authority focused on specific goals, it ensured battlefield success.  The Act's impact on the U.S. military offers valuable lessons; any nation aspiring to 21st-century victory must choose between \"reorganizing\" or defeat.",

    "text": "The Gulf War, initially envisioned as an opportunity to test the \"Air-Land Battle\" doctrine against Warsaw Pact tank formations, unfolded as a predominantly air campaign. \"Desert Storm,\" a weeks-long air offensive, overshadowed the brief 100-hour ground war (\"Desert Sword\").  This outcome seemingly validated Douhet's airpower theories, but the reality of Gulf air combat far exceeded his vision.  Instead of individual dogfights, the air campaign showcased integrated operations: reconnaissance, early warning, bombing, electronic warfare, and command and control, incorporating space and cyberspace. This marked a significant advancement beyond \"Air-Land Battle,\" but the full implications of integrated operations, extending across ground, sea, air, space, and cyber domains, would only become clear later, leading to the concept of \"omni-dimensional combat.\"  The key to this new form of warfare was the \"air tasking order\" (ATO), a daily 300-page document jointly drafted by the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The ATO, enabling Schwarzkopf to command the allied air forces, directed over 1000 aircraft daily in complex, trans-service, and trans-border air strikes. Despite Navy objections to its \"Air Force-oriented\" nature, the ATO orchestrated history's most massive and complex air campaign and provided a model for future integrated operations. The ATO's success in combining forces across services and nations surpassed the scope of \"Air-Land Battle,\" unknowingly ushering in a new era of warfare.",

    "text": "Despite the innovative use of aircraft carriers at Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto failed to grasp the significance of his own tactics, clinging to the belief in battleships as the decisive naval force.  Similarly, the U.S. Army, despite successfully employing helicopters against Iraqi armored units in the Gulf War, inexplicably reverted to pre-war thinking, prioritizing tanks over helicopters in post-war development.  Helicopters had shown their potential in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and the Falklands, but their opponents in those conflicts were primarily guerrillas and infantry, delaying their challenge to tanks. The Gulf War provided the opportunity for helicopters to prove their capabilities.  The U.S. deployed 1,600 helicopters, a force large enough to constitute a helicopter army.  However, they were initially used as support for armored units, mirroring the French use of tanks in World War II.  Despite being overshadowed by other high-profile weapons systems, helicopters played crucial roles. They destroyed Iraqi early-warning radar, enabling safe passage for bombers, and performed transport, medical evacuation, reconnaissance, and electronic countermeasures missions. They also played a key role in repelling the Iraqi offensive at Khafji.  \"Operation Cobra\" demonstrated the true potential of helicopters. The 101st Airborne Division used over 300 helicopters in a deep penetration leapfrog operation, establishing a forward base 100 kilometers inside Iraq. This base cut off Iraqi escape routes and intercepted fleeing troops, proving the capacity of helicopters for independent large-scale operations. The success of \"Operation Cobra\" forced Schwarzkopf to advance the VII Corps' attack by 15 hours. While General Franks' advance was faster than Gudarian's blitzkriegs, it was criticized as slow due to the comparison with helicopter operations. This highlights the inability of tanks to match the combat pace of helicopters.",

Helicopters, adept at dispersed deployment and concentrated strikes, can be massed for conventional warfare or dispersed for guerrilla warfare. Tanks and helicopters are natural enemies, but the former is outmatched. Even older helicopters like the AH-1 Cobra, not to mention the AH-64 “tank-killer,” destroyed numerous tanks in the Gulf War without sustaining casualties.  Helicopters are the true tank terminators, rising to prominence during the Gulf War and potentially driving tanks from the battlefield.

    "text": "people in the Chinese military, who had been shaken intensely, from the very beginning accepted the views of Western military circles almost completely, and at this point there are quite a few of them who are beginning to rethink the lessons and experiences of the Gulf War. (Conmilit, Nov 1998, No 262) [3] The anti-Saddam alliance in the Arab world was centered around Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Syria. According to General Khalid, who was a commander of the allied forces in \"Desert Storm,\" Iraq posed an enormous threat to them, so \"we have no other choice but to ask for the assistance of friendly forces, particularly the United States.\" (see Desert Warrior, Military Translations Publishing House, p 227) The Americans also took the alliance very seriously. For details, see \"Attachments to the Final Report of the Department of Defense to Congress,\" No 9, \"Alliance Construction, Coordination, and Combat\". [4] Chapter 2 (\"U.S. Military Reliance\") of the research report Military Experiences and Lessons of the Gulf War put out by the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies points out that \"this war demonstrated without a doubt that, whether with regard to politics or logistical support, the U.S. military must rely on friendly states and allies. Without the considerable help of other countries, the United States has no way to carry out any major emergency operation. Other than in small operations, the option of 'going it alone' is basically unworkable, and all diplomatic and defense policy decisions must be based on this understanding.\" (Ibid.). [5] In the research report on the Gulf War done for the House of Representatives by L. Aspin and W. Dickinson, there is high praise for the \"Goldwater - Nichols DOD Reorganization Act,\" writing that \"the Goldwater - Nichols DOD Reorganization Act ensured that the three military services would pull together to fight the same war.\" The report also quoted Secretary of Defense Cheney, saying that the said act \"is the legislation with the most far-reaching impact on the Department of Defense since the 'National Security Act.'\" The generals in the military also had high praise for it, with Navy Admiral Owens, who was formerly vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff terming the \"Goldwater - Nichols DOD Reorganization Act\" \"one of the three great revolutions in military affairs in the United States,\" and \"this act stipulated that in all conflicts, the fight would be conducted using a joint force, and it also clarified that chiefs of staff of the services are no longer combat commanders. The combat commanders are the five theater commanders in chief.\" (Journal of the National Defense University, No 11, 1998, pp 46-47; Conmilit, No 12, 1998, p 24). [6] General Merrill McPeak, who was Air Force chief of staff during the Gulf War, stated that this was \"a war which involved the massive use of air power and a victory achieved by the U.S. and multinational air force units,\" and \"it was also the first war in history in which air power was used to defeat ground forces\" (Air Force Journal (U.S.), May 1991). In a statement prior to the war, his predecessor Michael J. Dugan noted that \"the only way to avoid much bloodshed in a ground war is to use the Air Force.\" Although Dugan was seen to have overstepped his authority and was removed from his post, his views were not at all mistaken.

Aspin's report to the House of Representatives, both give a high assessment of the \"air tasking order,\" holding that \"the air tasking order orchestrated a precisely-planned, integrated air battle.\" [8] According to predictions by Russian and Western military specialists, \"today, the lifespan of a tank as an individual target on the battlefield does not exceed 2-3 minutes, and its lifespan in the open as part of a battalion/company formation is 30-50 minutes.\" This kind of estimate by the experts notwithstanding, most countries still have tanks serving as a main weapon (Soldier (Russia), No 2, 1996). In an article entitled \"The Future of Armored Warfare,\" Ralph Peter states that \"'Flying tanks' are something that people have wanted for a long time, but when one considers the rational use of fuel and the physical and psychological factors during battle, the future need is still for ground systems. Seeing that attack helicopters are already a concentration of the various features that we envisioned for flying tanks, we believe that attack helicopters can complement armored vehicles, but cannot replace them.\" (Parameters, Fall, 1997). [9] Into the Storm: A Study in Command is the book that General Franks wrote after retiring. In it he mentions that the speed with which the VII Corps crossed the desert was not a mistake, and that the criticism from Riyadh was unreasonable. (See Army Times (U.S.), 18 August 1997). [10] See \"Appendix to the Final Report of the Department of Defense to Congress,\" p 522. [11] See \"Appendix to the Final Report of the Department of Defense to Congress,\" Section 19, \"News Reports.\" [12] U.S. Army Field Manual FM100-6, Information Operations, discloses the details of this dramatic event (See pp 68-69). The television news reports on the \"expressway of death\" also had an effect on the overly-early conclusion of the war. (Joint Force Quarterly, Fall-Winter edition, 1997-98). [13] Section 16 of the \"Appendix to the Final Report of the Department of Defense to Congress\" has a special discussion of the issue of \"shared responsibility.\" Contrary to the general belief, the main reason for the U.S. to get their allies to share the costs of the war was not the economic factor, but rather political considerations. In 21st Century Rivalries, Lester Thurow notes that, with regard to the $61 billion that the war cost, \"compared to its annual GDP of six trillion dollars, this expense was hardly worth mentioning. The reason that they wanted those countries which did not send combat personnel to the war to provide fiscal assistance was entirely to convince the U.S. public that the war was not America's alone, but was a joint operation.\" [14] In the magazine Special Operations, Major Jake Sam [as published] reviews the circumstances of the psychological warfare conducted by the 4th Psyops Group during the Gulf War. (See Special Operations, October 1992). In the December 1991 issue of the U.S. military's Journal of Eastern Europe and Middle Eastern Military Affairs there is also an article devoted to psychological warfare during the Gulf War. [15] Air Force chief of staff McPeak advocated the use of \"mixed wings\" made up of several kinds of aircraft to replace the wings made up of just one kind of aircraft. He said that \"if we were to do something else in Saudi Arabia today, we would no longer use wings outfitted with 72 F-16s, but rather a wing made up of some attack airplanes, air defense fighters, jamming aircraft flying outside the air defense zone, \"Wild Weasels,\" and refueling aircraft, etc.... This tactic may be of use when an armed conflict breaks out in some region of the world.\" (Air Force (U.S. journal), February 1991.",

[pp. 87-120 in original] \"Aerial combat was the decisive factor for victory in the war against Iraq... High technology weapons were effectively used, and not only were they the key reason that air and ground troops demonstrated remarkably in combat, they also were the key reason United Nations forces were able keep their casualties and fatalities so low. -- L. Aspen The Gulf War has been the United States military's biggest war catch in the past few decades. When the war had just ended, the American military, members of Congress, and various civic organizations began to carry out a detailed examination of this catch from different points of view. From each of the reports submitted by them and each of the steps subsequently taken by the American military, the tremendous achievements of this examination can be seen. These achievements, moreover, are all extremely valuable to armies and military personnel throughout the world, and there must be no delay in looking at them. Because the nationalistic instincts of the Americans I especially admire are particularly prominent in the long-standing sectarianism that exists among the military services, theoretical blind spots and thought errors are bound to occur in the research, to the extent that a grand warfare investigation has been turned into a blind person trying to size up an elephant. This is a topic that requires our clear re-examination and should not be treated as an excuse to deny its value. But what is it, after all, that Americans want to feel on this big beast? Let's first take a look at it. The Hand Extended Under the Military Fence [Each Armed Service Views War Differently] The fence erected between the U.S. Army and the Navy since the time of the Civil War not only could not be eliminated after the birth of the U.S. Air Force, it instead became the fence separating the three branches of the military. It became the historical chronic disease giving headaches to the President and the Pentagon. Even though there was an effective \"reorganization method\" during the Gulf War, it was not so much a clever way for getting to the root of the problem as it was an expedient measure for bringing about a temporary solution in light of this invisible obstacle. As soon as things had settled down and all the troops had returned home, the doors were closed as before and everyone went their own way. Nevertheless, the high ranking officers at the head of each of the three military branches are certainly not a mediocre generation of stupidly unchanging leaders. The course and outcome expected from the Gulf War at the time when it shocked the whole world also deeply shook these \"Desert Storm\" policymakers. The dumbfounded feelings of having lost an adversary that came as a result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union along with the renewed motivation to establish the United States at the forefront of the new world order made these leaders clearly realize the urgency with which they must reform the armed forces even though they still had no intention of abandoning their prejudices. In view of each of the successive military combat regulations in the 1990s, its starting points have without exception been established on the basis of the many fresh experiences and lessons gained in the Gulf War. Just as \"in the eyes of a thousand people, there are a thousand views,\" what unfolded in the eyes of the three branches of the U.S. military were three different Gulf Wars. In this war, which not only was the last war of old times, but also the inaugural war of modern times, each of the three branches stuck to its own arguments and made every effort to find the evidence most advantageous to its respective branch, hardly realizing that the hand outstretched from behind the military wall could not possibly make heads or tails of such a big elephant as the Gulf War. General Sullivan felt what may have been an inflexible elephant's leg. Though in the eyes of this officer, who at the time of the Gulf War was Assistant Army Chief of Staff and became Chief of Staff only after the war had been over for a few months, the U.S. Army's show was not unremarkable during \"Desert Storm,\" but it certainly could not be called outstanding. Especially when compared with the 38 days of wanton and indiscriminate bombing by the Air Force, four days of a ground warfare clean sweep were unable to bring long expected glory to his armed forces. As someone who intimately knows each key link of the Army, he understood better than anyone wherein lay the crux of these age-old armed services in this landmark war. Even though the U.S. Army's prestige was at its apex when he took his position in \"Desert Storm,\" it turned into an even stronger military force with no one to battle because the Soviet Army had declined and the facts were known. He still farsightedly conveyed, however, prophetic concern for the common people. His greatest concern was that after the tension of the Cold War had suddenly relaxed, the Army structure would exhibit signs of aging, and the politicians who were eager to take part in the dividends of peace would render his Army unable to cross the threshold of the 21st century and preserve its leading position among the armies of the world at the start of the new millennium. Its only way of reviving was to swallow some very strong medicine and carry out a complete remolding of itself. To this end, he advanced tentative plans for building a completely new \"21st century Army\" in which the U.S. Army would be redesigned at every segment,\" from the foxholes to the factories.\" [1] In order to reduce to the greatest possible extent the spread of the effect of bad bureaucratic practices at the various organizational levels, he initially established a \"Louisiana Drill Task Force\" of only 1,100 people under his direct command which used the experience and lessons drawn from the Gulf War to mold this special force often referred to as the \"digitized force\". Additionally, he used its successfully clever maneuverings to take the Army to",

During the entire process, what he did not make clear was that in carrying out such a completely attractive reform there still were the selfish motives of the armed forces hidden within -- the size of the military expenditure pie had shrunk during the past few decades and the piece cut out for the Army was bigger than that of the other military branches. Sullivan's successor, General Reimer, also knew this path well and furthered these reforms on the basis of the blueprints drawn up by his predecessor. Everyone knows that there was great expense in establishing a digitized force, but what made this more shrewd on the part of Sullivan and Reimer was that spending more money was precisely in the interest of acquiring more money. From the \"21st century Army\" to the \"post-2010 Army\" and then to the \"Army of the future,\" it took two steps to make three flights. Using a rather convincing development objective as bait, they attracted the support of Capitol Hill and even more military expenditure to build up the Army. Regarding those politicians who were totally ignorant of military issues and who could not necessarily draw new conclusions and methods for victory in the face of the generals, they mostly feared making fools of themselves, and so none dared make irresponsible remarks to a man who might well be the next president. Actually, no matter how much hubbub the \"digitized force\" caused, the time when anyone will make a final conclusion on the validity of this plan is still far off. What others do not say it that it is just a standard method according to the U.S. Army, like a new weaponry purchase that goes from a proposed requirement of the military to manufacture by the industrial sector and then back to the military for testing, a process than can take as long as 10 years. However, the two rhythms that cannot work together - the \"18 month rule\" for computer development and the \"60 day rule\" for network technology - make it very difficult for the \"digitized force\" to finalize a technology design and establish a military force, thereby turning it into a top spun by the continually changing new technology. In the tired course of dealing with these things, not only is it not known what course to take, nothing is attempted and nothing is accomplished. On this point alone, linking an armed force's fate to the popularity of a certain type of technology, a bold plan with leading characteristics, makes it difficult truly to become the only road marker guiding the Army's future development. Moreover, who now dares state with certainty that in future wars this heavy spending will not result in an electronic Maginot line that is weak because of its excessive dependence on a single technology?",

This has made the smug General McPeak and his successor determined to go even further. They feel that one victory is enough to allow them to take the leading role within the armed forces from this point on. The Air Force, which was molded 50 years ago from an appendage of the Army, is no longer ignorant - it had suddenly grown wings when it touched the elephant in the Gulf. Even though Air Force Chief of Staff Fogleman and Army Chief of Staff Reimer were of the same mind and, having gone through the Gulf War, \"the two branches of the military both had deep understanding of military wartime operations for the 21st century\", \"relations between the Army and the Air Force became strained when the two branches tried to work out details and uses for the lessons gained from the Gulf War.\" The reason is very simple - neither the Air Force, whose wings were growing increasingly strong, nor the Army, which regarded itself as the number one authority under heaven, were willing to hand over the right to control operational command to the other. Those keeping to each respective stand were seemingly justified, but upon surmounting it, one would discover that it was a completely unbeneficial military struggle with the result that each meeting of military leaders to study joint operations became a mere formality and none of the new experience obtained from the Gulf War was fully and effectively shared between them. One need only look at the successive compendia and regulations issued by the Air Force and Army following the end of the war to understand this point.",

    "text": "necessary extravagance in order to win one war. [12] 93 It is just this point that strikes people strangely. However, the Pentagon, which was completely remolded by McNamara in the spirit of commerce, all along could only estimate the innumerable costs of luxury style war. [13] Even the Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives, an organization that frequently conducts verbal warfare with four star generals over money, did not even utter a word regarding the astonishing expenditures of this war. In the respective investigation reports done on the Gulf War, the key effect of high technology weaponry was given almost all equally high appraisals. Secretary of Defense Cheney said \"we lead fully one generation in the area of weapon technology,\" and Congressman Aspen responded \"the benefits demonstrated by high tech weaponry have exceeded our most optimistic estimates.\" If you cannot make out the overtones of my praises and only think they are proud of the American military for having fully realized their war objectives by defeating Iraq with the aid of high technology weapons, then you may think that this however is the typical nonsense spoken by two who have different opinions regarding the ability of technology to bring success, and you also are not yet fully aware of the meaning of American style warfare. What you must know is that this is a nationality that has never been willing to pay the price of life and, moreover, has always vied for victory at all costs. The appearance of high technology weaponry can now satisfy these extravagant hopes of the American people. During the Gulf War, of 500,000 troops, there were only 148 fatalities and 458 wounded. Goals that they long since only dreamt were almost realized -- \"no casualties.\" Ever since the Vietnam War, both the military and American society have been sensitized to human casualties during military operations, almost to the point of morbidity. Reducing casualties and achieving war objectives have become the two equal weights on the American military scale. These common American soldiers who should be on the battlefield have now become the most costly security in war, like precious china bowls that people are afraid to break. All of the opponents who have engaged in battle with the American military have probably mastered the secret of success - if you have no way of defeating this force, you should kill its rank and file soldiers. [14] This point, taken from the U.S. 94 Congressional report's emphasis on \"reducing casualties is the highest objective in formulating the plan,\" can be unequivocally confirmed. \"Pursuit of zero casualties,\" this completely compassionate simple slogan, has actually become the principal motivating factor in creating American style extravagant warfare. Therefore, unchecked use of stealth aircraft, precision ammunition, new tanks, and helicopters, along with long distance attack and blanket bombing - for all of these, weapons are okay as are tricks, so that there are no dual objectives that at the same time carry contradictions - there must be victory without casualties. Warfare framed on this basis can only be like killing a chicken with a bull knife. Its high technology, high investment, high expenditure, and high payback feature, make its requirements for military strategy and combat skill far lower than its requirements for the technological performance of weaponry. Even in successful wars of this dimension, there is not one outstanding battle that is laudable. Compared with the advanced technology that they possess, the American military clearly is technologically stagnant and it is not good at seizing opportunities provided by new technology for new military tactics. Aside from effective use of advanced technological weaponry, we are not sure how much of a disparity exists between the military thought revealed in this war by Americans and other countries. The difference at least cannot be any bigger than that between their weaponry. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that this war was unable to become a masterpiece of military skill. Instead it became, to a great extent, a sumptuous international fair of high technology weapons with the United States as the representative and, as a result, began the spread of the disease of American style war extravagance on a global scale. At the same time as huge amounts of U.S. dollars were trampling Iraq, it also muddled soldiers all over the world for a time. As the world's leading arms dealers, Americans naturally are overjoyed. In the face of this typical war with its advanced technology, dull warfare, and huge spending, just as with a Hollywood movie, with its simple plot, complex special effects, and identical patterns, for a long time after the war people could not understand the main threads of this complicated affair and believed that modern warfare is fought in just this 95 way, leaving those who cannot fight such an extravagant war feeling inadequate. This is why the military forums in every country since the Gulf War are full of a faction yearning for high technology weapons and calling for high technology wars.",

The mission they stipulate for this \"Naval Expeditionary Force\" of one battleship group, one amphibious guard force, and Marine Corps task forces is rapid control of the seas along with combat in coastal regions. What amazes and pleasantly surprises the Navy most is that the amphibious landing equipment needed by this expeditionary force actually obtained Congressional budgetary approval. The partiality that the American politicians have towards the Navy caused the Navy and especially the Marines to be treated with coldness upon their return from the Gulf War. Moreover, after establishing the new Naval system establishment, they were fully confident of occupying the number one position in the American armed forces. The institutional reforms that began after the Gulf War not only adjusted the internal structure of the U.S. military, but also gave impetus to changes in weapons development and tactics, and even had a far-reaching effect on America's national strategy. The small-scale, flexible, and quick \"Expeditionary Force,\" not only used for military attacks but also able to carry out non-warfare tasks, has become the new style of establishment striven for by each military branch as well as a convenient and effective tool in the hands of the U.S. government. We have discovered that, because there are these highly proficient forces and a dangerous, worrisome trend has even been brought about, in handling international affairs the U.S. government has become increasingly fond of using force, makes moves more quickly, and seeks revenge for the smallest grievances. These mutual moves between the armed forces and the government, military and politics, is causing the U.S. military to begin undergoing a deep yet quite possibly disastrous change from system establishment to strategic thinking. Currently, the U.S. Department of Defense is trying to set about organizing the ground, air, and sea expeditionary forces into an integrated \"Allied Task Force.\" This is the newest move in this change. It is still difficult to foresee whether this completely integrated force will drag the U.S. military and even the United States using the same special characteristics into a troublesome mire while nimbly achieving the global mission bestowed on the U.S. government.",

    "text": "When we say that American military theory is behind, it is only behind relative to its advanced military technology. Compared to the servicemen of other countries, the fully technological aspect of Americans' military thinking naturally occupies an insurmountable leading position on the scale of high-tech war in hypothetical future wars. Perhaps the Soviet Arjakov school of thought which was the first to advance the \"new military revolution\" is the only example that has come to light. The \"new military revolution\" is vividly portrayed by the anvil forged in the Gulf War. Not only with the American military but also with servicemen of the whole world, these words have become a blindly ludicrous and popular slogan. It is not a matter requiring great effort due to yearning for the technology of others and following certain slogans. The only ones using a great effort are the Americans. If they want to guarantee their own leading position in a field of military reforms that has already begun and will be completed right away, then the first thing that must be resolved is to eliminate the lag that exists between U.S. military thinking and military technology.  The U.S. military has not yet completed troop withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and has already begun top-to-bottom \"thought exchange transfusion.\" This means that, after military technological reforms are initiated, they will not be able to make up missed lessons of synchronized follow-up for military thought reform. Even though in the final analysis they are also unable to completely break away from their penchant for technology, Americans still are in this unusual encirclement from which they are unable to break free. They have achieved certain results that are equally beneficial for American servicemen as well as servicemen all over the world -- first is formation of the \"joint campaign\" concept, second is forging \"total dimensional warfare\" thinking. Formulation of the \"joint campaign\" originally came from the Number One Joint Publication in November 1991 of the \"United States Armed Forces Joint Operations\" regulations issued by the U.S. Military Joint Conference. This is clearly brimming with new concepts of the Gulf War and has broken through the confines of the popular \"cooperative war\" and \"contractual war\" which are already dated, and even surpassed the \"air/ground integrated battle\" theory seen by Americans as the magic weapon. This regulation exposes the four key elements of the \"joint campaign\" - centralized command, equality of the armed forces, complete unification, and total depth while doing battle. It has made clear for the first time the command control authority of the battle zone unified commander; it has stipulated that any one military branch can take the leading battle role based on different situations; it has expanded \"air/ground integrated battle\" into ground, sea, air, and space integrated battle; and it has emphasized implementation of total depth while doing battle on all fronts. Under the strong impetus of the American Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting, each military branch is successively setting about formulating and unifying mutually matching military regulations in order to make public this new tactic representative of the direction of future wars. [While the services have formally accepted this new concept], in private they still constantly bear in mind the prominent core functions of their branches, and they especially hope to carry out a unification that is clearly demarcated -- that is a unification that makes clear each domain and authority, including regulations, laws, and the differentiation among each other's military honors. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Shalikashvili feels that this does not intend to indicate a compromise between each of the Chiefs of Staff. Adopting the publication called, \"The Plan for a Joint Force in 2010,\" The \"Model\" for Leading the United States Military to Joint Operations, he resolutely plays the part of a modern Moses, leading the U.S. military to dismantle the fences separating the branches of the military, and stride along the difficult path of really bringing about integrated unified operations in the midst of a twilight which brings doubt. Even though it is in the United States, a country which easily propagates and accepts new things, the situation is still far more difficult than Shalikashvili thought. In the wake of his retirement, criticism of the \"joint plan\" for the U.S. military has gradually increased, and skepticism has again gained ground. The Marine Corps believes that they \"must not worship the 'joint [plan]' and stifle relevant future discussions on troop organization,\" that \"the uniformity of the joint [plan] will lead to the loss of the distinctiveness of the armed forces,\" and that this is mutually contrary to the American spirit of \"emphasizing competition and diversification.\" The Air Force tactfully expressed the opinion that the \"2010 unification plan must develop in practice and encourage mutual emulation between the armed services,\" that \"in this era of change and experimentation our thinking must be flexible and cannot become rigid.\" The views of the Navy and the Army in this regard are similar and have plenty of power to destroy Shalikashvili's painstaking efforts in an instant. It is thus evident that it is not only in Eastern reforms that the situation occurs where policies shift with a change of the person in charge. As onlookers, we of course can simply sacrifice a valuable ideology for the narrow benefit of a group. Because the essence of \"joint campaigns\" and \"joint plans\" certainly is not in the confirmation or expropriation of military advantage, rather its intention is to enable each branch of the military to achieve unification of operations within a centralized battleground space, and reduce to the greatest possible extent the negative effects of each branch going its own way. Before a way is found to truly integrate the forces, this is obviously a conceivable tactic of high order. The limitation of this valuable thinking, however, lies in that its starting point and ending point have both fallen onto the level of armed force and have been unable to expand the field of vision of \"joint\" to all of the realms in which humans can produce confrontational behavior. The drawback of this thinking at the very end of the 20th century, a time when an inkling of the broad sense of war has already emerged, is that it appears to attract attention to such an extent that if the concept of \"total dimensional warfare\" had not been set forth in the 1993 U.S. Army publication, The Essentials of War, we would be simply astounded at the \"anemic\" realm of U.S. military thinking.",

It was because of this concept that people saw the possibility of carrying out total positional warfare, and it brought the American Army to find an extremely lofty new name for its war theory -- \"total dimensional warfare.\" What is interesting is that the person in charge of revising the U.S. Army's 1993 publication of The Essentials of War and who displayed a fiercely innovative spirit was General Franks, the man who was criticized by people as an operational conservative when the Navy commanded the Seventh Fleet. If not for later circumstances that changed the direction of thinking of Americans, this commander of the US Army Training and Doctrine Headquarters who first took his post after the war would have brought the history of American military thinking to a historical breakthrough. Although General Franks and the officers who compiled his military regulations were unable to reconcile the tremendous discrepancy between the two sentences, \"implementation of centralized air, ground and sea operations supported by the entire theatre of operations\" and \"mobilization of all mastered methods in each possible operation, both combat and non-combat, so as to resolutely complete any mission assigned at the least price\" in this publication The Essentials of War, they were even less able to discover that, apart from war as a military operation, there still exists the possibility for far vaster non-military war operations. However, it at least pointed out that \"total dimensional warfare\" should possess the special characteristics of \"total depth, total height, total frontage, total time, total frequency, and multiple methods\", and this precisely is the most revolutionary feature of this form of battle that has never been seen in the history of war. It is too bad that the Americans, or more specifically the American Army, discontinued this revolution too early. In one case of dissension, Holder, one-time regimental commander under General Franks who later held the post of Combined Arms Commander of the Army Training and Doctrine Headquarters, strongly cross-examined his superior officer's idea. The then- Lieutenant General Holder already was not the out-and-out vigorous Colonel Holder on the battlefield. This time he was playing the part of the Army mouthpiece for conservative tradition. His view was that \"the belief that non-combat operations has its own set of principles is not welcomed among combat troops and many commanding officers are opposed to differentiating between non-combat operations and the original meaning of military operations.\" After Holder's death, \"the Army had formed a common consensus to handle differentiation of non-combat operations as a wrong practice.\" They believe that if \"non-combat military operations\" are written into the basic regulations, it will weaken the armed forces' trait of emphasis on military affairs and also could lead to confusion in armed forces operations. With the situation going in this direction, General Franks' revolution ended in an unavoidable miscarriage. Under the inspiration of the next commander of the Army Training and Doctrine Headquarters, General Hartzog, General Holder and the editorial group for the 1998 publication of The Essentials of War finally made a major amendment to the new compendium with \"a single principle covering all types of the Army's military operations\" as the fundamental key. Their practice is to no longer distinguish between non-combat operations and general military operations, but to differentiate battle operations into four types -- attack, defense, stabilization, and support -- and return the original manuscript to such responsibilities of non-combat operations as rescue and protection and reassembling the old set of combat operations in order to enable it to put centralized combat principles on the right course and altogether discard the concept of \"total dimensional warfare.\" At face value, this is a move of radical reform and simplification by simply cutting out the superfluous. In reality, however, this is an American edition of poor judgment. At the same time as the theoretical confusion brought by the unripe concept of \"non-combat military operations\" was eliminated, the rather valuable ideological fruits that they had accidentally picked were also abandoned on account of the newly-revised compendium. It appears that in doing the one step forward, two steps back dance, all nationalities are self-taught. Nevertheless, pointing out the U.S. Army's lack of foresight is not equivalent to saying that the \"total dimensional warfare\" theory cannot be criticized. Quite the opposite, there are clear flaws in this theory from both its conceptual denotation and connotation. Indeed, \"total dimensional war's\" understanding of battle is already much broader than any previous military theory, but as far as its innate character is concerned, it still has not escaped the \"military\" category. For example, the \"non-military combat operations\" concept we raised above is much broader in meaning than military combat operations and can at",

    "text": "least be placed along with comparable war realms and patterns outside the field of vision of American servicemen -- it is precisely this large domain that is the area for future servicemen and politicians to develop imagination and creativity -- with the result that it also cannot count as truly meaning \"total dimensional.\" Not to mention the phrase \"total dimensional\" in the U.S. Army, which also has not in the end reconciled how many dimensional spaces are referred to, whether it is that each [space] is an interrelated element of war or it is that there are two simultaneously. This is to say, it still has not been elaborated on and is in a state of chaos. If, however, what total dimension is referring to cannot be reconciled, then the nature of the relationship between each dimension, this original concept with its rich potential, can of course not be fully launched. Actually, there is no one who can launch a war in 360-degree three-dimensional space with time and other non-physical elements of total dimensionality added, and any particular war will always have its particular emphasis and is always launched within a limited dimension as well as terminated within a limited dimension. The only difference is that in the predictable future, military operations will never again be the entire war, rather they are one dimension within the total dimension. Even adding \"non-combat military operations\" as proposed by General Franks cannot count as total dimensionality. Only by adding all \"non-military combat operations\" aside from military operations can total dimensional war's complete significance be realized. What needs to be pointed out is that this ideology has never emerged in all of the theoretical research of the U.S. military since the Gulf War. [29] Even though these concepts of \"non-combat military operations\" and \"total dimensional warfare\" are full of original ideas and are already fairly close to a military ideological revolution that started from the military technology revolution, it can be said that it has already arrived under the last precipice on the rugged mountain path, and the mountain peak of the great revelation is still far away. Here, however, the Americans have stopped, and the American hares who have always been ahead of every other country in the world in military technology and military ideology have begun to gasp for breath. No matter that Sullivan or Franks let out \"running hare\" breaths in so many military theses after the Gulf War, they still cannot leave all the tortoises behind. Perhaps now this is the time when Lieutenant Colonel Lonnie Henley [30] and these Americans who have called into question the capability of other countries' military revolutions should examine their consciences: Why has there not been a revolution?",

According to the requirements of the battle zone command, it is organized from specially designated Air Force troops, ground troops, and special type combat troops and Navy troops.\" [25] For the \"Joint Doctrine for 2010\" put forward in 1996 by the United States joint military meeting, see Joint Force Quarterly, Summer 1996. In the Winter 1996 edition of Joint Force Quarterly, Naval War Commander Johnson and Air Force Chief of Staff Fogleman both expressed support for the \"Joint Doctrine for 2010.\" Army Chief of Staff Reimer also immediately put forward the \"Army Concept for 2010\" in response to the \"Joint Doctrine for 2010.\" [26] See the article, \"Reform Will Not Be Smooth Sailing,\" by Commander Huofuman [transliteration as printed 7202 1133 2581] in the United States Naval Institute Journal, January 1998.

Instead, it is such factors that are intimately related to war as politics, society, technology, combat, and logistics. It is too bad, however, that he still centers on the military axis to look at war and has not formed a breakthrough in war denotation. [30] At the Strategy Conference held by the United States Army War College in April 1996, Army Lieutenant Colonel Lonnie Henley wrote a paper for a report entitled 21st Century China: Strategic Partner... or Opponent. The conclusion was: \"In at least the first 25 years of the next century, China will be unable to carry out a military revolution.\" (See the Foreign Military Data of the Military Science Academy Foreign Military Research Department, June 1997.)",

    "text": "Therefore, soldiers do not have a constant position, water does not have a constant shape, and to be able to attain victory in response to the changes of the enemy is called miraculous. -Sun Zi The direction of warfare is an art similar to a physician seeing a patient. -Fu Le The expression of \"military revolution\" is as fashionable as Jordan's NBA fans. Aside from the appearance of each new thing having its factors of necessity, I am afraid that even more essential is that it is related to Americans being adept at creating fashions. The Americans who have always liked to hold a leading position in the world in terms of various questions are very good at putting pretty packaging on each perspective thing and then afterwards dumping it on the whole world. Even though many nations have been anxious about and resisted the invasion of American culture, yet most have followed suit and completely imitated their views in terms of the issue of the military revolution. The results are not difficult to predict, and so when the Americans catch a cold, the entire world sneezes. Because Perry, the former Secretary of the Department of Defense of the United States, emphasized stealth technology and was renowned as the \"father of the stealth,\" when answering the question, \"what have been the important achievements and theoretical breakthroughs in the military revolution of the United States\" that was posed by a visiting scholar from China, he answered without thinking, \"it is naturally stealth and information technology.\" Perry's answer represented the mainstream view of American military circles -- the military revolution is the revolution in military technology. From the view of those like Perry, it is only necessary to resolve the problem from the technical standpoint of allowing the soldiers in front of the mountain to know \"what was in back of the mountain\" and then this is equivalent to accomplishing this military revolution. [1] Observing, considering, and resolving problems from the point of view of technology is typical American thinking. Its 115 advantages and disadvantages are both very apparent, just like the characters of Americans. This type of idea which equates the technology revolution with the military revolution was displayed through the form of the Gulf War and had a powerful impact and effect on the militaries throughout the world. There were hardly any people who were able to maintain sufficient calm and clarity within this situation, and naturally there could also not be any people who discovered that the misunderstanding begun by the Americans is now causing a misunderstanding by the entire world of a widespread global revolution. The slogan of \"building the military with high technology\" is like a typhoon of the Pacific Ocean, wherein it lands in more and more countries [2], and even China, which is on the western coast of the Pacific, also appears to have splashed up a reverberation during the same period. It cannot be denied that the military technology revolution is the cornerstone of the military revolution, and yet it is unable to be viewed as the entirety of the military revolution, for at best it is the first step of this wild whirlwind entering the course. The highest embodiment and final completion of the military revolution is summed up in the revolution of military thought, for it cannot stay on this mundane level of the transformation of military technology and system formulation. The revolution in military thought is, in the final analysis, a revolution in fighting forms and methods. The revolution of military technology is fine as is the reform of the formulated system, but their final results are based upon changes in fighting forms and methods. Only the completion of this change will be able to signify the maturation of the military revolution. [3] If the revolution of military technology is called the first stage of the military revolution, then we are now in the essentially important second stage of this revolution. Approaching the completion of the revolution of military technology is to a very large degree a foreshadowing of the beginning of the new stage, which also to a very great extent presents problems in carrying out ideological work in the first stage: while the revolution of military technology has allowed one to be able to select measures within a larger range, it has also made it so that one is threatened by these measures within the same range (this is because the 116 monopolizing of one type of technology is far more difficult than inventing a type of technology). These threats have never been like they are today because the measures are diverse and infinitely changing, and this really gives one a feeling of seeing the enemy behind every tree. Any direction, measure, or person always possibly becomes a potential threat to the security of a nation, and aside from being able to clearly sense the existence of the threat, it is very difficult for one to be clear about the direction from which the threat is coming.",

    "text": "For a long time both military people and politicians have become accustomed to employing a certain mode of thinking, that is, the major factor posing a threat to national security is the military power of an enemy state or potential enemy state. However, the wars and major incidents which have occurred during the last ten years of the 20th century have provided to us in a calm and composed fashion proof that the opposite is true: military threats are already often no longer the major factors affecting national security. Even though they are the same ancient territorial disputes, nationality conflicts, religious clashes, and the delineation of spheres of power in human history, and are still the several major agents of people waging war from opposite directions, these traditional factors are increasingly becoming more intertwined with grabbing resources, contending for markets, controlling capital, trade sanctions, and other economic factors, to the extent that they are even becoming secondary to these factors. They comprise a new pattern which threatens the political, economic and military security of a nation or nations. This pattern possibly does not have the slightest military hue viewed from the outside, and thus they have been called by certain observers \"secondary wars\" or \"analogous wars.\" [4] However, the destruction which they do in the areas attacked are absolutely not secondary to pure military wars. In this area, we only need mention the names of lunatics such as George Soros, bin Laden, Escobar, [Chizuo] Matsumoto, and Kevin Mitnick [5]. Perhaps people already have no way of accurately pointing out when it first began that the principal actors starting wars were no longer only those sovereign states, but Japan's Shinrikyo, the Italian Mafia, extremist Muslim terrorist organizations, the Columbian or \"Golden New Moon\" drug cartel, underground 117 figures with malicious intent, financiers who control large amounts of powerful funds, as well as psychologically unbalanced individuals who are fixed on a certain target, have obstinate personalities, and stubborn characters, all of whom can possibly become the creators of a military or non-military war. The weapons used by them can be airplanes, cannons, poison gas, bombs, biochemical agents, as well as computer viruses, net browsers, and financial derivative tools. In a word, all of the new warfare methods and strategic measures which can be provided by all of the new technology may be utilized by these fanatics to carry out all forms of financial attacks, network attacks, media attacks, or terrorist attacks. Most of these attacks are not military actions, and yet they can be completely viewed as or equal to warfare actions which force other nations to satisfy their own interests and demands. These have the same and even greater destructive force than military warfare, and they have already produced serious threats different from the past and in many directions for our comprehensible national security. Given this situation, it is only necessary to broaden the view slightly, wherein we will be able to see that national security based upon regionalism is already outmoded. The major threat to national security is already far from being limited to the military aggression of hostile forces against the natural space of one's country. In terms of the extent of the drop in the national security index, when we compare Thailand and Indonesia, which for several months had currency devaluations of several tens of percentage points and economies near bankruptcy, with Iraq, which suffered the double containment of military attacks and economic boycott, I fear there was not much difference. Even the United States, which is the only superpower which has survived after the Cold War, has also realized that the strongest nation is often the one with the most enemies and the one threatened the most. In the National Defense Reports of the United States for several consecutive fiscal years, aside from listing \"the strong regional nations hostile to American interests\" in order of ten major threats, they also consider \"terrorism, subversive activities and anarchistic conditions which threaten the stability of the federal government, threats to American prosperity and economic growth, illegal drug trade, and international 118 crimes\" as threats to the United States. As a result, they have expanded the multi-spatial search range of possible threats to security. [6] Actually, it is not only the United States but all nations which worship the view of modern sovereignty that have already unconsciously expanded the borders of security to a multiplicity of domains, including politics, economics, material resources, nationalities, religion, culture, networks, geography, environment, and outer space, etc. [7] This type of \"extended domain view\" is a premise for the survival and development of modern sovereign nations as well as for their striving to have influence in the world. By contrast, the view of using national defense as the main target of security for a nation actually seems a bit outmoded, and at the least is quite insufficient. Corresponding to the \"extended domain view\" should be the new security concept of omnibearing inclusion of national interests. What it focuses on is certainly not limited to the issue of national security but rather brings the security needs in many areas including the political security, economic security, cultural security, and information security of the nation into one's own target range. This is a \"large security view\" which raises the traditional territorial domain concept to the view of the interest domain of the nation. The increased load of this type of large security view brings with it complications of the target as well as the means and methods for realizing the target. As a result, the national strategy for ensuring the realization of national security targets, namely, what is generally called grand strategy, also necessitates carrying out adjustments which go beyond military strategies and even political strategies. Such a strategy takes all things into consideration that are involved in each aspect of the security index of the interests of the entire nation, as well as superimposes political (national will, values, and cohesion) and military factors on the economy, culture, foreign relations, technology, environment, natural resources, nationalities, and other parameters before one can draw out a complete \"extended domain\" which superposes both national interests and national security - a large strategic situation map. 119 Anyone who stands in front of this situation map will suddenly have a feeling of lamenting one's smallness before the vast ocean: how can one type of uniform and singular means and method possibly be used to realize such a voluminous and expansive area, such complex and even self- conflicting interests, and such intricate and even mutually repelling targets? For example, how can the military means of \"blood letting politics\" spoken of by Clausewitz be used to resolve the financial crisis of Southeast Asia? Or else how can hackers who come and go like shadows on the Internet be dealt with using the same type of method? The conclusion is quite evident that only possessing a sword to deal with national security on a large visible level of security is no longer sufficient. One log cannot prop up a tottering building. The security vault of a modern national building is far from being able to be supported by the singular power of one",

This new form of warfare encompasses and surpasses all dimensions influencing national security.  Its principle is combination: \"The Way produced the one, the one produced the two, the two produced the three, and the three produced the ten thousand things.\" Combination creates abundance, change, and diversity.  It has expanded the means of modern warfare almost infinitely, changing the traditional definition of warfare conducted with modern weapons.  While increasing options may diminish the impact of individual weapons, it amplifies the concept of warfare itself.  Traditional aspirations of military victory may fall short in a war where the range of battlefield options is vastly expanded.

The report predicted the potential emergence of rival nations by 2015, possibly Russia or China.  This focus on military threats reflects a limited view. Xiaomohan Malike of Australia identified seven trends influencing 21st-century national security: globalized economy and technology, the spread of democracy, polarized international politics, changing international systems and security concepts, and shifting conflict focal points.

This revolution seeks a common operating method for all these changes – a new methodology to address the myriad transformations of future wars.  No one has seen tomorrow's war, but its potential scenarios are widely discussed.  From satellite warfare to submarine pursuits, precision bombs to cruise missiles, the possibilities are vast.

    "text": "direction? [4] This is because the international trend at the end of the 20th century is clearly displayed. As practically existing, the age of wars being a matter of moving weapons and soldiers has still not been translated into history, but as a concept it has already begun to noticeably fall behind. Following the increase in the number of international treaties limiting the arms race and the proliferation of weapons, the United Nations and regional international organizations have enlarged their intervention power in local wars and regional conflicts and relatively decreased the military threat to national security; on the contrary, the springing up of large amounts of new high technology will actually greatly increase the possibility of non- military measures threatening national security, and the international community which is at a loss of what to do upon being confronted with non-military threats with such destruction no less than that of a war at the least lacks necessary and effective limitations. This has objectively accelerated the occurrence of non-military wars, and at the same time it has also resulted in the old concepts and systems of national security being on the brink of collapse. Aside from the increasingly intense terrorist attacks, as well as the hacker wars, financial wars and computer virus wars which will dominate the future, there are also the present various types of \"new concept wars\" to which it is difficult to fix a name and are already sufficient to have the security view of \"resisting the enemy outside of one's national gate\" become something of the past. It is not the case that American military circles have not noticed this advantage of eliminating the enemy against military and non-military threats (we have already referred above to several National Defense Reports for several fiscal years by the Defense Department of the United States), and yet they have pushed the resolution of the latter problem on to the politicians and the Central Intelligence Agency so that they have retreated from the existing all dimensional wars, non-combatant military operations, and other new views. They have tightened up more and more so that they have shrunk into a watching tree hung full with various types of sophisticated weapon fruits waiting alone for a muddle-headed and idiotic rabbit to come and knock into it. However, after Saddam knocked himself dizzy at the bottom of this tree, who else is there who would become the second type of this rabbit? Given their state of mind of \"looking around in the dark with daggers drawn,\" the American soldiers who had lost their opponent due to the collapse of the former Soviet Union are vehemently searching for a reason not to allow themselves to be \"unemployed.\" This is because from the generals to the common soldiers, from the spear of attack to the shield of defense, from major strategies to minor methods of operation, everything that the American military does is done in preparation of gaining victory in a major war. It should not be said that as soon as there were no longer two armies facing off against each other that American military circles and even the American Congress would produce an empty feeling at having lost their goal. The result was that without an enemy, one still had to be created. Therefore, even if it is a tiny area such as Kosovo, they cannot pass up an opportunity to try out their frosty blades.",

    "text": "American military circles, which are digging deeper and deeper into the insoluble problem of either using force or not using any at all, seems, after stretching their own tentacles from war regions to the realm of non-combat military actions, to no longer be willing to extend themselves to a far distance, and are now in the realm of forming non-military warfare. This is possibly owing to a lack of sensitivity to new things and also possibly a result of work habit, and even more so possibly due to limitations in thinking. Regardless of the reason, the American soldier always locks his own field of vision in the range covered by war clouds, and this is an indisputable fact. Even though the United States bears the brunt of being faced with the threat of this type of non- military war and has been the injured party time after time, yet what is surprising is that such a large nation unexpectedly does not have a unified strategy and command structure to deal with the threat. What makes one even more so wonder whether to laugh or cry is that unexpectedly they have 49 departments and offices responsible for anti-terrorist activities, but there is very little coordination and cooperation among them. Other nations are not that much better than the United States in this area. The allocations and basic investment directions of various nations for security needs are still only limited to the military and intelligence and political departments, but there are few and pitiful investments in other directions. Again using the United States as an example, it uses seven billion dollars in funds for anti-terrorism which is only 1/25 of the US$250 billion military expenditure. Regardless of how each nation turns a deaf ear to the pressing threat of non-military warfare, this objective fact is encroaching upon the existence of mankind one step at a time, expanding and spreading based on its own pattern and speed. It is not necessary to point it out as people will discover that when mankind focuses more attention on calling for peace and limiting wars, many of the origins are the things in our peaceful lives which all begin one after another to change into lethal weapons which destroy peace. Even those golden rules and precious precepts which we have always upheld also begin to reveal a contrary tendency and become a means for some nations to be able to launch attacks against other nations or certain organizations and individuals to do so against the entire society. It is similar to [the following scenarios]: when there is a computer then there is a computer virus, and when there is currency there is monetary speculation, freedom of faith and religious extremism and heretical religions, common human rights and national sovereignty, free economics and trade protection, national autonomy and global unification, national enterprises versus transnational corporations, information liberalization and information boundaries, and the sharing of knowledge and the monopoly of technology. It is possible for each field that at any moment tomorrow there will break out a war where different groups of people are fighting at close quarters. The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odor of blood. However, it is war as before, because it accords with the definition of modern warfare: forcing the enemy to satisfy one's own interests. It is very obvious that none of the soldiers in any one nation possesses sufficient mental preparation against this type of new war which completely goes beyond military space. However, this is actually a severe reality which all soldiers must face. The new threats require new national security views, and new security views then necessitate soldiers who first expand their fields of vision prior to expanding their victories. This is a matter of wiping away the long narrow cloud covering of war cast over one's eyes.",

    "text": "The Destruction of Rules and the Domain of Losing Effectiveness As an extreme means for resolving conflicts of survival and interests, war has always been the beast truly tamed by mankind. On the one hand, it is the street cleaner of the ecological chain of society, and on the other hand, it is also the directly-formed threat facing the survival of mankind. How can we order it about without being harmed by it? Over the last several thousand years, and especially in the 20th century, during the intervals between the fires of war, there has always been one matter pursued: making efforts to lock the beast in the cage. It is for this reason that people have formulated innumerable treaties and rules. From the famous Geneva Convention to the United Nations and to the present, they have begun to continuously make various resolutions concerning war, erected one railing after another on the roads of crazy and bloody wars, and have wanted to utilize international laws and regulations to control the harm of war to mankind to the lowest level, from specifically not allowing the use biochemical weapons, not allowing the indiscriminate killing of civilians, not allowing the mistreatment of prisoners, and limiting the use of land mines, etc. to the widespread opposition to the use of military force or the threat of the use of force in handling national relations issues. All of these regulations are gradually becoming accepted by each nation. The most commendable of these is a series of treaties on nuclear non-proliferation, the banning of nuclear testing, bilateral and multilateral reduction of nuclear weapons, etc. which have to date resulted in mankind avoiding entrance into a nuclear winter. At the conclusion of the Cold War, the entire world was overjoyed and considered that a \"fearful peace\" was being entered from this. After Schwartzkopf used a \"storm\" fist to down Saddam on the Gulf fighting stage, President Bush was elated with success: \"The new order of the world has already withstood its first test.\" He was like Chamberlain returning from Munich announcing that mankind will \"get together in a world having the hope of peace.\" What was the result? Like Chamberlain, he also boasted too early. [5] Regardless of whether it is the end of the Cold War or the Gulf War, neither was able to bring about the promises of politicians to the world and the new international order anticipated by all of mankind. The collapse of the polarized world resulted in the beasts of local wars roaring out of their cages one by one drenching the nations and regions of Rwanda, Somalia, Bohei, Chechen, Congo and Kosovo in pools of blood. People had again discovered by this time how the efforts for peace over several thousand years could collapse at one single blow! The appearance of this type of situation is related to the practical attitude embraced by each nation concerning the establishment of international rules. Whether or not each nation acknowledges the rules often depends on whether or not they are beneficial to themselves. Small nations hope to use the rules to protect their own interests, while large nations attempt to utilize the rules to control other nations. When the rules are not in accord with the interests of one's own nation, generally speaking, the breaking of the rules by small nations can be corrected by large nations in the name of enforcers of the law. However, when large nations break the rules, for example the United States enforcing supranational laws in Panama, wherein it grabbed the head of another nation and brought him to be tried in their own nation. Another example is India's disregard of the nuclear test ban treaty, wherein it swallowed up the Himalayan nation of Sikkim, which was a similar action to Iraq swallowing up Kuwait. The international community time and again only sighed in despair, being at a loss of what to do. [6] However, in any matter, there is always its unbeatable rival and natural enemy which is aptly reflected in the Chinese popular saying: brine forms the bean curd, and one thing always overcomes another. In the international community, the participation by large nations, when facing the weak and powerless, in the formulation and the utilization of rules as well as the disregard and even destruction of rules when the rules are not advantageous to them, form a fresh contrast with the springing up of those non-state forces who do not acknowledge any rules and specialize in taking the existing national order as their goal of destruction. As the natural enemy of the international community, and especially large nations, while they threaten the survival of mankind, they also produce minute effects on the balance of society and the ecology. In other words, these non-state forces serve as a type of socially destructive force which both destroys the normal international order and restrains the destruction of the international community by those large nations. For example, there were the warning intrusions of nameless hackers [7] to the web site of the National Defense Ministry of India after it carried out nuclear tests and the terrorist act by the rich Moslem Osama bin Laden because of his dissatisfaction with the presence of the United States in the Middle East. Even though it is still difficult for us now to delineate the positive and negative effects of these actions, yet it can be determined that all of these actions carry irresponsible and destructive characteristics which disregard rules.",

    "text": "The direct result of the destruction of rules is that the domains delineated by visible or invisible boundaries which are acknowledged by the international community lose effectiveness. This is because all principals without national power who employ non-military warfare actions to declare war against the international community all use means that go beyond nations, regions and measures. Visible national boundaries, invisible internet space, international law, national law, behavioral norms, and ethical principles, have absolutely no restraining effects on them. They are not responsible to anyone, nor limited by any rules, and there is no disgrace when it comes to the selection of targets, nor are there any means which are not used. Owing to the surreptitious nature of their movements, they have very strong concealment, create widespread damage because of their extreme behavior, and appear unusually cruel as a result of their indiscriminate attacks on civilians. All of this is also broadcast through real time via continuous coverage by the modern media which very much strengthens the effects of terrorism. When carrying out war with these people, there is no declaration of war, no fixed battlefield, no face- to-face fighting and killing, and in the majority of situations, there will be no gunpowder smoke, gun fire, and spilling of blood. However, the destruction and injuries encountered by the international community are in no way less than those of a military war. Following the gradual fading out of the old terrorists who specialized in kidnapping, assassination, and hijacking, new forces of terrorism quickly appeared and very rapidly filled in the vacuum left by their predecessors. During a short period of over ten years, they transformed from being persons of nameless origins to world public nuisances, with the chief among them being computer hackers. The popularization of personal computers, and especially the formation of the internet, has resulted in the malicious acts of hackers increasingly endangering the existing social order. The hackers we speak of here refer to those network killers who steal information, delete and change files, release viruses, transfer capital, and destroy programs on the network. In order to differentiate them from the non-malicious hackers, we should perhaps call the former \"network bandits\" or \"network tyrants\" which would be much more accurate. Their powers of destroying the present world are shocking. Early, in 1988, when the hackers were first beginning their activities and people did not know anything about their danger, the very small \"worm\" designed by Robert Morris completely paralyzed 6000 computers of the military and civilian computer systems throughout the United States, including the \"Long-Range Planning Office\" of the United States' Department of Defense, the Research Center of the Rand Corporation, and Harvard University.

    "text": "..., this type of event began to appear one after another in the internet connections of nations and regions. Since the United States government began to seriously attack network crimes in 1990, not only have hacker activities not witnessed any decrease, but on the contrary, they have spread globally and have the great force of a forest fire. It is worth noting that following the \"Information Warfare\" ordinance of the American military, which placed enemy nation armies or world opponents on a par with non-approved users, inside personnel, terrorists, non-national organizations, and foreign intelligence organizations as the six sources of network threats, hackers with national or military backgrounds had already begun to reveal clues. [8] This not only greatly strengthened the battle formations of the hackers so that the actions of the disbanded and straggling hackers quickly escalated into national (network tyrant) actions, it also resulted in the increasing enlargement of the internet threat faced by all nations (including those nations with national or military hackers), and it becoming increasingly difficult to predict and guard against. The only thing which could be predicted was that the damage of this type of threat to the large network nation of the United States would certainly be greater than for other nations. Faced with theses prospects, even J. Saiteerdou [as printed 1049 3676 1422 6757], who is responsible for the investigation of computer crimes in the FBI of the United States, said with both self-confidence and worry: \"Give me ten carefully chosen hackers, and within 90 days I would then be able to have this nation lay down its arms and surrender.\" When compared with \"network bandits\" -- these network terrorist hackers -- the terror of the bombs of bin Laden are closer to the traditional terrorism in legacy. However, this does not prevent us from considering him to be within the ranks of new terrorism. This is because aside 134 from the religious or even heterodox teaching background and tendency to oppose control by large nations, from the person of bin Laden himself, we can see the shadows of those old fighters who make loud and empty boasts, are so fond of the limelight, and make use of light weapons and a single method, but in other areas they cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Prior to the major bombings at the American embassies in Nairobi and Dares Salaam which shocked the world, the name of bin Laden was still not listed in the name list of the 30 terrorist organizations published by the International Anti-Terrorist Organization, and even though earlier he already had many murder cases attributed to him, he was only a \"nameless hero\" in the Islamic world, owing to his having not boasted of them. Even after the Americans had already launched cruise missiles at him and issued an arrest warrant, he still repeatedly denied that he was personally connected with the bombing cases. \"Concealing oneself and shielding,\" having weightier results, and unexpectedly gaining an undeserved reputation are perhaps the first major characteristics of the new bin Laden type terrorist organizations. In addition, having learned how to use economic means and taking advantage of the loopholes in the free economics initiated by the West, they set up management-type companies and banks and engage in large-scale drug trafficking and smuggling, the resale of munitions, the printing of large amounts of forged currency, and rely on the contributions of religious followers to attain stable capital resources. [9] On this basis, the tentacles of these new terrorist organizations extend to even wider areas, and the means are also diversified, such as widely using religious and heretical organizations to develop their own media for propaganda, setting up anti-government militia organizations, etc. The easy accomplishment of raising funds guarantees that they will be able to attain and master large amounts of high technology means so that they will be able to kill even more people with great ease. Even though the vast majority of the attacks they have launched to date have been aimed at the rich nations and Western nations, especially the large nations which have the capability to control other nations, yet they are a common threat to the existing order, the destruction of commonly acknowledged rules, and to the international community.",

    "text": "It can be seen from known 135 conditions that these new developing terrorist organizations are merely several black waves turning over within the new global terrorist activities. It can be confirmed that there are even greater turbid currents which we do not know about surging under the water surface. Newly converging into this counter current are the international financial speculators. Although there is still no one at present listing these immaculately dressed and dapper fellows in the ranks of terrorists, yet in terms of their actions and the calamitous consequences they have caused in England, Mexico and Southeast Asia, none of those types, such as the \"bandits\" and bin Laden, can even hold a candle to them. Taking the big financial crocodiles as represented by Soros, on the strength of a daily business volume exceeding US$120 billion in floating capital, he used financial derivative methods as well as free economic regulations to repeatedly change his attitude and play tricks to foment trouble, so as to bring about one financial upheaval after another. As a result, the area of harmed nations gradually enlarged from Southeast Asia to Russia and then to Japan, and finally to Europe and the United States, which were watching from the sidelines and were also unable to escape by sheer luck, so that the existing world financial system and economic order were fundamentally shaken and it had already become another new disaster threatening human society and international security. [10] The typical characteristics of terrorism including being transnational, concealed, without rules, and tremendously destructive, have given us reason to call it financial terrorism. Before the tremendous state apparatus, terrorists and their organizations are perhaps not worth mentioning in terms of numbers of peoples and methods, but in fact there is not one country which dares to look at them lightly. The reason is that this is a group of maniacs which does not act according to the rules. A terrorist organization which possesses nuclear weapons is definitely much more dangerous than a nation with the same nuclear weapons. The creed of bin Laden is \"If I die, then I will also not let others live,\" and therefore, he would then stop at nothing, so that in order to kill over ten Americans he would also drench several thousand innocent people in a pool of blood. Soros's logic is \"I entered the room to steal money because your door was not 136 locked.\" In this way, he does not have to be responsible for destroying the economies of other nations and throwing the political order of others into disarray. For bin Laden who hides under the hills of Islamic fundamentalism, Soros who conceals himself within the forests of free economics, and the computer hackers who hide themselves in the green curtains of networks, no national boundaries exist, and borders also are ineffective. What they want to do is carry out wanton destruction within a regulated sphere and act wildly and run amuck within an unregulated sphere. These new terrorist forces have formed an unprecedented serious challenge to the existing world order, and in turn they have made us doubt to a certain degree the logical production of a fixed order. Perhaps those who check the destruction of rules and those who revise the rules are both necessary. This is because any destruction of rules always brings on new problems which need to be rigorously dealt with. In an age when an old order is about to be removed, those in the lead are frequently those who are the first to destroy the rules or those who are the earliest to adapt to this situation. Naturally, in this respect, the new terrorists have already walked to the head of the international community. The most ideal method of operation for dealing with an enemy who pays no regard to the rules is certainly just being able to break through the rules. Recently, in coming to grips with enemies which appear and disappear in the domain of non-military warfare, the Americans have utilized cruise missiles, the Hong Kong government has used foreign currency reserves and administrative measures, and the British government has broken conventions so as to allow their secret service organizations to \"legally\" assassinate the leaders of foreign nations who they consider to be terrorists. This reveals an updating of the rules and a changing of the methods of operation. However, it also reveals the weaknesses of dullness in thinking and singleness in method. It is said that the Americans have already decided to employ hacking methods to search for and seal up the bank accounts of bin Laden in various nations, so as to basically cut off his source of capital. This is no doubt a breakthrough in method of operation which goes beyond the military domain. However, we must also say that in this area, the new and old terrorists who 137 consistently uphold the principle of resorting to every conceivable means are still the best teachers of each nation's government.",

The US, under Bush, effectively combined military might with media manipulation, economic blockades, and a coalition of international forces to swiftly defeat Iraq. This victory highlighted the importance of integrating diverse elements of power.  The effectiveness of this combined approach starkly contrasted with Iraq's disjointed military deployment.  This principle, where the “winner is the one who combined well,” transcends specific time periods and applies to conflicts throughout history.  Modern warfare has seen a rapid expansion in the means and methods of conflict. The introduction of new elements, from stirrups to computers, constantly reshapes the landscape of war, often leading to military revolutions.  Information technology, cyber warfare, and financial tools further complicate predicting outcomes. While most military leaders unconsciously combine elements on the tactical level, true military geniuses consciously integrate all available means, including non-military ones, to achieve decisive victory.  This conscious combination is becoming increasingly crucial in the technologically integrated age, offering immense potential for future warfare.",

    "text": "Warfare is evolving beyond its traditional form.  Conflicts are increasingly fought in non-traditional domains, like the internet and financial markets.  The enemy, the weapons, and the battlefield are no longer clearly defined.  This new era demands a hybridized approach, combining diverse elements to gain an advantage. This is where “addition” comes in as the method for achieving combination. While seemingly simple, the concept of addition, or combining different elements, is often misunderstood in national security and warfare.  Many focus on combining similar elements (technology with technology, tactics with tactics), but fail to grasp the potential of integrating seemingly disparate elements, like military force with financial warfare or cyberattacks. The true potential lies in combining battlefield and non-battlefield, warfare and non-warfare, military and non-military elements. Examples include combining stealth aircraft with network attacks, nuclear deterrence with financial wars, and even integrating diverse actors like military commanders, financiers, and non-state actors. This expanded view of combination challenges traditional models of war and their underlying logic. The challenge is not to discard traditional models, but to integrate them with new approaches. This requires a shift in military thought, moving beyond a purely military-focused perspective.  This echoes Machiavelli’s forward-thinking approach, which recognized the importance of transcending traditional boundaries.",

    "text": "The American military, despite its technological superiority, has often struggled with this conceptual shift.  Analysts like Steven Maizi and Thomas Kaiweite have highlighted the “frequency bandwidth” problem, where a focus on specific enemy types and conventional warfare leaves the military unprepared for unconventional threats. This narrow focus, exemplified by the Cold War emphasis on conventional armored warfare against the Warsaw Pact, limits the military's ability to adapt to new challenges, such as cyberattacks, terrorism, and asymmetric warfare. These unconventional threats fall outside the traditional “frequency bandwidth” of the American military, exposing its vulnerability to actors using non-military or asymmetric tactics.  Examples include hacker intrusions, the World Trade Center bombing, and attacks by non-state actors like bin Laden. These events underscore the limitations of traditional military thinking and the need for broader perspectives that incorporate non-military elements into strategic planning.  Overcoming these limitations requires a willingness to consider unconventional approaches and integrate new technologies and factors arising from the age of integrated technology. This demands breaking free from the constraints of traditional military doctrine and embracing a more holistic view of warfare.",

In a conflict between two technologically advanced nations, a traditional approach involving large-scale military deployments might prove ineffective.  However, a combined approach could yield a decisive advantage. The attacking nation could initiate a covert financial assault, crippling the enemy's economy. Simultaneously, cyberattacks could paralyze critical infrastructure, creating social chaos and political instability.  These actions would pave the way for a limited military intervention, forcing the enemy to accept unfavorable terms.  This demonstrates how combining financial, cyber, and military elements can achieve victory more efficiently than relying solely on military force. This example highlights the flexibility and adaptability of combined warfare. By creatively combining various elements, nations can tailor their strategies to specific circumstances, maximizing their chances of success.",

    "text": "Any of the above types of methods of operation can be combined with another of the above methods of operation to form a completely new method of operation. [17] Regardless of whether it is intentional or unintentional, the carrying out of combined methods of operation using different methods of operation that go beyond domains and categories has already been applied by many nations in the practice of warfare. For example, the countermeasure used by the Americans against bin Laden is national terrorist warfare + intelligence warfare + financial warfare + network warfare + regulatory warfare; another example is what the NATO nations used to deal with the Southern Alliance Kosovo crisis: deterrence with the use of force + diplomatic warfare (alliance) + regulatory warfare; prior to this, the United Nations under pressure mainly from the United States adopted the methods of operation against Iraq: conventional warfare + diplomatic warfare + sanction warfare + media warfare + psychological warfare + intelligence warfare, etc. We also noticed that the means adopted by the Hong Kong government during the financial security warfare in August of 1998 to deal with financial speculators were: financial warfare + regulatory warfare + psychological warfare + media warfare, and even though they paid a heavy price, yet the results of the war were very good. In addition, the methods for matters, such as the large quantity printing of counterfeit Renminbi in Taiwan, very easily became a warfare measure of financial warfare + smuggling warfare. We can see from these examples the miraculous effects of applying addition-combination in methods of operation. If it is said that, owing to the limitations of technical measures and conditions, those engaged in warfare in the past were still unable to freely combine all factors for winning wars, then today the great explosion of technology led by information technology has already provided us with this type of possibility. Only if we are willing and do not allow subjective intentions to depart from objective laws, will we then be able to arrange the cards in our hand into various types of hands based on need until finally winning the entire game. However, there is no one who can write a guaranteed winning prescription for all future wars. Various types of methods of operation have appeared in the history of human warfare, and most have been forgotten with the passage of history. When examining the reasons, all of these methods of operation were all determined based upon a specific target, and when the target disappeared, then the method of operation also lost its existing value. Methods of operation which truly possess vitality must be an \"empty basket.\" This empty basket only relies upon its thinking and principle of utilizing the non-changing to deal with the myriad changes. The combination of which we speak is just this type of empty basket, an empty basket of military thinking. It is not the same as any of the very strongly directed methods of operation of the past, for only when the basket is filled with specific targets and contents does it begin to have directionality and aim. The key to whether or not victory is won in a war is nowhere else but in what things you are able to pack into this basket. Yue Fei, the military strategist during the Song Dynasty in China, stated when discussing how to employ methods of operation that \"the subtle excellence of application lies in one-mindedness.\" Although this statement sounds very abstruse, yet it is actually the only accurate explanation of the correct application of combination. Only if we understand this point will we then be able to attain a method of operation which goes beyond the multitude of methods of operation. This is then having the myriad methods converge into one. It is even the final stage of methods of operation. Aside from combining the transcendence of being unfettered, you have no way of imagining what other method of operation can transcend the net of combination. The conclusion is thus so simple, and yet it will definitely not arise from a simple brain.",

    "text": "However much is said about combination, we still have to say that it is not enough to focus on combination. It is necessary to further sharpen the focus, to see whether there is any secret closer to the core. Without understanding the secret of how to conduct combination, it will be useless to conduct combination 100 times incompetently. In the history of war, there has never been a victory achieved in a smooth manner. Thus, in all its versions, the book Jun Yu [Military Talk] contains such terms as direction of main attack, main targets of striking, feint attack, feint move, and outflank which entail distinguishing between the main and secondary actions. What is behind such terms is not only consideration of the need to deceive the enemy or the sound use of force. There must be some other reasons. In terms of instinct, all those famous generals who have won countless victories, or obscure people, have all realized the existence of something which perhaps should be called \"rules of victory.\" Those people have also got close to such rules tens of thousands of times. Nevertheless, to this day, no commander or philosopher has ever dared to say: I have found the rules. Not even the job of naming such rules has been completed. But, actually, the rules are hidden in the waves of military practice of mankind. It is proper to say that every classical victory has testified to the rules. However, each time, people either do not want to admit or do not dare to affirm their encounters with rules of victory, but, instead, often attribute the effects of the rules to the favor of some mysterious fate. Many \"belated pronouncement\" works on military history offer arguments which are difficult for people to grasp because the arguments describe the rules' effects in an excessively mysterious manner. But, rules of victory do exist. They are there. Like an invisible man, they accompany every war of mankind. The party to which their golden fingers point will go through the arch of triumph by stepping on the sorrow of the vanquished. However, even the victors in war have not truly seen their real faces. Secretly Conforming to the Rule of the Golden Section \"Everything is a matter of numbers.\" Along this line of thought, the ancient sage Pythagoras [1] unexpectedly encountered a set of mysterious digits: 0.618. As a result, he found the rule of the golden section! [A mathematical formula showing the derivation of the figure 0.618 omitted] In the 2,500 years since then, this formula has been considered by formative artists as the golden rule of aesthetics. As convincingly testified to by the history of arts, almost all artistic works considered masterpieces, whether created in a casual manner or through intentional effort, have all been close to or in accord with this formula in their basic aesthetic features. People had long marveled at the beauty of the Parthenon Temple of ancient Greece, suspecting it to be the creation of a god. With measurement and calculation, it was found that the relationship between its vertical lines and horizontal lines were entirely in accord with the 1:0.618 ratio. In his book Vers Une Architecture, the great modern architect Le Corbusier also established his most important theory of \"basic design scale\" on the basis of the rule of the golden section, a theory which has had profound and extensive influence on architects and architecture in the world.

    "text": "The golden ratio, often observed in art and aesthetics, has a broader application, extending to other fields like mathematics and even warfare. The principle, where the ratio of a smaller part to a larger part is the same as the ratio of the larger part to the whole (approximately 0.618), has been instinctively applied throughout history, even before its formal recognition.  Evidence of this can be found in numerous military campaigns and battles.\n\nExamples include the Battle of Yanlin during the Spring and Autumn Period, where Duke Li of Jin's attack point against the Chu force aligned with the golden section. Similarly, Alexander the Great's attack point at the Battle of Arbela against the Persian forces coincided with this golden point.  The Mongol cavalry formation under Genghis Khan, with a 2:3 ratio of heavy to light cavalry, also demonstrates this principle. This ratio, reflecting the golden section, likely contributed to their formidable power.\n\nEven in the transition from cold weapons to firearms, the golden ratio appears.  King Gustavus of Sweden adjusted the traditional phalanx formation by adding 96 musket-armed soldiers to a squadron of 216 pike-armed and 198 musket-armed soldiers. The resulting ratio again reflects the golden section and significantly emphasized the use of firearms.\n\nNapoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812 offers another example.  His entry into Moscow, a turning point marking the beginning of his decline, occurred at the golden section point in the timeline of his campaign. Similarly, in Operation Barbarossa, the German offensive against the Soviet Union, the Battle of Stalingrad, a major turning point, occurred near the golden section point of the war's timeline.\n\nFinally, in the Gulf War, the extent of Iraqi losses due to aerial bombardment before the ground offensive began also hovered around the golden ratio. These repeated instances suggest that the golden section principle, though seemingly accidental, might have played a subtle yet significant role in shaping these historical events.",

    "text": "In Chinese grammar, the side-principal structure is fundamental.  It divides a sentence into two parts: the modifier (side) and the center word (principal).  The modifier, although seemingly secondary, plays a crucial role in specifying and defining the center word.  For example, in “red apple,” “red” specifies which apple is being referred to, making it distinct from any other apple. Similarly, in “special economic zone,” “economic” provides the defining context for the term “special zone.”\n\nThis side-principal relationship extends beyond grammar into various aspects of reality. The “side” element often acts as the directing element, shaping and guiding the “principal” element.  In a country, the government (side) directs the people (principal). In an army, the command headquarters (side) directs the soldiers (principal). In a nuclear explosion, the means of bombardment (side) trigger the reaction in the uranium or plutonium (principal).  Even in a financial crisis, speculators (side) can trigger the downfall of entire economies (principal).\n\nThis side-principal structure is asymmetrical, reflecting an unbalanced relationship where the side element holds greater influence. This mirrors the golden ratio, where 0.618, the smaller part, is crucial in defining the whole. Both the side-principal structure and the golden ratio emphasize the importance of the seemingly secondary element.  This parallel suggests a potential underlying commonality, where the side element's deviation or influence is key.",

He started by racing Tian Ji's worst horse with the best horse of the king of Qi. After inevitably losing that race, he used his side's middle and best horses to beat the opponent's worst and middle horses, thereby ensuring the two-win advantage necessary for achieving a victory. This method of using the strategy of losing one and winning two (directing element) to win the overall game (principal element) can be viewed as having a typical side-principal structure. The result of winning two of three games conformed entirely to the golden ratio of 2:3. Here, we are seeing the perfect confluence and unity of the two rules: The golden rule = the side-principal rule. Finding a rule is both the end and the beginning of studying an issue. As long as we believe that something called the side-principal rule can be seen in the functioning of all things, we should also believe that this rule, like the rule of the golden section, will not leave the military sphere untouched.",

    "text": "Facts are indeed so. The Changshao battle between Qi and Lu: As the two forces confronted each other on the battlefield, the Qi force was very aggressive, but the Lu force remained motionless. The Qi force attacked three times with three rounds of drum beating but failed to unsettle the front of the Lu force, resulting in an obvious decline in momentum. The Lu force took the opportunity to launch a counterattack, achieving a complete victory. After the battle, the advisor Cao Gui revealed the reason for Qi's defeat and Lu's victory in this battle: The enemy force \"had a great momentum at the first round of drum beating, had a weaker momentum at the second round, and was exhausted at the third round. As the enemy force was exhausted, while our force had full vigor, our force prevailed.\" The entire process of the battle can be divided into five phases: the Qi force's first round of drum beating--the Qi force's second round of drum beating--the Qi force's third round of drum beating--the Lu force's counterattack--the Lu force's chase. From the first to third phases, Cao Gui adopted the strategy of avoiding the enemy's attack, so that the Qi force quickly passed the golden point of its attack power without achieving any results. Meanwhile the Lu force precisely selected this point as the time of counterattack, thereby fully testifying to the rule of the golden section on the battlefield 2,700 years ago (3:5 approximately equals 0.618).\nHannibal thought in the exactly same way as Cao Gui during the Cannae battle. As Cao Gui did, he understood the secret of declining attack power of enemy forces. Thus, unusually, he deployed the weakest force from Gaul and Spanish infantry at the center of the front where the best force should have been deployed, letting such weak forces to bear attacks from Roman forces. As such forces were unable to withstand the attacks, there gradually emerged a crescent-shaped indentation. Whether this curve was created intentionally by Hannibal or accidentally, it became a huge buffer for absorbing the attack power of the Roman forces. As this strong power gradually weakened because of the lengthening of the front and came to the low point of its momentum at the time of approaching the bottom part of the Carthaginian front, the Carthaginians, who were inferior in overall strength but superior in cavalry force, quickly launched their flanking cavalry forces to complete the encirclement of the Roman forces, thus turning Cannae into a killing field for killing 70,000 people.",

    "section": "Modern applications of the side-principal rule",
    "text": "This point has been perhaps even more prominent in modern warfare. During the Second World War, the entire German operation of attacking France was immersed in the pith of the two rules that we discussed. Such moves as changing tanks from being subordinate to infantry to being the main battle weapons, using blitzkrieg as the main operational doctrine on the basis of discarding First World War practices, and selecting the Ardennes mountains as the main direction of attack of the German forces, an action which surprised not only the enemy but also conceptually obsolete old generals at the German high command, must have seemed to be unorthodox and had a prominent character of deviation toward the side element. It was this deviation character that led to the fundamental change in military thinking of the entire German military and also made Schlieffen's dream of \"sweeping across the English Channel\" a nightmare for the British at Dunkirk. Before that time, who would have thought that the blueprint of this miracle would come from the hands of two relatively low-level officers--Manstein and Guderian?\nDuring the same world war, there was also the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which was similar to the operation of attacking France, an operation with a prominent side-principal tendency. Isoroko Yamamoto used aircraft carriers in the same way Guderian used tanks. Conceptually, Yamamoto still viewed battleships as the main force for decisive naval battles in the future, but sensitively and correctly selected aircraft carriers and their carrier-borne aircraft as the principal weapons for operations against the U.S. Navy. More interestingly, he did not carry out frontal attacks on the long Pacific coast of the continental United States when launching attacks on the Americans. At the same time, he fully considered the attack radius of his joint fleet, that is, the optimal location that his fist was capable of hitting. Thus he selected, as the point of attack, Hawaii which, while being of critical importance to controlling the entire Pacific Ocean, the Americans refused to believe to be the point of attack even after receiving intelligence before the operation. As should be pointed out, this believer in decisive naval battles chose a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, instead of a naval battle dreamed about by him all the time, in the first major battle bearing on the future course of the war. Consequently, he won a victory with surprising moves by hitting side targets.",

    "section": "The Essence and Manifestations of the Side-Principal Rule",
    "text": "With the analysis above, we should understand that neither the rule of the golden section nor the side-principal rule should be understood literally in a narrow manner; instead it is necessary to grasp their essence. A rapidly changing battlefield will give any military leader or commander neither adequate time nor adequate information for carefully determining the point of the golden section or the degree of deviation toward the side element. Even the two core elements of the two rules, 0.618 and \"deviation toward the side element,\" are not constants in a mathematical sense. Rather, they represent the thousands of manifestations of the god of victory in ever-changing courses of wars, battlefields, and war situations. It is sometimes manifested in the selection of means. For instance, during the Gulf War, Schwartzkopf used aerial bombings as the dominant means, while using as supporting forces the army and the navy which had always been the main combat forces. It is sometimes manifested in the selection of tactics. For instance, Donitz changed ship-to-ship naval warfare into submarines' attacks on merchant ships; this \"Wolfpack\" tactic posed a much greater threat to Britain than naval battles. It is sometimes manifested in the selection of weapons. For instance, Napoleon's artillery, Guderian's tanks, Yamamoto's aircraft carriers, and the precision ammunition used in Operation Gold Coast were all main weapons which were able to shift the balance in war. It is sometimes manifested in the selection of the point of attack. For instance, during the Trafalgar naval battle, Nelson wisely selected the rear portion, instead of the forward portion, of the French fleet as the main point of attack, thereby producing a naval war victory, which would lead to the birth of a maritime empire. [13] It is sometimes manifested in the selection of opportunities of fighting, For instance, in the Fourth Middle East War, Sadat selected 6 October, in the month of Ramadan for Muslims, as the D-day for Egyptian forces' crossing of the Suez Canal, and launched the attack in the afternoon when sunlight, going from west to east, was directed at the pupils of the Israeli's eyes, thereby demolishing the myth of Israeli invincibility. [14] It is sometimes manifested in the uneven deployment of forces. For instance, before the First World War, the German High Command formulated the Schlieffen Plan for invading France, planning the bold move of deploying 53 of the 72 German divisions on the right flank to be used as the main attacking force and deploying the remaining 19 divisions along the long frontlines of the left flank and the center. In this way, the sand-table exercise became the most famous war plan in history which was never implemented. It is sometimes manifested in the use of stratagem. For instance, in 260 BC, there was a rivalry between Qin and Zhao. The Zhaoxiang King of Qin was not in a hurry to have a decisive battle with the enemy, and adopted Fan Sui's advice, first attacking Shangdang in Han to deprive Zhao of its backing. Then he faked a willingness to negotiate a peace, and, as a result, the lords stopped giving assistance to Zhao. He used the stratagem of sowing discord, and, as a result, the king of Zhao dismissed General Lian Po and appointed armchair strategist Zhao Kuo as commander. As a consequence, the Zhao force was defeated at Changping. Qin's victory and Zhao's defeat in this battle should be, more properly, be attributed to Fan Sui's stratagem, rather than to the Qin force's powerfulness. [15]",

    "text": "We should also pay focused attention to and study another phenomenon, that is, that more and more countries are looking beyond the military sphere when handling important issues such as political, economic, and national security issues. They use other means to supplement, enrich, or even replace military means, so as to achieve objectives which cannot be achieved by military force alone. This has been the most important episode of the side element's modifying the principal element in relation to war on the basis of a conception of war. At the same time, this also indicates that in future wars there will be increasingly frequent occurrences of the side-principal structure formed by the military means and other means. All the selections discussed above had the character of \"deviation toward the side element.\" Like the rule of the golden section, the side-principal rule is opposed to all forms of parallel placement, balance, symmetry, being all-encompassing, and smoothness, but, instead, advocates using the sword to cut the side. Only by avoiding frontal collisions, will it be possible for your sword to cut apart things without being damaged. This is the most basic grammar of victory for the ancient article of war. If we call the rule of the golden section in the sphere of art the rule of aesthetics, then why do we not also call the side-principal rule--its mirror image in the military sphere--the rule of victory?",

    "section": "The Dominant Element and the Whole: Understanding the Side-Principal Structure",
    "text": "The Dominant Element and the Whole Thing: the Essence of the Side-Principal Structure Among the many internal elements comprising a thing, there must be a certain element which assumes a prominent or dominant position among all the elements. If the relationship between this element and the other elements is harmonious and perfect, it will be in accord with the 0.618:1 formula in some places and, also, in accord with the side-principal rule. For, here, \"all the elements\" constitute the main body, that is, the principal element; the \"certain element\" serves as the directing element and is thus the side element. Once an object has acquired specific purposefulness, the side element and the principal element will form a dominant-subordinate relationship. When two bulls fight, the bulls constitute the principal element, while the horns constitute the side element. When two swords are pitted against each other, the swords constitute the principal element, while the edges constitute the side element. It is very clear which is dominant and which is subordinate. When the purpose is changed, a new dominant element will emerge and replace the old dominant element and form a new side-principal relationship with all the existing elements. Grasping the relationship between the dominant element and all the elements in an object is tantamount to grasping the essence of the rule of the golden section and the side-principal rule. On the basis of such an understanding, we can quickly establish five most important relationships among all the complex relationships of war: the dominant weapons and all the weapons; the dominant means and all the means; the dominant force and all the forces; the dominant direction and all the directions; and the dominant sphere and all the spheres. The relationship between the five dominant elements and all the elements in the five areas basically represent the side-principal relationship which exists in wars in a widespread manner. Take again the example of the Gulf War. In Operation Desert Storm, the dominant weapons used by the Allied forces were stealth aircraft, cruise missiles, and precision bombs, with all other weapons playing a subordinate role. The dominant means was the 38 consecutive days of aerial bombardment, with other means playing a supplemental role. The dominant force was the air force, with all other forces playing a supporting role. The dominant direction was to hit the Republican Guards as the target of focused attacks, with all other battlefield targets serving as secondary targets. The dominant sphere was the military sphere, with all other spheres providing comprehensive support in the forms of economic sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and media offensives.",

    "text": "As we know, all countries' war resources are limited. Even such a powerful country as the United States still has to continually think about cost-effectiveness (the principal of the \"least consumption of energy\") and how to fight wars in a more marvelous way and to produce more splendid war results. Therefore, it is very necessary for any country to use and allocate war resources in a sound and strategic manner. This will require finding a correct method, that is, the issue of how to consciously apply the side-principal rule. In fact, many countries have already subconsciously applied this rule.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, Russia's military capability has declined continually. It has not only lost its superpower position of confronting the U.S. forces, but has even found it difficult to maintain national security. Under such circumstances, the Russian high command has adjusted its future strategy, making tactical, or even strategic, nuclear weapons the dominant weapons of first choice if a war is launched against Russia. On the basis of this decision, it has also adjusted the distribution of conventional weapons and nuclear weapons.\n\nContrary to Russia, being the only superpower in the world, the U.S. Armed Forces have established as their new strategic objectives for the three services a \"comprehensively superior\" (army), a (navy) \"moving from sea to land,\" and a \"globally engaged\" (air force).\" On that basis, digitized equipment, new types of amphibious attack vessels, and long-range stealth aircraft have been selected as a new generation of weapons, which appear to be replacing contemporary trump cards like tanks of the M-1 series, aircraft carriers, and F-16 fighters as the dominant weapons in the U.S. arsenal.\n\nAs can be seen in the strategic adjustments made by Russia and the United States in regard to their respective dominant weapons, it seems that the practice of selecting the dominant weapons on the basis of the magnitude of destructive power is obsolete. As far as the selection of the dominant weapons is concerned, the destructive power of weapons is but one of many items of technical performance of weapons. What is more important than technical performance is the basic consideration of the war aim, operational objectives, and security environment. Thus, the dominant weapons should be the most effective weapons for accomplishing the above-mentioned goals. Furthermore, it is necessary to have them organically combined with other weapons, so as to formulate the dominant element of a complete arms system. Under conditions of modern technology, dominant weapons are no longer individual weapons, but \"systems of weapons,\" which are also components of larger systems.\n\nThe emergence of a lot of high and new technology and the continual adjustment of war aims have provided enough space for the selection of dominant weapons and the combination of dominant weapons with other weapons, and have, at the same time, also made the dominant-subordinate relationship between dominant weapons and the other weapons even more complicated. The same factors are also affecting the use of the means of war. It is becoming obsolete to automatically consider military action the dominant means and the other means supporting means in war. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, the military means will be only one of all the available means in wars such as one of fighting terrorist organizations of the bin Laden category. A more effective means that can strike at bin Laden in a destructive way is perhaps not the cruise missile, but a financial suffocation war carried out on the Internet.",

    "text": "As means have become more complicated, there has emerged a consequence that is unexpected to all soldiers: the civilianization of war. Therefore, the issue of the relationship between the dominant force and all forces under discussion here also encompasses the issue of degree of participation of the entire population in war, in addition to the deployment, allocation, and use of military forces in combat operations. As professional soldiers' war or quasi-war activities have increasingly become an important factor affecting national security, the issue as to which constitute the dominant force in future wars, an issue which has never been a question, has become a question worldwide. For example, the incidents of attacks conducted by \"web rascals\" on the network centers of the U.S. Defense Department and the Indian Defense Ministry were evidence in this regard.\n\nWhether an action is a pure war action, a nonwar military action, or a nonmilitary war action, any action of a combat nature will entail an issue of how to accurately select the main direction of operation and the main point of attack, that is, to determine your main orientation in view of all the factors of the war concerned, the battlefields, and the battle fronts. This is the most difficult issue even for all those commanders who are in control of good weapons, a multitude of means, and sufficient manpower. However, Alexander, Hannibal, Nelson, and Nimitz as well as Sun Wu and Sun Bin of ancient China were good at selecting main directions of attack which would surprise enemy forces completely. Liddle Hart also noted this point. He referred to the approach of selecting the line of least resistance and the direction of action least expected by the enemy as the \"indirect strategy.\"\n\nAs the arena of war has expanded, encompassing the political, economic, diplomatic, cultural, and psychological spheres, in addition to the land, sea, air, space, and electronics spheres, the interactions among all factors have made it difficult for the military sphere to serve as the automatic dominant sphere in every war. War will be conducted in nonwar spheres. This notion sounds strange and is difficult to accept, but more and more signs indicate that this is the trend. In fact, even in ancient times, war was not always confined to one single sphere. Lian Xiangru's diplomatic battle of \"returning the jade in an undamaged condition to Zhao\" and the virtual war conducted by Mo Zi and Gongshu Ban were classical examples of winning or precluding a war with nonmilitary actions. This method of resolving the problem of war through actions in multiple spheres should give insights to people today. The era of comprehensive use of highly developed technologies has provided us with much greater room for applying wisdom and means than ancient people, so that people's dream of winning military victories in nonmilitary spheres and winning wars with nonwar means can now become reality.",

    "text": "If we want to have victory in future wars, we must be fully prepared intellectually for this scenario, that is, to be ready to carry out a war which, affecting all areas of life of the countries involved, may be conducted in a sphere not dominated by military actions. It is now still unknown what weapons, means, and personnel such wars will use and in what direction and sphere such wars will be conducted. What is known is one point, that is, that whatever the mode of warfare, victory always belongs to the side which correctly uses the side-principal rule to grasp the relationship between the \"dominant\" and the \"whole.\"\n\nWar is the most difficult to explain and understand. It needs support from technology, but technology cannot substitute for morale and stratagem; it needs artistic inspiration, but rejects romanticism and sentimentalism; it needs mathematical precision, but precision can sometimes render it mechanical and rigid; it needs philosophical abstraction, but pure thinking does not help to seize short-lived opportunities amid iron and fire. This is no formula of war. No one dares to arrogantly claim to have the perfect method in the sphere of war. No one has ever been able to use one method to win all wars. But, it does not mean that there are no rules regarding war. A few people have had their names listed in the roster of ever-victorious generals because they have discovered and grasped rules of victory. Those names testify to the existence of rules of victory, but no one has revealed the secret.\n\nFor a long time—almost as long as the history of war—people have regarded them as flashes of electricity in the brains of gifted commanders, but have seldom realized that they are hidden in bloody fighting characterized by collisions of swords and the smoke of gunpowder. In fact, any rule is like a sheet of paper, and what is important is whether you are able to poke a hole in it. The side-principal rule is just such a sheet of paper. It is both simple and complicated and both fluctuating and stable. As has often happened, a person with a lucky finger sometimes unintentionally pokes a hole in it, and the door of victory opens to him immediately. It is so simple that it can be expressed by a set of digits or a rule of grammar. It is so complicated that you are unable to find an answer even if you are proficient in mathematics and grammar. It is like smoke and is difficult to grasp. It is as constant as a shadow and accompanies every sunrise of victory.",

    "text": "Consequently, we regard the side-principal rule as a principle, but not a theorem. We have taken full account of the relativity of the principle. Relative things should not be applied mechanically and require no precise measurement. Relativity is not absolute whiteness, and thus does not fear black swans. However, through study of the history of war, we have determined that the side-principal rule is a rule of victory, but how it can be used correctly will be an issue for each individual operator to determine in view of the particular circumstances. For the phenomenon of antimony in war has always puzzled every person pursuing victory: those acting against the laws will undoubtedly fail, but those sticking to set practices are also unlike to win.\n\n\"Six multiplied by 6 is 36. There are stratagems in numbers, and there are numbers in stratagems. The yin and the yang are coordinated. Opportunities are there. It is not possible to manufacture opportunities. Manufacturing will not work.\" The \"36 stratagems\" constitute the revealing of the way things work. That is, no matter how many examples of war we can find to demonstrate that the causes of victories involved were in accord with 0.618, the next person who plans a war, battle, or engagement strictly in accordance with the rule of the golden section will almost certainly eat the bitter fruit of defeat. Whether the rule of the golden section or the side-principal rule is involved, the key is to grasp the essence and apply the principle, instead of making mechanical applications, as the legendary Dong Shi emulated the beauty Xi Shi.\n\nIn the famous Rossbach battle and the Luzern battle in European history, the attacking sides in both cases used the Alexander-style \"diagonal attack formation,\" but the results were totally different. In the Rossbach battle, commanders of the French-Austrian force copied the history of war faithfully. They made troop movements and built battle formations right under the eyes of Frederick the Great. The French-Austrian force attempted to use the diagonal formation to attack the left wing of the Prussian force. As a result, it was thoroughly beaten by the Prussian force which made adjustments in deployment in a timely manner. A year later, at Luzern, Frederick again encountered an Austrian force which was three times as large as Frederick's force. But, this time, he performed brilliantly. He also used the diagonal attack formation, but managed to annihilate the Austrian force. It is thought-provoking that the same method of operation produced entirely different results. This incident tells us that there are no method of war which is always right. There are only rules which are always correct. It also tells us that correct rules do not guarantee that there will always be victories; the secret to victory is to correctly apply rules.",

    "text": "Similarly, with regard to the side-principal rule, the emphasis is on using the side element for modifying the principal element, but it is not the case that deviation toward the side-element will always produce a victory. Deviation toward the side element means mainly deviation in terms of lines of thought and essence, instead of deviation in form. For instance, in actual warfare, it is not the case that every time the point of attack should be located at the point of deviation in a 0.618 style in order to be in accord with rules of victory. It is possible that this time, rules of victory call for frontal breakthroughs. Thus, this time, the \"principal\" element is the \"side\" element. This is the nature of war as art. This art element cannot be replaced by mathematics, philosophy or other areas of science and technology. Thus, we are sure that in this sense the military technological revolution cannot replace the revolution in the art of military affairs.\n\nAs should also be indicated, the side-principal principle is unavoidably similar to the \"surprise-non-surprise\" principle advocated by ancient Chinese strategists; nevertheless they are not entirely the same. For, ancient strategists advocated the use of surprise moves and non-surprise moves at different times. As Sun Zi said, \"in fighting, it is necessary to use non-surprise moves to gather strength and to use surprise moves to achieve victory. Fighting entails just surprise and non-surprise moves. There is endless change to the use of surprise and non-surprise moves.\" The side element and the principal element are not two methods which can each be used without the other, but are an expression of an objective law. The most important distinction is the following: It is certainly true that in the history of war the cases of winning with surprise moves have all been marvelous because of their excellent execution, but not all victories have been achieved through surprise moves. There have also been many examples of achieving victories through non-surprise moves. The side-principal principle is different. Through analysis, the trace of the rule of victory can be seen in every victory, whether the victory has been achieved through surprise or non-surprise moves: that is, that the victory is the effect of the side-principal principle demonstrated in either in a \"surprise\" or \"non-surprise\" way.\n\nNo matter how clear we state the side-principal rule or the rule of victory, we can only proceed with the application of the rule in a fuzzy way. Sometimes, being fuzzy is the best way of reaching clarity. For only fuzziness is good for being grasped in an overall manner. This is the Eastern style of thinking. But, in a peculiar way, it has met Occidental wisdom at the golden point of 0.618.",

    "section": "Unrestricted Warfare: Beyond Traditional Military Thinking",
    "text": "They are in the dark: the war will be fought and won in a war beyond the battlefield; the struggle for victory will take place on a battlefield beyond the battlefield.  Even modern military men like Powell, Schwartzkopf, or even Sullivan or Shalikashvili cannot be considered \"modern.\"  A chasm has appeared between traditional soldiers and modern soldiers. This requires a complete military rethink, a leap potentially unachievable for many professional military people. The necessary new method is to create a complete military Machiavelli. Achieve objectives by fair means or foul, that is the most important spiritual legacy of this Italian political thinker of the Renaissance. In the Middle Ages, this represented a breakthrough against romantic chivalry and the declining tradition of knighthood. It meant using means, some possibly comprehensive, without restraint to achieve an objective; this holds for warfare also. Even though Machiavelli was not the earliest source of \"an ideology of going beyond limits\" (China's Han Feizi preceded him), he was its clearest exponent.\n\nThe existence of boundaries is a prerequisite for differentiating objects one from another. In a world where all things are interdependent, the significance of boundaries is merely relative. The expression \"to exceed limits\" means to go beyond things which are called or understood to be boundaries. It does not matter whether they fall into the category of physical, spiritual, or technical, or if they are called \"limits,\" \"defined limits,\" \"constraints,\" \"borders,\" \"rules,\" \"laws,\" \"maximum limits,\" or even \"taboos.\" Speaking in terms of war, this could mean the boundary between the battlefield and what is not the battlefield, between what is a weapon and what is not, between soldier and noncombatant, between state and non-state or supra-state. Possibly it might also include technical, scientific, theoretical, psychological, ethical, traditional, customary, and other sorts of boundaries. In summary, it means all boundaries which restrict warfare to within a specified range.\n\nThe real meaning of the concept of exceeding limits which we propose is, first of all, to transcend ideology. Only secondarily does it mean, when taking action, to transcend limits and boundaries when necessary, when they can be transcended, and select the most appropriate means (including extreme means). It does not mean that extreme means must be selected always and everywhere. When speaking of military people in this technologically integrated era, there are actually more facets to consider now, an abundance of usable resources (meaning all material and non-material resources), so that no matter what limits military people face, there is always a means which can break through those limits, many more means than in the environment from whence Machiavelli came. Thus, the requirements for modern military people with regard to transcending their way of thinking also involve being more thorough.\n\nWe said earlier that combinations were the cocktails in the glasses of the great masters of warfare. But in past wars, the combination of weapons, means, battle arrays, and stratagems was all done within the limits of the military sphere. This narrow sense of the concept of combinations is, of course, very inadequate for today. He who wants to win today's wars, or those of tomorrow, to have victory firmly in his grasp, must \"combine\" all of the resources of war which he has at his disposal and use them as means to prosecute the war. And even this will not be enough. He must combine them according to the demands of the rules of victory. Even this will still not be enough, because the rules of victory cannot guarantee that victory will drop like ripe fruit into a basket. It still needs a skilled hand to pluck it. That hand is the concept of \"going beyond limits,\" surpassing all boundaries and conforming with the laws of victory when conducting warfare with combinations. Thus we obtain a complete concept, a completely new method of warfare called \"modified combined war that goes beyond limits.\"",

But in fact, unlimited surpassing of limits is impossible to achieve. Any surpassing of limits can only be done within certain restrictions. That is, \"going beyond limits\" certainly does not equate to \"no limits,\" only to the expansion of \"limited.\" That is, to go beyond the intrinsic boundaries of a certain area or a certain direction, and to combine opportunities and means in more areas or in more directions, so as to achieve a set objective. This is our definition of \"combined war that goes beyond limits.\"\n\nAs a method of warfare with \"beyond-limits\" as its major feature, its principle is to assemble and blend together more means to resolve a problem in a range wider than the problem itself. For example, when national security is threatened, the answer is not simply a matter of selecting the means to confront the other nation militarily, but rather a matter of dispelling the crisis through the employment of \"supra-national combinations.\"\n\nWe see from history that the nation-state is the highest form of the idea of security.  Nowadays, the significance of the word \"country\" in terms of nationality or geography is no more than a large or small link in the human society of the \"world village.\" Modern countries are affected more and more by regional or world-wide organizations, such as the European Community, ASEAN, OPEC, APEC, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the WTO, and the biggest of them all, the United Nations. Besides these, a large number of multinational organizations and non-state organizations of all shapes and sizes, such as multinational corporations, trade associations, peace and environmental organizations, the Olympic Committee, religious organizations, terrorist organizations, small groups of hackers, etc., dart from left and right into a country's path. These multinational, non-state, and supra-national organizations together constitute an up and coming worldwide system of power.\n\nPerhaps not many people have noticed, but the factors described above are leading us into an era of transformation in which great power politics are yielding to supra-national politics. The main characteristic of this era is that it is transitional: many indications of it are appearing, and many processes are just now beginning. National power is a main part, and supra-national, multinational, and non-state power is another main part, and the final verdict on which of these will play the main role on the international stage has yet to be delivered. On the one hand, the big powers still play the dominant part.  On the other hand, there are far-sighted big powers which have clearly already begun to borrow the power of supra-national, multinational, and non-state players to redouble and expand their own influence. They realize they cannot achieve their objectives by relying only on their own power. The most recent and most typical example is the use of the euro to unify the European Community.\n\nThe recent direction and the long-range prospect are not clear-cut. Nevertheless, some signs of a trend are evident; that is, the curtain is now slowly falling on the era in which the final decision on victory and defeat is made by way of state vs. state tests of strength. Instead, the curtain is quietly opening on an era in which problems will be resolved and objectives achieved by using supra-national means on a stage larger than the size of a country. In view of this, we list \"supra-national combinations\" as being among the essential factors of warfare that exceeds limits.",

This requires the United States to maintain its overseas involvement, especially in those areas in which the most important interests of the United States are endangered. For example, regarding the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization, the initial idea of its conceptualizer, Australian Prime Minister Hawke, was that it would only include Asian countries, Australia, and New Zealand. However, this idea immediately encountered strong opposition from President Bush, and it was then expanded to include the United States and Canada. At the same time, so as to check the momentum of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, the United States spared no effort in instigating some Asian countries to sign independent agreements with the North American Free Trade Area. Not only did the United States make its way in, it also dragged others out. It might well be said that the United States used a double-combination tactic. What people sense as a closely guarded secret is the attitude and methods of the Americans in dealing with the Asian financial crisis. When the storm erupted, the United States immediately opposed a Japanese proposal to set up an Asian monetary fund. Instead, the United States advocated the implementation of a rescue plan, with strings attached, by way of the International Monetary Fund, of which it is a major shareholder. The implication was that Asian countries should be forced to accept the economic liberalization policy promoted by the United States. For example, when the IMF extended a $57 billion loan to South Korea, it was with the condition that Korea must open up its markets completely and allow American capital the opportunity to buy up Korean enterprises at unreasonably low prices. A demand such as this is armed robbery. It gives the developed countries, with the United States as their leader, the opportunity to gain unrestricted access to another country",

    "text": "Alliances, military exercises, arms control, weapons embargoes, armed blockades, right down to the use of force, these are all without doubt military means.  And although economic assistance, trade sanctions, diplomatic mediation, cultural infiltration, media propaganda, formulating and applying international rules, using United Nations resolutions, etc., belong to different domains such as politics, economics, or diplomacy, statesmen use them more and more now as standard military means. From the angle of methods, philosophical methods, technical methods, mathematical methods, scientific methods, and artistic methods are all used by humanity to bring benefit to itself. However, they can also be used as means in war. Take for example, technology. The emergence and development of information technology, materials technology, space technology, bioengineering technology, and all other new technologies are part of the expanding array of means. Another example is mathematics. There is nowhere in which the influence of mathematical methods is not seen in military terminology such as disposition of forces, base figures [used to plan consumption] of ammunition, calculation of trajectories, probabilities of deaths and woundings, combat radii, and explosive yields. Moreover, philosophical, scientific, and artistic methods are also effective in supporting military wisdom and military action. This is why people often refer to military ideology, military theory, and military practice as military philosophy, military science, and military art.\n\nLiddell Hart [British officer and military theorist] defined the word strategy as \"the art of using military means to achieve political objectives.\" From this we can see that the concept of means covers a lot of territory, on numerous levels, with overlapping functions, and thus it is not an easy concept to grasp. Only by expanding our field of vision and our understanding of means, and grasping the principle that there is nothing which cannot be considered a means, can we avoid the predicament of being confronted with too many difficulties to tackle all at once and being at wit's end when we employ means. During the crisis in 1978 when Iran occupied the U.S. Embassy and took hostages, at first, all the United States thought of was the rash use of military means. Only after these failed did it change its tactics, first freezing Iran's foreign assets, then imposing an arms embargo, and supporting Iraq in the war with Iran. Then it added diplomatic negotiations. When all these channels were used together, the crisis finally came to an end.[18] This shows clearly that in a world of unprecedented complexity, the form and the scope of application of means is also in a state of continuous change, and a better means used alone will have no advantage over several means used in combination. Thus, supra-means combinations are becoming extremely necessary. It's a pity that not many countries are aware of this. On the contrary, it is those non-state organizations in pursuit of various interests which are sparing no effort in search of the use of means in combination. For example, the Russian mafia combines assassination, kidnapping for ransom, and hacker attacks against the electronic systems of banks in order to get rich. Some terrorist organizations pursue political objectives by combining means such as throwing bombs, taking hostages, and making raids on networks. To stir up the waters and grope for fish, the likes of Soros combine speculation in currency markets, stock markets, and futures markets. Also they exploit public opinion and create widespread momentum to lure and assemble the \"jumbos\" such as Merrill Lynch, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley and their partners [19] to join forces in the marketplace on a huge scale and wage hair-raising financial wars one after the other. Most of these means are not by their nature military (although they often have a tendency to be violent), but the methods by which they are combined and used certainly do not fail to inspire us as to how to use military or non-military means effectively in war. This is because nowadays, judging the effectiveness of a particular means is not mainly a matter of looking at what category it is in, or at whether or not it conforms to some moral standard. Instead, it mainly involves looking at whether or not it conforms to a certain principle; namely, is it the best way to achieve the desired objective? So long as it conforms to this principle, then it is the best means. Although other factors cannot be totally disregarded, they must fulfill the prerequisite that they be advantageous to achieving the objective. That is, what supra-means combinations must surpass is not other [means], but rather the moral standards or normal principles intrinsic to the means themselves. This is much more difficult and complex than combining certain means with certain other means. We can only shake off taboos and enter an area of free choice of means -- the beyond-limits realm -- if we complete our picture of the concept of beyond-limits. This is because for us, we cannot achieve objectives merely by way of ready-made means. We still need to find the optimum way to achieve objectives, a correct and effective way to employ means. In other words, to find out how to combine different means and create new means to achieve objectives.",

    "text": "For example, in this era of economic integration, if some economically powerful company wants to attack another country's economy while simultaneously attacking its defenses, it cannot rely completely on the use of ready-made means such as economic blockades and trade sanctions, or military threats and arms embargoes. Instead, it must adjust its own financial strategy, use currency revaluation or devaluation as primary, and combine means such as getting the upper hand in public opinion and changing the rules sufficiently to make financial turbulence and economic crisis appear in the targeted country or area, weakening its overall power, including its military strength. In the Southeast Asian financial crisis we see a case in which the crisis led to a lowering of the temperature of the arms race in that region. Thus we can see the possibility that this will happen, although in this case it was not caused by some big country intentionally changing the value of its own currency. Even a quasi-world power like China already has the power to jolt the world economy just by changing its own economic policies. If China were a selfish country, and had gone back on its word in 1998 and let the Renminbi lose value, no doubt this would have added to the misfortunes of the economies of Asia. It would also have induced a cataclysm in the world's capital markets, with the result that even the world's number one debtor nation, a country which relies on the inflow of foreign capital to support its economic prosperity, the United States, would definitely have suffered heavy economic losses. Such an outcome would certainly be better than a military strike. The reality of information exchanges and intertwining interests is continually broadening the meaning of warfare. Also, any country which plays a decisive role has various capabilities to threaten other countries, and not just with military means. The use of means singly will produce less and less effect. The advantages of the combined use of various kinds of means will become more and more evident. This has opened the door wide for supra-means combinations, and for the employment of these sorts of combinations in warfare or quasi-war actions. Supra-Tier Combinations [Chao Taijie Zuhe 6389 0669 7132 4809 0678] [Combine All Levels of Conflict Into Each Campaign] When a war becomes a phase of history, the course of the war emerges little by little, like the gradual cooling of molten steel. From the earliest small-scale local fights, to campaigns consisting of interrelated battles on all sides, to wars consisting of a few or even several campaigns, and finally to the possibility that a war could spread and become a great intercontinental or worldwide war; in this way a war proceeds tier by tier up invisible steps. Possibly it might also go back down. On each level are strewn moaning casualties and the bodies of the dead, the muzzles of the victor's guns raised high and the rifles of the defeated lying abandoned, as well as many plans and stratagems, either wise or stupid. If we start with the last page of a war's history and go backwards chapter by chapter, we will discover that the entire process is an accumulation, and all of the outcomes resulted from this accumulation. Victory is an accumulation, and so is defeat. In terms of the two combatant sides, they followed a single road to their outcomes. The only difference is to be seen in whether one ascended the stairs and went higher or ascended the stairs and fell on them. Leaps and sudden changes all occur when you set foot on the final step. This is practically a rule. But rules must be respected. To evade or break the rules requires prudence. The issue is that what we are thinking about is precisely how to evade or break such rules. We do not believe that all wars must gradually progress in level-by-level sequence, accumulating until a fateful moment of destiny is reached. We believe that moment is something which can be created. Finding a way by which we can continuously create that moment and not wait for the accumulation, and then fixing that method as a kind of strategy, that is the thing which we should do. Of course, we know that one battle does not constitute a war, any more than one soldier constitutes an army. But this is not the issue we want to talk about. Our issue is how to use some method to break down all the stages, and link up and assemble these stages at will. For example, take a fight or an action on the tactical level, and combine it directly with an action on the level of wars, or on the strategic level. We could change warfare into something like a dragon with interchangeable limbs, torsos, and heads, which we could put together as we like, and which could swing freely in any direction. This is what is meant by the method \"supra-tier combinations.\" A level is also a kind of restriction, similar to national boundaries, territorial boundaries, and the boundaries around means. All are boundaries which must be surpassed in the actual practice of supra-combinations warfare.",

    "text": "Herman Kahn divided the threshold to nuclear war into a number of stages. Stages like them exist in other forms of warfare as well. But if we truly follow Kahn's line of thought, we discover that the delineation of his 44 levels is excessively fine, and is not easy to work with. [20] Also, because he focused more on dividing warfare into stages based on intensity, he lacked penetrating insight into the essential nature of the levels of war. In our view, if the cuts dividing the levels of war are made based on the two aspects of the scale of war and the corresponding methods of war, then the levels of war are greatly simplified, and division into four levels is sufficient. On this point, our views and those of some American military analysts are basically the same, and differ only in their wording. Our specific delineation is as follows:\n\nGrand War - War Policy [dazhan - zhance 1129 2069 - 2069 4595]\nWar - Strategy [zhanzheng - zhanlue 2069 3630 - 2069 3970]\nCampaigns - Operational Art [zhanyi - zhanyi 2069 1763 - 2069 5669]\nBattles - Tactics [zhandou - zhanshu 2069 2435 - 2069 2611]\n\nThe first level is \"grand war - war policy.\" In terms of scale, this is military and non-military actions of warfare with supra-national as the upper limit and the nation as the lower limit. The function corresponding to it is \"war policy,\" which is what Collins calls \"grand strategy.\" We call it \"war policy\" because strategy at this level mainly involves the political stratagems for warfare. The second level is \"war - strategy.\" National level military actions include non-military actions of warfare on this level. The function corresponding to it is \"strategy,\" that is, a country's military stratagems or stratagems of war. The third level is \"campaigns - operational art.\" In terms of scale, this refers to combat actions lower than a war but higher than battles. The function corresponding to this level has no title, and often the concept of \"campaigning\" is used indiscriminately. Obviously this obscures the implications of the scope and methods of combat operations, and so we have chosen the term \"operational art [ zhanyi; or war arts or art of warfare]. The selection of the positioning of this level, lower than strategy and higher than tactics, would require elaboration on the meaning of the art of warfare. The fourth level is \"battles - tactics.\" This is combat actions on the most basic scale. The function corresponding to them is \"tactics.\" It can be seen at a glance that each of these levels has a corresponding combat function. Speaking of traditional military men, perhaps throughout their lives their lessons were on how to be skilled in employing these functions and fighting well at whatever level they were on. But for soldiers who are about to be in the next century, it is far from sufficient for them just to practice these functions on these four fixed levels. They must study how to disrupt these levels, to win wars by combining all the factors from supra-national actions to specific battles. This is certainly not a mission which cannot be accomplished. To put it quite simply, as an attempt to match up war policy, strategy, operational art, and tactics with methods, the principle of supra- tier combinations is nothing more than a matter of interchangeable and easily transposed roles. Examples are using a strategic method which is some sort of non-military action to go along with the accomplishment of a tactical mission, or using a tactical method to accomplish an objective on the war policy level. This is because, the trend of warfare shows more and more clearly this sort of indication: it is definitely not the case that the problems at one level can only be solved by the means at one level. No matter whether it is allocating only a fraction of the resources, or using a big machete to kill a chicken, it is a feasible method so long as it works well. Bin Laden used a tactical level method of only two truckloads of explosives and threatened U.S. national interests on the strategic level, whereas the Americans can only achieve the strategic objective of protecting their own safety by carrying out tactical level retaliation against him. Another example is that in past wars, the smallest combat element was the combination of a man and a machine, and its usefulness would normally not go beyond the scale of battles.

Because it has the breadth and secrecy of trans-level combat, this method of individual combat very easily achieves results on the strategic and even war policy levels. This is the gist and significance of supra-level combinations. In warfare and non-military warfare which is primarily national and supra-national, there is no territory which cannot be surpassed; there is no means which cannot be used in the war; and there is no territory and method which cannot be used in combination. The applicability of the actions of war to the trend of globalization is manifested in the word \"beyond.\" This word is sufficient to mean using one to apply to ten thousand, but what we mean by ten thousand methods combined as one is precisely covered by the word \"beyond.\" It must be pointed out once again that combined war that goes beyond limits is first of all a way of thinking, and only afterwards is it a method.",

    "text": "In the history of warfare, the first person credited with using principles to regularize methods of fighting should be Sun Tzu. Principles which he advocated, such as \"know the enemy and yourself and in a hundred battles you will never be defeated,\" \"strike where the enemy is not prepared, take him by surprise,\" and \"avoid the solid and strike the weak,\" are still articles of faith for modern strategists. But in the West, 2,400 years later, Napoleon would reveal his real desire to the world famous Saint-Cyr Military Academy, which would one day emblazon his name above its main doorway: \"To write a book, describing the principles of war precisely, and provide it to all soldiers.\" Unfortunately, when he fought and won wars he had no time to write, and after he was defeated he was no longer in the mood. To a marshal who created nearly 100 victories in his lifetime, this should be neither too big nor too little a regret. But having been born a great man, it was enough for him to leave behind a brilliant record of victories for posterity to scour in search of his path to victory. A hundred years afterwards, from the wars directed by this old enemy who elicited dread from British people both during life and after death, a British general by the name of J.F.C. Fuller induced five principles for directing modern wars. All of the West's principles of modern warfare are descended from these. Although later military regulations of quite a few countries and several military theorists proposed this or that as a principle of war, all of those things differ only in minor ways with those originated by Fuller. This is because, from the beginning of the Napoleonic wars to the time prior to the Gulf War, apart from the continual increase in lethality and destructiveness, there was no reason for an essential change in the nature of war itself.",

The introduction of precision guided weapons, non-lethal weapons, and non-military weapons has derailed warfare from its mad dash down the track toward increased lethality and destructiveness. Events have set in motion the first change of course since the dawn of history. This has laid a new track for war in the next century, and given rise to principles with which professional military people are unfamiliar. No principle can rest on a flimsy platform waiting to collapse. This is even more true of principles of war. Regardless of which military thinker produced them, or whatever military headquarters regulations they come from, the principles are all undoubtedly the product of repeated tempering in the furnace and on the anvil of war. If there had been no wars in the Spring and Autumn period there would be no principles of Sun Tzu. If there had been no Napoleonic wars, there would be no principles of Fuller. In the same way, if there had been no large and small military, quasi-military, and even non-military wars throughout the world before and after the Gulf War, then there would not be proposals for new concepts such as the Americans' \"full- dimensional operations\" and our \"beyond-limits combined war.\" And of course, the principles of war which emerge with these concepts would be out of the question.

This includes observing, planning, employing measures, and combining all mobilizable war resources across all potential battlefields. These battlefields are not just physical spaces like land, sea, air, and space, but also social spaces like military, political, economic, cultural, and psychological realms, as well as the technological space connecting them.  Beyond-limits warfare recognizes various forms of warfare, including military, quasi-military, non-military, violent and non-violent confrontations, involving professional soldiers, ordinary people, or experts. This principle applies to all levels of beyond-limits combined war, from the war policy level down to the tactical level, including intersecting combinations among these levels. The core of this principle is to grasp the combat situation from all angles.",

This shrinks the timeframe of warfare, enabling objectives previously achieved in stages to be accomplished quickly and concurrently. \"Synchrony\" emphasizes conducting actions within the same time period, making beyond-limits war a form of \"designated time warfare.\"  Beyond-limits war utilizes key factors dispersed across different spaces and domains within a designated timeframe. These factors, revolving around war objectives, are employed in a coordinated attack to achieve surprise, secrecy, and effectiveness.  A single, full-depth synchronized action can potentially decide the outcome of an entire war.  The U.S. military's capabilities, particularly its information campaign systems and long-range attack systems, exemplify this concept, although their current thinking remains confined to the military sphere.",

The failures of MacArthur in the Korean War, the U.S. in Vietnam, and the Soviets in Afghanistan exemplify the dangers of exceeding the limits of available measures.

Measures must always serve the purpose of achieving the designated objective. The principle of unlimited measures encourages employing diverse and unconventional methods to achieve limited objectives, as long as those measures remain connected to the desired outcome. Sherman's march to Savanna during the American Civil War, employing destructive measures to cripple the Southern economy and achieve the North's war objective, exemplifies the successful use of unlimited measures for a limited objective.

The Verdun campaign exemplifies senseless attrition warfare, while Germany's blitzkrieg across the Maginot Line demonstrated effective resource use by combining speed, optimal route, and powerful weapons.

This differs from traditional explanations by directly introducing non-military and non-war factors into the sphere of war. Any sphere can be a battlefield, and any force can be used.  Multidimensional coordination is the coordination of the military dimension with other dimensions in pursuit of an objective. Military action is not always primary.

Continuous feedback and revisions are necessary to maintain initiative.  \"Adjustment and control of the entire process\" means adapting throughout the war's course. Due to the principle of synchrony, this process can be extremely short. Modern technology and interconnectedness increase the factors influencing war. Loss of control over any element can be disastrous. Adjustment and control require intuition more than mathematical deduction.  Adapting to new technologies, measures, and arenas is crucial. The shift of the battlefield to non-military spheres changes combat rules, leading to unfamiliar battles against unknown enemies.  Adapting and controlling this unfamiliar process is essential for victory. \"Beyond-limits combined war\" uses completely new methods of combat.

    "text": "dawn of the 21st century. Global integration is comprehensive and profound. Through its ruthless enlightenment, those things which must inevitably be altered or even dispelled are the positions of authority and interest boundaries in which nations are the principal entities. The modern concept of \"nation states\" which emerged from the Peace of Westphalia [1] in 1648 is no longer the sole representative occupying the top position in social, political, economic and cultural organizations. The emergence of large numbers of meta-national, trans-national, and non- national organizations, along with the inherent contradictions between one nation and another, are presenting an unprecedented challenge to national authority, national interests, and national will. [2] At the time of the emergence of the early nation states, the births of most of them were assisted by blood-and-iron warfare. In the same way, during the transition of nation states to globalization, there is no way to avoid collisions between enormous interest blocs. What is different is that the means that we have today to untie the \"Gordian Knot\" [3] are not merely swords, and because of this we no longer have to be like our ancestors who invariably saw resolution by armed force as the last court of appeals. Any of the political, economic, or diplomatic means now has sufficient strength to supplant military means. However, mankind has no reason at all to be gratified by this, because what we have done is nothing more than substitute bloodless warfare for bloody warfare as much as possible. [4] As a result, while constricting the battlespace in the narrow sense, at the same time we have turned the entire world into a battlefield in the broad sense. On this battlefield, people still fight, plunder, and kill each other as before, but the weapons are more advanced and the means more sophisticated, so while it is somewhat less bloody, it is still just as brutal. Given this reality, mankind's dream of peace is still as elusive as ever. Even speaking optimistically, war will not be wiped out rapidly within the foreseeable future, whether it is bloody or not. Since things which should happen will ultimately come to pass, what we can and must focus on at present is how to achieve victory. Faced with warfare in the broad sense that will unfold on a borderless battlefield, it is no longer possible to rely on military forces and weapons alone to achieve national security in the larger strategic sense, nor is it possible to protect these stratified national interests. Obviously, warfare is in the process of transcending the domains of soldiers, military units, and military affairs, and is increasingly becoming a matter for politicians, scientists, and even bankers. How to conduct war is obviously no longer a question for the consideration of military people alone. As early as the beginning of this century, Clemenceau stated that \"war is much too serious a matter to be entrusted to the military.\" However, the history of the past 100 years tells us that turning over warfare to the politicians is not the ideal way to resolve this important issue, either. [5] People are turning to technical civilization, hoping to find in technological developments a valve which will control war. But what makes people despair is that the entire century is just about gone, and while technology has made great strides, war still remains an unbroken mustang. People still expect wonders from the revolution in military affairs, hoping that high-tech weapons and non- lethal weapons can reduce civilian and even military casualties in order to diminish the brutality of war. However, the occurrence of the revolution in military affairs, along with other revolutions, has altered the last decade of the 20th century. The world is no longer what it was originally, but war is still as brutal as it has always been. The only thing that is different is that this brutality has been expanded through differences in the modes in which two armies fight one other. Think about the Lockerbie air disaster. Think about the two bombs in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. Then think about the financial crisis in East Asia. It should not be difficult to understand what is meant by this different kind of brutality. This, then, is globalization. This is warfare in the age of globalization. Although it is but one aspect, it is a startling one. When the soldiers standing at the crossroads of the centuries are faced with this aspect, perhaps each of them should ask himself, what can we still do?",
