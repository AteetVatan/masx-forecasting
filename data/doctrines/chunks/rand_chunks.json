    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "The publication of a new COIN doctrine manual in late 2006 was widely heralded as an indication that the U.S. military was finally coming to understand the problems it has recently faced in Iraq and Afghanistan. This interpretation assumes a tight linkage between doctrine as written and operations conducted. As one way to test this proposition, this paper compares modern COIN doctrine and operations with those of the 1960s. In the 1960s, two periods of COIN doctrine can be observed. The first is 1960 to 1965, the period after John Kennedy was elected President but before U.S. combat troops were committed to Vietnam. The second is 1965 to 1970, the period of heaviest U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. In both cases, COIN doctrine as written by both the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps emphasized the role of the population (so-called hearts and minds), civil-military relations, small-unit operations, intelligence gathering, and related concepts. Yet operations seldom matched this written doctrine; instead, the military attempted to attrite the insurgency through large-scale operations and heavy reliance on firepower. In short, doctrine as written and operations conducted were not tightly linked. As at least a partial explanation for this weak linkage, this paper posits a deeper set of organizational concepts and beliefs that has a much greater influence on operations than written doctrine. While a set of beliefs can often be helpful to organizations in conducting their preferred missions, it can be detrimental in other contexts. Much of the U.S. military prefers high-intensity warfare, a mission for which the organization is mentally and materially well prepared. However, mental preparation for this mission makes the military poorly suited to COIN. Altering the set of beliefs oriented toward high-intensity warfare will require more than just new doctrine and some additional professional education. It will require significant reorientation of the services both mentally and materially. If correct, this paper casts doubt on the military’s ability to truly be a “full-spectrum force,” because attempting to optimize for the full spectrum of conflict may produce a force that is not particularly good at any one aspect of that spectrum.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Present U.S. military actions are inconsistent with that fundamental of counterinsurgency which establishes winning popular allegiance as the ultimate goal. While conceptually recognizing the total problem in our literature, Americans appear to draw back from its complexity in practice and gravitate toward a faulty premise for its resolution—military destruction . . . . Many authors have noted the United States’ massive and pervasive difficulty in conducting effective large-scale counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The country’s tendency to repeat the same mistakes during COIN has similarly generated a number of pithy analogies, with Bruce Hoffman’s comparison of the United States to the protagonist of the movie Groundhog Day being the most common and most apt. This paper seeks to address this repetition from a different angle by comparing the development of the U.S. military’s doctrine for COIN in the 1960s with its development of a new COIN doctrine in the years after Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). In doing so, it serves two purposes. First, it illustrates that doctrine as written in a variety of manuals is remarkably similar both within the two periods as well as across them. This will surprise those who believe that doctrine in the Vietnam era was somehow very different. But the fundamentals of COIN remain constant even as specific contexts and circumstances change, and those who wrote doctrine were aware of at least the outlines of these fundamentals. Second, this paper argues that, as the epigraph from the Program for the Pacification and Long-Term Development of South Vietnam (PROVN) report cited above observes, written doctrine has only a modest effect on the actual conduct of COIN operations. This second point is of critical importance, as it refutes both highly optimistic and highly critical interpretations of the U.S. military’s relationship to COIN. Some optimists see the production of a new COIN doctrine as a moment of collective epiphany in the U.S. military. They believe that the U.S. military will embrace this new doctrinal approach with open arms, and rapidly adapt its operations accordingly. Some critics, in contrast, find it appalling that the last manuals issued on COIN before OIF dated to the 1980s. Had a manual for COIN been issued more recently, they seem to imply, the conduct of operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan would have been quite different. Both of these interpretations hinge on a tight linkage between words written in a manual and actions taken in the field. If this linkage is in fact not very tight, then both the optimistic and critical views lose much of their force. This paper concludes, in fact, that a military organization’s structure, philosophy, and preferences (grouped under the general rubric of “organizational culture”) have a much greater influence on the conduct of operations than written doctrine. It further argues that the culture of military organizations does more to shape doctrine than doctrine does to shape operations.",

    "section": "Doctrine and Counterinsurgency: Defining the Terms",
    "text": "The U.S. military has brief and easily accessible definitions of both doctrine and counterinsurgency. Doctrine is defined as the “[f]undamental principles by which the military forces or elements thereof guide their actions in support of national objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgment in application.” COIN is defined as “[t]hose military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken by a government to defeat insurgency.” These definitions, though adequate, require some clarification. Doctrine is more specific than just “fundamental principles,” yet less specific than what are presently termed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP). Some fundamental principles, such as the need for clear chains of command, are general enough to apply to virtually any military activity. Doctrine, however, is about a specific subset of military activity, such as COIN or combined-arms assault. TTP, in contrast, are about very specific activities, such as clearing a building or suppressing an enemy position with indirect fire. COIN is also more than just a laundry list of possible actions intended to thwart insurgency. Instead, it should be viewed as a campaign that uses a variety of means to secure the population of a territory and restore (or create) the functions of government over that territory. At a minimum, these goals require (1) the government to possess a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence and (2) the disruption or elimination of insurgent forces and infrastructure. Thus, COIN doctrine should provide a general guide to the conduct of a campaign that both (1) results in effective security and governance of a certain population and territory and (2) attacks the insurgency.",

    "text": "COIN emerged as both a concept and a concern only in the aftermath of World War II. The collapse of empires and the emergence of nationalism and decolonization reduced or eliminated effective governance over large areas of the world. At the same time, small arms of unprecedented capability became increasingly available, often provided by either the U.S.–led Western bloc or the Soviet-led Eastern bloc. Combining these factors with advances in communications and transportation made insurgency and COIN qualitatively distinct from previous experiences. Yet the experience of creating or restoring governance was not in itself novel; both the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps had previous experience with operations of this sort. The Army’s central experiences occurred during the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Philippine War. In all three cases, the Army was successful, if often brutal. Beginning with Generals Grant, Sherman, and Sheridan, the Army showed a willingness to apply extreme coercion and violence to civilian populations to accomplish its goals.

Only in the Philippines was there a civilian agency, and, despite its limited ambit, its presence provoked civil-military tension.\nWhatever lessons the Army drew from these experiences were not well codified in doctrine, and instead remained diffuse. The Philippines is particularly interesting because it is in some ways the U.S. Army’s most successful effort to restore governance in the face of guerilla opposition. The Army accomplished this goal with an often uneven but overall successful mix of force application and development. Initial Army policy under BG Arthur MacArthur, Jr., was very benevolent and only slightly repressive, and had little effect on the guerilla movement. This failure led to a division of opinion within the Army, with some advocating much harsher methods reminiscent of the Indian Wars and the Civil War. Others felt that more effort to secure the population should be made but that care should be taken to avoid excessive use of force. This latter view prevailed and became the basis of General MacArthur’s successful pacification plan of 1900 and 1901. Following the replacement of General MacArthur with MG Adna Chaffee in 1901, however, the brutal methods advocated by some were put into practice in places like Samar and Luzon. This ugly but geographically limited violence resulted in courts martial for some officers but also destroyed the remaining guerilla elements.\nIt is also worth noting that the Army in this period was still in its infancy as a professional organization. For example, it did not yet have a General Staff. Its mobilization for the Spanish-American War was haphazard; it had little control over the National Guard or informal units such as Roosevelt’s Rough Riders. Though these deficiencies were corrected over the next two decades, these limitations in terms of conventional war may have paradoxically made adaptation to guerilla pacification easier. There were fewer “bad habits” for officers to unlearn, or those patterns of thought were at least less uniform throughout the officer corps.",

    "text": "Subsequent Army experience with the restoration of government took place in the aftermath of World War II. In Japan and Germany, the combination of devastation and formal surrender limited insurgency, and the United States deliberately chose (after some debate) to retain much of the civilian apparatus of the former governments. In both cases, this approach, combined with massive aid for reconstruction, was highly successful.\nIn contrast to the Army, the Marine Corps had more-frequent but smaller-scale experiences with the restoration of governance. From the 1880s through World War II, the Marine Corps was involved in numerous interventions, mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. In particular, the Marine Corps was engaged in Nicaragua for over six years in the 1920s and 1930s. The Marines, though not afraid to use violence, never had sufficient force in these countries to use the types of coercive methods that the Army used. Furthermore, Marine Corps operations were almost always integrated with civilian agencies, particularly the State Department. (This earned the Marines the nickname “the State Department’s troops.”) The Marines also created or trained a variety of indigenous forces. Many of these experiences were codified in doctrine in the form of the Small Wars Manual, published in several editions through 1940.\nNeither the Army nor the Marine Corps was heavily involved in COIN between World War II and Vietnam. During the Eisenhower administrations, COIN was conducted primarily by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in some cases supported by U.S. Army Special Forces teams. The Korean War’s guerilla elements operated as “adjuncts” to the conventional war rather than as a true insurgency. The U.S. military was also used during limited interventions in countries like Lebanon and the Dominican Republic, but these interventions were of very short duration and relatively bloodless.",

    "text": "The Kennedy Years: The Birth of COIN Doctrine\nWith the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, COIN became one of the foremost concerns of the U.S. government. President Kennedy believed that insurgencies aimed at undermining governments friendly to the United States were a major threat to national security. Within a year of taking office, he formed an interagency organization, the Special Group (Counter-insurgency), to study the problem. This group, which included the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of State, and the CIA, produced an overall COIN doctrine (also called “overseas internal defense”) that was embodied in National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 182 in August 1962.\nThe ideas embodied in NSAM 182 provided the overarching framework within which early COIN doctrine was developed in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. These ideas, influenced by prominent academics and think tanks like the RAND Corporation, focused on the central role of the population and its grievances against the government. In defining insurgency and the appropriate targets for countering it, NSAM 182 noted the following:\nInsurgency is grounded in the allegiances and attitudes of the people. Its origins are domestic, and its support must remain so. The causes of insurgency therefore stem from the inadequacies of the local government to requite or remove popular or group dissatisfactions. . . . The U.S. must always keep in mind that the ultimate and decisive target is the people. Society itself is at war and the resources, motives and targets of the struggle are found almost wholly within the local population.\nA minor variation of this definition is used in the Army’s field manuals (FMs) from this period. FM 31-16, Counterguerilla Operations (February 1963), uses the following definition: “The fundamental cause of a resistance movement is the real, imagined, or incited dissatisfaction of a portion of the population with prevailing political, social, or economic conditions.” The Army’s capstone manual, FM 100-5, Field Service Regulations-Operations (February 1962), uses this variation: “The fundamental cause of large-scale irregular activities stems from the dissatisfaction of some significant portion of the population . . . with the political, social, and economic conditions prevalent in the area.”\nThe Marine Corps used a similar definition in its Fleet Marine Force manuals (FMFMs). FMFM-21, Operations Against Guerilla Forces (August 1962), uses the following terms:\nResistance stems from the dissatisfaction of some part of the population. The dissatisfaction may be real, imagined, or incited and is usually centered around a desire for—\n(1) Political change.\n(2) Relief from actual or alleged repression.\n(3) Elimination of foreign occupation or exploitation.\n(4) Economic and social improvement.\n(5) Religious expression.",

NSAM 182 noted the following:\nIn insurgency situations indigenous military action will be required. U.S. operational assistance may be a necessary adjunct to the local effort. In these situations, U.S. programs should be designed to make the indigenous military response as rapid and incisive as possible while parallel reforms are directed at ameliorating the conditions contributing to the insurgent outbreak. . . . Anticipating, preventing, and defeating communist-directed insurgency requires a blend of civil and military capabilities and actions to which each U.S. agency at the Country Team level must contribute.\nThis model of COIN became known as the “hearts and minds” approach after Sir Gerald Templer’s remarks about the British experience during the Malayan insurgency. Reform and good governance combined with judicious police and military action were the essence of this approach. Close coordination between military, police, and civil authority was a prerequisite for success.\nThe U.S. Army’s doctrine generally accepted this vision, though with a slightly harsher tone. For example, the importance of a reform program is noted in FM 100-5:\nIrregular forces lose effectiveness when not supported by the civil population, whether such support is provided willingly or gained through coercion. . . . The irregular force is usually a result and not the cause of the problem. The destruction of an existing irregular force normally does not provide a complete solution. The population must be convinced that the conduct or support of irregular activities will not only fail to gain the desired results, but may result in the imposition of sanctions and actually delay the elimination of the causes of discontent.

FMFM-21 states every Marine must be an intelligence collection asset, reporting anything unusual. Small-unit actions should be based on this intelligence. FM 31-16 makes a similar point about individual soldier reporting. Both manuals advocate coordinating intelligence among military, police, paramilitary, and civilian agencies, utilizing clandestine informer networks and emphasizing surrendered and captured enemy personnel as intelligence sources.

Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine 11 tenets essential to success. However, these tenets had not been fully or well implemented in practice. PROVN sought to provide a blueprint for the operationalization of COIN doctrine. First and most importantly, PROVN reiterated the doctrinal point that development and good governance should be central to all U.S efforts: A viable, noncommunist government in SVN [South Vietnam] is fundamental to the achievement of U.S. objectives. Failure to develop such a public supported political order not only will preclude winning a true military victory, it will ensure losing a negotiated peace . . . . Long-standing and legitimate causes of insurgency are still present. Promises of reform melt into maintenance of the status quo.41 PROVN readily acknowledged that development required security, but pointed out that security was meant to enable development rather than be an end in itself. PROVN also called for a “single manager” for Vietnam who would be responsible for all aspects of U.S. activity there, and further argued that this should be (at least initially) the U.S. Ambassador. In addition, PROVN stated the following: To succeed, we must actually decentralize and delegate to Americans and Vietnamese at district and province levels the requisite resources and authority to accomplish the tasks at hand. Their exercise of this authority must be buttressed and sustained up through the chain of command. . . . Unity of command and effort is required now at province level, with the province chief directing all GVN activities (military and nonmilitary) in the province. His counterpart, the SUSREP (Senior U.S. Representative), must direct all U.S. activities . . . . 42 This was a directive for actually implementing FM 31-16’s recommendation to establish “pacification committees” and NSAM 182’s call for unity of civil and military effort. PROVN additionally stressed the importance of language training and knowledge of political and social factors. It repeatedly noted that wide variations between the situations in different provinces and even between different districts in the same province were to be expected. This variation would require detailed awareness of the specific local environment where those conducting COIN were assigned.43 Despite being an honest attempt to implement the doctrine that the U.S. government and the military services had promulgated, PROVN did not receive a warm welcome from much of the military.",

Others, such as Marine Corps LtGen. Victor Krulak, found it to be highly useful, as did civilians such as Ambassador Robert Komer.44 Yet the net effect of the PROVN study on the military conduct of COIN in Vietnam 41 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 76–77, emphasis in the original. 42 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 61, 66. 43 U.S. Department of the Army (1966), pp. 2-47–2-50. 44 For the history of PROVN and reactions to it, see William Gibbons, The U.S. Government and the Vietnam War: Executive and Legislative Roles and Relationships, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995, Part Four, pp. 201–212; and 12 Doctrine of Eternal Recurrence—The U.S. Military and Counterinsurgency Doctrine was minimal for the next several years. Instead, as detailed below, the U.S. military did almost exactly the opposite of what the report recommended. COIN as Practiced: Vietnam, 1965 to 1968 The introduction of U.S. ground forces in a combat (rather than advisory) role in Vietnam in March 1965 began a rapid cascade of U.S involvement in the war. Most significantly for COIN operations, it meant that the COMUSMACV, General Westmoreland, at last had combat troops to command rather than to merely advise. He quickly began employing them in operations, but these operations were not grounded in COIN doctrine as promulgated. The essence of operations from 1965 to 1968 was to apply maximum firepower to enemy “main-force” units in order to destroy them. By destroying enemy forces faster than they could be replaced, Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) sought to bring the war to a favorable conclusion via attrition. To this end, U.S. forces sought contact with large units and then destroyed them, an approach known as “search and destroy.” This approach was premised on the idea of the massive application of firepower. General Westmoreland provided a one-word summary of his antiguerilla strategy: “Firepower.”45 In a less terse summary, General Westmoreland stated that if the enemy did not quit, the U.S. forces would “just go on bleeding them to the point of national disaster for generations.”46 General Westmoreland’s operations officer, BG (later LTG) William Depuy, summarized the MACV strategy in a statement to the press: “We are going to stomp them to death.”47 After being promoted to major general and receiving command of the 1st Infantry Division, General Depuy described the approach in more detail to Daniel Ellsberg: “The solution in Vietnam is more bombs, more shells, more napalm . . . till the other side cracks and gives up.”48 MACV’s actions more than lived up to this rhetoric. Over 4 million tons of indirect (air and artillery) ordnance was expended over South Vietnam from 1965 to 1973.49 Artillery forces alone expended more than 20 million rounds total of all calibers.50 Much of this firepower was not even employed in direct support of troops, instead being fired in so-called harassment and interdiction missions. This meant firing unobserved into areas thought likely to contain the enemy.51 Vast amounts of direct-fire ordnance were used as well. In addition to using large quantities of firepower, the military spent considerable effort on improving the quality of firepower. It developed new doctrinal guidelines for the employment Lewis Sorley, “To Change a War: General Harold K. Johnson and the PROVN Study,” Parameters, Vol. 28, No. 1, Spring 1998.

    "text": "Fixed-wing gunships were developed from cargo aircraft, while a panoply of lethal aerial munitions were employed.53 Strategic Air Command B-52s intended for nuclear delivery were pressed into service as massive, all-weather conventional bombers.54 Along with firepower, the Army sought to utilize superior mobility in the form of helicopters to outmaneuver the enemy. Units dispatched in helicopters from central bases spent a few hours or days “in the bush” (often quite far away from major population centers) and then returned to base. This was hardly consonant with COIN doctrine, which required significant interaction with the population, both to provide security and to gather intelligence. However, given that the original goal of airmobility was to provide the ability to rapidly disperse and concentrate against armored forces on the potentially nuclear battlefields of Europe, the inapplicability of this tactic to COIN is not surprising. In fact, it was just another example of the feeling, common among many in the Army, that COIN was a lesser included case of war. One of the pioneers of airmobility noted the following after the end of the war: A briefing of particular significance took place in the late afternoon of 12 December 1960. . . . At that time the focus in the Army was on the nuclear battlefield. Organic aviation was viewed by the Army as the best means of maintaining combat operations in an area characterized by great depth and frontage with the dispersion of many small self-contained units. The major threat was viewed as a sophisticated enemy attacking with masses of armor on the plains of Europe. Counter-guerrilla warfare at that time was viewed as a secondary mission. Nevertheless, the early planners in airmobility perceived that one of the automatic fallouts in organizing the Army for greater airmobility would be much greater capabilities in the lower spectrums of warfare.55 Instead of automatically making the Army more capable of COIN, airmobility actually undercut written doctrine by disconnecting troops from the population. In addition to emphasizing fire and maneuver over pacification, combat forces in Vietnam were also oriented toward centralized, large-unit operations rather than decentralized pacification and patrolling. Beginning with the 1st Cavalry Division’s battle in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965, Army units were consistently employed in multibattalion operations.56 Operations increased in size, as Operation Attleboro in September 1966 illustrated. Begun as a search and destroy operation by battalions of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade, Attleboro grew to include over 22,000 U.S. and allied troops, including General Depuy’s 1st Infantry Division.57 Attleboro was followed in 1967 with the even larger Cedar Falls–Junction City operations. Both were multidivisional operations with massive fire support, with Junction City utilizing over 25,000 U.S. and allied forces.58 In contrast to the exhortations of written doctrine, MACV also significantly slighted pacification and encouraged aggressive, large-unit sweeps with high volumes of firepower. This is apparent in the metrics for unit performance and officer evaluation chosen by MACV. The most infamous is the “body count,” the counting of enemy dead. Far from encouraging the military to provide security to Vietnamese civilians, the body count often meant that Vietnamese were simply designated enemies if they were killed.",

    "text": "Metrics for success against main-force units included number of combat sorties flown, bomb tonnage dropped, ammunition expended, and ratio of U.S. deaths to enemy deaths.61 Not all U.S. military COIN operations adhered to the approach described above. Two programs in particular were notable for how well they tried to follow written COIN doctrine. The first was the CIA and Army Special Forces–led Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) program, which sought to help ethnic minorities in the central highlands by both training self-defense forces and providing some development assistance.62 The second was the Marine Corps–led Combined Action Platoon (CAP) program, which combined a Marine squad with a paramilitary Popular Forces platoon to provide security at the village and hamlet levels.63 Despite being consonant with doctrine, both the Special Forces and the Marines experienced intense pressure to conform to the MACV model. CAP has been and remains the subject of much attention and debate. Some argue that the program was not terribly successful given its small scale, lack of sufficient troops to protect all hamlets, and the fact that such dispersed U.S. forces were vulnerable to being overrun by large enemy units. Others see CAP as a road to victory because CAPs provided local security and invited attack from mass insurgent groups, thereby making these groups more vulnerable to firepower.64 There is some merit to both points of view (though this author leans more to the latter), but the important point is not whether CAP was a model for success or not. Instead, it is important to note that CAP was supported by existing doctrine for COIN in a way that harassing and interdiction fire and search and destroy missions were not. Yet, it was search and destroy that dominated. Finally, civil-military integration was not well developed in this period. Not until 1967 was a real organization established to manage all civilian efforts and to attempt to integrate them with military efforts. This organization, Civil Operations and Revolutionary [later Rural] Development Support (CORDS), was headed by Robert Komer, who was acting as a deputy to the COMUSMACV. Although CORDS represented a step forward in integration, Ambassador Komer still had limited ability to influence how U.S. forces were employed. This was clearly not the arrangement advocated in doctrine and articulated in PROVN.",

    "section": "Evolution of COIN Doctrine (Late 1960s)",
    "text": "Doctrine in the Late 1960s\nBy March 1967, U.S. combat forces had been engaged in Vietnam for two years. New doctrine manuals began to appear in this period and, as one might expect, they demonstrated some signs of evolution. For instance, the new manuals were longer. The March 1967 version of FM 31-16 was about 25 percent longer than the February 1963 version; the December 1967 version of FMFM-21 (redesignated FMFM 8-2, Counterinsurgency Operations) was about 50 percent longer than the August 1962 version. Some shifts in terminology were also visible; FM 31-16 used the term “internal defense and development” rather than “counterinsurgency.” This shift is also evident in the September 1968 version of FM 100-5: The term “counterinsurgency” is used by the joint services, other governmental agencies, and many foreign countries. Within the U.S. Army, depending on the context, use of “stability operations” or “internal defense and internal development” is preferred to “counterinsurgency.”65 Yet despite these cosmetic differences, the doctrine produced in this period was fundamentally similar to earlier doctrine. For example, the 1967 version of FM 31-16 notes the primary importance of the population and the need for civil-military integration:\nSince the essence of the counterguerilla campaign is to win back the support of the people for the established government, the importance of civil affairs is paramount . . . . [I]n internal defense operations, because of the importance of isolating the guerillas from the people, civil affairs becomes one of the primary missions of the counterguerilla force. This is because all internal defense operations plans must be based on an integrated civil-military approach designed to progressively reassert host government control and gain the trust, confidence, and active cooperation of the people.66 Similarly, the 1968 version of FM 100-5 describes the roots of insurgency much as earlier versions did: “Government ultimately depends on the acquiescence if not the active support of its citizens. . . . Thus, the basic causes of insurgency are the existence of one or more grievances and lack of faith in the government’s ability or desire to correct them.”67 The root causes of insurgency as described in FMFM 8-2 are identical to those presented in FMFM-21.68 In terms of organization for COIN, the 1967 version of FM 31-16 reiterates the call for the establishment of pacification committees, though they are renamed “area coordination centers” (ACCs).",

    "text": "This later version provides more detail on these pacification committees than the earlier version, and specifically calls for the establishment of ACCs at all levels of political organization, especially the province, district, and village levels. The membership of the ACC is also enumerated, with the military, intelligence agencies, paramilitary, and police being the foremost members. FM 31-16 also calls for Civil-Military Advisory Committees (CMACs) to be established to advise the ACC, with members including judges, religious leaders, labor unions, and other respected members of the community.69 In terms of operations, the revised doctrines of the late 1960s were similar to their predecessors, although they frequently elaborated on earlier versions. FMFM 8-2 (December 1967), for example, devoted an entire chapter to the conduct of small-unit actions, noting the following:\nOperations against guerillas are characterized by small unit actions. They are conducted by numerous squads, platoons, and companies operating continually throughout the guerilla area . . . . The authority to conduct patrols is decentralized as much as practicable. Although overall patrolling policy and certain special patrols may be determined by higher headquarters, the extensive patrol activity and need for rapid response makes it desirable to assign patrol authority to lower echelons. Battalions, companies, or platoons may be assigned patrol authority. Flexibility is the prime consideration.70 The 1967 version of FM 31-16 also reasserted the importance of the population and provided a caution about the use of firepower:\nMilitary operations must take into account protection of the civilian population. This is a problem in counterguerilla operations because the guerilla usually hides himself in the civilian population and fights from that base of support. Bringing artillery or airpower to bear on a town from which sniper fire was received may neutralize the guerilla action, but it will almost certainly alienate the civilian population as a result of casualties among noncombatants.71 The 1967 version of FM 31-16 also devotes sections to the importance of consolidation operations (also known as “clear-and-hold operations”) as well as civil affairs.72 Doctrine in this later period continued to emphasize the critical importance of intelligence for COIN. Cultural, political, and economic intelligence was still seen as important alongside traditional order of battle. In addition, FMFM 8-2 and FM 100-5 both stated that the need for and staffing requirements of intelligence in COIN were more intense than the needs of normal operations.73 Besides the formal and general doctrine produced by the services, MACV also began to produce its own COIN doctrine specific to the conflict in Vietnam. One example is the Handbook for Military Support of Pacification (February 1968).",

    "text": "This guide provided descriptions of pacification and of the military’s role in supporting pacification, as well as numerous specific TTP for COIN. The handbook’s introduction provides perhaps as clear and succinct a definition of COIN as can be found:\nPaciﬁcation, as it applies in the Republic of Vietnam [,] is the military, political, economic, and social process of establishing or re-establishing local government responsive to and involving the participation of the people. It includes the provision of sustained, credible territorial security, the destruction of the enemy’s underground government, the assertion or reassertion of political control and involvement of the people in the government, and the initiation of economic and social activity capable of self-sustenance and expansion. . . . The key to paciﬁcation is the provision of sustained territorial security. Territorial security is security from VC local forces and guerilla units and VC/NVA [North Vietnamese Army] main force units, if any are in or threatening the area. It also includes the protection of the people within a hamlet from the VC infrastructure and bullies.74 The handbook also provides guidance on how many of the other elements of COIN doctrine relate to the specific environment of Vietnam. COIN as Practiced: Vietnam, 1969 to 1972 The Tet Oﬀensive of 1968 ﬁnally provided General Westmoreland with a chance to eﬀectively apply the ﬁrepower he had amassed in Vietnam. The results were devastating to the VC, but the mere fact that the VC could launch such a major eﬀort after almost three years of search and destroy was equally devastating to General Westmoreland. He was “kicked upstairs” to become Army Chief of Staﬀ, while his deputy, GEN Creighton Abrams, replaced him.75 General Abrams’ understanding of the war was clearly diﬀerent from his predecessor’s. After observing the war for several years he had come to accept, as written COIN doctrine elaborated, that paciﬁcation was a more appropriate strategy than search and destroy. General Abrams found many of PROVN’s recommendations to be very useful as well. He therefore",

Some credit him, along with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and the CIA’s William Colby, with the Army’s shift to effective pacification. Unfortunately, this shift was undone by the 1972 and 1975 conventional offensives of the NVA.76 Closer inspection of what actually took place after Tet reveals a much more mixed record of change. Even a commander as well respected as General Abrams was unable to shift strategy easily. General Abrams bemoaned the inability of various subordinates, including battalion and division commanders, to change their conception of the war and thus the actual conduct of operations.77 Battles like Khe Sanh and Hue, in which the enemy stood and fought rather than running, appeared to validate the conventional warfare approach. Despite General Abrams’ top-down efforts to change Army doctrine, “unofficially, attrition remained in force.”78 LTG Julian Ewell’s career under GEN Abrams is a good example of the limits of change. General Ewell commanded the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta in 1968 and 1969, where his obsession with body counts and kill ratios earned him the nickname “Delta Butcher.” Writing after the war in an Army official publication, he defended search and destroy: When one first observes the fighting in Vietnam, there is a tendency to assume that the current tactics are about right and that previous tactics were rather uninspired if not wrong. The first conclusion is probably correct, the second is probably wrong. For example, one hears much criticism of the Search and Destroy Operations which were extensively used in 1967 and before. However, if one looks at the situation then existing and what was actually done, the tactics were pretty well chosen and did the job. Any reasonably effective commander, after observing the enemy operate a while, can cope with him reasonably well.79 Elsewhere in the same publication, he derides pacification via development.80 One would not expect an officer advocating such an approach to prosper if strategy actually changed significantly under General Abrams. Yet General Ewell was promoted to command II Field Force, an Army corps command, where he continued to serve under General Abrams in 1969 and 1970. He subsequently served as a military adviser at the peace talks in Paris. Whatever General Abrams himself may have believed about COIN, much of the rest of the Army continued to pursue more or less the same type of operations it had undertaken under General Westmoreland, and continued to reward those who performed these operations well.",

    "text": "The end of significant U.S. involvement in Vietnam also marked the end of significant U.S. interest in COIN for nearly a decade. The U.S. Army refocused on conventional high-intensity war in Europe and rebuilt itself into a well-trained, all-volunteer force. Doctrine, written by GEN William Depuy and his acolytes at the new Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), was all but exclusively focused on defeating the Warsaw Pact signatories. The 1976 version of FM 100-5 is pure Central Front (except for a chapter that discusses the environmental effects of deserts and jungles). The 1982 version presents a somewhat different view of operations, but they are nonetheless focused on the same enemy in the same theater. The Marine Corps also began to turn away from COIN, though to a lesser extent. It first sought a greater role in the European theater on the so-called Northern Flank of Norway. It subsequently embraced the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) concept designed to intervene in and protect the Persian Gulf area from Soviet depredations. COIN did not vanish entirely; the Marine Corps published a revised version of FM 8-2 in 1980 and included discussion of low-intensity conflict in its new capstone doctrinal manual, simply titled Warfighting. The Reagan administration’s concern about insurgency in Central America in the 1980s led to a limited resurgence of interest in COIN. A new position in DoD, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, was established by Congress in 1986 to provide additional support and guidance on low-intensity operations, including COIN. One of the primary goals of low-intensity conflict in the 1980s was to help the government of El Salvador defeat the insurgents of the Frente Faribundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN). Yet the involvement of the U.S. military was strictly limited to a military advisory group of officially no more than 55 personnel (though this limit was circumvented to some degree).81 Furthermore, many of these advisers, who came from the special operations community, had relatively little interaction with the broader U.S. military. Most of the military remained much more concerned with NATO or RDF contingencies. Nonetheless, resurgent interest in COIN and growing concern about international terrorism did affect doctrine. In 1986 the Army updated another COIN manual, FM 100-20, renaming it Field Circular (FC) 100-20, Low Intensity Conflict. This document covered COIN, counterterrorism, and peacekeeping operations. In 1990 FC 100-20 was updated and redesignated FM 100-20. The end of the Cold War was rapidly followed by the end of both the FMLN insurgency and the limited COIN renaissance. The U.S. military continued to be involved in various peacekeeping and peace-enforcement operations in the 1990s and continued to produce doctrine for these operations. FM 100-20 was redesignated FM 3-7 and renamed Stability and Support Operations.",

    "text": "With the attacks of September 11, 2001, U.S. concern about low-intensity conflict increased dramatically once again. The rapid assault on Afghanistan resulted in the quick ouster of the Taliban government but left nothing in its place. A new government was formed, but it faced an essentially lawless country filled with terrorists, warlords, and narcotraffickers. Yet even as the military and some civilian agencies sought to grapple with this problem, planning for the invasion of Iraq began. The invasion of Iraq and ouster of President Saddam Hussein in 2003 went as well as the ouster of the Taliban, yet it again left the United States with a lawless and ungoverned country. Within only a few months a Sunni Arab insurgency emerged, though it was not officially identified as such at that time. The U.S. military was about to engage once again in large-scale COIN operations. A new edition of FM 3-7 was actually released in February 2003, one month before the beginning of OIF. This edition (over 200 pages long) is not specifically and exclusively about COIN, but it contains many familiar elements from previous COIN doctrine. It uses the term “foreign internal defense” (FID) rather than COIN in many instances, but nonetheless devotes an entire chapter to COIN. In discussing stability operations generally, it makes the following comment on intelligence: Stability operations and support operations demand greater attention to civil considerations—the political, social, economic, and cultural factors in an area of operations (AO)— than do the more conventional offensive and defensive operations. Commanders must expand intelligence preparation of the battlefield beyond geographical and force capability considerations. The centers of gravity frequently are not military forces or terrain but may be restoring basic services or influencing public support. Cultural information is critical to gauge the potential reactions to the operation, to avoid misunderstandings, and to improve the effectiveness of the operation. Changes in the behavior of the populace may suggest a needed change in tactics or even strategy. Biographic information and leadership analysis are key to understanding adversaries or potential adversaries, their methods of operation, and how they interact with the environment. Knowledge of the ethnic and religious factions in the AO and the historical background of the contingency underlying the deployment are vital to mission success . . .82 This edition also stresses the importance of the population and of coordination between civilian and military efforts.83 The chapter devoted to FID presents the following summary of COIN: Success in counterinsurgency goes to the party that achieves the greater popular support. The winner will be the party that better forms the issues, mobilizes groups and forces around them, and develops programs that solve problems of relative deprivation. This requires political, social, and economic development. Security operations by military and police forces, combined with effective and legitimate administration of justice, provide the necessary secure environment in which development can occur.84 The chapter then discusses the need for amnesty programs, the importance of police and paramilitaries, the need to avoid using excessive force, and the need to remain on the strategic defensive (but tactical offensive) in COIN.85 Though comparatively brief, the same basic discussions found in earlier Army COIN doctrine are present. The manual also contains appendices on making interagency coordination work (Appendix A) and the nature of insurgency (Appendix D). Thus, the U.S. military that entered Iraq in 2003 did not lack at least general doctrinal guidelines for COIN. However, the 2003 version of FM 3-7 was not ideal. It covered such a broad range of operations that it did not provide sufficient detail on COIN. It was further limited by its assumption that U.S. forces would typically provide advice and support rather than conduct combat operations themselves. By the end of 2003, the U.S. military realized that it needed a new doctrine manual more specific to COIN. The result, released in October of 2004, was the Army’s Field Manual– Interim (FMI) 3-07.22, Counterinsurgency Operations. FMI 3-07.22 elaborated on previous concepts (such as the importance of insurgencies that attempted to form a “counterstate” to replace the existing authority) but basically retained the same definitions and prescriptions for COIN. In discussing why insurgency happens and why the population is important, the manual notes that [t]he desire to form a",

Popular support is crucial for sustaining or defeating such movements.  FMI 3-07.22 emphasizes the population as the center of gravity in COIN, stressing the need for intelligence covering cultural, social, political, and economic aspects, and highlighting the importance of civil-military coordination.  The manual also acknowledges potential drawbacks of excessive firepower, which can cause collateral damage and alienate locals, driving them towards insurgents. It advocates for small-unit decentralized operations and patrolling among the populace.  Additionally, it discusses “clear and hold” operations (essentially pacification efforts). In Iraq, initial civil-military coordination was inadequate, improving later under different leaders but remaining personality-dependent rather than doctrinally sound. U.S. COIN operations in Iraq (2003-2005) varied greatly, ranging from firepower-intensive raids to population security, depending on commanders. Some prioritized security and development, while others favored “kinetic activity.” Operations like Kennesaw Dragon and Clean Sweep in November 2005 exemplified a tendency to disregard COIN doctrine, focusing on brief sweeps rather than enduring security and popular support. Recognizing this, MNF-I established a “COIN Academy” to educate commanders, producing a handbook providing cultural and historical context for Iraq, emphasizing the importance of non-kinetic operations, intelligence gathering (“every soldier an intelligence collector”), and population-centric approaches.",

Operation Swarmer near Samarra in March 2006, a large air-assault operation, exemplifies a non-doctrinal approach with brief sweeps and limited impact on long-term security.  However, other efforts, like those in western al-Anbar, adhered more closely to doctrine. Marines in Al Qaim and Tal Afar prioritized population security, leading to increased stability and reduced insurgent activity. Similar doctrinally sound techniques were employed in Ramadi, focusing on intensive patrolling, police support, and community engagement. These methods continued to be practiced by Iraqi units even after the U.S. Marines departed.  A new joint manual, FM 3-24/FMFM 3-24, Counterinsurgency, was drafted in June 2006, incorporating academic input.  It defines the COIN objective as fostering effective governance by a legitimate government, emphasizing consent over coercion. The manual underscores the importance of civil-military integration, advocating for unity of command and effort, and highlighting the need for local forces to establish control and a monopoly on legitimate violence. It provides examples of coordination mechanisms, such as Joint Interagency Coordination Groups and Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The manual stresses the importance of intelligence in COIN.",

    "text": "Both insurgents and counterinsurgents require an effective intelligence capability to be successful. They attempt to create and maintain intelligence networks while trying to neutralize their opponent’s intelligence capabilities.\nThe Marine Corps also developed two other complementary manuals: *A Tentative Manual for Countering Irregular Threats* and *Marine Corps Interim Publication (MCIP) 3-33.01, Small Unit Leader’s Guide to Counterinsurgency*. The Tentative Manual is focused at the battalion and above level of leadership and MCIP 3-33.01 at the company level and below.  The Tentative Manual, as its title suggests, is intended as much to provoke debate as to provide extensive guidance. In contrast, MCIP 3-33.01 includes a substantial amount of TTP information along with doctrine. Its focus is heavily on small-unit patrolling; it devotes more than 40 pages (out of 239) to the subject, and includes two patrolling-related appendixes. It also bluntly argues that security of the population must be paramount: “If you fail to secure the people, you will fail in COIN.” It further argues that securing the population requires living among the people:\n>One of the most effective ways to protect and establish relations with the people is to move in and live among them. The increase in COIN operations in the urban environment and the critical need to maintain contact and provide security for the local populace has driven us to conduct near continuous operations—primarily patrolling—at the rifle company level. In order to make this tactically feasible, rifle companies should normally establish a “firm base” (FB) inside of or in the immediate vicinity of the urban area where the patrols will operate.\nWhile MCIP 3-33.01 may be somewhat lengthy and too focused on TTP, as some in the Marine Corps have privately argued, it is nonetheless valuable as a clear guide for the kind of decentralized small-unit operations that have been at the heart of U.S. COIN doctrine for decades. The final doctrinal development of 2006 was the December release of the official version of FM 3-24; the Marine Corps official designation was changed to *Marine Corps Warfighting Publication (MCWP) 3-33.5*. It is substantially similar to the June 2006 draft; indeed, the only major change appears to be the incorporation of an appendix on intelligence into the main body of the text. Like the draft manual, it emphasizes the importance of intelligence, civil-military operations, population security, and legitimate government.",

    "text": "After a near-disastrous 2006 that saw rising violence in most of Iraq, 2007 saw improvement in the security environment, most strikingly in al-Anbar province but also in Baghdad. Some credit changes in military practice related to the new COIN doctrine with this improvement, along with an increase in troop numbers. While a detailed assessment of the situation is beyond the scope of this paper, it is important to note that the central improvements in security have resulted from fractures between insurgent groups rather than a major change in U.S. operations. As late as November 2006, Marine intelligence painted a grim picture of al-Anbar despite the doctrinally sound efforts in places like Al Qaim and Ramadi. However, many tribes were in the process of splitting from Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and realigning with the United States (and to a lesser extent the central government of Iraq). While the United States proved flexible in exploiting some of these fractures, U.S. successes occurred independently of doctrinal change. Furthermore, these maneuvers have not resulted in conditions amenable to long-term stability under a unified government. Instead, various tribes and factions jockey for power even as AQI lurks in the hinterland. Elsewhere, success is mixed or absent. In and around Baqubah, north of Baghdad, AQI and Shia militias such as Jaysh al-Mahdi battle to dominate the population. Some operational shifts have taken place. Many smaller bases have been opened, particularly in al-Anbar and in Baghdad. Partnering with Iraqi security appears to be taken much more seriously. Yet wide variation in U.S. military unit attitudes toward Iraqis (both in uniform and out) persists, and disagreements about COIN are still obvious at senior levels. Sometimes these disagreements have serious consequences in terms of operations undertaken or foregone.",

    "text": "Robert Komer’s 1972 diagnosis was that institutions, military and civilian, “do their thing”; because no U.S. organization’s “institutional repertoire” is focused on the politico-military niche of COIN, all responses fail. In particular, Komer notes the following:\n>Equally striking is the sharp discontinuity between the mixed counterinsurgency strategy which U.S. and GVN policy called for from the outset, and the overwhelmingly conventional and militarized nature of our actual response. The impact of institutional constraints is nowhere more evident than in the GVN and U.S. approach to Vietnam’s military aspects, both before and after 1965. . . . The institutional background of U.S. and GVN military leaders helped shape the nature of that response.\nThe essence of this argument is that a force that is structured to fight a high-intensity conflict against another nation-state’s military is ill-equipped to adapt to the challenge of COIN. It is not just physically ill-equipped but, much more importantly, mentally ill-equipped. This is not an indictment of the intellectual capabilities of the military. Professional military officers are rarely stupid, particularly in the highly competitive ranks of the U.S. military. Rather, it is an argument that successful organizations such as the U.S. military develop structures, philosophy, and preferences, together referred to as “organizational culture,” to help them carry out their tasks. By virtue of long years of training and education, officers are inculcated with patterns of thinking that reflect this culture. In the case of the U.S. military, these patterns are both incredibly useful in high-intensity conflict (the mission of most of the military) and incredibly inappropriate in COIN. A number of these patterns of thinking affect COIN practice. One is the search for decisive battle, which necessarily drives forces to seek large battles and thus leads to operations like Junction City and Swamer. Another is the drive to maximize use of available firepower. The understandable desire to protect and provide comfort to their units encourages officers to (1) adopt force protection measures that limit effectiveness and (2) create large, comfortable bases away from the population. These patterns are so deeply inculcated that officers seldom recognize them, much less correct them.",

It is based on repeated trips to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. It focuses on the early stages of the insurgency—from 2002 until 2008—and examines why and how the insurgency began. It also draws lessons from the broader literature on counterinsurgency warfare and provides recommendations to help the United States develop capabilities and improve performance in future counterinsurgency operations. The focus of this research is on the U.S. military. However, since the actions of other U.S. government agencies, countries, international organizations such as the United Nations (UN), and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are obviously important, they are discussed where appropriate. The results should be of interest to a broad audience of policymakers and academics concerned with counterinsurgency and the related issues of state-building, nation-building, and stability operations.

    "section": "Summary",
    "text": "Following the initial success of U.S. and Afghan forces in overthrowing the Taliban regime in 2001, an increasingly violent insurgency began to develop. A mixed group of insurgents comprised of the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign fighters, local tribes, and criminal organizations began a sustained effort to overthrow the Afghan government. U.S. and coalition efforts in Afghanistan offer a useful opportunity to assess what works—and what does not—in counterinsurgency warfare. This study examines the beginning of the insurgency in Afghanistan and asks three major questions. First, what was the nature of the insurgency? Second, what factors have contributed to the rise of insurgencies more broadly and to the insurgency in Afghanistan in particular? Third, what capabilities should the U.S. military consider developing to improve its ability to wage effective counterinsurgency operations?\n\nThe core argument of this study is that the United States should focus its resources on developing capabilities that help improve the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces to wage counterinsurgency warfare. It has not always done this well. The analysis of 90 insurgencies since 1945 in Chapter Two indicates that three variables are correlated with the success (and failure) of counterinsurgency efforts:\n\n* Capability of indigenous security forces, especially police\n* Local governance\n* External support for insurgents, including sanctuary.\n\nThe U.S. military—along with other U.S. and coalition partners—is more likely to be successful in counterinsurgency warfare the more capable and legitimate the indigenous security forces are (especially the police), the better the capacity of the local government is, and the less external support to insurgents there is. The indigenous government and its forces have a greater chance of gaining, in Max Weber’s words, a “monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.” In many cases, a significant direct intervention by U.S. military forces may undermine popular support and legitimacy. The United States is also unlikely to remain for the duration of most insurgencies: This study’s assessment of 90 insurgencies indicates that it takes an average of 14 years to defeat insurgents once an insurgency develops.",

    "text": "In the Afghan insurgency, the competence—and, in some areas, incompetence—of the indigenous government and its security forces have been critical factors. This analysis suggests that success in Afghanistan hinges on three factors. First is the ability of the United States and other international actors to help build competent and legitimate Afghan security forces, especially police, which was not accomplished during the early stages of the counterinsurgency. Repeated trips to the regional police training centers in Afghanistan, as well as interviews with police in the field, indicated that the Afghan National Police were corrupt, incompetent, underresourced, and often loyal to local commanders rather than to the central government. Indeed, the Afghan police received little attention and were a low priority in the early stages of the counterinsurgency. This was a mistake. The police are the primary arm of the government in a counterinsurgency because of their presence in local villages and districts. The U.S. military made significant changes in the police training program beginning in 2005 and 2006, but persistence is the key to police reform. Based on the low quality of Afghan police when the Taliban was overthrown in 2001, police reform in Afghanistan will take at least a decade.\n\nSecond, the United States and other international actors need to improve the quality of local governance, especially in rural areas of Afghanistan. Field research in the east and south showed that development and reconstruction did not reach most rural areas because of the deteriorating security environment. Even the Provincial Reconstruction Teams, which were specifically designed to assist in development and reconstruction projects, operated in pockets in the east and south because of security concerns. NGOs and state agencies, such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Canadian International Development Agency, were also not involved in reconstruction and development in many areas of the south and east. The irony in this situation is that rural areas, which were most at risk from the Taliban and where unhappiness with the slow pace of change was greatest among the population, received little assistance. The counterinsurgency in Afghanistan will be won or lost in the local communities of rural Afghanistan, not in urban centers such as Kabul. This means the counterinsurgency must find ways to reach these communities despite security concerns.",

    "text": "Third, the United States and other international actors need to eliminate the insurgents’ support base in Pakistan. The failure to do so will cripple long-term efforts to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan. Every successful insurgency in Afghanistan since 1979 enjoyed a sanctuary in Pakistan and assistance from individuals within the Pakistan government, such as the Frontier Corps and the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate (ISI). The Taliban and other insurgent groups enjoyed a sanctuary in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan Province. The Taliban regularly shipped arms, ammunition, and supplies into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Many suicide bombers came from Afghan refugee camps located in Pakistan, and improvised explosive device components were often smuggled across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and assembled at safe houses in such provinces as Kandahar. The Taliban used roads such as Highway 4 in Kandahar Province to transport fighters and supplies between Afghanistan and Pakistan. And the leadership structure of most insurgent groups (e.g., the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, and al Qaeda) was based in Pakistan. There is some indication that individuals within the Pakistan government—for example, within the Frontier Corps and the ISI—were involved in assisting insurgent groups. Solving this problem will require a difficult political and diplomatic feat: convincing the government of Pakistan to undermine the sanctuary on its soil. This effort became more challenging with the rise of an insurgency in Pakistan by a range of militant groups, members of which assassinated Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and conducted brazen attacks against the Pakistan army, ISI, and officials from other government agencies. Militants from Pakistan’s border areas were also linked to a range of international terrorist attacks and plots, such as the July 2005 attacks on London’s mass transit system, the foiled 2006 plot against transatlantic commercial aircraft flights, foiled plots in 2007 in Germany and Denmark, and the 2008 arrests of terrorist suspects in Spain. These developments indicated that the insurgency in Afghanistan had spread to neighboring Pakistan and required a regional solution.\n\nMost policymakers—including those in the United States—repeatedly ignore or underestimate the importance of locals in counterinsurgency operations. Counterinsurgency requires not only the capability of the United States to conduct unconventional war, but, most importantly, the ability to shape the capacity of the indigenous government and its security forces. U.S. military and civilian efforts should focus on leveraging indigenous capabilities and building capacity. In some areas, such as air strikes and air mobility, this may be difficult. The recommendations in Chapter Seven cover eight functional areas: police, border security, ground combat, air strike and air mobility, intelligence, command and control, information operations, and civil-military affairs. In some of these areas, such as civil affairs, the U.S. military should not be the lead agency and will need to coordinate closely with other states, international organizations, and NGOs. Indeed, the success of any counterinsurgency campaign over the long run ultimately requires a combination of military, political, economic, and other efforts.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "In 2001, the United States orchestrated a rapid military victory in Afghanistan. A combination of U.S. Special Operations and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) forces, air power, and Afghan indigenous troops overthrew the Taliban regime in less than three months; U.S. forces suffered only a dozen casualties.\nSome individuals involved in the operation argued that it revitalized the American way of war. However, this initial success was quickly succeeded by the emergence of a prolonged insurgency as the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign fighters, local militias, and criminal organizations began a sustained effort to overthrow the new Afghan government. This study defines an insurgency as a political-military campaign by nonstate actors seeking to overthrow a government or secede from a country through the use of unconventional—and sometimes conventional—military strategies and tactics.\nThis study asked three major questions. First, what was the nature of the insurgency in Afghanistan? Second, what factors have contributed to the rise of insurgencies more broadly and to the insurgency in Afghanistan in particular? Third, what capabilities should the U.S. Department of Defense consider developing to improve its ability to wage effective counterinsurgency operations? This chapter outlines the research effort, and then provides a brief outline of the book.\nResearch Design\nThe research design adopted is straightforward. It included conducting an exhaustive set of primary source interviews in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, the United States, and Europe (including during multiple visits to Afghanistan in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008). These included conversations with several hundred government officials from the United States, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), as well as staff from the United Nations (UN) and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Finally, the research included a review and analysis of hundreds of government documents from the United States, Afghanistan, and coalition countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, as well as transcripts and videos from the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, and al Qaeda.\nTo supplement the research on Afghanistan, several researchers at RAND (including the author) built a data set of all of the 90 insurgencies that occurred since 1945. Our goal was to identify the variables that can be correlated with the success and failure of insurgencies.",

    "section": "The Fallacy of External Actors",
    "text": "One of the key challenges in waging effective counterinsurgency operations is understanding the variables that impact their success (or failure). Most assessments of counterinsurgency operations tend to ignore or downplay the role of indigenous forces and mistakenly focus on how to improve the capabilities of outside forces to directly defeat insurgents. This might include revising the U.S. military’s organizational structure or increasing external resources (such as troops) to directly counter insurgents. This approach assumes the recipe for a successful counterinsurgency is adapting the U.S. military’s capabilities so it can win the support of the local population and defeat insurgents. The problem with this approach is that it ignores or underestimates the most critical actor in a counterinsurgency campaign: the indigenous government and its security forces.\n\nThis mistake is common in the counterinsurgency literature. John Nagl argues, for example, that success in counterinsurgency operations is largely a function of an external military’s ability to adapt its organizational structure and strategy to win the support of the local population and directly defeat insurgents. But he largely ignores the role of the indigenous government and its security forces. In assessing the British performance in Malaya and the U.S. performance in Vietnam, Nagl concludes that the British army's better performance is due to its learning organization, while the American army failed to adapt. General Frank Kitson, who participated in several counterinsurgency campaigns, similarly argues that a successful campaign needs to take into account three groups: the insurgent group’s political structure, the insurgent group’s military structure, and the population. Kitson argues that external forces need to focus on defeating the insurgent’s political and military infrastructure and winning the support of the population. However, he largely ignores the role of indigenous actors. In his study of French counterinsurgency operations, Roger Trinquier makes a similar mistake. He argues that the key to success is adapting the external military’s ability to directly defeat insurgent groups, and the failure to adapt led to French defeats in Indochina and Algeria.  In addition, U.S. Army Colonel Timothy Deady argues that the United States was successful in the Philippines because of direct U.S. action.\n\nAll of these works commit a similar fallacy: They ignore or downplay the role of the indigenous government and its security forces. This focus on winning counterinsurgency campaigns by improving the capabilities of external actors has become conventional wisdom among numerous military officials and counterinsurgency experts. However, such a strategy is misplaced. While improving the U.S. military’s ability to directly counter insurgents may be necessary to a successful counterinsurgency campaign, it is not sufficient. In particular, it underestimates the importance of indigenous forces: Most counterinsurgency campaigns are not won or lost by external forces, but by indigenous forces. The quality of indigenous forces and government has significantly impacted the outcome of past counterinsurgencies. Shaping a successful counterinsurgency is not just a matter of adapting the organizational structure of an external military to unconventional war. It requires an understanding of the nature of the local conflict and the ability to shape the capacity of indigenous actors to conduct an effective counterinsurgency campaign. This includes a range of steps such as effectively training police and improving governance capacity.",

    "section": "An Indigenous Lead",
    "text": "There are dangers in focusing too heavily on a lead U.S. role and improving U.S. military capabilities to directly act against insurgents. First, U.S. forces are unlikely to remain for the duration of any counterinsurgency effort, at least as a major combatant force. Insurgencies are usually of short duration only if the indigenous government collapses at an early stage.  Since indigenous forces eventually have to win the war on their own, they must develop the capacity to do so. If they do not develop this capacity, indigenous forces are likely to lose the war once international assistance ends. Second, indigenous forces usually know the population and terrain better than external actors and are better able to gather intelligence. Third, a lead U.S. role may be interpreted by the population as an occupation, eliciting nationalist reactions that impede success. Fourth, a lead indigenous role can provide a focus for national aspirations and show the population that they—and not foreign forces—control their destiny. Competent governments that can provide services to their population in a timely manner can best prevent and overcome insurgencies.\n\nInsurgencies involve three sets of actors. The first are insurgents, which include those groups that adopt unconventional—and sometimes conventional—military strategies and tactics to overthrow an established national government or secede from it. The second is the indigenous government, which includes the government’s security forces, such as the army and police, as well as its governance capacity. Governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by a central authority in a timely manner, including health care, power, transportation infrastructure, and other basic services. The third group of actors comes from outside. These include states and nonstate entities, which can support the indigenous government or the insurgents. Outside actors can play a pivotal role in tipping the war in favor of insurgents or the government. However, outside actors alone can rarely win the war for either side. Popular support is a common goal for all actors in an insurgency. Both winning support and preventing insurgents from gaining support are critical components of any counterinsurgency. With popular support comes assistance—money, logistics, recruits, intelligence, and other aid—from the local population. The Afghan insurgency can be understood using this framework. The Afghan government and such forces as the Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) are the primary indigenous counterinsurgency actors. The Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign fighters, criminal groups, and a host of Afghan and Pakistani tribal militias are the primary insurgent forces. There are two sets of external actors. The United States, NATO forces, and other international actors such as the United Nations are the primary external actors that support the Afghan government. The broad jihadist network, individuals within the Pakistan government, and Pakistani and Afghan tribes are the primary external actors that support the insurgents. In between the two sides are the Afghan and, to some degree, Pakistani populations, which lie at the center of insurgent and counterinsurgent efforts. The population is particularly critical to insurgents because of their relative weakness. Insurgents generally cannot attack their opponents in a conventional manner, as the government forces are usually much more capable of waging conventional warfare. This asymmetry in power forces insurgents to carry the fight to an arena in which they have a better chance of success. To many insurgents, the population offers a level playing field. If insurgents manage to alienate the population from the government and acquire its active support, they are more likely to win the war.",

    "text": "The success of political power depends on the tacit or explicit agreement of the population, or at worst, on its submissiveness.  Outside actors, like the U.S. military, often play an indirect role by providing resources to the indigenous government. The long-term struggle, however, is between the government and insurgent groups. Analysis of insurgencies since World War II reveals several critical variables linked to the success or failure of counterinsurgency efforts: capability of indigenous security forces (especially police), quality of local governance, and external support for insurgents (including sanctuary). Other factors like terrain and population size can influence outcomes but are largely outside the control of external and indigenous actors.  The capability of government security forces to defeat insurgents and establish law and order is paramount. Insurgents thrive when security forces are weak, lack legitimacy, are poorly funded, or are organizationally inept. Indigenous governments often rely on military and paramilitary forces for their firepower, but ideal characteristics also include initiative, intelligence, inter-unit integration, quality leadership, motivated soldiers, and adaptability.  While military and paramilitary forces are key, police are the most critical component. Their permanent presence in communities, understanding of the local threat environment, and intelligence gathering capabilities make them a direct target of insurgents. Their mission should be to eliminate the entire insurgent organization—command structure, guerrillas, logistics, and financial and political support—from the population. Military force has limitations; insurgents can simply relocate their activities when pressured. A viable indigenous police force is thus crucial for long-term success. However, providing police training can be politically sensitive, requiring careful consideration of potential impacts on human rights and internal repression.",

Stronger, more competent governments providing essential services effectively undermine popular support for insurgents. Governance involves the timely provision of services by a legitimate central authority, influenced by factors like corruption, the justice system, and the power of warlords or militias. Poor governance is often a root cause of insurgency, providing insurgents with an attractive cause—be it social injustice, economic hardship, or government weakness. Corruption is a particularly insidious challenge, undermining government support, fueling insurgent support, hampering economic growth, burdening the poor, eroding the rule of law, and damaging government legitimacy. It diverts public resources for private gain, hindering development and deterring investment.  Most importantly, corruption destroys public trust in the political system, institutions, and leadership.  In essence, weak governance leads to declining government support, which can be fatal to counterinsurgency efforts.

External support, particularly from states, significantly boosts insurgent capabilities through resources like money, weapons, and training.  Sanctuaries in foreign territories further enhance insurgent success rates.  However, even with external aid, local forces must ultimately govern and establish order.  A core challenge for external actors like the U.S. military is the often poor training and corruption within allied security forces, coupled with issues of legitimacy, incompetence, and weakness within indigenous governments.

Despite Soviet efforts, the mujahideen, backed by external support, persisted.  The Soviet withdrawal led to internal conflict among mujahideen factions, allowing the pro-Moscow regime to survive briefly.  The fall of Kabul in 1992 resulted in a new government, but disputes and ethnic tensions, particularly among Pashtun leaders, reignited conflict.

    "text": "Following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the country descended into civil war among various mujahideen factions.  Ismail Khan controlled the western provinces around Herat, while the area south and east of Kabul was held by warlords such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The eastern border with Pakistan was controlled by a council of mujahideen, and the south was fragmented among ex-mujahideen and bandits who exploited cross-border trade with Pakistan. In late 1994, a new movement called the Taliban emerged in the south, rapidly gaining control of Kandahar and surrounding provinces.  The Taliban, meaning \"students\" in Arabic, drew many members from madrassas in Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. Led by Mullah Omar, they presented themselves as a purifying force aiming to eliminate factionalism, corruption, and violence.  Exploiting public frustration and war-weariness, the Taliban gained initial support and quickly advanced through southern and eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) provided substantial backing, including recruitment assistance, weapons, training, and technical support. By 1996, the Taliban captured Kabul and, despite setbacks, conquered northern cities by 1998.  By 2001, they controlled nearly all of Afghanistan, except for a small area held by Ahmed Shah Massoud and his Northern Alliance forces in the Panjshir Valley.  The Taliban imposed a harsh interpretation of sharia law, banning music, restricting women's rights, and suppressing press freedom.  Afghanistan became a haven for jihadists and terrorists, including Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda, who supported the Taliban regime in exchange for safe haven and training grounds.",

Various countries took lead roles in specific areas: the UK in counternarcotics, Italy in justice, the U.S. in army development, Germany in police training, and Japan in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.

Despite political progress, including a new constitution in 2004, Karzai's election as president, and parliamentary elections in 2005 (which saw some ex-Taliban members elected), the insurgency intensified. Three key factors contributed to the success of past insurgencies in Afghanistan: governance challenges, external support, and the quality of security forces. Afghanistan’s governance has long been decentralized, with power residing in tribes and local strongmen rather than a central authority. This decentralized structure has hindered the establishment of a monopoly on the legitimate use of force and a formal justice system. External support has also played a critical role, with various states providing aid to different Afghan factions throughout history.  The Soviet Union, the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have all provided significant financial and military assistance at different times.  This external involvement further complicated the internal dynamics and fueled the ongoing conflicts.  Finally, the quality of Afghan security forces has been affected by the weak central government and external influence. The lack of a national police force and reliance on local militias and tribal forces contributed to the overall insecurity and instability.",

Most were untrained, ill-equipped, illiterate, and owed their allegiance to local warlords and military commanders, not to the central government. As a German delegation in January 2002 concluded, the police force is in a deplorable state just a few months after the dissolution of the Taliban regime. There is a total lack of equipment and supplies. No systematic training has been provided for about 20 years. At least one entire generation of trained police officers is missing. Next to constables, former Northern Alliance fighters are being put to work as police officers. While Afghanistan has lacked a trained civilian police force, it has had secret police agencies. During the Soviet era, the Afghan government established a powerful secret police body, the State Information Services, to suppress opponents of the regime and establish order. The Taliban established the Ministry of Enforcement of Virtue and Suppression of Vice to enforce decrees regarding moral behavior, such as those restricting women’s employment, education, and dress; enforcing men’s beard length and mosque attendance; and regulating the activities of the United Nations and NGOs. The Afghan army has traditionally had little internal control over the country. During the 1980s, the Moscow-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and its successor, the Republic of Afghanistan, recruited a large number of tribal and local militias as army forces.",

    "section": "Taliban Military Structure and the Insurgency's Conclusion",
    "text": "During the Taliban era, the army was comprised of an assortment of armed groups with varying degrees of loyalties and professional skills. There was no formal military structure. The army was not organized, armed, or commanded by the state. Mullah Mohammed Omar was commander of the armed forces and ultimately decided on military strategies, key appointments, and military budgets. A military shura sat below Omar, helping to plan strategy and implement tactical decisions. Individual Taliban commanders were responsible for recruiting men, paying them, and looking after their needs in the field. These field commanders acquired much of the money, fuel, food, transport, and weapons they needed from the military shura. The Taliban’s military structure also included Pakistani officers and al Qaeda members. For example, the elite Brigade 055 consisted of Pakistani, Sudanese, and other foreign fighters. This overview reiterates the argument laid out in Chapter Two: Governance challenges, external support, and the capacity of indigenous security forces have been critical factors in the outcome of Afghanistan’s insurgencies. Pakistan played two particularly important roles. First, the Pakistan government, especially the ISI, supported the victors of each insurgency: the mujahideen, Taliban, and U.S. forces during the initial stages of Operation Enduring Freedom. Since Afghanistan and Pakistan share a 1,160-mile border, Pakistani leaders have historically viewed the ability to influence Afghanistan as critical for strategic depth. Second, Afghan insurgent groups have repeatedly used Pakistan as a sanctuary. These findings have significant implications for understanding the Taliban’s resurgence and assessing how they can be defeated. The next three chapters will explore these findings and their implications by focusing on the three key actors: insurgents, the Afghan government and its security forces, and the United States and other coalition partners.",

    "section": "Insurgent Groups and Their Support Network",
    "text": "This chapter examines Afghan insurgent groups and their support network in the early stages of the insurgency. It argues that a critical independent variable in the success of any counterinsurgency is outside support for insurgents. The insurgency in Afghanistan included a dangerous combination of local and transnational support. Afghan groups successfully acquired external support and assistance from the global jihadist network, including groups with a strong foothold in Pakistan, such as al Qaeda. They also acquired support from some individuals in the Pakistan government, as well as local tribes, criminal organizations, and militias in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This assistance enabled Afghan insurgent groups to adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures—to become, in effect, learning organizations—and largely explains the resurgence of the Taliban and other insurgent forces. This chapter is divided into four sections. The first outlines the main insurgent groups. The second examines their increasing ability to conduct violence. The third section assesses why they have been successful in destabilizing the south and east, especially their ability to gain external support. The fourth offers a brief conclusion. The insurgency in Afghanistan included six main insurgent groups: the Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, the Haqqani network, foreign fighters (mostly Arabs and Central Asians), tribes based in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and criminal networks. There is evidence of some coordination among these groups at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels—including through several shuras located in Pakistan. But there was no unified leadership. As Figure 4.1 illustrates, Afghan insurgent groups fell into three loose fronts. The northern front, which included a large Hezb-i-Islami presence, was based in Afghan provinces that include Nurestan, Konar, Laghman, and Nangarhar, as well as across the border in Pakistan. Other groups, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Tehreek-e-Nefaz-e-Shariat-Mohammadi, were also active on this front. The central front included a loose amalgam of foreign fighters, including Central Asians and Arabs. They were located in a swath of territory near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border from Bajaur in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan to Khowst, Paktia, and Paktika in Afghanistan. The Haqqani network was active in the central front against Afghan and coalition forces. Finally, the southern front, which included a large Taliban presence, was based in Baluchistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, as well as around the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Oruzgan, Zabol, and Paktika. In addition to the Taliban, several drug and tribal groups were also active in the southern front.",

    "text": "The Taliban have historically been motivated to impose a radical interpretation of Sunni Islam in Afghanistan, which is derived from the Deobandi school of thought. Their primary strategies for accomplishing this objective have long been to overthrow the Afghan government, break the political will of the United States and its coalition partners, and coerce foreign forces to withdraw. As former Taliban spokesman Mofti Latifollah Hakimi argued, “the only avenue open to us is the path of jihad.” Indeed, the Taliban increasingly adopted jihadist rhetoric to reestablish control of the country. The Taliban included a recent influx of new members—sometimes referred to as the “neo-Taliban”—who were recruited at madrassas and other locations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There were several thousand full-time Taliban fighters; some estimates ranged from 5,000 to 10,000. The Taliban has traditionally involved two main tiers. The top tier included the leadership structure and key military and political guerrillas and commanders. They were motivated by a radical version of Islam and saw the insurgency as a fight between Islam and Western infidels and the West’s “puppet government” in Kabul. The Taliban leadership was comprised of Mullah Omar and his senior lieutenants, many of whom were based in Quetta, Pakistan. A second shura was based in Pakistan’s Federally Administered Tribal Areas and revolved around such individuals as Sirajuddin Haqqani, who commanded several hundred fighters and was loosely allied with Taliban leadership. His base of support was in the Afghan provinces of Khowst, Logar, Paktia, and Paktika, as well as in Waziristan. Haqqani cooperated with the Pakistan government, including the military and ISI. He enjoyed a support base and ran madrassas in and around Miranshah and Mir Ali.",

    "text": "The bottom tier of Taliban guerrillas included thousands of local Afghan fighters. They were primarily men from rural villages who were paid to set up roadside bombs, launch rockets and mortars at NATO and Afghan forces, or pick up a gun for a few days. Most were not ideologically committed to jihad. Rather, they were motivated by unemployment, disenchantment with the lack of change since 2001, or anger over the killing or wounding of a local villager by Afghan, U.S., or NATO forces. Some fought because of grievances with the Afghan government or because of abuse (either actual or perceived) by Afghan or coalition forces—such as bombings and intrusive house searches.\n\nHezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hezb-i-Islami, which included several hundred fighters, sought to overthrow the government of Afghanistan and install Hekmatyar as leader. Hekmatyar is a Pashtun from the Imam Sahib district of Kunduz and served as Afghanistan’s prime minister from March 1993 to 1994 and again briefly in 1996. His group has traditionally found support in the areas around the Afghan provinces of Konar, Nurestan, Nangarhar, Paktia, and Paktika. The Hezb-i-Islami has historically received assistance from the Iran and Pakistan governments, as well as the United States during the Cold War. Hekmatyar openly pledged to cooperate with al Qaeda and Taliban forces to fight the “crusader forces” in Afghanistan.\n\nBoth the Taliban and Hezb-i-Islami had loosely hierarchical organizational structures and were roughly divided into four groups: logistics support, financial and political support, guerrillas, and commanders. The logistics support network provided supplies, equipment, and other assistance. The success or failure of the guerrilla force depends to a great extent on the logistics support network’s ability to gain support from the tribal populations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Individuals in this group assisted the insurgency by acquiring supplies (including food, water, and ammunition), conducting information and intelligence campaigns, operating medical facilities, conducting counterintelligence operations, recruiting new guerrillas or supporters, operating communication systems, and acquiring and maintaining equipment.\n\nThe financial and political support network was focused on acquiring money and other types of assistance from government and nongovernment sources and establishing political relations with friendly governments, tribal leaders, and other groups. It also worked to recruit new members from madrassas, tribes, and foreign countries. The guerrillas were the armed insurgents, who conducted military and paramilitary operations. Insurgent groups also paid locals—especially youths—to conduct low-level operations, such as harassing fire at U.S. or coalition forces. The Taliban often paid these local youths two or three times the daily rate of pay of ANA and ANP units, suggesting that some insurgents were motivated more by financial than ideological incentives. Finally, the commanders provided strategic organization. Commanders did not exert control in traditional military terms. Rather, guerrilla units were often given tactical and operational autonomy.",

    "text": "The foreign fighters assisting the Afghan insurgents were an amalgam of loosely knit Muslim extremists, including al Qaeda forces. Their ranks were made up primarily of two major types: individuals from the Caucasus and Central Asia (such as Chechens, Uzbeks, and Tajiks) and Arabs (such as Saudis, Egyptians, and Libyans). Several waves of Arabs settled in Waziristan during the mujahideen wars against the Soviets and, more recently, after the U.S. and Northern Alliance overthrow of the Taliban regime. A number of foreigners were directly or indirectly affiliated with al Qaeda, though some were simply inspired by the broader jihadist goal of pushing the United States and its Western allies out of Afghanistan.\n\nAl Qaeda played an important role as an enabler of the Taliban and had close relations with several Pakistan militant groups such as Jaish e Muhammad, Harakat ul Mujahideen, Lashkar e Jhangvi, and Harakat ul Jihad ul Islami. Key al Qaeda figures involved in the Afghanistan insurgency included Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, Abu Yahya al-Libi, and Adam Gadahn. Indeed, the Afghan-border region of Pakistan was home to what is generally referred to as “al Qaeda central”—the remnants of the pre-9/11 al Qaeda organization. Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri relied on an informal infrastructure of militants and tribes to survive, travel, communicate, and conduct operations. First forged during the Afghan jihad of the 1980s, these relationships were institutionalized in the late 1990s when al Qaeda trained and catalogued tens of thousands of Pakistani militants in camps inside Afghanistan. Al Qaeda was deeply involved in suicide terrorism. For example, Croma Yahya, a suicide bomber from Mali who failed to kill Balkh governor Atta Mohammad Nur, had al Qaeda links and came to Afghanistan through Pakistan. As Lt. General Michael Maples, head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, argued, “Al Qaeda will remain engaged in Afghanistan for ideological and operational reasons. Taliban and other anti-coalition militants are adopting al Qaeda tactics in Afghanistan.”\n\nThe foreign fighters often acted as franchises to al Qaeda. They had autonomy at the tactical and operational level but often took guidance from more senior al Qaeda or other commanders at the strategic level. Their strategic objectives were much broader than those embraced by Hezb-i-Islami and Taliban forces. They adopted a strict interpretation of Islam, embraced jihad against the U.S. and other allied governments, and sought to eradicate Western military forces and influence from the region. However, their objectives were usually much broader than regime change in Afghanistan and included a return of the Islamic caliphate in the Middle East. Foreign jihadists were often better equipped, trained, and motivated than other insurgent forces and played a key role as trainers, shock troops, and surrogate leaders for Taliban units in the field.",

    "text": "Wahhabi groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba cooperated with insurgent groups. A variety of organizations involved in the illicit drug trade also cooperated with the Taliban, especially in Afghan provinces such as Helmand. In many cases, members of the Afghan government—including the ANP—were also involved in narcotics trafficking. Former Afghan Minister of Interior Ali Jalali argued that rising narcotics-related violence “is more indicative of a change in tactics than capability,” including “closer cooperation between the militants and drug-traffickers (particularly in Helmand Province).” Drug and other criminal groups developed an intricate network to transport drugs between Afghanistan and neighboring states. The Taliban profited from the drug trade in several ways. They received payments to provide protection to some drug-trafficking organizations operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban also levied taxes on some farmers and secured bribes from drug-trafficking groups at checkpoints. Farther north, there were a number of Russian, Tajik, Uzbek, and Turkmen drug-trafficking organizations. Tajikistan has historically been a primary transshipment country for opiate shipments destined for Russia. Drug traffickers in Afghanistan used produce-laden trucks as a cover for drugs sent north toward Tajikistan, where they were handed off to other criminal organizations. Tajik criminal organizations were the primary movers of this contraband. Approximately half of the heroin that passed through Tajikistan was consumed in Russia. The balance transited Russia to other consumer markets in Western and Eastern Europe. In places where the local economy was dominated by drug traffickers, the opium poppy economy financed a mode of local government that undermined the power of the central government. Researchers at the World Bank argued that areas of Afghanistan—particularly in the south—became a fragmented narco-state in which local drug lords took control of district- and provincial-level state institutions of government with the assistance of insurgent groups. In short, the opium industry has become increasingly powerful and institutionalized in Afghanistan “as Afghan traffickers and the armed leaders who profit from them—both warlords within the government and anti-government forces—capture a higher proportion of the value added of the opiate trade.”",

    "text": "From the beginning of the current Afghan insurgency in 2002, there was a gradual deterioration in the security environment—especially in the south and east of the country. RAND data show that the overall number of insurgent-initiated attacks increased approximately 400 percent from 2002 to 2006, and the number of deaths from these attacks increased over 800 percent during the same period. The data incorporate insurgent-initiated attacks against Afghan civilians, international aid workers, and coalition forces. The U.S. military reported that the increase in violence was particularly acute between 2005 and 2006. During this period, the number of suicide attacks increased by more than 400 percent (from 27 to 139), remotely detonated bombings more than doubled (from 783 to 1,677), and armed attacks nearly tripled (from 1,558 to 4,542). In 2007, insurgent-initiated violence rose another 27 percent from 2006 levels. Helmand Province witnessed among the highest levels of violence, with a 60-percent rise between 2006 and 2007. The result was a lack of security for Afghans and foreigners, especially those living in the east and south. Road travel in many areas was dangerous, and crime was a major problem. Interfactional—or “green-on-green”—fighting continued among regional commanders, including those in the provinces of Herat, Nangarhar, Nuristan, Logar, Laghman, and Badghis. As one report by the National Directorate for Security concluded, Taliban cells in the south of Afghanistan developed good intelligence about individuals in villages and towns, Individuals who flirt with the government truly get frightened as the Afghan security forces are currently incapable of providing police and protection for each village . . . . When villagers and rural communities seek protection from police either it arrives late or arrives in a wrong way. Promoting disorder among the population is a key objective of most insurgents. Disrupting the economy and decreasing security helps produce discontent with the indigenous government and undermines its strength and legitimacy. Once insurgents establish a hold over the population, those who are hostile to the insurgents often become too fearful to oppose them. Some may be eliminated, providing an example to others. Some may escape abroad. Still others may be cowed into hiding their true feelings. By threatening the population, the insurgents give individuals a strong rationale to refuse or refrain from cooperating with the indigenous government and external actors.",

    "text": "As learning organizations, insurgent groups were successful at continually adapting their tactics, techniques, and procedures to confront counterinsurgency efforts. They conducted a wide variety of attacks against U.S., coalition, and Afghan security forces, as well as Afghan and international civilians. The insurgents relied heavily on asymmetric tactics, some of which were similar to those used by mujahideen forces against Soviet and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan army forces during the Soviet-Afghan war. Insurgent tactics included yielding the population centers to U.S. and Afghan forces, operating from rural areas, distributing propaganda to the local population and opposition forces, threatening and intimidating the local population, and conducting armed attacks. As Taliban military officials argued, this is classic guerrilla warfare: “Our military tactic is to control a district center, kill the government soldiers there, and withdraw to our mountainous strongholds, where it would be very difficult for the government to pursue us.” Examples of armed attacks by the insurgency included ambushes and raids using small arms and grenades; shelling using 107-mm and 122-mm rockets and 60-, 82-, and 120-mm mortars; and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Most of their shelling and rocket fire was not accurate, though there is some evidence that insurgent forces considered harassment of enemy forces and populations as valuable. Insurgent groups, especially the Taliban, also succeeded in capturing government installations, villages, and district centers in the south, though usually for brief periods. Taliban forces deployed in larger numbers over time, especially in such southern provinces as Helmand. In 2002, they operated in squad-size units. In 2005, they operated in company-sized units of up to 100 or more fighters. By 2008, they occasionally operated in battalion-sized units, though they deployed in smaller units as well. This suggests that the Taliban were able to move around with more freedom in the south without being targeted by Afghan or coalition forces as time wore on. They also shifted from hard targets, such as U.S. forces, to soft targets, such as Afghan police and international personnel perceived to be supporting the Afghan government or coalition forces. Examples include Afghans organizing or otherwise involved in election work, NGO workers, ANP, ANA, and Afghan citizens believed to be cooperating with coalition forces or the Afghan government. Major spikes in insurgent-initiated violence were usually a function of specific campaigns. Examples include the insurgent attempt to destabilize the October 2004 presidential elections and 2005 parliamentary elections in Afghanistan by targeting Afghan and international personnel involved in organizing, registering, and participating in the elections. Insurgents also conducted a major campaign tied to the U.S. handover of the counterinsurgency campaign to NATO in 2006. Attacks occurred throughout the country before and after the handover, though most were in the south and east around the provinces of Helmand.",

In most insurgencies, the insurgent’s ability to achieve sanctuary in neighboring countries presents a major challenge for indigenous governments. Opportunities for such sanctuary are often exploited by insurgents. It is more difficult for counterinsurgent forces to target insurgents who have retreated to these sanctuaries, which allow the insurgents to regroup, resupply, and recruit new members. Statistical evidence shows that mountainous terrain can provide a particularly useful sanctuary for insurgent groups because it is difficult for indigenous and external counterinsurgent forces to navigate and easier for insurgents to hide in. This presented a particular challenge in Afghanistan, since the border areas and sanctuary in Pakistan included some of the world’s most rugged, mountainous terrain.",

    "text": "Insurgent groups were successful at leveraging assistance from external states—especially in Pakistan. There are indications that support from Pakistan included two major components: assistance from some officials in the Pakistan government and the freedom to operate on Pakistani soil. Officials in the Pakistan government had ideological and geostrategic motivations. Afghanistan has long been important to Pakistan policymakers because of its geographic location. Following the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001, officials in the Pakistan government were motivated to work with the Taliban for several reasons: to balance against India, especially in light of Delhi’s close relationship with the Afghan government; to hedge against a U.S. and NATO withdrawal, ensuring that if Western troops departed from Afghanistan, Pakistan would retain a proxy force in Afghanistan to preempt a movement among Pakistan’s Pashtun population toward closer relations with Afghanistan should Afghanistan became more secure and prosperous. The ISI provided assistance to the Taliban in the 1990s and early 2000s to ensure that it had an ally in Kabul. The motivation of those in the ISI assisting the Taliban in the mid-2000s was similar: to increase the likelihood over the long term that the government of Afghanistan (or at least those controlling the areas of Afghanistan near Pakistan) was controlled by allies. Balancing against India appeared to be a particularly strong impetus for Pakistan’s support of the insurgents. Pakistan and India have long been involved in a balance-of-power struggle in South Asia. Both lay claim to the Kashmir region and fought at least three wars over Kashmir since 1947. Since September 11, 2001, India provided several hundred million dollars in financial assistance to Afghanistan, including funds to assist Afghan political candidates during the 2004 presidential elections and 2005 parliamentary elections. India also helped fund construction of the new Afghan parliament building and provided financial assistance to elected legislators. India’s road construction near the Pakistan border was a significant point of contention between India and Pakistan. These projects were run by India’s state-owned Border Roads Organisation, whose publicly acknowledged mission was to help “the [Indian] armed forces meet their strategic needs by committed, dedicated and cost-effective development and sustenance of the infrastructure.” Finally, India established several consulates in such Afghan cities as Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Herat. Pakistan accused India of using these consulates as a base for “terrorist activities” conducted inside Pakistan, such as fomenting unrest in the province of Baluchistan. The Indian-Afghan axis left Pakistan isolated among its South Asian neighbors. Before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States, Pakistan had a close relationship with the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which it had nurtured since the 1990s. Half a decade later, Pakistan was surrounded by hostile states. Consequently, for some Pakistani officials, assisting insurgents in Afghanistan was a way to balance against Indian influence in Afghanistan, maximize Pakistan’s influence in the border regions, and prevent the Pashtuns on both sides of the border from developing a unified front and pushing for integration into Afghanistan.",

They also helped train Taliban and other insurgents destined for Afghanistan and Kashmir in Quetta, Mansehra, Shamshattu, Parachinar, and other areas within Pakistan. To minimize its visibility, these individuals appeared to supply indirect assistance—including financial assistance—to Taliban training camps. NATO officials uncovered several instances in which ISI operatives provided intelligence to Taliban insurgents at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. This included tipping off Taliban forces about the location and movement of Afghan and coalition forces, which undermined several U.S. and NATO anti-Taliban military operations. In addition, General Hamid Gul and Colonel Sultan Amir Imam, pro-Taliban and pro–al Qaeda Pakistani leaders, gave widely reported speeches at government and military institutions in Pakistan calling for jihad against the United States and the Afghan government. In sum, individuals within the ISI and other Pakistan government agencies provided several types of assistance: ensuring that wounded Taliban and other insurgents received medical aid; training insurgents at camps in Pakistan; providing intelligence; providing financial assistance; assisting with logistics in crossing the border. This assistance is consistent with the Pakistan government’s past behavior, especially the ISI. Throughout the 1990s, Pakistan’s military and intelligence service provided arms, ammunition, supplies, financial aid, and training to the Taliban and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Pakistan also helped recruit fighters for the Taliban, sometimes working with domestic religious associations. In addition, insurgent groups had substantial freedom to operate in Pakistan. The Taliban and other insurgent groups shipped arms, ammunition, and supplies into Afghanistan from Pakistan. Many suicide bombers came from Afghan refugee camps located in Pakistan. IED components were often smuggled across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and assembled at safe houses in and around such provinces as Kandahar. The Taliban used roads such as Highway 4 in Kandahar Province to transport fighters and supplies between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Pakistan’s government failed several times to negotiate effective peace deals with militants in such tribal regions as North and South Waziristan. These deals called on tribesmen to expel foreign militants and end cross-border attacks into Afghanistan. In return, Pakistan’s military promised to end major operations in the area and pull most of its soldiers back to military camps. The logic of these deals seems intuitive: In areas where tribes exert political, military, and economic power, the most effective long-term solution was to create incentives for tribal leaders to police their areas. After all, these tribal areas had been ruled indigenously for hundreds of years. And tribes often regard outside forces, including Pakistan’s military, as unwelcome foreigners. But there were several problems with this strategy. First, it rested on a false assumption, since it presumed that tribes actually controlled these areas. A closer look at the tribal areas indicated that insurgents and terrorists like the Taliban increasingly exerted control.",

Second, the tribal deals failed to curb cross-border activity and undermine the power of the Taliban and other militant groups there. NATO officials I interviewed argued that insurgents crossed the border in greater numbers.\nAs former Pakistan foreign minister Najmuddin Shaikh acknowledged in Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper, “There is no doubt that the Waziristan agreement has led to increased Taliban influence.” Third, there was no enforcement mechanism were the tribal deals to fail. Why should tribes cooperate, assuming they could, if there was no penalty for defection? Pakistan’s military expressed a deep unwillingness to enter the tribal areas again. Indeed, Afghan insurgents used Pakistan as a staging area for offensive operations. Taliban insurgents that operated in the southern Afghan provinces of Kandahar, Oruzgan, Helmand, and Zabol had significant support networks in such Pakistani provinces as Balochistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, including in Waziristan. Due to common ethnicity, they received political support from some of Pakistan’s Pashtun tribes. The Taliban conduct much of their financing and recruiting operations on the Pakistani side of the border. There is also significant evidence that the Taliban leadership had a support base—commonly referred to as the Quetta Shura—in Quetta, Pakistan. As Zalmay Khalilzad, former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, noted, Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders are in Pakistan. [Mullah Akhtar] Usmani, one of the Taliban leaders, spoke to Pakistan’s Geo TV at a time when the Pakistani intelligence services claimed that they did not know where [the Taliban leaders] were. If a TV company could find him, how is it that the intelligence service of a country which has nuclear bombs and a lot of security and military forces cannot find them?”\nIn addition, Ali Jalali, former Afghan Interior Minister, argued, The Taliban have training camps, staging areas, recruiting centers (madrassas), and safe havens in Pakistan. The operations of a 70,000-strong Pakistani military force, deployed in the border region, mostly in the Waziristan tribal areas, have been effective against al Qaeda and non-Pakistani militants, but they have not done much toward containing the Taliban.",

    "text": "The Pakistani military conducted combat operations against foreign fighters—especially Central Asians and Arabs—in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. But Pakistan was reluctant to conduct operations in Baluchistan against Taliban insurgents or their support network. As one Pakistani journalist argued, the Pakistan government “plunges into action when they know they can lay their hands on a foreign militant but they are still reluctant to proceed against the Taliban.” Part of the reason may be that the Pakistan government was preoccupied with other security concerns in such provinces as Baluchistan, where it was fighting a counterinsurgency campaign against Baluch tribes. In addition to Pakistan, Iran has historically been active in Afghanistan. Iranian policymakers have long been interested in securing strategic depth and influence in Afghanistan. Following the overthrow of the Taliban regime in 2001, the Iranian government funded reconstruction projects in Afghanistan (including road construction projects) and provided aid to some warlords. This behavior was consistent with the activities of such regional powers as Pakistan, India, and Russia. Indeed, the Iranian strategy in Afghanistan after the overthrow of the Taliban is perhaps best characterized as a “hedging strategy.”\nThe Iranian government preferred a close relationship with the Afghan government, which it enjoyed with key Afghan policymakers. Iran and Afghanistan cooperated in trying to crack down on drugs passing over their shared border. They also participated in joint trade, energy, investment, cultural, and scientific projects. However, Iran also saw its involvement in Afghanistan as a hedge against a possible U.S. or Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities. This meant that Iran was prepared to undermine U.S. efforts in Afghanistan in the event of further deterioration of U.S.-Iranian relations. There was some evidence that individuals from the Iranian government, including from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps–Quds Force, provided some arms, money, and training to Taliban commanders and other insurgents. Examples included explosively formed penetrators, anti-tank mines, mortars, and small arms. However, there were limits to Iran’s willingness to support the Taliban and other insurgent groups. Iran historically had poor relations with the Taliban. As one Iranian diplomat noted in 1997, for example, Iran joined “Russia and the anti-Taliban alliance against Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the Taliban” because it was concerned about the rise of Sunni extremist groups like the Taliban.",

    "text": "Jihadist Support Another source of support for the insurgency in Afghanistan was the international jihadist network, which enabled the Taliban and other groups to sustain their operations and helped them become more lethal in attacks against Afghans and coalition forces. This support came from a variety of different jihadist sources. One source was organizations such as the international al Qaeda network. Afghan insurgent groups also received assistance from the collection of zakat (the Islamic concept of tithing and alms) at mosques in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the broader Muslim world. Finally, much of the jihadist funding came from wealthy Muslims abroad, especially from such Gulf states as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. For example, al Qaeda personnel regularly met with wealthy Arab businessmen during the Tabligh Jamaat annual meeting in Raiwind, Pakistan, which attracted one of the largest concentrations of Muslims after the hajj. The Taliban and other insurgent groups established a major support base through their cooperation with Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam. This Pakistani political party had its roots in the Deobandi movement and had a following largely confined to the Pashtun border belt of the North West Frontier Province and Baluchistan (although it also has support in several of Pakistan’s urban centers). The Deobandi movement developed in British-ruled India during the mid-1800s. It was an offshoot of the Sunni Hanafi legal school and took its name from the Indian Himalayan town of Deoband, the location of an influential religious school. The Deobandi movement aimed to reform and unify Muslims, preached strict adherence to the Sunnah (the way or deeds of the Prophet Muhammad), and emphasized the importance of shari’a law. Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam was split into two factions, led by Maulana Fazal ur-Rehman and Samiul Haq (a fervent supporter of Osama bin Laden). The party ran an extensive network of madrassas that trained most of the leadership and much of the early rank and file of the Taliban. Party links with the Taliban remained close, despite President Musharraf’s talk of reforming the madrassas. Indeed, Afghan insurgents long targeted recruits at madrassas and Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan. Al Qaeda played a critical role in the insurgency as a force multiplier, assisting insurgent groups such as the Taliban at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Groups such as the Taliban used support and training from jihadists to construct increasingly sophisticated IEDs, including IEDs with remote-control detonators. For example, there were a handful of al Qaeda–run training facilities and IED assembly facilities in such places as North and South Waziristan. They ranged from small facilities hidden in compounds to much larger “IED factories,” which doubled as training centers and labs where recruits experimented with IED technology. These facilities were located in such remote places as the Bush mountains, Khamran mountains, and Shakai valley. Al Qaeda received operational and financial support from local clerics and Taliban commanders in Waziristan. They recruited young Pashtuns from the local madrassas and financed their activities through “religious racket”—forced religious contribution, often accompanied with death threats. Some of this IED expertise came from Iraqi groups, which provided information to Afghan groups on making and using various kinds of remote-controlled devices and timers. Indeed, there is evidence of cooperation between insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan. Islamic militants in Iraq provided information through the Internet and face-to-face visits on tactics to Taliban, Hezb-i-Islami, and foreign fighters from eastern and southern Afghanistan and Pakistan’s tribal areas. In addition, there is some evidence that a small number of Pakistani and Afghan militants received military training in Iraq; Iraqi fighters met with Afghan and Pakistani extremists in Pakistan; and militants in Afghanistan increasingly used homemade bombs, suicide attacks, and other tactics honed in Iraq. The “TV bomb” is one example of an IED introduced to Afghan insurgents by Iraqi groups. This shaped-charge mechanism can be hidden under brush or debris on a roadside and set off by remote control from a distance of 300 yards or more.",

Afghan groups occasionally adopted brutal tactics like beheadings, mirroring Iraqi groups. In 2005, a video depicting the beheading of an Afghan hostage surfaced online. The Taliban also acquired new communication gear, field equipment, and received tactical, camouflage, and marksmanship training from Iraqi groups.  Furthermore, Afghan insurgents increasingly used suicide tactics, especially in cities like Kandahar and Kabul. Suicide attacks rose steadily: one in 2002, two in 2003, six in 2004, and twenty-seven in 2005, reaching 139 in 2006 and 140 in 2007. Al-Qaeda leaders like Ayman al-Zawahiri encouraged this tactic, advocating for \"martyrdom operations.\" Suicide bombers included Afghans, Pakistanis, and some foreigners, mostly from Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, often radicalized in Pakistani madrassas.",

Suicide attacks offered maximum impact with minimal resources. Conventional attacks had a 5% probability of inflicting casualties, while suicide attacks significantly increased this chance.

The Afghan National Police (ANP) was considered the least competent. German police trainers initially focused on training higher-ranking officers, but the US shifted focus to lower-level recruits due to concerns about the slow pace and limited scope of the German approach.  The US military later took over police training amidst concerns about mentoring, institutional reform, and corruption within the Ministry of Interior and the ANP.  Evidence suggests widespread corruption within the ANP, with officers accepting bribes and police chiefs skimming funds.

As a 2006 German assessment of the border police concluded, “Neither the Afghan border police nor the customs authorities are currently in a position to meet the challenges presented by this long border.”9 A report by the Oﬃces of Inspector General of the U.S. Departments of State and Defense concluded that the “ANP’s readiness level to carry out its internal security and conventional police responsibilities is far from adequate. The obstacles to establish a fully professional ANP are formidable.” It found that key obstacles included “no eﬀective ﬁeld training oﬃcer (FTO) program, illiterate recruits, a history of low pay and pervasive corruption, and an insecure environment.”10 ANP forces had a diﬃcult time even against criminal organizations. In February 2006, for example, ANP forces were attacked, captured, and disarmed by a drug cartel in Balkh Province after an armed clash.11 As Ali Jalali, former Afghan Minister of Interior, argued, “[B]ecause of the late start in comprehensive police development, the ANP continues to be ill-trained, poorly paid, under-equipped, and inadequately armed.”12 The ANP was vital to establishing order in urban and rural areas. But it was badly equipped, corrupt, poorly trained, and lacked any semblance of a national police infrastructure. There was little oversight at the provincial or district levels. The Afghan police lacked uniforms, armored vehicles, weapons, ammunition, police stations, police jails, national command and control, and investigative Afghanistan Security: Eﬀorts to Establish Army and Police Have Made Progress, but Future Plans Need to Be Better Deﬁned (Washington, D.C.: GAO, 2005). 9 Government of Germany, Doha II Conference on Border Management in Afghanistan: A Regional Approach (Berlin: Government of Germany, 2006).

Several factors contributed to the poor competence of the ANP. International training was not as good as it was for the ANA. The police were not an international priority in the early stages of the insurgency and received signiﬁcantly less money and attention than the ANA. Interviews with U.S. and German oﬃcials involved in police training suggest that there were signiﬁcant challenges with DynCorp, the U.S.-based company hired by the U.S. Department of State to implement police training at regional training centers across Afghanistan. One recurring criticism was wide variation in the quality of DynCorp police trainers. Some had signiﬁcant international police training experience and were competent in dealing with police in a tribal society in the middle of an insurgency. But many other DynCorp trainers had little experience or competence.14 The use of private contractors for police training or other tasks during counterinsurgency and nation-building operations has long been controversial.15 At the very least, the U.S. government should conduct a thorough assessment of the performance and eﬀectiveness of contractors in police training. In addition, the lack of follow-on mentoring meant that police were given a few weeks of training and sent back to their villages with no oversight and assistance. Most had never received formal police training.",

But the ANP lacked a comprehensive mentoring program. U.S. oﬃcials argued even in 2008 that security concerns in the south and east precluded the deployment of mentoring teams to rural areas. This meant that in areas where a competent ANP was essential because of the growing presence 13 McCaﬀrey, “Trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan.” 14 Author interviews with U.S. and German police oﬃcials, Afghanistan, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008. 15 On the role of civilian contractors for security sector reform, see, for example, P. W. Singer, Corporate Warriors: The Rise of the Privatized Military Industry (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003). 72 Counterinsurgency in Afghanistan of the Taliban, there was virtually no mentoring. The lack of mentoring made police more susceptible to local warlords. Indeed, ANP forces were frequently more loyal to local warlords, tribal leaders, and even criminal networks than to the central government. This reﬂects the weakness of the central government and the strength of nonstate actors in much of the country. In counterinsurgency operations, the police need to be involved in the community at all levels, such as monitoring border posts and patrolling cities, villages, and highways. Building the police in counter-insurgencies should be a higher priority than the creation of the army because the police are the primary arm of the government in towns and villages across the country. Unfortunately, this was not the case in Afghanistan. The ANP needed to be at the forefront of ﬁghting insurgents, illegal border incursions, illicit drug trade, warlords, and organized crime in Afghanistan, but they were overwhelmed. Unfor-tunately, the situation in Afghanistan is not unique—building a competent and legitimate police force has been a major challenge in numerous counterinsurgency and stability operations.16 Afghan National Army The available data suggest that the competence of ANA forces has improved since 2002, when training began. The United States was the lead nation for building the ANA, although French, British, Turkish, and other instructors from coalition countries were also involved.17 16 On policing during counterinsurgency and stability operations, see Robert B.

On training the ANA, also see Anja Manuel and P. W. Singer, “A New Model Afghan Army,” Foreign Aﬀairs, Vol. Afghan Government and Security Forces 73 Training commenced in May 2002, when the ANA’s ﬁrst regular army battalion began 10 weeks of infantry and combat training at the Kabul Military Training Center. U.S. special operations forces assigned to the U.S. Army’s 1st Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group provided the initial training.18 Combined Security Transition Command– Afghanistan, including Task Force Phoenix, then took over the bulk of ANA training. New Afghan recruits received training on basic riﬂe marksmanship; platoon and company-level tactics; use of heavy weapons; and engineering, scout, and medical skills. Desertion rates were initially high; Afghanistan’s 1st Battalion had a desertion rate of approximately 50 percent. But the rate eventually dropped to 10 percent per month by the summer of 2003, between 2 percent and 3 percent per month by 2004, and 1.25 percent per month by 2006.19 Several units of the ANA were deployed throughout Afghanistan to conduct combat operations against Taliban and other insurgent forces and to oversee the cantonment of heavy weapons. In July 2003, for example, the ANA launched Operation Warrior Sweep with U.S. forces in the Paktia Province against Taliban and al Qaeda forces. This was followed in November 2003 by Operation Mountain Resolve in the Nuristan and Kunar provinces. The ANA deployed outside of Kabul to stem interfactional ﬁghting in such areas as Herat and Maimana.

More than 2,500 ANA and coalition forces were involved in the operation.22 Evidence from ANA actions during these operations suggests three conclusions about their competence. First, ANA soldiers were usually tenacious fighters in battle and became more proficient in tactics, techniques, and procedures for fighting counterinsurgency warfare following U.S. and coalition training. This included combat proficiency, crowd control, and humanitarian assistance and civil-action 20 “Fighting in Afghanistan Leaves 40 Insurgents Dead,” American Forces Press Service, June 22, 2005. 21 “Coalition Launches ‘Operation Mountain Lion’ in Afghanistan,” American Forces Press Service, April 12, 2006. 22 U.S. Air Force F-15Es, A-10s and B-52s provided close air support to troops on the ground engaged in rooting out insurgent sanctuaries and support networks.

Opium was converted into morphine base, heroin (both white and brown), within Afghanistan, although the country lacked domestic production of precursor chemicals like acetic anhydride, which was smuggled in from various countries.  Processing labs were concentrated in Badakshan, Nangarhar, and Helmand provinces. The majority of the processed opiates were trafficked to Western markets, with some remaining for domestic consumption.  Trafficking routes were dynamic and adapted to law enforcement activities, primarily utilizing overland routes through Pakistan.  The drug trade provided revenue for warlords, insurgents, criminal organizations, and even some members of the Afghan government. A raid in June 2005 on the Helmand governor's office uncovered over nine metric tons of opium.  Cultivation saw a brief decline in 2005, likely due to government pressure and coercion, with the majority of eradication occurring in Nangarhar and Helmand.  However, cultivation rose again in 2006, highlighting the need for sustainable alternative livelihood programs to discourage opium production.",

Karzai became head of state in June 2002 and president in October 2004.  This indigenous interim government fostered a sense of ownership among the population. The U.S. maintained a light military footprint in Afghanistan to avoid large-scale resistance, believing small ground forces and airpower were sufficient for security and reluctant to engage in nation-building. This approach, while successful in overthrowing the Taliban, had drawbacks for the stability operation phase.  Too few U.S. and Afghan forces existed to stabilize the country, forcing Afghan militias to fill the security vacuum, which undermined the central government.

While clear, hold, and expand operations were effective, Pakistani forces didn't employ them consistently in critical areas against high- and mid-level Taliban members. Even in Afghanistan, these operations were restricted to smaller regions due to insufficient troop numbers for holding and expanding larger territories.\n\nArmed reconnaissance, patrolling suspected insurgent areas to gather information and initiate contact, proved crucial. In Afghanistan, it was carried out using various platforms and methods, including AC-130 gunships, UAVs, and ground patrols. These were geared towards \"hunter-killer\" missions to disrupt insurgent operations. UAVs assisted with reconnaissance, force protection, route surveillance, and target identification.\n\nSpecialized raiding forces were occasionally necessary for time-sensitive targeting beyond the capabilities of conventional forces. These forces varied, encompassing counterterrorist units, indigenous forces, and specially trained units. In Afghanistan, they often required dedicated mobility and access to intelligence, with streamlined command structures for optimal effectiveness. Their primary focus was targeting insurgent leadership and organization, with a secondary role in conducting raids within sensitive sanctuaries.\n\nClose air support significantly benefited small U.S. and Afghan units, proving especially valuable during intense engagements like Operation Anaconda. However, its applicability might be limited in urban settings or where sufficient indigenous air capacity exists.  Various aircraft, including AH-64 helicopters, AC-130 gunships, A-10 and F-14 fighters, and B-52 bombers, provided close air support in Afghanistan.

Flattened, horizontal command structures, enabling shorter sensor-to-shooter links, proved more effective and responsive. However, this wasn't always implemented well. Initially, Task Force Dagger had direct communication with the combatant commander, facilitating access to ground-level intelligence.  This efficiency decreased as higher command levels, like the 10th Mountain Division and 18th Airborne Corps, assumed control, adding layers of bureaucracy to operational approvals.\n\nThis tight control hindered initiative. Special forces often required approval from multiple headquarters for even minor operations, impeding their flexibility and responsiveness.  Future counterinsurgencies necessitate adapting organizational structures to empower lower-level operations. Well-trained, small-unit maneuvers are essential, particularly against dispersed insurgent forces.  Success often hinges on granting small-unit leaders the autonomy, resources, and firepower to engage the population and develop their own intelligence.\n\nMilitary doctrine needs to embrace decentralized networks with high individual independence and survivability.  This involves training company and battalion commanders in combined-arms warfare, civil-military operations, and intelligence development, granting them the authority typically reserved for higher command levels.

Civil-military operations also served as effective intelligence-gathering tools.

Mullah Mohammad is representing a huge umma [Muslim community], and a large nation is behind him.” Portraying the United States and other Western countries as dedicated to the destruction of Islam was a critical part of this eﬀort. As Mullah Dadullah argued, “God be praised, we now are aware of much of the U.S. plans. We know their target, which is within the general aim of wiping out Islam in this region.” The Taliban used young Pakistan-trained mullahs to glorify their cause in mosques in the east and south. These Taliban eﬀorts had mixed success in Afghanistan, with more success in Pakistan. Since mosques have historically served as a tipping point for major political upheavals in Afghanistan, Afghan government oﬃcials focused on mosques. As one NDS report noted, There are 107 mosques in the city of Kandahar out of which 11 are preaching anti-government themes. Our approach is to have all the pro-government mosques incorporated with the process and work on the eleven anti-government ones to change their attitude or else stop their propaganda and leave the area. Another major factor was the public campaign by Afghan religious ﬁgures. For example, in July 2005, the Ulema Council of Afghanistan called on the Taliban to abandon violence and support the Afghan government in the name of Islam. It also called on the religious scholars of neighboring countries—including Pakistan—to help counter the activities and ideology of the Taliban and other insurgent organizations. A number of Afghan Islamic clerics publicly supported the Afghan government and called the jihad un-Islamic. Moreover, the Ulema Council and some Afghan ulema issued fatwas, or religious decrees, that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing. They argued that suicide bombing does not lead to an eternal life in paradise, does not permit martyrs to see the face of Allah, and does not allow martyrs to have the company of 72 maidens in paradise. These eﬀorts to counter Taliban propaganda were made easier by the populations’ lingering resentment of the Taliban. Afghan support for the Taliban through 2007 was low. In one public opinion poll, for example, only 13 percent of Afghans had a favorable view of the Taliban.",

This reﬂects successful U.S. and Afghan government eﬀorts to balance representation in the government among the country’s ethnic groups. The Taliban has long drawn its membership from the Pashtuns. In the immediate aftermath of the December 2001 Bonn Conference, the Tajiks and Uzbeks (who comprised the Northern Alliance) ﬁlled key government positions with their own personnel. They also took control of the intelligence service and ministries of defense, interior, and foreign aﬀairs. This meant that there was a signiﬁcant absence of representation from the Pashtuns, as well as the Shia Muslim Hazaras from the center. One notable exception was the decision to name Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun, as interim president. By late 2003, however, the U.S. government and President Karzai made a concerted push to redress the ethnic balance at the levels of minister and deputy minister. For example, President Karzai appointed Ali Jalali, a Pashtun, as Minister of Interior, who began to appoint ethnically diverse governors and police chiefs. In addition, the Afghanistan and Pakistan governments encouraged the organization of traditional Pashtun councils (jirgas) to solicit the aid of local tribes in ﬁghting extremists. This included the use of tribal militias to help quell the growing power of the Taliban in Pashtun areas. The expansion of good governance and strong state institutions is probably the most eﬀective long-term solution. In sum, indigenous actors were most eﬀective in conducting information operations. The U.S. and other coalition governments tried to implement information operations to degrade insurgent decisionmaking and recruitment.",

    "text": "The U.S. experience working with coalition forces and other international actors was mixed. The counterinsurgency campaign—and security sector reform more broadly—was initially based on a “lead nation” approach. The United States was the lead donor nation for reconstructing the ANA; Germany was lead for police; the United Kingdom was lead for counternarcotics; Italy was lead for justice; and Japan (with UN assistance) was lead for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants. In theory, each lead nation was supposed to contribute significant financial assistance, coordinate external assistance, and oversee reconstruction efforts in its sector. In practice, this approach did not work as well as envisioned. The United States provided the bulk of assistance in most security sectors—including counternarcotics, police, and the army. In other areas, such as the justice sector and the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants, there was little measurable improvement. Counterinsurgency operations are generally complex, demanding, and expensive. Even major powers like the United States need cooperation from others, especially on such issues as basing rights, overflight rights, intelligence, combat forces, economic assistance, and political support. Bilateral donors, international organizations, development banks, and military alliances have different comparative advantages and can provide valuable resources to counterinsurgency. In the absence of broad multilateral support, counterinsurgency operations may not have sufficient military, economic, and political resources to establish security. In addition, the absence of multilateral participation may increase the likelihood that some states will undermine the operation. NATO’s forces in Afghanistan were generally competent. But the NATO experience in Afghanistan highlights several drawbacks with multilateral operations. One was the variation in political will of coalition partners. NATO’s International Security Assistance Force was severely limited by the political-military rules of engagement, which constrained each of the national contingents. Some countries, such as Canada and Britain, were reliable allies who were willing to fight—and die—in Afghanistan. During Operation Medusa in 2006, for example, Canadian military forces fought a conventional battle against Taliban forces in Kandahar Province. The Taliban used crew-served weapons and rocket-propelled grenades and engaged from fixed positions. But most NATO countries, such as Germany and Norway, had national caveats that severely restricted their ability to fight. Another drawback was the variation in capabilities. Several coalition countries lacked adequate enabler forces—including attack and lift helicopters, smart munitions, intelligence, engineers, medical, logistics, and digital command and control—to fully leverage and sustain their ground combat power.",

    "text": "One of the most innovative aspects of the Afghan counterinsurgency campaign was its civil-military programs—especially the use of PRTs. PRTs were made up of roughly 60 to 100 soldiers, including civil affairs units, special forces, force protection units, and psychological operations personnel. U.S. PRTs also included less than a half dozen State Department, USAID, and other U.S. government personnel. U.S. PRTs were generally successful in helping strengthen the reach of the central government. They also were successful in providing security at events like the Loya Jirga and during elections. They facilitated reconstruction by funding projects like school repairs or by helping the State Department, USAID, and Department of Agriculture representatives implement civilian-funded projects. The success of NATO PRTs varied somewhat. They tended to be more successful when working closely with the local population to coordinate reconstruction projects and secure their area of operations. The UK-led PRT in Mazar-e Sharif helped mediate several instances of interfactional fighting and was successful in helping stabilize the region. In contrast, the German-led PRT in Konduz could travel only within a 30-kilometer radius and avoided areas where there was significant factional fighting. Based on interviews with NATO forces, this variation in PRT activity appears at least partly to be a function of domestic politics. In some countries, such as Germany, the aversion to casualties impacted PRT and broader civil-military operations. As one German soldier argued, “The German government is risk averse, especially for anything more than peacekeeping operations.",

    "text": "A lead indigenous role in counterinsurgency is often preferable to a lead U.S. role for several reasons. Indigenous security forces typically know the population and terrain better than U.S. forces and are more familiar with social and cultural conditions. A lead U.S. role may elicit a strong nationalist or religious backlash among the population. In much of the Muslim world, anti-U.S. sentiment is high. This suggests that a large U.S. presence in a predominantly Muslim country may trigger widespread unrest. Finally, a lead indigenous role can provide a focal point for national aspirations in tandem with competent security forces and good governance.\nA glaring deficiency in Afghanistan was the poor quality of the police. Due to the nature of their work, police are the first line of defense against insurgents. They have close contact with local populations and will inevitably have a good intelligence picture of insurgent activity. The failure of the police to combat insurgents and undermine their support base can be fatal to counterinsurgency efforts. This means that a major focus of the U.S. military and other government agencies should be to improve the competence of police through training, mentoring, and equipping. There is currently a plethora of U.S. government agencies involved in police training and equipping. However, they are plagued by a paucity of funding and civilian police. This forces the United States to either rely on contractors or other states or organizations.\nUnlike the police, the ANA’s competence improved in the early stages of the counterinsurgency campaign. This was primarily a result of training provided by U.S. and other coalition forces, as well as the integration of indigenous forces into kinetic and nonkinetic operations. The same cannot be said for the ANP, which suffered from a lack of attention, low levels of initial funding, no initial mentoring, corruption, and a paucity of loyalty to the central government. The Department of Defense needs to be involved in rethinking police training.",

    "text": "There are at least three options for police training. First, the Department of Defense could create specialized police units within the U.S. military or provide predeployment training for an active-duty Army military police brigade. Second, the U.S. government could create police units within a federal law enforcement agency that could be deployed abroad. Third, the U.S. government could fund additional positions within state and selected metropolitan police departments with the understanding that these officers would be available for deployment abroad as part of a federal effort. Additional analysis is necessary to assess these options.\nBorder Security\nOutside assistance was critical to the Afghan insurgents’ success in the early stages of the insurgency. Support from the Pakistan government, Pashtun tribes, al Qaeda, and the global jihadist network was crucial to the survivability of insurgent forces. Insurgent groups adapted their tactics and techniques during the counterinsurgency campaign and became veritable learning organizations. They adopted suicide tactics, increasingly sophisticated IEDs, and networked organizational structures involving small cells. Since the success of insurgent groups is highly correlated with their ability to acquire external support, the U.S. military needs to improve indigenous capabilities in denying support. Perhaps the most important is improving border security. A major part of the solution is diplomatic and involves negotiations with neighboring countries to curb cross-border activity. In Afghanistan, the United States and other coalition partners failed to alter the will or capacity of the Pakistan government to decrease cross-border activity. Some technological capabilities may improve border security. For uncontrolled border areas, such as the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, these capabilities might include a range of sensors and platforms to detect insurgent movement. Efforts along these lines might also include training and equipping indigenous forces to conduct patrols, utilize a range of technologies, interdict insurgent forces, and work with neighboring governments to enforce border security.",

The military and political authorities need to utilize diplomatic and other means to encourage neighboring states to curb recruitment campaigns for insurgents, close training camps, and conduct a sustained counterinsurgency campaign that undermines popular support for insurgents and captures or kills leaders and guerrillas. Insurgents’ ability to maintain sanctuary in neighboring countries can be lethal to a successful counterinsurgency effort. The second area requiring new capabilities is countering the external financing of insurgent groups. The U.S. government needs to continue pressuring foreign governments to curb the financing of insurgent groups from diaspora populations and wealthy financiers—in close cooperation with the Department of State, Department of Treasury, and other U.S. and coalition partners.\nGround Combat\nMilitary force is usually most effective when used in ways that are considered legitimate; it is also more effective when used by locals and not external actors. The most effective use of military force in a counterinsurgency includes two types of ground combat capabilities. First, one of the most successful approaches in Afghanistan was clear, hold, and expand. Forces are assigned to contested areas to regain government presence and control and then conduct military and civil-military programs to expand the control and edge out insurgents. The focus is on consolidating and holding ground that is clearly progovernment; protecting the government and other key resources; and deploying counterinsurgency forces to conduct offensive operations in contested areas. Holding territory proved to be the most difficult facet of clear, hold, and expand in Afghanistan due to the low number of U.S. and local forces. This suggests that sufficient numbers of forces are needed to hold territory once it is cleared, or insurgents can retake it.",

Where possible, U.S. counterinsurgency forces should be kept to a minimum and supported with civil-affairs and psychological operations units. Clear, hold, and expand involves conducting operations in ever-increasing zones around military bases. The first measure for force protection is to target and eliminate the insurgents living within the inner zone—defined by mission, enemy, troops, terrain, and time around their base. This requires living among the local population for long durations to gain trust and support and the ability to separate the locals from the insurgents. The secondary zone is the transit and support zone for the insurgents. Occasional operations need to be conducted in these areas to show the flag and keep the population neutral to the idea of supporting the insurgents. Second is the development of an armed reconnaissance capability and a specialized raiding force. Armed reconnaissance is the patrolling of suspected insurgent areas to glean information on their activities, initiate contact, or confirm the area is clear. A specialized raiding force is sometimes required to conduct time-sensitive targeting beyond the scope of conventional forces. These specialized raiding forces may consist of a counterterrorist unit, an indigenous strike force, or a specially formed and trained unit drawn from organic forces.",

The effectiveness of close air support in counterinsurgency operations made it particularly useful for the United States to continue to develop technological capabilities such as GPS-based systems and SOFLAMs. For much the same reason, it was also useful to continue to develop new and more sophisticated communication equipment. Air mobility capabilities are also likely to be important. In most developing countries, indigenous forces are unlikely to possess significant air mobility assets, and the United States may need to provide air transport. Close air support provided a particularly significant advantage to small groups of U.S. and Afghan forces operating against insurgents. This lesson may not be applicable to all counterinsurgency operations, especially those conducted in urban areas.  A variety of aircraft can provide close air support to U.S. and indigenous forces. \nThe problem of destroying insurgent groups and their supporters is often one of finding them. This makes access to reliable and actionable information of paramount importance. The U.S. military needs to continue developing capabilities for collecting, analyzing, and acting quickly on intelligence.  Advanced technologies were sometimes helpful in identifying insurgents. However, insurgents were frequently able to adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures to avoid these collection methods. This makes HUMINT particularly important—including HUMINT gathered by indigenous intelligence and security services, as well as local tribes and militias. Civil-military programs can also be utilized to build trust with locals. The development of analytical tools to process information is also important. Effective analysis capability is a critical component of any intelligence capability. Counterinsurgency operations require the development of an analytical methodology to measure the insurgency’s impact on the local population—especially the impact of the security condition. A number of factors can make it difficult to measure the effectiveness of counterinsurgency operations: Progress cannot be measured by the advance of militaries across a map as in conventional warfare; focusing only on guerrilla fighters misses the much broader\n",

Outcomes are conditions impacting the local population, the consequences of efforts. Without outcome measures, policymakers lack objective success/failure assessments.  Key outcome indicators include attack trends against the local population and public opinion trends. These are difficult to measure, especially where systematic data collection is lacking, like Afghanistan.  Building such assessments into assistance programs and encouraging host nations to do the same will improve counterinsurgency operations. Key indicators might include: insurgent violence trends (number, lethality, location of attacks); public opinion trends (local perceptions of safety); other indicators (e.g., nighttime activity in villages, travel outside villages). In Somalia, metrics included starvation death rates, gunshot wound patients, and AK-47 prices.  All outcome measures should tie to mission objectives.",

Each grid square was surveilled and marked as empty or suspicious. Suspicious activity triggered further investigation and potential deployment of forces. Timing was critical; finding insurgents required significant time and resources. Hunter-killer platforms engaged immediately upon discovery, maintaining contact until reinforcements arrived.\nThis gridding method resembles British tactics in Malaya and U.S. tactics in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the Hamlet Evaluation System measured “pacification” with objectives like determining government or insurgent control. Subjective measures gauged quality of life, assessing whether residents lived in tranquility or faced harassment.  Crucially, separate reports were prepared independently by the U.S. Senior District Advisor and the Vietnamese District Commander, preventing biased conclusions. Reports were compared at higher levels, providing statistical averages for hamlets, villages, districts, and provinces. Secure areas were classified A, B, or C; guerrilla-controlled areas were D or E. Analysis revealed that large-unit sweeps only promoted pacification if U.S. forces remained in the area.",

    "text": "Future counterinsurgency may require adapting organizational structures. Empowering lower-level operations and well-trained small units are crucial. Competent insurgents disperse, becoming smaller, harder to target, with better communication, camouflage, and diversions.  Success is more likely when small-unit leaders have leeway, specialized assets, and firepower to engage the population, develop intelligence, and fight. Doctrine and training should prepare company/battalion commanders for combined-arms warfare, civil-military operations, and intelligence development. Infantry commanders need the responsibility, autonomy, and distance from higher headquarters currently held only by special forces A-team commanders.  They need authority to make decisions currently made at battalion/brigade levels. Flattening command and control from hierarchical to horizontal, with shorter sensor-to-shooter links, improves effectiveness and battlefield flexibility.\nIn Afghanistan, strategic command and control presented challenges: coordinating the overall counterinsurgency (ideally led by the indigenous government); coordinating among international forces (separate U.S./NATO chains of command created confusion); and coordinating within the U.S. effort (poor military-civilian agency coordination). Options for improvement include civilian leadership (ambassador or special envoy), military leadership, or an interagency working group.",

    "text": "Insurgents sometimes make religion a significant part of their rhetoric to gain popular support. Since mosques have historically served as a tipping point for major political upheavals in Afghanistan, Afghan government officials have targeted mosques. The Ulema Council of Afghanistan called on the Taliban to abandon violence and support the Afghan government in the name of Islam. They also called on the religious scholars of neighboring countries—including Pakistan—to help counter the activities and ideology of the Taliban and other insurgent organizations. A number of Afghan Islamic clerics publicly supported the Afghan government and called the jihad un-Islamic. Moreover, the Ulema Council and a number of Afghan ulema have issued fatwas, or religious decrees, that unambiguously oppose suicide bombing. Indigenous efforts to influence the population, especially credible actors such as Muslim clerics and tribal leaders, were the most successful.\n\nThe Afghan government suffered from significant governance problems, such as its failure to stem the rising drug trade and corruption in key areas like the justice system. While civilian agencies should lead efforts to rebuild the justice system, the military needs to play an important role as well. This means establishing civil-affairs teams that can work in key areas of the justice system, such as establishing courts to prosecute insurgents, terrorists, and major criminals involved in such activities as drug trafficking. Effectively prosecuting “spoilers”—including insurgents—is critical to the success of a counterinsurgency campaign. The failure to adequately deal with these individuals undermines counterinsurgency efforts. In addition, pretrial detention facilities and prisons are often in poor condition in developing countries. Compounding this problem, donor states may be reluctant to become involved in rebuilding a system with a reputation for significant human rights violations. The military can help fill this gap.\n\nReconstruction teams should be a core component of counterinsurgency operations, and involve both military and civilian personnel. In the U.S. government, this includes personnel from such organizations as USAID and the Departments of State, Justice, Treasury, and Agriculture. These teams should become involved in a wide variety of projects that range from assisting the local population with basic health care; helping improve basic services such as water and electricity; and rebuilding schools, government buildings, and hospitals. Reconstruction programs should be designed to gain support for the indigenous government, rather than for the United States or other external actors. As Israeli General Moshe Dayan argued, “foreign troops never win the hearts of the people” and generally do not gain support for the host government. In areas where there is significant insurgent violence, the U.S. military may need to provide a greater percentage of civil-military assistance, since they are better prepared to operate in hostile environments. These nonkinetic operations are a critical weapon in an indigenous government’s battle for popular support. The U.S. military should deploy civil affairs units with training and experience in such areas as public administration, public safety, public health, and legal systems. Again, the focus of the U.S. military and other international actors should be to improve the indigenous government’s ability to rebuild and provide essential services—not to do it for them. This is a key aspect of any attempt to secure popular support and legitimacy for the government.",

    "section": "Improving Counterinsurgency Effectiveness",
    "text": "One of the most innovative aspects of the Afghan counterinsurgency campaign was the inclusion of civil-military programs—especially the use of PRTs. The PRT concept can help strengthen the reach of the central government and rebuild essential services. PRTs can facilitate reconstruction by funding projects such as school repairs or by helping Department of State, USAID, and Department of Agriculture representatives to implement civilian-funded projects. However, there are several barriers to the successful implementation of PRTs. One is staffing hurdles. Short tours of duty—such as three-month tours—make it difficult for PRT members to develop an understanding of local politics and culture. A second is a scarcity of PRTs, which need to reach beyond urban areas into rural areas, where insurgent support may be strongest. In Afghanistan, they had little operational reach in rural areas. Since insurgents are often better able to build support networks and capture territory in rural areas, PRTs need to spread to rural areas. This is where Team Village missions can be effective. In Afghanistan, Team Village units—which usually included a mix of civil affairs and psychological operations personnel—were tasked with conducting civil-military operations within a larger campaign. Team Villages also included tactical HUMINT teams, interpreters, military police, media and public affairs personnel, medical personnel, and local Afghan forces. Health care operations can be particularly successful in winning support among the locals. Local villagers can be treated for everything from mild bumps and bruises to more serious injuries and illnesses. Although these patients can be treated from the backs of the high-mobility multipurpose-wheeled vehicles, such care is better tended in a secure compound arranged by the locals. Also, it is key to have a female medic available to treat the women and children.\n\nGood governance involves the provision of essential services to the population by a central authority in a timely manner. This includes the process by which those in authority are selected, monitored, and replaced (the political dimension); the government’s capacity to effectively manage its economic resources and implement sound policies (the economic dimension); and the respect of citizens and the state for the country’s institutions (the institutional dimension). The U.S. military is generally not the primary actor for governance and institution-building during counterinsurgency operations. Nonetheless, it should play a critical role in encouraging good governance by helping the indigenous authorities deal with corruption, improve the criminal justice system, and disarm militias. In the long term, poor governance can undermine a counterinsurgency effort by undermining popular support for the government. Thus it is important to ensure coordination between other actors involved in governance: UN agencies such as the UN Development Programme; regional organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; and a broad range of non-governmental organizations. The failure of governance in key provinces—such as Helmand and Kandahar—has seriously undermined counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 1940, the U.S. Marine Corps’ Small Wars Manual perceptively noted that “the history of the United States shows that in spite of the varying trend of the foreign policy of succeeding administrations, this Government has interposed or intervened in the affairs of other states with remarkable regularity.” It continued with the contention that since these types of missions would likely recur in the future, “it is well that the United States may be prepared for any emergency which may occur.” This assessment is just as true today as it was in the 1940s. Indeed, the United States has been involved in numerous counterinsurgencies throughout its history in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The challenge is to improve its ability to engage more effectively in counterinsurgency operations in the future.",

    "text": "This April, 1962 symposium was held at a time when Kennedy Administration officials were focusing increasingly on the growing communist insurgency in Vietnam and on the verge of radically expanding the numbers, roles, and types of U.S. military forces in that country. The purpose of the symposium was to distill lessons and insights from past insurgent conflicts that might help to inform and shape the U.S. involvement in Vietnam and to foster the effective prosecution of other future counterinsurgency campaigns. To gather these lessons and insights, RAND brought to the same conference table twelve U.S. and allied officers and civilian officials who had expertise and a proven record of success in some aspects of guerrilla or counterinsurgency warfare. As their biographies will testify, the accomplishments and backgrounds of the symposium’s formal participants gave their views significant credibility. Each participant could claim firsthand experience with guerrilla or counterinsurgent operations in one or more of the following post-World War II conflicts: Algeria, China, Greece, Kenya, Laos, Malaya, Oman, South Vietnam, and the Philippines. Three of the participants had led or operated with anti-Japanese guerrilla or guerrilla-type units in Burma and the Philippines during World War II. During five days of meetings, the participants exchanged views on a wide spectrum of topics relating to the political, military, economic, intelligence, and psychological measures required to defeat insurgencies. Convinced that the fundamental verities of effective counterinsurgency policy and practice that were elucidated by the participants remain as valid today as they were 44 years ago, RAND decided to republish the symposium proceedings. Among the insights that emerged from the discussions, the reader will find a number of counterinsurgency best practices that seem especially germane to the insurgency challenges confronted today by the United States and its allies. These include discussions of the counterinsurgent’s need to:\n\n• Identify and redress the political, economic, military, and other issues fueling the insurgency\n• Gain control over and protect the population, which the counterinsurgent must see as the prime center of gravity in any counterinsurgency conflict\n• Establish an immediate permanent security presence in all built-up areas cleared of enemy forces\n• Accumulate extensive, fine-grained human and other intelligence on insurgent plans, modes of operation, personnel, and support networks\n• Avoid actions that might antagonize the population\n• Convince the population that they represent the “winning side” and intend to prevail until complete victory is secured\n\nThe participants also discussed measures to control borders (particularly effective in Algeria), techniques for countering and conducting ambushes, and the utility of mounting “false insurgent” operations. They also addressed the issue of when and how the counterinsurgent knows he is winning, and came to a consensus that the most important indicators of success were when the people voluntarily cooperated in providing intelligence and were willing to disregard insurgent orders.",

    "text": "This is a report on the Symposium on Counterinsurgency that was held at The RAND Corporation’s Washington Office during the week of April 16, 1962. The Symposium was sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and was organized and chaired by Stephen T. Hosmer of RAND’s Social Science Department. The basic rationale in undertaking the Symposium was that, rather than approach the problems of guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare theoretically and academically, it might be useful to draw on the knowledge of men of recent and direct experience in counterinsurgency, with a view to assembling a large body of detailed information and judgment on the multifarious aspects of this inadequately explored form of conflict. It was hoped that such a pragmatic approach would not only provide fruitful insights into earlier struggles but would, above all, yield valuable lessons for the future. The main criterion in the selection of the participants, therefore, was that each have firsthand and successful experience in some phase of insurgent or counterinsurgent operations. RAND was most fortunate in being able to bring together the particular group of military and civilian experts who constituted the Symposium.* The biographic information about the participants’ background and achievements reflects not only their unusually high caliber but also the diversity of their experience, knowledge, and special skills. Some of these men had been combat leaders; some occupied headquarters positions; still others were engaged in highly specialized activities such as civic action or operations research into weapons and communications technology. Together, they combined the experience of some nine different theaters of insurgency during the last twenty years, including such key areas as Malaya, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Kenya, and Algeria. *Since not all the participants were able to attend every meeting, the schedule was so planned as to permit those whose time was limited to be present at the discussions that bore on their own experience and special interests. To derive maximum benefit from this wealth and variety of expertise, the Symposium was conducted in a manner that would encourage the freest possible exchange of ideas and experiences. Hence there were no formal papers, but only informal roundtable discussions in which the members of the group were asked to present their opinions and to draw freely on their recollections of problems encountered and techniques employed in their areas of operations. To give the Symposium a degree of structure and continuity, “Proposed Terms of Reference” (see Appendix) were drafted and distributed to the participants in advance of the meetings to serve, not as a rigid agenda, but as a general outline and guide to the discussions. As was inevitable in view of the scope and complexity of the subject, not all aspects of counterinsurgency could be covered exhaustively. Some that might have been treated in greater detail, had time permitted it, were only touched on in passing, and some aspects were not discussed at all. Then again, several points were more prominently debated than had been envisaged. The summary of the discussions, which constitutes the present report, follows the order and progression of the meetings as closely as possible in the hope of conveying something of the spontaneous character of the talks and the manner in which certain findings and generalizations evolved. It is hoped that the detailed subheadings at the beginning of each section will prove useful in orienting the reader whose interest may be confined to particular questions. (The ten sections of the report correspond to the ten half-day sessions of the Symposium, and a listing of the participants present appears at the beginning of each section.) The report was prepared by our rapporteur, Sibylle Crane, who attended all sessions and was able also to consult the taped recordings of the proceedings. Each participant in the Symposium had an opportunity to read and amend in draft form all statements in the report that were attributed to him. It is well to realize that, with a few exceptions, the officers and civilians who took part in the Symposium were intimately associated only with particular phases of the larger campaigns in which they served, and their experience was often confined to one geographic sector of",

    "text": "LT. COL. CHARLES T. R. BOHANNAN, AUS-RET., has been intimately associated with the major events in the Philippines in the last two decades, playing an important role, in particular, in the struggle against the communist (Hukbalahap) insurgent movement of the postwar period. A geologist, archaeologist, and cartographer prior to his enlistment in the U.S. Army in 1941, he saw combat in various Pacific theaters during World War II and took part in the liberation of the Philippine Islands from the Japanese. He returned to the newly independent Philippine Republic in 1946 and, for the next three years, participated in the anti-Huk campaign as a counterintelligence officer, thus gaining firsthand, authoritative knowledge of the nature of guerrilla warfare and the principles and techniques of counterinsurgency. In the later phases of the campaign, he served in Manila as JUSMAG advisor on unconventional operations to the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Col. Bohannan, who now makes his home in the Philippine Islands, is the coauthor, with Col. Napoleon D. Valeriano, of Counterguerrilla Operations: Lessons from the Philippines, published by Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., New York, 1962.\n\nCOL. WENDELL W. FERTIG, USA-RET., won great distinction during World War II as a guerrilla leader in the Philippines. A mining engineer and army reserve officer, he was superintendent of the largest iron mine in the Philippines at the outbreak of the war, when he volunteered for active duty with the Corps of Engineers of the Philippines Department of the U.S. Army. After the fall of the Philippines, Col. Fertig organized and commanded the Philippine-American guerrilla forces on Mindanao and, during the next three years of the Japanese occupation, developed them into a highly trained and effective force. His efforts did much to pave the way for the return of the American forces to Mindanao in 1945. Between the end of the war and his retirement from the service in 1956, Col. Fertig’s assignments included a tour as professor of military science and tactics at the Colorado School of Mines (1947-1951); the post of Deputy Chief of Psychological Warfare, Department of the Army (1951-1953); and that of Deputy Director of the Joint Staff of PROVMAAG-Korea (1954-1955). Today, Col. Fertig is a practicing mining-engineer consultant in Denver, Colorado. He is a frequent lecturer on guerrilla and psychological warfare and has issued a number of publications on the subject in the last ten years.",

Valeriano served with the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces on Luzon until General MacArthur’s return in 1945, when he joined the 1st Cavalry Division of the Sixth Army and participated in the Philippine liberation campaign. Among his numerous staff and command positions after the war was that of commander of the 7th Battal- ion Combat Team, which achieved spectacular results under his leadership in 1949/1950 against the communist Huk guerrillas on Luzon. Col. Valeriano subsequently served as military assis- tant to President Magsaysay; commander of the Presidential Guards Battalion; Secretary to the Philippine National Security Council; and national Security Co-ordinator for the Philippines. From 1954 to 1955 he was in South Vietnam on loan to the U.S. Military Mission. Thereafter, he became the Philippine Military Attaché in Thailand and his country’s military representative to the SEATO Secretariat. Col. Valeriano resigned his commission in 1957. He is coauthor, with Lt. Col. Charles T. R. Bohannan, of Counterguerrilla Operations: Lessons from the Philippines, published by Frederick A. Praeger, Inc., New York, 1962. COL. JOHN F. WHITE, OBE, AAR, gained his most valuable experience in counterinsurgent strategy and tactics during the emergency in Malaya. A graduate of the Royal Military College of Australia, he had previously served with the Australian Parachute Battalion (1941-1946) and had spent five years as instructor at the Royal Military College and the Australian Parachute School. He had been a company commander and brigade major during the Korean war (1951- 1952). In the latter part of 1957, following three years in Australia on various instructional and staff duties and a brief tour of duty in Singapore, he assumed command of the Third Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment in Malaya, where for two years he successfully employed a large variety of counterinsurgent techniques against the communist terrorists. In I960 Col. White attended the U.S. Armed Forces Staff College. For the past two years he has been his country’s Military Attaché in the United States. LT. COL. SAMUEL V. WILSON has been concerned with aspects of insurgency and counter- insurgency throughout his distinguished military career. An officer in the U.S. Infantry (Spe- cial Forces qualified), he taught guerrilla and counterguerrilla tactics at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, in 1942 and early 1943. He then joined the 5307th Composite Unit known as “Merrill’s Marauders,” with whom he participated in the North Burma campaign in 1943/1944. He was highly decorated for his part in this campaign, which essentially was one of guerrilla tactics and operations. After the war Col. Wilson was chosen to undergo training in the army’s four-year program for foreign area specialists. His general field of specialization was Russia, and his particular area of intensive research was the Soviet partisan movement of World War II.

HOSMER saW was to assemble some of the wealth of the participants' experience and knowledge of the subject; and to permit a free exchange of ideas and opinions, in\nthe hope of identifying principles and techniques of guerrilla and counter- guerrilla warfare that would be useful to all those who today are concerned with that problem. The approach, therefore, was to be practical rather than academic Instead of formal papers there would be intensive round-table discussion, for which the Proposed Terms of Reference that had been distributed to the par- ticipants in advance of the meetings were to serve as & general guide rather than a rigid agenda MR. HOSMER then invited debate and comment, with the suggestion that the following opening questions from the Terms of Reference might serve as a useful of departure: What conditions cause guerrilla movements?

    "section": "Revolutionary Wars and Guerrilla Motivation",
    "text": "Revolutionary wars often begin during periods of military and political upheaval, with insurgents exploiting leadership vacuums, recent military experience, and readily available arms. However, there are exceptions, such as Colombia, Cuba, China, and the Boer War. Communists frequently usurp nationalist movements, capitalizing on existing disorganization and public willingness to fight, initially concealing their true intentions. Individual guerrilla motivation varies. In the Philippines, joining guerrilla cadres was sometimes the only alternative to torture. Initial guerrilla bands, often composed of desperate individuals, occasionally produced capable leaders who drove the movement's growth. The Communist Party in France successfully recruited cadres among African students, appealing to those with little to lose and much to gain. However, this overlooks the genuine believers in communist or other ideals who often become outstanding insurgent leaders. Many Filipinos, for example, voluntarily joined the guerrillas despite the dangers, driven by a fervent belief in freedom. Dedicated individuals were also present in guerrilla companies, highlighting that successful campaigns require more than just rowdies. A viable guerrilla movement needs a political basis centered around a motivating factor. Four major guerrilla motivations exist: belief in the movement's ideals, personal ambition, fear, and the desire to join a successful movement. In the Philippines, the willingness to fight for liberty and democratic government significantly contributed to the guerrilla movement's eventual success. A study based on interviews with captured Malayan terrorists emphasized the importance of an individual's stake in the movement. In Malaya, post-war communist forces, led by former anti-Japanese resistance leaders, attracted members who found terrorizing more appealing than working. Identifying the transition point where control shifts from low-level bandits to communist leaders remains a challenge.",

    "text": "A key advantage for guerrilla leaders lies in offering potential recruits more than just protection from other bullies.  In the Philippines, aligning with an outside power promising aid and referencing American successes facilitated control. In 1947 China, superior organization and dedication enabled communist success despite a tradition of banditry. However, banditry's role in guerrilla movements is often overstated, with China being a primary exception. In the Philippines, Malaya, and other theaters, appeals primarily focused on the people's interests. In Colombia, banditry devoid of ideology outlasted the guerrilla movement itself, which communists never controlled.  Hard-core communists engage in long-term groundwork for takeover, resorting to military means only when political means fail (e.g., Indochina and the Philippines). Identifying areas where communist cadres operate is crucial for timely intervention. The counterinsurgent faces a significant disadvantage if the insurgent develops unnoticed or unchecked. Once insurgents establish some control, rival clandestine organizations become impossible.  Distinguishing between two communist guerrilla warfare initiation scenarios is vital: exploiting existing resentment versus culminating years of planning and organization (e.g., Central Vietnam).  The Philippines presents minimal concern for communist insurgency, while Indonesia's economic chaos makes it vulnerable. Cambodia lacks major conflicts, while Burma's racial and religious issues offer exploitable possibilities. Poverty in India and the East-West Pakistan conflict provide fertile ground for communist propaganda. Ceylon's diverse races and languages warrant attention.  In many Near East countries, wealth and power concentration alongside widespread poverty pose a problem, especially in Iran. Saudi Arabia's issue is mitigated by its sparse population, while Libya's oil resources could exacerbate its situation. Tunisia and Morocco's unemployment presents a potential vulnerability to communist exploitation. Sub-Saharan African countries' problems are largely colonial in nature.",

    "section": "Terrain, Popular Support, and Insurgency",
    "text": "The ideal guerrilla operating site is an island with poor communications, sea access, and a mountainous, food-producing interior with year-round rain. Mindanao's terrain provided advantages over Luzon's open plains, which favored Japanese tanks and forced guerrillas into inhospitable mountains. However, post-war communists troubled the Philippine government on Luzon despite its open terrain and good communications, highlighting the importance of a strong political base and armed force. Terrain becomes less critical once insurgents establish a foothold; population density then becomes decisive. A secure base is political, not physical. It involves winning over or neutralizing the local population, who refuse to cooperate with the enemy even after the guerrillas leave.  Guerrilla survival depends on superior intelligence, achieved through popular support. Initially, the population comprises three groups: pro-guerrilla, neutral, and hostile. Guerrilla leaders must leverage the friendly group to control the majority and neutralize the hostile minority. This applies to indigenous communist insurgencies, while guerrilla movements based on enemy invasion and occupation start with vast popular support, with hostility and apathy confined to a small group. This key difference distinguishes World War II guerrillas from present communist-organized warfare. In Vietnam, both sides compete for the politically apathetic majority.  South and Central America possess elements conducive to insurgent movements: vast lower-class poverty, concentrated upper-class wealth, and a negligible middle class. Chile exemplifies these conditions, but its length and northern desert terrain hinder effective organization. Ecuador and Bolivia are considered major South American danger zones. Any Pacific-facing Latin American country is a potential candidate for guerrilla warfare. Chinese experts' involvement in Colombia suggests potential plans to foster insurgency west and southwest of the Caribbean once the situation stabilizes. Recent events in Guatemala, Bolivia, and Ecuador support this theory, with Chinese communist influence seemingly expanding on Latin America's Pacific side, driven by favorable economic and social imbalances and other potential motives.",

    "section": "Psychological Effect of Challenging Pan-Americanism and the Role of Foreign Advisors",
    "text": "Apropos of the often-expressed fear that Castro may export his revolution to other Latin American countries, MR HOSMER raised the question of the function and importance of foreign experts and advisors both in preparing the ground politically and in training the future guerrillas militarily. Can this be accomplished with a relatively small corps of specialists? The Communists, COL GALULA maintained, object to this in principle and would have the natives do the work; even if it takes time, rather than inject Russian or Chinese advisors directly. COL. VALERIANO pointed out, however, that rebellions can be, and often are, prepared by an outside power, which will train and indoctrinate indigenous groups of individuals abroad and then send such skilled cadres back in to lead the insurgent movement. A classic example is the case of Fidel Castro, who, after an abortive attempt to seize power, fled to Mexico, underwent intensive training under the well-known communist guerrilla trainer Colonel and returned to Cuba with a cadre that included Raul Castro and Che Guevara. As one of several instances where outside leadership had been evident at the site of the rebellion, especially in the formative and early phases of a guerrilla war, MR GREENE mentioned American and Indonesian communist agents in the Philippines who helped with the political organization. COL. BOHANNAN added that this help extended also to training of the field army, but he stressed the inconspicuous advisory, rather than leading, function of these foreign nationals. In Malaya, on the other hand, said COL WHITE, where 92 per cent of the guerrillas were Chinese, there was no supply or help, and little influence, from without; and MR TANHAM pointed out that the Vietminh, too, had only minimal outside assistance until the Chinese reached the border. Apart from any question of direct leadership and physical aid, COL. GALULA said, the doctrinal influence of Communist China was very apparent in Indochina. It manifested itself, for instance, in 1949 in the Vietminh's radical change of attitude toward their prisoners from the previous rough treatment to the Chinese principle of decent treatment and suasion with a view to political conversion.",

The Chinese Communists generally gave their prisoners a choice among several alternatives: (a) joining the communist army, (b) settling as civilians in communist territory, (c) being demobilized, and even (d) going back to the national army (which meant that their captors would not have to feed them). Once, interviewing a group of 250 junior officers in a prison camp, COL GALULA met three who had been prisoners before and had returned to the Nationalists and been recaptured. The conciliatory approach was so effective that during the war the Communists had Nationalists as their prisoners (COL. FERTIG recalled a similar phenomenon in the Philippines, where a Japanese general in 1944 launched a conciliation program that proved so effective as to constitute a real threat to the guerrillas). COL GALULA contrasted the Chinese principle with the less sophisticated methods of the FLN in Algeria, who treated their prisoners brutally and often killed them.",

WILSON, that 'the primary objective of counterguerrilla warfare is not merely the guerrilla's elimination, neutralization, and conversion, but the winning over of the apathetic majority of the people.' COL BOHANNAN disagreed. In his opinion, the ultimate objective is indeed the elimination of the enemy (by liquidation, neutralization, or conversion), but the path to that end runs largely through the civilian population. Because the guerrilla can live without the civilians' support, the latter offer a way of getting at him; therefore, winning them politically, though not a principal objective (since they present no direct threat to you), is certainly a most important immediate objective. COL. GALULA added that, wherever you have gained control and won the support of the population, and have thereby defeated the guerrilla locally, you can afford to release your forces, for the guerrilla cannot easily come back.",

    "text": "the area reduced to small, scattered elements and men in hiding, you can go on to the next step: establishing the degree of control that will prevent the rebels from coming back. The ideal would be to seal the area, as was done for the whole of Algeria, where it became impossible after 1957 to smuggle in more than four people at a time across the eastern and western borders. But this extremely costly mechanical procedure may not be feasible in most situations. Having completed the first step, and having chosen an area of control that is not so small as to permit outside rebel forces to penetrate it within a 2 night's march nor so large as to cause your forces to be too thinly distributed, you can afford to retire some of your forces, keeping only a reserve strong enough to handle enemy incursions. To this end, you 'compartmentalize' the area, with a post in each compartment (say, at company level), and a local commander in control. (See Fig: 1.) Most important, the over-all direction of the process has to be with a territorial commander, familiar with the area and in touch with its people, who must remain the undisputed chief even if high-ranking troop commanders are brought in. In choosing the location for the posts you do well to pick the politically and administratively most important villages rather than positions that are strategic only from a military point of view. Compartmentalization of a purged sector. Here, COL. VALERIANO interrupted COL. GALULA to ask (a) how, in these clearing operations, one distinguished the genuinely peaceful farmer from the seemingly peaceful one who was a part-time armed guerrilla at night; and (b) what could be done about the regular guerrillas who remained imbedded in the population. COL. GALULA answered that the typical population in insurgent territory consists of (a) the regular guerrillas; (b) the part-time guerrillas (described by COL. VALERIANO); (c) political supporters of the revolutionaries; and (d) the rest of the people, with many shades of feelings. In the first phase of counterinsurgency just outlined, you need to concern yourself only with the first of these, because once the 'regular' forces of the enemy are expelled or immobilized, the part-time guerrilla cannot easily operate. Regular guerrillas who hide in the population will come out sooner or later, or else will just split up and stop all their armed activity. In the first instance, you will catch them; in the second, they cease to be a problem for the time being, and their final elimination can be entrusted to a concerted effort of the entire population at some later time.",

    "text": "In reply to COL. BOHANNAN's question as to how many troops are required for an operation such as the one described, COL. GALULA thought that this would depend largely on the terrain, and you could not therefore give universally applicable facts and figures. To take a specific case, in the Kabylie area east of Algiers, which is about 100 miles long and 60 miles wide, with precipitous mountains that require the soldiers and vehicles to make detours to cover relatively short distances, and with a population density equal to that of Belgium, surprise was impossible, for troops had to come from afar and by the highways, and it took twelve battalions to comb an area of 18 square miles. Having secured an area militarily, COL. GALULA continued, you must work on the population and, first of all, destroy the rebels' political organization. For this you need intelligence, which you can get only if the people are convinced that you are not only strong but are going to stay, so that they need not fear reprisal from the guerrillas for having helped you. Wait until you discover three or four people in each village whom you suspect of working with the insurgents. Arrest them all at the same time, not one by one, for they will find a certain safety in numbers (if a secret is betrayed, it might have been any one of them). Then interrogate them, and they probably will lead you to the insurgents' political cell. COL. GALULA singled out three important points in embarking on the destruction of a village insurgent organization: (1) This is essentially police work and, ideally, therefore, should not be done by the army. If for lack of police the army has to undertake it, special intelligence groups should be organized for the task, so as to dissociate the army as such from the unpleasant side of police activities. (2) It is useless to purge a village unless you are ready to establish a post in it. Otherwise, the rebels will rebuild a cell from the outside, and you will have to repeat the entire process later, against much greater popular reluctance. (3) To control a village, which includes surveillance of all traffic in and out, you must institute a system of passes and permits, based on a complete census that establishes who the legitimate inhabitants are and who does not belong. The house-by-house census, your first individual contact with the people, is also your opening for psychological operations. Having purged the village and ascertained from local informers not only who was for the guerrillas but also who was against them and may therefore be material for antirebel cadres, you must ask the people to elect new leaders. Once elected, these men must be tested for their reliability through a variety of civic tasks, and the one who proves himself must be given all possible power and aid. Finally, you must help the population set up its own defense units (either paid, full-time professional forces or a militia of local farmers), and make the people select military leaders from their own ranks. After that, the remaining small rebel elements usually surrender and disappear, and you can then bring down your strength to two or three men whom you leave behind, while the bulk of your forces is freed to repeat the process in another, usually an adjoining, area.",

    "text": "This method, at first used only experimentally by individual commanders, later became standard procedure in Algeria. Asked specifically how much time it might require to clean up a typical area, COL. GALULA gave this account of the first problem he encountered on arriving in Algeria and of his success and rate of progress in the operation: In July of 1956 the company he then commanded was assigned an area in Kabylie. The company sector (or sous-quartier) was part of a battalion area (or quartier) 10 miles long and 6 miles wide, with mountains ranging up to 3,000 feet, which contained seven main villages and five or six hamlets and had a total of twelve to fifteen thousand inhabitants. By October COL. GALULA had cleaned the first village in his sous-quartier, having been lucky enough to be given a list of all FLN political agents, which led to a great deal of intelligence information. By December (the sous-quartier having by then been enlarged) he had purged and occupied three more villages. By February 1957 this entire sous-quartier had been cleaned up. Periodically, as the battalion quartier was expanded, so was the sous-quartier, and in the end COL. GALULA had complete and effective control over an area comprising half the original battalion quartier plus considerable territory in the lowland to the south of it, with a total population of about fifteen thousand. In another and much larger area, COL. GALULA added, where, after their initial successful operations of 1956, the French units busied themselves mainly with military tasks and left the population to itself, the insurgents not only survived but thrived. Having learned a valuable lesson in the early months of the war, they organized their forces into small groups of never more than twenty men (the standard number being between five and ten), and it took months of intensive, large-scale operations in 1959 to achieve anything significant against them. COL VALERIANO mentioned similar operations conducted by the Japanese in the Philippines. In one of these, after learning where a few Americans were hiding, they saturated the area with an entire division and stayed forty-five days in the very village where the Americans were, employing the most brutal terror methods. But when they left, the Americans were still there, having found it safer to stay hidden than to move out. COL. VALERIANO himself had marched in with weapons and radio receivers on the eleventh day of the Japanese operation. Despite their massive effort, the Japanese obtained very little information from the local people. Terror and torture succeeded in producing the opposite of their intended effect. Even informers were often executed, and rather than tell on the Americans, the Filipinos hid them in their cellars, and the women fed them.",

Constant patrolling keeps guerrillas on the move. While Colonel Bohannan's theory wasn't supported by Galula's Algerian experience, both stressed patrolling's importance and the population's centrality. Bohannan highlighted the high troop-to-guerrilla ratio Galula's methods required, unlikely with indigenous guerrilla forces, and the undesirable suspension of civil liberties it entailed. Galula conceded the civil liberties issue but believed the troop ratio might be less problematic. The French in Algeria, acutely aware of this, maintained a facade of legality. Gendarmes attached to units documented casualties, filing manslaughter reports against officers, which were routinely dismissed in court. A theoretical rule mandated three warnings before firing on armed enemies. These experiences underscore the need to adapt peacetime civil liberty protections to insurgency conditions.",

In Malaya, the military always remained subordinate to civilian authority. Even in 'black' areas with shoot-on-sight authorization, such authority was granted and revoked by civilian-led committees.  Powell-Jones viewed any military overreach as a victory for the insurgents.  The military's role was to support civil authority, troop deployment prioritized targets, and civilian control stringency depended on the military situation, incentivizing civilian cooperation for greater freedom. Food control aimed to give individuals just enough to refuse guerrilla demands without starving.",

Remaining civil servants often abandoned posts or refused to function, fearing Huk reprisals. Military officers stepped in, assuming civil responsibilities with political leaders' acquiescence, sometimes encouragement. The public preferred dealing with military officers over powerless civilian officials.  By 1950, when Magsaysay took over, the military was the only functioning authority in Huk-controlled areas, operating with little civilian oversight. Magsaysay leveraged this situation effectively. Colonel Fertig cautioned against generalizations from diverse experiences and political settings. Even within the Philippines, situations varied; some areas had functioning civilian governments while others needed political structures created.  Hosmer sought opinions on optimal counterguerrilla warfare organization, acknowledging the need to utilize available resources.",

Bohannan noted the effectiveness of special-purpose counterguerrilla units in the Philippines, small teams that located guerrilla bases for other units, avoiding combat unless highly advantageous. While not a complete solution, these teams provided valuable harassment. Powell-Jones mentioned that such harassment in Malaya, while often not directly productive, kept troops engaged beyond auxiliary policing duties. However, Malaya's unique conditions – isolated enemy pockets, vast jungle, poor communications, and diverse population – limited generalizability.

Nine states, each governed by a war executive committee led by the state governor and advised by police, Home Guard, military, and civilian representatives. Districts within states had similar committees. Brigades were typically assigned to states, battalions to districts. Towns and population centers were secured with perimeter defenses and lighting. Local volunteer police and armed home guards supplemented resident police.  Battalions supported civil authority, sometimes augmented by police operations units.  Military operations in settled areas required civilian administrator permission and close police liaison.  In designated areas, military commanders could request free rein, including air support, but inhabited areas required prearrangement. Fertig described Japanese counterinsurgency in Mindanao. The initial plan using local police and officials was abandoned. The 'Bureau of Constabulary,' formed from reorganized puppet troops, proved more dangerous but vulnerable to guerrilla harassment, eventually withdrawing from most areas.  The Japanese, despite substantial troop presence, rarely committed first-line troops to counterinsurgency.  A June 1943 foray involving 1800 men for two weeks was an exception, but guerrillas quickly regained control.  Japanese counterinsurgency lacked coordination and understanding of the organized resistance, mistaking them for bandits.  This resulted in a stalemate until guerrillas received sufficient supplies for attacks.",

    "text": "The importance of access to outside support is a main principle of guerrilla warfare. Even if unused, the psychological value for soldiers feeling they are not cut off is immense. Conversely, the counterguerrilla must aim to isolate the guerrilla.  The facade of outside contact and support was maintained even if it required distorting facts. The Huk movement received little American support during the Japanese occupation, except for reciprocal arrangements between local commanders and Huk leaders.  Terror should be used wisely and selectively, unlike the Japanese indiscriminate approach.  Emphasizing legality is advantageous. In Malaya, subjecting terrorists to due process and death sentences deterred others from unnecessary brutality. In the Philippines, the focus was on necessities of warfare, concentration camps for the duration only, and adherence to legal boundaries. The counterinsurgents cannot win popular support without the power to protect the population.  In Malaya, the British brought people into perimeters for protection. The loyalty of the Philippine population to the Americans, despite lacking protection against Japanese terrorism, stemmed from hatred of the invaders. Communists are aware of terrorism’s potential backfire and use it only for intimidation. The FLN used selective killings for intimidation and stopped once successful. Later, having lost popular support, they resorted to large-scale terrorism unsuccessfully.  Strong measures can garner both acquiescence and active support. In China, despite initial hostility, local militias cornered Nationalist agents due to fear of reprisals.  Disrupting the guerrilla's timetable can be a counterinsurgency target. The effectiveness depends on the enemy’s flexibility. In Malaya, the British gained an advantage by changing the situation, making the communists' agreed policy inapplicable. Guerrillas often avoid publicizing targets and policy to avoid negative psychological effects from failures. The decision to advance to the next phase of revolutionary warfare is critical for insurgents. Premature decisions have led to setbacks and failures. The Greeks in 1947, the FLN in 1956, and the Vietminh initially miscalculated their strength.",

    "text": "The defense of fixed installations, including non-military targets like power plants and water reservoirs, is challenging due to the numerous potential targets, uncertainty about enemy intentions, and limited troops. The principle is to defend only essential installations, relying on alarms and other devices for the rest, providing a sense of security.  Defense needs change with circumstances. Routine measures include wire fencing, lights, and grass cutting. In grassy areas, traditional ambush and patrol methods are ineffective; shotguns and troop formations are necessary. Light aircraft can spot ambushes. Mobile reserves are crucial.  Guerrillas often choose targets outside defenders' priorities.  The Vietminh refined ambush techniques. Infiltration of fixed installations was a constant danger, using disguises and exploiting events. Ambushing a village at night and then attacking the relief column was a frequent tactic, even helicopters proved ineffective.  Well-organized ambushes are over quickly. Helicopters are limited by available cover for guerrillas. Armoring vehicles and modifying seating arrangements for quick exit are crucial. Spacing between vehicles in convoys and armored car escorts are essential.  Shotguns are effective short-range weapons. Using weapons too heavy for guerrillas to carry is advantageous. Flamethrowers are unsuitable due to fire risk. Limiting ammunition forces guerrillas to return for resupply, dispersing enemy forces. Night patrolling is essential for protecting fixed installations. Frequent ambush drills are necessary, but should be controlled to avoid accidents like the one in Malaya between a regiment and a tin miner's home guard.  Deep-in ambushes in the jungle require patience and discipline, often yielding no results.",

CAPT: JEAPES, 0n the contrary, had preferred using only a single narrow track, however and unmistakable it might become as a result of repeated traffic, gambling that the enemy would not stumble on it Even if he did, there was a chance that he would follow it out of curiosity and thus stumble into an ambush or a base camp More likely, terrorists coming across such a trail, unless their number was quite large, would try to withdraw unseen, not knowing how many troops might find at the end of the trail. There followed some discussion among COL. WHITE, COL. SHIRLEY , and CAPT: JEAPES as to the wisdom of ambushing the tracks in the expectation that the enemy would use them COL. SHIRLEY’ $ experience had been that the troops spent many fruitless hours waiting for the enemy along the tracks, and only a surprisingly small number of Chinese casualties were inflicted during the brief fire fights characteristic of the ambush Indeed, in most instances in neither guerrilla nor counterguerrilla achieved a very high percentage of casual- ties through ambush: COL. GALULA described an unorthodox but extremely successful experiment (( with the 'one-man ambush;' which had been tried by 2 friend of his who com- manded a sector in Indochina A single man, it turned out, was almost invulnerable, and the system permitted the setting of a large number of ambushes As to the demoralizing effect of frequent ambushes on the guerrilla, CAPT: JEAPES believed it to be an important aspect of psychological warfare.

VALERIANO saw this as another argument (valid at least in the Philippine situation) fof not tying up the bulk of the defending forces in the perimeter of a fixed installation but deploying it on the outside; then inviting the enemy to attack the perimeter, and firing at him from the rear: To anticipate likely points of attack and to secure the foutes needed for mobile reserves, COL. VALERIANO’ $ forces developed an elaborate procedure that involved mining (o marking as 'mined\") the likely ambush points and, on the basis of a survey by the intelligence officer, classifying places and routes by various categories calling for diverse types of action",

GALULA commented that most of these devices were used already by the Chinese Communists, as were underground caches with interconnecting tunnels (even, in Indochina, under paddy fields filled with water): COL. FERTIG recalled the use of tetanus-infected bamboo spikes against the Japanese, all the more effective because an incapacitated soldier represents a greater burden to his side than a dead one: CAPT.

    "text": "and on the size of his reserve Y and most com- manders are unlikely to have enough troops to spare: COL. BRUNDAGE opened the question of water boundaries, which several speakers agreed were far easier to control. COL SHIRLEY emphasized the greater usefulness there of modern technical detection aids, even on a coastline like that of Vietnam; provided you have the means to follow up on detection. He compared today's advanced technology to the lack of technical gadgetry in Malaya, where the British, flying low over the jungle known to be hiding Communists, could not see them (he was frankly skeptical of COL WHITE's contention that some of the pilots could). COL. SHIRLEY, as an electronics specialist, had conceived the idea that an aircraft, with its radar tuned to the metal barreling of the rifles that soldiers moving in file through the jungle were bound to be carrying, would be able to spot such hidden forces in a terrain that normally contained not a particle of metal. He sent the suggestion to the War Office for thorough scientific exploration, and also tried it himself experimentally. Both attempts failed. The War Office reply called the idea unworkable; and COL. SHIRLEY, in a day's flight over the jungle, was unable to penetrate the canopy at any time, and even failed to pick up on his radar screen a Sunderland four-engine flying boat at anchor directly below the reconnaissance plane. He thought, however, that this negative showing was almost entirely a reflection of the poor maintenance of equipment typical of operations in Southeast Asia. With today's American equipment, a much better job could be done in this difficult environment, though it still would appear impossible to seal off an entire border in such a way.\nMR HOSMER asked COL VALERIANO about the methods he had used to prevent Huk bands, once they were identified in a given area, from extending their activities beyond it. The answer: aggressive patrolling around the area by local police or any troops that can be spared, and gaining the co-operation of the people in spotting the Huks (a kind of help that is obtained only through the systematic screening of villages and routine interrogation of all individuals to identify those who have no business in a given place). COL. BOHANNAN added, however, that it had proved virtually impossible in the Philippines to contain any band of trained guerrillas who wanted to leave an area. It was better, therefore, to keep patrols moving all the time, leaving the guerrillas uncertain where they might meet such a patrol, and to hope for a chance encounter between them. The fact that the guerrillas are usually fragmented into small groups was recognized as a major problem for counterinsurgency. COL SHIRLEY once proposed a massive operation in Malaya, in which an entire brigade was to saturate a terrorist-infested area. However, this idea was turned down because it had been tried earlier with almost no success. While there might be psychological advantage in not dismissing this tactic and thus keeping the guerrilla fearful that his area might be 'saturated' by the other side at any time, such an operation can never be expected to yield a great many kills, given the guerrillas' faculty for just fading away. In the Philippines, according to COL. BOHANNAN, saturation operations in themselves picked up people only by accident; but an ancillary device was to leave stay-behind groups (preferably near trails and springs) when the forces were ostensibly pulled out, so that the Huks, after they felt safe enough to come out of hiding, could be picked up by them. COL. VALERIANO described one such successful operation. In a Huk area believed to be safe for the guerrillas (in swamp terrain that made pursuit difficult), and hence a regular rallying and supply center for them, seven rifle companies, including commandos with civilian clothes and radio sets in their packs, marched in; a few days later, having left the commandos behind, the troops marched out in full view of the inhabitants, and as soon as the Huks emerged, the commandos gave them lively action. Wherever this principle was applied (it was done in mountain areas, too), good signal communications to synchronize movements were of the essence. Thus, part of the stay-behind party could fraternize with the Huks, pretending to belong to another Huk unit, and notify other parts of the group where to block or intercept the enemy.",

    "text": "At MR HOSMER's suggestion, COL. GALULA then gave a detailed exposé on the very successful methods for border control in Algeria that he had briefly alluded to earlier. Figure 2 is an illustration of the typical complex of fence barriers (COL GALULA called it a \"barrage\") on the Algerian-Tunisian and Algerian-Moroccan borders. At the very beginning the French made the mistake of building the barrage directly against the border, where it could too easily be attacked from Moroccan or Tunisian soil. Thereafter, they allowed a considerable margin between the actual border and the first of the several parallel barricades — a simple wire barrier, about 1 to 1½ meters high, to keep livestock and wild animals out of the mined and electrified area inside the barrage. About five meters behind this first fence came an entanglement of barbed wire, which occupied a width of about ten meters and was mined. Next was a three-meter-high electrified (5000 volt) fence capable of killing as well as sending the alarm when touched. Immediately parallel to it ran a road to permit access to the fence for maintenance and repair. Behind the road was another mined wire entanglement, and next to that an unmined wire fence to keep unauthorized people from the danger area. Finally, a well-paved road on the inner perimeter was patrolled at night by vehicles that were spaced at frequent, regular intervals and used large searchlights. During the day, the barrage was patrolled from the air. A series of gates in the barbed wire and fences permitted access to the outer perimeter for occasional patrols and defensive action. For the alarm system, the entire barrage area had been so compartmentalized that the precise spot of any disturbance was immediately known wherever the alarm registered, and mobile reserves could therefore reach it in minimum time. The power for the electric fence came from stations spaced from ten to twenty miles apart; and alarms at the power stations indicated if and where the fence had been cut or grounded. False alarms, set off by animals, were an occasional problem. Although the initial impact of the barrage was tremendous, the FLN gradually found ways of crossing it: A couple of scouts would cut through the minefield, then straddle the electric fence with a tall wooden stepladder, and signal to other troops to follow them across it. In this manner, however, it would take them four hours to traverse an area that might normally take a mere fraction of that time. In trying to delay them still further, if not entirely to stop them, the French found radar very helpful, although they had a problem in interpreting signals. To illustrate the over-all effectiveness of the barrier, in one instance, an entire company attempted to cross, but only one man succeeded, while 51 withdrew, and the rest were caught; in another case, out of 1000 who tried, 6 of the 110 who crossed the first barrier survived and escaped, and the others died or were captured. The system was costly in money and labor. Erecting the fence (a total of about 2500 kilometers, from the coast down along the two borders well into the desert) consumed about one-sixth of total military expenses for an entire year; also, rain and other factors required constant repairs on the electric fence, and waterproofing the mine detonators continued to be a problem. But the expenditures were well worth while in view of the troops saved. Moreover, the system, though easiest to construct in flat, open country, is workable in any terrain. In Algeria, for example, it extended the full length of the enormous Moroccan border, including some very difficult terrain in the north, where there were typically two or even three barrage lines. From early 1958 on the FLN was unable to bring supplies across that border. All of their crossing attempts were unsuccessful, or in such small numbers as to make no significant difference. Among other difficulties, they ran out of men trained to perform the unpleasant job of clearing the minefields. Also, the dropping of flares at night to illuminate the barrage added to the discomfort of the guerrillas. And once the French soldiers manning the patrols along the Moroccan border received large searchlights with a range of 2 kilometers, these completely discouraged attacks. Fortunately for the French, the FLN never resorted to the much-feared diversionary tactic of mounting several attacks, with a number of crossings, at one time.",

    "text": "MR GREENE speculated on the possibility of getting electricity out of an electric fence system for use in the hinterland for civilian homes, radio, perimeter lighting, etc.—an incidental benefit by which to charge off some of the heavy investment. MR HOSMER turned to the topic of encirclement and sweeping operations, and COL. GALULA began the discussion by distinguishing between (a) encirclement operations that you prepare in advance; and (b) those that are improvised. The former require a great deal of personnel (they lose the benefit of surprise and hence must be made large enough to be sure of catching some of the enemy); the latter benefit by helicopter transport. For the prepared encirclement, which must be accomplished within a single day, he advocated the kind of cylinder-and-piston operation he had described earlier, during which the perimeter troops must dig themselves in, assuming an essentially defensive position.\nCOL. SHIRLEY amplified the last statement by a reference to Malaya, where air bombings were sometimes used, in the absence of the cylinder around the piston, in order to stop the gaps through which the enemy might escape—a method he regarded as not very satisfactory. To COL. GALULA's statement that aircraft (even planes used only for troop transport) will inevitably slow down the guerrilla, COL. SHIRLEY thought this was true only in the daytime and, furthermore, depended much on the terrain. Useful wherever enemy forces were in the open and in large groups, aircraft had been quite ineffectual, for example, in Malaya, because of the dense ground cover. CAPT. JEAPES, in his encirclement operations against the Chinese terrorists, had found ways of turning the guerrilla's faculty for dispersal to the advantage of his own side. He would place small-party ambushes in a large circle around the target and then send three or four larger units into the area. In an effort to get away from these units and out of the area, the CTs would scatter and run into the ambushes. Very similar tactics, it appeared, had been used in Algeria and also in Malaya. Furthermore, as COL. GALULA pointed out, any operation that results in the random scattering of the guerrillas affords an opportunity for infiltrating them, for they have no system of intercommunication and are at a loss to tell the difference between an unknown guerrilla unit that is genuine and one that is a plant. In the Philippines COL VALERIANO had had considerable success with infiltration based on this particular ruse. He trained and conditioned a volunteer force of 4 officers and 76 men (Force \"X\") in a special camp, to the point where they resembled a typical Huk in the minutest detail. To add realism, two wounded enlisted men volunteered to join Force X. Then, equipped with weapons originally captured from the Huks, Force X staged a sham battle against COL. VALERIANO's forces, in order to appear as having been driven from its own area into that of the Huks whom they were trying to infiltrate. Their cover story was bought, and for four days they fraternized with the local Huks (even came close to obtaining an interview with the Huk supreme commander), and learned their entire modus operandi, the identity of their leaders, their supply sources, and the civilian government officials who were secretly collaborating with them. On the fifth day, the fact that the men had more ammunition than did the ordinary Huk guerrilla—the one flaw in the preparations—seemed to have aroused the local commander's suspicions. Force X thereupon decided to strike, and, within half an hour, had deactivated two Huk squadrons, its guerrilla members either killed or seriously wounded. Immediately afterward, two uniformed companies moved in and screened the local inhabitants for two weeks. The impact of this operation was such that, whenever thereafter two Huk squads met, they did not trust each other. However, similar experiments by other commanders were less successful because planning and preparation had not been detailed and thorough enough.",

After tying them up and manhandling them a little, the soldiers would turn the pseudo-Huks over to the police for safekeeping (that is, ostensibly, to prevent them from rejoining the enemy). When they finally came out of prison, the men had a great deal of information and sometimes told stories of entire villages collaborating with the Huks. A related device, not involving disguise, was to kidnap peaceful farmers and hold them for a while, waiting to see whether their absence would be reported. When, after five or so days, the chief of police or the mayor still had not reported these disappearances to the army authorities, it was a safe guess that these local officials were on the side of the guerrillas.\nOn the subject of an effective alert system, COL. GALULA described the one in use in Algeria, where the French maintained a single VHF channel for emergencies, with a monitoring receiver at every large post, regiment, battalion, and even military planes would be on that emergency channel. With a ready reserve unit at division level, reinforcements could be brought to any trouble spot by helicopter within half an hour, and support planes could take off at one minute's notice. In answer to a question from MR. RUTKOWSKI, COL. GALULA said that security for the channel was never a problem; the FLN did not succeed in swamping the French with emergency calls, for they failed to capture the necessary number of transmitters and lacked the batteries and spare tubes with which to maintain those they did get.\nTurning to the subject of the control of arms and other equipment, MR. HOSMER asked what techniques the participants had employed or encountered for limiting the supply of arms to the guerrilla side (aside from border control and other methods already discussed). COL. VALERIANO described the system used successfully in the Philippines: an attractive price scale for arms voluntarily surrendered, which brought in a flood of weapons of all sorts; strict control over firearms issued to licensed holders; and severe penalties (up to ten years' imprisonment) for people using arms without license. Many weapons, nevertheless, remained in the hands of subversives, who in the beginning were able to get needed ammunition from the citizens. In the last three years of the Huk campaign, however, they lacked ammunition in sufficient quantity. As an example of the price scale, COL. BOHANNAN mentioned 70 to 100 pesos (or U.S. $30 to $50) for a rifle (up to 200 pesos if it was in very good condition). Personally, he was against the program, for he would have preferred arming the citizenry. Also, a great many unserviceable arms had to be paid for with money that could more profitably have gone into replacements and spare parts, of which there was a shortage. He thought more highly of the usefulness of ammunition control. This was achieved in part by improving the discipline of one's own troops so as to cut down on sales of ammunition by the men.",

    "text": "One very successful trick was to let the soldiers sell ammunition that, when fired, killed the man shooting. When that happened, the entire enemy company, not knowing whether the mishap was due to gun or ammunition, would get gun-shy and spend valuable time taking apart the gun as well as the ammunition. If they suspected the latter, they might angrily go in search of the man who had sold it to them, and get caught that way. COL. WHITE described the system in Malaya, similar to that in the Philippines, whereby the British paid the equivalent of U.S. $330 for a Bren gun and about 35 cents for individual rounds of ammunition, and exercised tight control over weapon-holders. At first, the Chinese terrorists were able to take the weapons issued to the civilians whom the British were training to defend the villages; later, they held on to them. Soldiers, on the other hand, never gave up their weapons, knowing they would be court-martialed if they did. Even single rounds, CAPT. JEAPES pointed out, had to be accounted for; if they were accidentally dropped, the fine might be up to a month's pay. In the case of a lost magazine, it would be much higher, and a report would go to general headquarters. The village home guard also had relatively few losses, knowing that, if they lost a gun, they would be told to go on patrol without a weapon. They were deliberately equipped with shotguns in the (mistaken) assumption that, if lost, it was the least valuable weapon. COL. BOHANNAN commented that so rigid a system of controls would be difficult to impose on an independent army such as the Philippine forces. In answer to a question from MR. RUTKOWSKI as to how easy it would be to introduce certain devices into the bandit forces by way of arms and ammunition, COL. WHITE thought this would not be difficult; and COL. FERTIG related his own experience in the Philippines, where the native counterguerrillas in the service of the Japanese received virtually no ammunition from the Japanese and would eagerly pick up anything they found lying around, providing the guerrilla with a good opportunity for introducing devices that would incapacitate the user.",

    "text": "CAPT. JEAPES and COL. BOHANNAN thought it more important to deprive the enemy of food than of weapons, as the guerrilla can survive without a gun but not without food. (COL. FERTIG qualified this last statement: The guerrilla must have arms at least at the outset, or else, as in the Philippines, receive them soon thereafter through outside assistance, if there is to be a movement at all.) It was generally granted that in certain countries, including Vietnam, it would be impossible to cut off the enemy's food supply (COL. BRUNDAGE thought that it would be feasible in certain sections of Vietnam), and that, in general, a guerrilla who is completely cut off from the outside can survive for a considerable time, though with obvious hardships. The FLN, COL. GALULA reported, received no weapon shipments from outside Algeria after 1958 and at the end of the war was down to about 6,500 weapons. But even if you succeed in drying up the guerrilla's stock of firearms, said CAPT. JEAPES, you have not necessarily incapacitated him; he may resort to knives and still more primitive weapons before he surrenders. On the subject of surface logistics, MR. HOSMER asked CAPT. JEAPES whether weight had been a major factor in long-range, deep-penetration operations. CAPT. JEAPES: The men in the SAS trained for it very hard and still do. The most ever carried in was a 90-pound knapsack, containing two weeks' rations. They did not expect to fight with that. Rather, they would dump it in the area of operations and pack from it only a very light load (containing little more than three days' rations and a hammock) with which to do the actual fighting. Much time and thought went into working out the lightest rations. Rice was the main staple, as it was with the CTs, but the British also needed tea. Even heavy Western eaters learned to subsist on very little if they had to carry it. A typical diet would be a breakfast of nothing but tea; a midday snack of tea, cheese, and biscuits; and an evening meal of curried meat, rice, tea, biscuits, and perhaps a piece of chocolate. American hammocks, and even the British net hammocks, were found too heavy, and the men preferred to make their own from parachute silk, just as they improvised a substitute for the heavy British poncho. They carried only one spare set of clothes, into which they changed each night. Not expecting engagements, they brought with them three magazines (sixty rounds) of ammunition. There would also be two wireless sets that worked on continuous wave. Battery-operated, similar to the 109 set, with a range of 250 miles that was good for most purposes, these could be carried by one man.",

    "text": "the firing of artillery; fof reconnaissance; and for set operations against a known enemy camp. In COL. WHITE's experience (which was confirmed by CAPT. JEAPES), a trained pilot acquired the faculty of seeing what was in the jungle, especially on early morning reconnaissance flights, and could thus become a valuable source of information. As to the ideal level of control, it should be no lower than the brigade to ensure maximum use of the plane.\nWith respect to aircraft used as fighter support; COL. WHITE saw little difference between conventional and guerrilla warfare, with the problem of troop and target identification still a very difficult one. He described an experiment by which British troops in tropical areas had been successful in devising a code of differently colored balloons to identify their own positions and strength. In answer to a question from MR. HOSMER about the desirability of having one patrol and become thoroughly familiar with a single area, COL WHITE preferred a more flexible system by which a group of pilots would be assigned to take turns in a number of patrol areas, so that within three to six months each man would be fully acquainted with all of them and able to handle any part of the larger territory. COL GALULA commented briefly on the possibilities - largely unexplored so far - for airplanes in gas warfare. The French originally developed a gadget that could spread tear gas over a sizable area but forced the planes themselves to too high. They discarded it in favor of helicopters, but these have not as yet been used in the field. For obvious psychological reasons, gas spread by air was never used for riot control in the cities. Moreover, its effects are so short-lived that it can be successfully used only where very quick follow-up action is possible.\nReturning to the role of aircraft in reconnaissance, MR RUTKOWSKI wondered whether planes had any effective function during the night; admittedly the best time for patrol and reconnaissance in counterinsurgency. COL. FERTIG reported some surprising results in spotting the upturned faces of people on the ground when you flew over them at night, especially as it is instinctive for men to look up at a passing plane. COL VALERIANO had found the L5's very useful at night, at the height of the Huk campaign, when the Communists were strong enough to attack towns in Central Luzon and the counterguerrillas lacked reliable communications between their bases and the towns. He had an L5 in the air at all times, and as soon as it spotted a fire (the Huks were using arson), planes would go to work on the area, dropping flares and discouraging the movement of Huk forces. COL. GALULA described the successful protection of the border barrages by planes flying constantly back and forth and dropping flares to [prevent] the guerrilla from moving. (He did not think, in answer to a question from CAPT. JEAPES, that the use of flares had affected the night vision of his own troops.) MR HOSMER now raised the subject of air logistics, inquiring especially into the merits of helicopters, and the needed characteristics (silence, etc.) of transport aircraft. It was agreed that surprise was very difficult to preserve in air operations. COL GALULA suggested that, having inevitably given away the fact that troops or supplies are on their way, you could try, by mock landings or erratic flight patterns, to confuse the enemy as to their actual destination. Better still, if you can afford the planes, thought COL. BOHANNAN, is to keep aircraft in the air so much of the time that the guerrilla side becomes saturated with more reports than it can possibly sift out. CAPT. JEAPES, on the other hand, stressed the desirability of maintaining secrecy whenever possible; supplies to cut-off troops, in particular, should be carried in by men on foot rather than dropped. In the jungle operations of the SAS, the troops always started out with two weeks' rations, heavy though these were to carry, just to avoid having to be air-supplied and thus run the danger of revealing their position. COL. WHITE admitted that the man-pack was desirable for small operations, but regarded helicopters or planes as the only alternative for large-scale operations or man-drops in special drops.",

    "text": "COL BOHANNAN was inclined to make an even stronger case for the logistic uses of aircraft. He felt that the potential of air supplies drops, which are economical in manpower and money, had not been fully enough exploited; by the relatively simple device of keeping a few planes, perhaps no more than two, continually buzzing back and forth over an area, you could camouflage your movements well enough to use air extensively without endangering your security. COL WHITE concurred; he quarreled with the theory, taught by the warfare schools, that air support is a bonus, and advocated air supply as a routine means of support wherever other vehicles are unusable.\nAs for the free-drop versus the parachute technique, CAPT. JEAPES favored the latter, having found the free-drop not sufficiently accurate as well as a hazard to the ground troops. COL. VALERIANO disagreed, recalling that he had once laid out an entire air strip in the middle of a mountain range using free-drop supplies in connection with helicopters; once the troops had been moved out of the way, he had found the free-drop method safe and accurate (\"we could free-drop fresh eggs\"). There was general agreement on the psychological value of air support in its effect on both the enemy and the counterguerrillas. COL VALERIANO cited the case of an important Huk personage who allowed himself to be captured in the mountains. He had been demoralized, and led to believe that his cause was lost, by the sight of supplies being dropped to the government forces while he and his men were starving. He was released on condition that he go back and persuade his followers to surrender; as indeed he did. COL WHITE stressed the importance for the morale of your own troops of 'letting the men know that, when they are sick or wounded, a helicopter will fetch them'. COL WHITE ended the afternoon's discussion with the more general observation that all the methods and techniques mentioned by the participants in the preceding two days hinged on finding the right leaders and placing them in positions where they could do the most good. This applies, he said, not only to the leadership of your own military forces, but also to the police, the intelligentsia, and the administration of the country in which you are operating. It took the first three months of his assignment to Malaya, and a series of initial failures, for him to recognize this principle and to begin to operate on it with success.",

LANSDALE felt that this question had to be approached from the point of view of counterinsurgency as it related to insurgency. The basic situation being one in which the guerrilla side is essentially out to capture the population, and territory is captured in the process, the chief operating principle of the counterinsurgents must be to formulate aims and devise methods that will win the people to their side. Our side is conspicuously weak in the definition of this objective and in the productive co-ordination of political and psychological ends. Western political leaders are inclined to deal in concepts that seem imprecise to those on the local foreign scene, and the stress at other echelons is often too much on mechanics and technical application. Thus, diplomats tend to think in terms of negotiating a modus vivendi (that is to say, in terms of compromise); the people below them, in terms of political structure; the psychologists, only in terms of the communications media. In Vientiane, for example, GEN. LANSDALE had once met with several representatives of various nationalities who were actively at work on the psychological aspects of the Laotian situation and had started a newspaper and a radio station. Yet when asked by him why they were doing this work, not one had a realistic answer. Whenever we have faced a communist enemy, his side - thanks to the concerted effort of a handful of experienced people - has had a precisely stated objective, a timetable, and patience. The answer to our problem, GEN. LANSDALE suggested, may be for each one who has a function in the total picture to inject the necessary wisdom and purpose within his own small area of jurisdiction and activity.",

    "text": "COL. GALULA's experience completely confirmed GEN. LANSDALE's remarks. On being sent to Algeria in 1956, he and his fellow commanders were told simply to 'pacify,' on the assumption that one could win the population to one's side just by being kind. The mistakes that were made in those early days, in spite of dedication and manpower, were due partly to ignorance of the principles and methods demanded by modern guerrilla warfare. COL. GALULA then outlined at some length his own theories, principles, and procedures - proved by his experience in China, Greece, Indochina, and Algeria - which he regarded as generally relevant and applicable to all guerrilla warfare situations. Communist techniques, he believes, derive from the realization that in any situation, whatever the cause, a small minority is actively for the cause, another small minority is actively against it, and the large majority is undecided and uncommitted. By that same 'golden rule' the counterinsurgent side, in turn, must make it its first task to identify those who are already for it and then persuade them to work on the passive majority with a view to winning it over. Obviously, the better your cause, and the larger the share of the population that is actively on your side, the easier it will be to neutralize or eliminate the opposition. The initial situation determines the methods by which to identify the sympathetic minority. If the insurgents have established control, people are not likely to come forward immediately and reveal themselves, and it will require pressure and force before they do. The next step is to choose among those who are for you those who are capable of leadership. This screening can be accomplished by setting potential leaders tasks of increasing difficulty. In the selection of cadres it is well, once again, to look at the very efficient methods of the Communists and their imitators. In Algeria, for example, the rebels found an issue, managed to attract a small corps, and used this to influence and win a larger corps. They then divided Algeria into six areas, each organized and controlled by its own boss, in whom was vested the all-important function of collecting money, and who, in turn, subdivided his area down to the village level, choosing his cadres upon careful observation of who contributed and who did not. Once such cadres have been formed, they furnish the initial guerrilla forces, and the rest follows. An example of the communist principle that organized cadres must pave the way for military action was furnished in China in 1949, when the Chinese Communists, on reaching the Yangtze River, stopped for five or six months, ostensibly to \"'negotiate' with the National government, but actually to organize and train the political cadres that they still lacked in the south before moving in their troops to take control there. Then, having deluded the Nationalist side to the point where it actually sent teams of negotiators, they suddenly crossed the river and did not stop again until they reached the border.",

    "text": "Can then aid in the political conquest of the population: 'Land reform;' by which every Chinese farmer was to receive a piece of land of his own, was just such an issue. An obviously attractive goal, it was attainable only by confiscating the property of 'rich landowners;' who initially were arbitrarily defined as people with more than one acre of land. For certain villages, however, which turned out to be already so divided up that no farmer qualified by that definition, the Communists simply changed the criterion of wealth to half an acre (in some cases even less), in order to preserve the issue that would separate the supporters from the hostile and indifferent.\nOn the counterinsurgent side, too, all military and psychological action must be geared to finding cadres. Whereas orthodox warfare requires only two men on the army staff—a chief of operational planning and a chief of logistics—in revolutionary warfare you need a third, namely, the man who can say, at the time an operational idea is first conceived and before the operation is planned, 'this operation is useless in terms of your objective of winning the population; but that one, which seems militarily stupid, is excellent from the political point of view.' Ideally, this third function, being essentially political, should not be the job of the military; but of necessity it must be, because only the army has the needed reservoir of manpower. It should be integrated with the army's established responsibilities throughout the counterinsurgent effort of conquest and control in a well-defined 'SOP.'\nThus, the six successive steps in the full application of a counterguerrilla doctrine are:\n1. Expelling the enemy's armed forces from a chosen area.\n2. Assigning small selected units to work with the population.\n3. Eliminating those elements that actively support the enemy.\n4. Finding a group of potential leaders.\n5. Selecting the ultimate leaders from among them.\n6. Organizing these leaders into a political party.\nNone of these steps may be omitted, though at times it will be possible to go rapidly from one to the next. Passage from one phase to another, as difficult for the counterinsurgent as for the insurgent side, requires much imagination and astute leadership. Moreover, the units needed to accomplish the first step, being militarily oriented, do not necessarily lend themselves to the primarily political tasks involved in the subsequent phases (just as people who think largely in terms of psychological action are apt to ignore military factors). One possible way of solving the problem is to screen units of soldiers to find among them those with a political orientation and aptitude and then assign these to the task that is paramount once an area has been physically conquered.",

    "text": "As regards the counterinsurgents' accompanying propaganda effort, one may distinguish, first of all, between 'strategic propaganda' (designed to show that the defender's cause is good and that his position is strong) and 'tactical propaganda' (geared to each of the above six steps and an essential weapon in its achievement). To name just one example of tactical propaganda in the first step (expulsion of the guerrillas' armed forces from a chosen area), the enemy, on being told that the counterinsurgents are about to clear that sector, has a choice between leaving it and accepting a fight. Since the defenders' interest lies in the latter alternative, his propaganda must be aimed at forcing the rebels to fight rather than to disappear. Apart from propaganda directed at the enemy himself, the first step must be accompanied also by an appeal to the native population, which should be, essentially, only this: \"There will be military engagements; try to stay neutral!\" For neutrality is all that is needed in the military phase of the war. And, finally, there is the propaganda line to be taken with the counterinsurgent troops, namely, to 'avoid any action (such as the shelling of villages) that will antagonize the populace.'\nGEN. LANSDALE pointed out that psychological warfare is meaningless without a forceful, positive ideological base from which to combat and surpass the dynamic ideas of the communist side, supported as they are by every known trick of propaganda. Against those communist beliefs, rooted in nineteenth-century philosophy, we should at least pit our own ideals, rooted in eighteenth-century philosophical concepts, to show that we are for something and not just fighting a negative, defensive battle. Those whose support we are seeking must have reason to feel that they are being asked to risk their lives for something worthwhile. The example of Malaya demonstrates the crucial importance of a wise political goal, and a practice consistent with it, in the achievement of military victory. By the same token, 'liberte, egalite, fraternite,' if practiced as professed in Indochina, might well have changed the outcome of the French-Vietminh war. Moreover, everyone who has had a command position in a counterguerrilla campaign knows that there are always some men among his troops who attract support from the population simply because they believe in an ideal that they can communicate to others and that the people can share. The ideals and beliefs of such natural leaders are worth heeding; they might well become part of the ideological base of the counterinsurgent side.",

    "text": "And, COL. GALULA added, whenever such a natural leader emerges, he ought to be given the widest possible powers, in violation, if necessary, of established military tradition and without reference to his formal education. To do so, however, requires the kind of flexibility that distinguishes the communist side but which, unfortunately, conflicts with conventional concepts of Western armies and governments. COL. BOHANNAN reiterated with approval GEN. LANSDALE's point about the importance of a national objective and about the need for people at the working level to carry it out. On a small scale, he stressed the additional requirement that, from the top to the bottom level, all actions be at all times clearly in pursuit of the national objective, lest the enemy find abuses of the principle and thus an opportunity for saying, \"They are just talking, but you can see that they don't mean it.\" Even more indispensable a psychological factor, COL. GALULA thought, was the absolute, unwavering determination of the top leaders. He cited Hungary as an example of a war that had been won by counterinsurgents through firm resolution even though their cause was bad, and Indochina as an illustration of a good cause that failed for lack of determined leadership. COL. BOHANNAN would not go quite so far. Batista's defeat in Cuba and Chiang's in China, he suggested, tended to prove that resolute leadership was not enough; and the nationalistic aspirations of the Vietminh, unobjectionable as they appeared at first glance, probably had influenced the developments in Indochina almost as much as had the irresolution of the French. Without agreeing, therefore, that 'resolution at the top' was any more important than either an understanding of revolutionary warfare or a wise political goal, he was prepared to grant that all three elements were necessary to successful counterinsurgency.",

COL: GALULA granted, however, that even he would not hesitate to organize the children in any situation where the enemy was a foreign invader: This, of course, had been precisely the position of COL. FERTIG in the Philippines, where children were effectively enlisted for a variety of tasks in the struggle against the Japanese. However, they were not, strictly speaking, 'organized;' and their contribution was a gratuitous adjunct to intelligence work rather than part of the plan. Moreover, they were supposedly all volunteers, and they reported to the civil authorities rather than to the army. COL FERTIG recalled that some boys as young as ten had exhibited all the resourcefulness and leadership qualities that one might hope to find in an adult: Children, lightly armed, were commonly used as reporters to their fathers in the volunteer guard, and, in areas where it was impossible to maintain posts, also as runners. In addition, they participated in the \"bamboo telegraph\" that operated without interruption through Japanese-occupied terrain for fifteen months before it was finally broken. The Japanese (in answer to a question from MR HOSMER) were unsuccessful in their attempts to cultivate the children, because of the same inconsistent, irrational behavior by which they alienated the adults. By offering candy one day and slaps the next, they gradually frightened off possible recruits among the young. This, despite the fact that in December 1941 the Americans and their allies had lost face so completely that for a long period thereafter the Japanese enjoyed the support of the population while the guerrillas had to start from scratch. In the Huk campaign COL. VALERIANO had observed a similar development, and a comparable lack of wisdom on the part of the enemy. Once the government forces under Magsaysay began to show successes, the Huks abandoned their previous policy of friendliness toward the population in favor of the most blood-thirsty and ruthless tactics (they attacked hospitals and massacred civilians regardless of age and sex), methods that permanently alienated the people and marked the beginning of a growing rapport between civilian youth and the army. One of the ways in which COL VALERIANO attracted the young was to invite provincial schools to stage tournaments on the basketball court at his headquarters, with refreshments served at the army's expense. The enterprising intelligence officer made himself acquainted with the youngsters, discovered that several of them were the children of Huk commanders, and methodically obtained from them a file of information not obtainable through ordinary intelligence channels. These data included, for example, the fathers' birthdays or the expected arrival dates of new babies – times, that is, when a Huk family man might be tempted to leave his mountain base for a short stay at home, thereby offering the government troops an opportunity for picking him up.",

    "text": "Turning to another aspect of the problem, MR HOSMER asked the group: \"How, in the area of strategic psychological warfare, do you convince a people that you, rather than the guerrillas, are going to win?\" COL GALULA stressed as the crucial requirement a determined government and unwavering policy at the top. If the government hesitates or the policy changes, the local people are bound to be discouraged and the loyalist cause will suffer a setback of months and sometimes years, no matter how hard the people in the field may be working. The rebels' propaganda is sure to exploit any such weakness at the top. In Algeria, the FLN's line was simple: \"The French proclaimed that they were staying in Indochina, Tunisia, and Morocco forever, yet they left; now they say they'll remain in Algeria, but will pull out in the same way.\" No words - not even such evidence as the heavy French investment in the country - could prevail against such a simple argument. And a cabinet change in Paris, with its attendant uncertainty about the future, would instantly wipe out any political benefits of recent military advances. The FLN for its part, aware of this interaction, was quick to deny any rumor about negotiations, for fear that their followers would equate talks with compromise and see in them a sign that their organization was crumbling. This, to COL. GALULA, was just one manifestation of the fact that a revolutionary war calls for unyielding, extremist attitudes on both sides and leaves no room for the moderate middle. Thus, every attempt to form a 'third force' in Algeria failed, for only in postwar times can the liberal element emerge in numbers. COL. VALERIANO had found no more dramatic and persuasive way of demonstrating that the guerrillas' was a losing cause than to let former Huks talk to the crowd about their experiences before and since their surrender. If an ex-Huk could say, for example, that some of his compatriots in Mindanao were being helped by the army, that they had houses, animals, and tools and were doing scientific farming, this kind of testimony made a powerful impression, for it gave the lie to the contention - central to the Huks' ideological appeal - that Filipino farmers were landless tenants.",

    "text": "Mr. Hosmer opened the meeting with the proposal that the treatment of psychological warfare and its supporting political operations be geared as much as possible to detail and specific instances, with emphasis on techniques that members of the Symposium had tried and found particularly effective.\n\nCol. Galula distinguished between 'strategic' and 'tactical' psychological warfare and between the levels at which each is executed. Strategic psychological warfare is planned at the theater level, aligned with top-level policies and strategic goals; its chief media are radio, press, films, and other mass communication means. Tactical psychological warfare begins at the highest level with direct population contact (in Algeria, the company rather than battalion commander) and continues down. Its task, more difficult than strategic psychological warfare, lies in varying media and techniques to suit particular conditions at lower echelons. A tactical propaganda action must be sustained for effectiveness, as seen in Algeria's unsuccessful experiment with mobile movie teams.\n\nRegarding demoralizing guerrillas, participants offered answers based on their campaign experiences. Col. Bohannan discussed Magsaysay's impact on the Philippine situation, particularly the 1951 elections, which shifted the mood from distrusting the government to contempt for the Huks. This demonstrated the appeal of a national policy focused on stability, citizens' aspirations, minority rights, and democratic freedoms, though the Philippines never formally stated its national objective. Col. Fertig attributed this to Magsaysay's position as Secretary of Defense, preventing criticism of past policies.\n\nMr. Phillips illustrated a constructive approach from South Vietnam (1954-1955), where an American officer advised, \"Find out what the people want, and then we'll try to help them get it.\"  Any country under communist attack harbors dissatisfactions exploited by communists. The anticommunist side must identify these and address the people's desires. In mid-1950s South Vietnam, the communists used 'independence' as an issue, highlighting the government's French domination, weakness, corruption, and untrustworthy army. Within two years, the Diem government countered this by demonstrating independence and energetic leadership through pacification, civic action, and restoring order, while exposing Vietminh's foreign domination.  Communist promises were also exposed as unfulfilled.  Even the behavior of troops – not stealing or raping, but being helpful – contrasted with communist propaganda.\n\nCol. Galula noted that guerrillas are demoralized when cut off from the population through systematic purging. He recalled two FLN members fleeing a purge to seek guerrilla support, only to be abandoned.  Demoralized by this and separation from their people, they surrendered.  Mr. Phillips advocated finding out what the people want, but Col. Galula cautioned against misinterpreting or overemphasizing lesser concerns. In Algeria, Parisians misjudged the primary desire for peace above all else.",

    "text": "Col. Fertig argued that the common man, especially in Asia, is apolitical, focused on his own needs, and impervious to abstract ideals like democracy. He attributed the lack of success in Vietnam compared to the Philippines to Western misunderstanding of Asian traits and the absence of a Magsaysay-like figure. Magsaysay personalized government, making himself accessible to all, addressing grievances directly, and focusing on immediate needs like peace, food, and land.  Col. Fertig stressed the Asian's inability to cope with long-term goals.\n\nMr. Phillips disagreed, believing this underestimated the Asian's understanding of basic rights and dislike of external control. He emphasized the desire for safety and security, and the appeal of a government serving the people, as Magsaysay demonstrated.  He advocated appealing to these desires, promising civil liberties, equal justice, and citizen participation, areas where communists are vulnerable.\n\nCol. Bohannan acknowledged Fertig's point but noted increased Filipino political consciousness.  He agreed that leadership was a key difference, highlighting Magsaysay's unique methods and personal magnetism.  Vietnam lacked such a leader, despite its president's strong purpose and intellect.  Mr. Phillips suggested developing local leaders, citing the Laotian police lieutenant who inspired a village civic and road-building program, and Father Hoa in South Vietnam.  These examples showed the potential of local leadership.\n\nMr. Hosmer asked about Malaya, where information programs targeted the noncommunist population, and psychological warfare targeted terrorists.  Col. White described the simple needs of the average rubber tapper, whose rights were protected by local officials (penghulus).  Communication was direct, with Col. White's band playing in villages, followed by discussions of problems and the army's role.  Various psychological warfare methods were used against terrorists, but a simple carrot-and-stick approach worked with civilians.  Punishments and rewards were determined with local officials, emphasizing fairness and using civil administrators for punishments to enhance their prestige. Once control was established, rewards became more effective.",

    "text": "Trust in local populations is crucial in counterinsurgency. In Malaya, the British benefited from the loyalty of both the civilian and military government. This allowed for easier control and influence compared to other situations where ensuring loyalty within the government, police, and military is a major challenge. In Malaya, disloyal elements could be removed without political ramifications. Conversely, in the Philippines, individuals collaborating with communists might also be government supporters, making it impossible to address their disloyalty due to their political influence.\n\nBuilding trust and cooperation requires individuals who maintain high moral standards, demonstrate efficiency and trust in others, and possess the ability to influence people.  They should learn local customs and languages, consult with local officials, and prioritize a humane and considerate approach. This was demonstrated in Malaya, where a shift from harsh methods to a more respectful approach yielded positive results.  However, the Malayan situation may be unique compared to the challenges faced by American advisors in Vietnam and Laos, where actions must be taken by proxy. Mistakes by individual soldiers can undermine efforts, highlighting the need for careful indoctrination and respect for local civilians. Political and social change should be implemented indirectly, persuading locals to replace undesirable leaders through elections or psychological means, rather than direct action.\n\nRespecting local customs and taboos is paramount. The Japanese occupation of the Philippines illustrated this. Initially viewed positively, the Japanese failed to adapt to local customs, leading to resentment and uprisings. Communists understand the importance of respecting local norms, instructing their soldiers to avoid coercion and be mindful of local customs.  This is evident in their rigorous indoctrination processes, where even requests for reinforcements are denied if troops are not adequately prepared. Communist soldiers typically adhere strictly to these rules, demonstrating respect for local populations even in challenging circumstances.\n\nEstablishing trust and cooperation with local populations involves practical steps.  Setting up first-aid stations, reopening schools, and initiating propaganda campaigns are key activities.  Propaganda efforts can include both collective addresses and individual discussions.  Soldiers can be tasked with engaging in individual conversations to assess the sentiments of the population, identifying hostile, fearful, and cooperative individuals. During purges, leniency towards those who repent and punishment for others is effective.  This approach, combined with early self-government and promoting desired leaders, facilitates consolidation of control. Civic action plays a significant role, and financial resources are crucial. Engaging local officials in decision-making regarding the allocation of funds for projects like wells and highways fosters community involvement and builds trust. Encouraging local initiatives, such as building schools through community contributions, further strengthens cooperation.",

FERTIG pointed out that the importance of a given item to the enemy, and hence its value as a bargaining weapon, bore no necessary relation to its cost. He had once operated in an area of the Philippines to which he and his men gained entrance through a 'side door' that it was essential and yet difficult to protect: The people who lived within the area itself had little use for money or even additional weapons, but their women badly needed sewing needles. In a mutually beneficial arrangement, therefore, the head man was given five rounds of ammunition and ten needles, in return for which he undertook to protect the side door and sentries posted. COL. FERTIG's side also made effective use of another scarce item – matches – adding propaganda value to them by having each book carry General MacArthur's picture with the legend \"I shall return.\" From the anticommunist campaign in the Philippines, some years later, COL VALERIANO recalled a typical and very simple gimmick that proved most effective in bewildering and frightening individual enemy soldiers. He had taken half-sheets of paper, drawn on each of them a staring eye and a triangle with sunrays going out from it, and then had covert patrols plant them in places where the Huks were likely to come across them. The finder's first reaction was likely to be \"What is this piece of paper that has no meaning?\"; his second, \"It must have a meaning, or the enemy wouldn't have bothered to draw it.\" As a result, a number of Huk hideouts and sleeping places were abandoned. COL BOHANNAN advised the use of 'gadgets and gimmicks' only so long as their cost in terms of manpower reserves and effort did not diminish your strength for the military pursuit of the war: as he pointed out, these will at best be auxiliary, never conclusive, weapons. The single most effective device, in his opinion, remains the pocketful of sweets for the children. Most others are useful only by adding a little to the normal harassment and unpleasantness of the guerrilla's life, just enough perhaps to tip the scales for a few of the enemy in favor of giving it up.",

MR PHILLIPS told of a somewhat more intricate scheme executed in Central Vietnam, at the time that the Vietnamese, under the Geneva Agreement, were reoccupying areas long held by the Vietminh: As the Communists withdrew from a locality, they consistently refused to exchange their own wartime scrip for regular Vietnamese currency, and the people of the area were stuck with the worthless money. The Vietnamese, therefore, printed and distributed large numbers of leaflets throughout the areas that the Vietminh were about to leave, stating that anyone wanting to exchange communist scrip for national currency was invited to come on a certain day to the last town that the Vietminh were evacuating. In response to these leaflets, a tremendous crowd of people – some from as far as 100 miles away – arrived at once clamoring for Vietnamese government currency, and the Vietminh, unable to make the exchange, suffered a blow to their prestige because they had to deny what had been assumed to be their own propaganda.",

In Indochina the long rebellion against the French had totally disrupted all traditional administrative and other public services. Given these chaotic conditions, civil administrators were afraid to leave their provincial capitals, thus adding to the neglect and isolation of the villages. Civic action in Vietnam or Laos, therefore, came to mean primarily a special effort, outside normal administrative channels, to bring the services of government to the villages. The first problem in restoring contact between the villages and the central government and re-establishing administrative functions was to regain the people's loyalty and their support. This was no easy matter, for the departing Vietminh had left behind their agents, who constantly assured the population that the Communists would return and that the wisest course, therefore, was to continue supporting them. The task of effective counteraction was carried out through two different types of organization: through army units and through civilian teams, both trained to approach the people directly and to work side by side.",

COL GALULA, reviewing the contrasting attitudes and methods of his own unit in Algeria in terms of their results, thought that confirmed all that COL. WHITE and MR. PHILLIPS had been saying. The battalion he was later to join arrived in February 1956 (a marine battalion made up of draftees, except for the officers, and hastily thrown into Algeria from France), and its immediate task was to clear up a heavily populated area about 15 miles from Algiers. It was at the height of FLN terrorism, when the population was much against the French, and the troops, afraid and furious, reacted angrily and violently:\n\nFor the first three months this earned them considerable applause, until the Paris press criticized them for their alleged harsh reprisals, and the battalion was moved t0 Kabylie 'for disciplinary reasons.' It was at this that COL. GALULA joined the battalion and undertook the slow but ultimately successful task of indoctrination by which to convince the men that they had to avoid whatever would antagonize the civilian population. In the end, some of those who had once resented the label of \"pacifcateurs' came t0 feel quite superiof toward the 'warriors' with their useless methods. Despite the physical hardships they suffered, the men in COL. GALULA's unit became a disciplined, dedicated group (they seemed to include few or no Communists), one of whom, for example, bought medical supplies for native babies out of his own pocket because the army had no provisions for them.\n\nAsked by MR. HOSMER whether he had found it difficult to protect the informers who helped him in the earliest phase of a clearing operation, COL. GALULA said that this had never been a problem, because he did not, except on one occasion, act on the information given him by a single informer. Instead, he waited until he could arrest and interrogate a group of at least three or four men, so that the insurgents would never know which of these had informed against them. Once some degree of control had been established, the informers were no longer in any danger of reprisal; COL. GALULA at first had a platoon to protect them, and eventually he would organize a self-defense corps, from which was recruited the 'commando de cbasse.'\n\nMR HOSMER inquired whether the French had ever had a program for the rehabilitation of FLN prisoners comparable to the EDCOR program in the Philippines. Until 1958, said COL. GALULA, there was no over-all policy; FLN members usually would fight to the end rather than surrender, and the treatment of prisoners, left to the discretion of individual commanders, varied greatly. From 1958 on, however, the official aim was to 'win over' the FLN, though it took years to convince the rebels that they could surrender with impunity. COL. GALULA'$ division gave out medals for capturing, but not for killing, FLN members. Once captured, the ordinary soldiers were frequently released and persuaded to join the French forces, where they made the best recruits for the 'commandos de cbasse.' Members of the FLN's political organization, on the other hand, were sent to rehabilitation camps. But the work there was bungled for lack of a doctrine, or a systematic approach, on which to base the enforcement of discipline. In many camps, instead of working with prisoners individually, the officers in charge (former Vietminh prisoners, who were impressed with the communist brainwashing methods in Indochina even though these obviously had not had the intended effect on the officers themselves) foolishly attempted to win the FLN political prisoners by indoctrinating them with propaganda, with so little success that some camps turned into virtual seminars for the enemy. In the exceptional camp, by contrast, the personality of the commanding officer at times produced unusual results, and it was not uncommon in those instances for the prisoners t0 be given passes to visit their families.\n\nComing back once more to the broader masses, and the means by which to influence them and help them build a stable society, COL. GALULA had found that in Algeria, as undoubtedly elsewhere, the long-range key to pacification was education: His greatest triumph had been his success in teaching the adults, having overcome the resistance even of the fathers, who commanded tremendous respect and veneration and were naturally unwilling to expose themselves as more ignorant than their children. Another generally valid principle that COL. GALULA had derived from his experience in Algeria was that activities on behalf of the people among whom one is operating must be pursued, not only for the sake of 'doing good,' but also for the political benefits likely to accrue from them. And perhaps the most important function of the counterinsurgents, and an indispensable step toward consolidating their gains, is to select the new leaders from among the population.",

In Vietnam, for example, the undeniably superior intelligence of the Viet Cong is today perhaps one of the most serious problems for the loyal troops, whose own movements and plans are frequently known to the Communists, while they themselves have no warning even of operations involving as many as one thousand Viet Cong. COL. VALERIANO was the first tO speak at some length about the approaches to intelligence that he had used or observed in the Philippines, and to mention certain lessons he had learned about the nature of intelligence-gathering. The characteristic scenario in which COL. VALERIANO had to operate was a village known to be heavily supporting a Huk squadron in the field, with most able-bodied male inhabitants out among the armed units that were roving the countryside, hiding by day and operating by night. After trying to determine who was still in the village and who was missing, the most important task of the counterinsurgent side was to learn about the village support organization. The typical village turned out to be organized into several units, each with specific support functions. In general, these support activities were divided between political affairs (which included education and indoctrination) and, more important to the counterinsurgents, intelligence. In trying to establish the connection and methods of communication between the intelligence support units in the village and the units in the field, it was essential to penetrate the village and also, if possible, the armed bands in the hills and swamps. Army agents would move among the villagers disguised as peddlers or delivery boys. In one very successful operation, COL. VALERIANO and a small group of agents went into a swamp area controlled by the guerrillas, passing themselves off as public-works surveyors (They were taking advantage of a publicized government plan for road construction in the area.) Equipped with all the paraphernalia of such a surveying unit, they passed the initial scrutiny of the Huks, who thereafter did not interfere with them, though they did keep them under surveillance and occasionally used them to obtain supplies. Living with the guerrillas as they did, COL. VALERIANO and his men came to know the pattern of the village support organization, and indeed the entire modus operandi by which the armed Huk units were supplied and taxes raised for their support. They began to recognize individuals who might be recruited as counteragents. At first, most of those who were approached with the suggestion that they work for the government refused t0 co-operate. The reason for their reluctance was either lack of understanding or fear; only rarely was it to be sought in dedication to the guerrilla cause. Those who were successfully recruited in this way, however, formed the basis of an intelligence network that began with few agents and simple methods but grew slowly in numbers and complexity. In the beginning, liaison with local agents was maintained by such primitive devices as leaving messages under certain stones or behind a given church pillar. Gradually, however, it became possible to obtain a wealth of valuable information by infiltrating small numbers of men, with radio sets, into the outlying area, where, hidden in the bushes, they could keep an eye on the village at all times, observing the routine of all its inhabitants, noting any unfamiliar faces that turned up, and tracing recurrent patterns that pointed to an intelligence network and code. Still later, COL. VALERIANO resorted to kidnapping certain apparently innocuous civilians and taking them to distant headquarters, where they were well treated and usually persuaded to divulge some information - including such seemingly innocent intelligence as who was particularly friendly with a certain person (who happened to be the brother of a guerrilla leader). All leads so obtained were then promptly developed on the chance that they might yield something important. The Huks' system of communications within their area of operations was simple in its conception and impressive in its effectiveness and reliability; transmission at times was faster than by the government's radio sets. COL. VALERIANO's men stumbled on the entire system almost by accident, after becoming suspicious of certain repetitive patterns of behavior. The basic principle of the guerrillas was to blend all signals into the scenario, using landscape and native customs as camouflage for the code.",

Each agent had a code number for reporting information. While individual observations might be approximate, the combined data plotted on a map provided reliable intelligence for ambushes. The network aimed for one spotter per 10 square miles, sometimes achieving denser coverage.\n\nCol. Valeriano described village screening techniques for recruiting informants. Initial errors stemmed from uninformed approaches, poor troop conduct, and lack of discipline. Standardized methods, strict supervision, and officer accountability improved the process. The screening force was divided into specialized units: 'enclosing' to seal village exits, 'security' as a reserve, 'collection' to assemble inhabitants, and 'search' to inspect houses alongside village officials, who signed statements confirming only subversive material was seized. The collecting unit separated men, women, and children for individual interrogation, comparing testimonies to uncover inconsistencies.\n\nPsychological warfare tactics ranged from staged executions (using chicken blood) to disguising soldiers as informants for identification purposes. Once everyone was interrogated, loyal individuals could safely provide information. Prolonged screenings allowed civic action teams to demonstrate helpfulness, offering medical treatment and fostering trust, sometimes leading to voluntary surrenders.",

Initially, aborigines denied seeing terrorists, but information emerged after prolonged SAS presence. However, CT reprisals upon SAS departure hindered future intelligence gathering. Relocating aborigines proved unsuccessful due to their dependence on the jungle environment.\n\nJungle forts, distinct from fortified bases, were established as resupply and medical points for patrols. These facilitated continuous patrolling by police, fostering trust through medical care and assistance without demanding crop shares. The presence of security forces and the decline of CT influence encouraged aborigines to remain within patrolled areas, receiving compensation for crop losses. Personal contact was crucial, with unorthodox soldiers excelling at building rapport. Each police post assigned such individuals to specific tribes, fostering trust through shared activities and gathering information.\n\nCol. White, operating in settled areas, described the modus operandi within a 'black' area (Figure 3). Wire enclosures surrounded towns, villages, and plantations to control movement and restrict supplies to terrorists. Curfews and centralized food distribution further limited terrorist access. Three enemy types were encountered: (a) Armed Work Forces (AWFs), local natives with community ties, (b) independent platoons operating in the deep jungle, and (c) communist headquarters directing overall operations.",

The commander took no major step without the blessing of both the police chief and the head of Special Branch, and each was at all times fully informed of all activities of the other two. The military intelligence officer, though he did not know everything that Special Branch was doing, enjoyed its confidence and had enough information for a fruitful collaboration.\n\nThe peculiar circumstances in which operations were conducted, the need to move amidst watchful women and children who were known to be enlisted in the enemy's elaborate signaling system, and the fact that the several companies of a battalion were distributed over a large area (with some as much as 20 miles from headquarters) required the strictest measures for the protection of all plans, large and small. No plan was ever made without the presence, and the express approval, of the signal officer (a point whose importance Col. White stressed the more emphatically as he felt that it was not sufficiently appreciated in the American forces). Once a decision had been made and orders had been given to the company, no one was allowed to leave the company area until the operation was well launched. As a standard precaution in nearly all operations, the troops would leave by night. Moreover, to camouflage the movement of troops and agents, military vehicles were in motion at all times on roads specially built along the jungle fringe. On those occasions when they were transporting troops, the men were trained to leave them, fully equipped, at speeds of up to 20 miles an hour, to disappear into the jungle singly, and to reassemble at a prearranged place. (They usually were picked up by helicopters, and returned after a circuitous flight.)\n\nSpecial Branch maintained accurate dossiers on the guerrillas, as well as on the wives who were with them and on their families in the villages. Knowing which wives were pregnant, the troops would listen for the cry of a baby in the jungle at the appropriate time, or lie in wait for the visiting father if the child was born in the village. Wherever possible, the dossiers included photographs of the men (and even the women) which, aside from their obvious usefulness in identification, contributed to troop morale by giving the men a sense of knowing what the enemy looked like whom they were asked to chase. Capt. Jeapes recalled a time, before helicopter traffic in and out of the jungle became relatively easy, when SAS patrols were equipped with small, cheap cameras and asked to photograph every CT they killed and take his fingerprints, for use in identification and also in statistics on the size of the enemy forces.\n\nFinally, terrorists as well as counterinsurgents watched the calendar closely for any holidays—Chinese, Indian, Malay, Australian—when those feasting and drinking might be expected to relax their guard. Col. White at times planned entire operations, with the aid of the calendar, in terms of such calculations.",

    "text": "The techniques used in Algeria were similar in some respects, yet differed in others in response to the unique demands of the situation. The French, Col. Galula explained, were up against three types of rebel units and organizations: the armed forces of the FLN, separately organized terror groups, and the rebels' political organization within the population. Moreover, the intelligence problem varied greatly, and required different techniques, with each of the three main stages of the war, which were determined by changing ratios of military strength and popular support. In the first stage, from the beginning of the war in November 1954 until early 1956, the rebellion spread like brushfire, and the French had neither enough troops nor any support from the people, with the result that they rarely obtained good intelligence and, if they did, were unable to act on it. In the second stage, from early 1956 to 1957, they were still lacking popular support, and their operations, therefore, were blind rather than planned on the basis of intelligence. But manpower by then was adequate, and the forces succeeded in breaking the FLN military organization to the point of reducing it to very small units. Only in the third and final stage, however, did the French have sufficient support from the populace as well as the means to stage major operations (the main problems, by that time, being posed by the rugged terrain and the fact that the armed rebel bands were too small to offer targets). Support from the people was clearly the crucial determinant for successful intelligence, and, hence, ultimately for victory.\n\nAt the highest level of theater and government, where it was possible to intercept the rebels' radio broadcasts to their organizations in Algeria and abroad, the French did have information, but only of the kind that is transmitted through such channels. Below these, intelligence had to be obtained from the people, and at the beginning it was at best sporadic; information volunteered by captured rebels, if not actually false, was either already known or impossible to exploit. The first systematic breakthrough came from the realization that the rebels were forcing their organization, including the obligation to contribute to its support, on the people, all of whom knew the identity of the FLN agent who collected their money and, in turn, was in touch with the higher echelons. With this approach in mind, and aided by the fact that, nominally and physically, they were in control throughout Algeria while the rebels were hiding, the French compartmentalized the country, and the officer and his unit in charge of a compartment were thus able to interrogate and get to know every person within that sector. The method was simple and effective. However, there were mistakes and abuses that led in early 1957 to the formation of a special unit, called *detachment operationel de protection*. These were security troops, which were sent as needed to any local commander on his request. On the same principle, an army paratroop division was called in to take over police functions in Algiers in 1957 after a small terrorist unit of about fifty rebels had effectively terrorized the entire city of 600,000, including the once loyal police. It took the army just one month to wipe out the FLN's civil organization in Algiers.",

    "text": "Col. Galula, too, had coped effectively with the problem of breaking the civil organization in the villages and towns within his command and of persuading the people to pass on the information he needed. He proceeded from the knowledge that the rebels had a three-man committee in every village (the leader, the political commissar, and the money collector), and that the villagers knew every one of the three. Col. Galula's favorite and most successful technique, shortly after he had begun to garrison a village, was to arrest simultaneously several citizens for minor infractions of the curfew or other rules, and to keep them locked up without further punishment or trial. He would interrogate them every day, until, worn out with waiting and feeling somewhat protected by their very number, they would talk one by one. After that, Col. Galula could arrest the village FLN cell and its collaborators—anywhere from ten to fifteen people—knowing that these were the right people. Once a village had been purged, the information always flowed readily. And every reconstituted political organization proved inferior to the previous generation and easier to break.\n\nThe difficulty in Algeria came as the rebels' armed forces declined in size. From up to battalion size in early 1957 they went to less than company strength a year later, until in 1959 the armed enemy consisted only of many small groups of three to ten men. In their attempt to survive, these isolated insurgent bands were favored, on the one hand, by the rugged terrain and, on the other hand, by the surprising density of the population. For one thing, they could easily obtain what food they needed; the weekly market, to which crowds of people came from far away, was too well established a custom for the government to stop, and it made any food-denial plan useless. Observation from the air or through binoculars was equally unsuccessful, as the rebels moved only by night. Eventually, the problem was attacked somewhat more efficiently with the organization of the aforementioned *commandos de chasse*. These units of 30 to 120 men (most of them rebel defectors) were lightly equipped and supplied (the problem of supply and reinforcement was simple because of the large number of posts throughout the country) and sent out into the woods for as much as five days on end to watch and stalk any guerrillas they found, overpower them if they could, and otherwise send the alarm. In the end, however, the surviving rebel bands, though their identities were well known, were caught largely by accident, like small flies in a large net, for they had lost contact with the population, and any information leading to a capture was thus no more than a happy chance.",

    "text": "level agents) and were building up a good intelligence network. To some extent, they succeeded in penetrating the guerrilla organization, though never very deeply. One of their mistakes was to give their intelligence net a twofold job: collection as well as penetration; another blunder, widely publicized by the guerrilla side, was to execute their own informers as well as enemy agents.\nGoing back to counterinsurgent operations in Malaya, MR. HOSMER asked COL. SHIRLEY whether he and his operations-research group had concerned themselves with problems of intelligence. They had not, COL. SHIRLEY explained, but had confined themselves to the examination of weapons, equipment, and techniques, with a view to applying operations-research methods to their improvement. The chief reasons for not entering directly into the area of intelligence were (a) that his group was skilled only in the field of communications intelligence, and this form of intelligence, though vitally important, was not obtainable and usable in that theater and that kind of war as one would like to imagine; and (b) that communications monitoring in Malaya did not play the part that one had come to assume on the basis of the European experience in World War II. COL. SHIRLEY elaborated on both these points.\nThe methods that COL. WHITE had described earlier were typical and most satisfactory for all military operations against small enemy concentrations. With close liaison between the military and the Special Branch (most important at battalion level, but repeated wherever possible at company level), the Special Branch obtained the information and fed it to the commander, who used it as a basis for planning ambushes and attacks. General headquarters, where COL. SHIRLEY was working with both army and air force, would receive the occasional request for air force action against an enemy camp inside the jungle fringe to which the battalion commander had decided not to commit his troops, and would be supplied with whatever intelligence, locally obtained, might help pinpoint the location of the camp on the photographs of the jungle fringe that were maintained at headquarters. As it turned out, however, the information was rarely accurate enough for the precise map references that were needed by the pilots. In addition, the aircraft were fitted with navigational aids that were inadequate for the particular terrain, distances, and low-level attacks involved. The conclusion among the operations-research staff, therefore, was that sudden surprise of the enemy — the most desirable and most difficult objective — was in most instances achieved, not in direct response to intelligence, but through essentially orthodox techniques that had been modified and sharpened (above all through the patient and persistent combing of any area where enemy movement was suspected).\nAs for the monitoring of communications, it came as something of a shock to those conditioned by the European theater, who had been taught the importance of radio security and the need for deception techniques, to realize that the prime requirement for the military in Malaya was simply to get through. Any concern about interception by the Communists was overshadowed by the effort to overcome the difficulty, inadequacy, and slowness of communications. The British battalion groups operated on a number of fixed high frequencies, which in many cases they did not change from one end of the month, or even the year, to the next, unless it were to avoid interference. Furthermore, all the units of a battalion were on the same frequency, so as to heighten the chances that every report would be picked up by at least one of them. Detection and identification should thus have been quite easy for the Chinese terrorists, but if they did intercept, there was no evidence that it ever paid off for them. Had there been, the British would quickly have changed the system.\nAs a final point in the morning’s discussion, MR. HOSMER raised the question of the usefulness of bombing in guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare. How many kills, he asked COL. SHIRLEY, could the average bombing run in Malaya be expected to yield? In the period of the emergency with which he had been associated (that is, 1949-1951), COL. SHIRLEY did not recall evidence of anyone’s being killed by the daily sorties against targets. There were several reasons why planes were nevertheless used: (a) they had an undeniable psychological effect on the guerrillas; (b) they provided stops across lines of escape that could not be covered by infantry (a far preferable system); and (c) they were a means of justifying the presence of as much air force strength as London would permit, against the possibility that these planes might suddenly have to play a vital part in a larger limited war with Communist China. In Malaya the planes actually had a very limited function in the attack role. They clearly could not be used against villages, nor even in the areas between settlements. Their use remained confined to the jungle fringe and (in response, for example, to a radio message from CAPT. JEAPES reporting the presence and location of a camp) the deep jungle. The problem of target-marking, the participants agreed, was never solved satisfactorily, though balloons were the preferred method. COL. SHIRLEY recalled general headquarters’ preoccupation with the difficulty of sighting a communist camp without being sighted first by the concealed communist sentries on the perimeter tracks. The opportunity to use a balloon as a target marker was thus rare indeed, because the CTs would disperse on the alarm from their sentries. COL. SHIRLEY did not, however, rule out the possible usefulness of such a target-marking device in theaters where the guerrilla has become very strong and his larger units thus offer more substantial targets. Vietnam, he thought, might prove to be such an area, as the situation there appeared to be moving from sublimited to limited warfare. COL. WHITE had found bombing a waste of money and of time because of the small size of enemy groups and the difficulty of accurate positioning. He had, however, used fighter support with some success. Indeed, if the enemy’s camps had been larger, this might have been the answer, though, to be fully effective, it would have required the shortening and simplification of communications to the planes. Once again, however, COL. WHITE warned against overemphasizing the British operational experiences in Malaya; with its basic framework of established British administration and a loyal native police, it had been an atypical theater, where commanders like himself never faced some of the formidable problems and obstacles that confronted other members of the Symposium.",

SHIRLEY made this general and basic point, on which he was seconded by other participants: People, he said, are alike in that they want to be on the winning side; therefore, if the democracies can convince the local nation in a guerrilla warfare theater that they, rather than the Communists, will be the ultimate winners, they will not only gain the psychological advantage but will also break through the intelligence barrier. If they fail to do that, even their sympathizers among the local people will naturally shun the danger of informing on the Communists whom they expect to be their masters in the end. MR. PHILLIPS, in support of COL. SHIRLEY’s statement, pointed out that the Communists themselves fully recognized its truth and, therefore, in their propaganda never let up on the theme of inevitable final victory even in the face of setbacks. CAPT. JEAPES had seen the success of this tactic well illustrated among the people of Southeast Asia. Although the large majority of these were not Communists but industrious, peaceful people interested mainly in their families and the business of making a living, many of them worked for the CTs in Malaya, for example, because they felt they had no alternative. Indeed, they begged the British to protect them, in wire enclosures if necessary, against having to help the Communists.\nTurning to the specific techniques of both sides in various past theaters of operations, MR. PHILLIPS described some of the difficulties the Laotian government had had to overcome before it could establish the kind of relations with the people that would yield information. In the days of French rule, when the Communists first came to a village of peaceful Laotians unwilling to do violence to anybody, they methodically set about involving and implicating individuals in terrorist acts, convincing them that they were thereafter on the French blacklist and had best prepare for retaliation, and thus gradually committing more and more of them to anti-French attitudes and violent action. Once committed to the other side, these people were difficult to win back. COL. BOHANNAN returned the discussion to the idea of a single intelligence organization — which COL. WHITE had defended at the morning session, and which undoubtedly had proved workable in Malaya — as one that he thought inconceivable as well as inadvisable in any country not accustomed to British rule and its unique practices. The safer system, whose adoption COL. BOHANNAN favored for all countries faced with insurgency problems, was one in which military intelligence played the primary role, with a second (civilian) intelligence service fulfilling its own useful functions, and each service checking on the other to prevent the danger of its usurping too much power or becoming corrupt. In this way, to be sure, the information might have to go all the way up to the president’s office before it could be fully co-ordinated, but the greater danger, COL. BOHANNAN thought, lay in allowing the fear of exposing operational plans to control the intelligence system. He cited as symptomatic of this mistaken attitude COL. WHITE’s remark that he \"knew everything, but [his] intelligence officer did not.\" Moreover, he was not easily persuaded that the British system was necessarily the more efficient. In the Philippines between 1947 and 1950 the following were working on the communist problem in Manila alone: Military Intelligence Service (MIS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (with separate branches of intelligence and counterintelligence), the Philippine Constabulary, the National Bureau of Investigation, the Ministry of the Interior; secret agents of the president; Customs, Immigration, Internal Revenue, secret agents of the Special Branch of the Manila Police, and intelligence agents of other countries. With all the inevitable confusion, overlapping, and rivalry that went with this diversity of effort, these many organizations, with large numbers of people and very little money, did a good job of maintaining intelligence on the Communists. Later, when action against the Huks really got under way, intelligence activity in the field was the responsibility of MIS, whose support of the combat forces took two forms. Certain teams were more or less permanently assigned to the combat forces (each battalion combat team had one MIS team); other teams operated directly out of headquarters, either to augment a particular combat team or to work independently of the military commander in the area. The permanent assignment of MIS officers throughout an area with a view to establishing informants’ nets against possible subversion, all the while co-operating closely with any combat units in the area, seemed to COL. BOHANNAN a sine qua non in all countries with actual or potential guerrilla problems. CAPT. JEAPES (speaking also on behalf of the absent COL. WHITE) was shocked at the assumption of other-than-total trust between the services. But to COL. BOHANNAN a certain degree of distrust, rivalry, and even occasional enmity between the civilian and the military intelligence services was a fact of life that did not seriously affect the capacity for fighting the common enemy; obviously, one had to seek within such a system what co-ordination and collaboration one could achieve. To COL. SHIRLEY, who described the single-service arrangement as administratively and psychologically the only possible extension of the situation the military encountered on arriving in Malaya, COL. BOHANNAN granted that this was indeed the natural and best method for Malaya (as for other parts of the British Empire). But compare this, he suggested, with the average South American, Middle Eastern, or Southeast Asian country, where the principal business of the",

    "text": "The armed forces' role is to maintain internal security in case of rebellion. The ministry of the interior likely controls a national police force, potentially creating rivalry with the armed forces.  The president may have a separate intelligence service to oversee both. In a rebellion, an army lacking its own intelligence service would rely on the police, leading to interservice dependence, rivalry, and compromised information flow if the police are connected to or sympathetic with the rebellion. A separate military intelligence service, with officers and agents throughout the country cooperating with but independent from the police, is essential.  Police loyalty, if properly supported, can be relied upon. The British likely had alternative systems in Malaya if the police proved disloyal.  Counterinsurgency operations, like in Malaya and Kenya, sometimes begin as police actions before military involvement. In Malaya, the British found well-established intelligence operations within police stations. The police proved efficient and loyal, possessing information the battalion commander lacked, leading to a natural division of labor where police handled undercover methods and troops focused on orthodox military intelligence. Algeria experienced both unified and dual systems. At higher levels, in cities, intelligence was divided among the Police de Renseignements Generaux, the Surete, and the Bureau de Securite de Territoire (counterintelligence).  In rural areas, the Surete was absent, civilian police were powerless, the constabulary was militarily oriented, and the army handled all intelligence with a single military intelligence service. The Philippines presented a different scenario, with Filipino insurgents fought by Filipino troops, advised by a few Americans. Vested interests and political pressures hindered the counterinsurgency effort. This situation mirrored Vietnam, where President Diem resisted creating a truly efficient intelligence organization, fearing its potential misuse by political rivals. He prioritized maintaining power over efficiency, reminiscent of France, where a unified police and intelligence service was considered dangerous. In underdeveloped countries, military personnel often make the best intelligence officers, administrators, and economic developers due to their experience and training.  Villagers might confide in familiar policemen rather than unknown soldiers, though political reasons could cause distrust of local police while the army's efficiency and protection might inspire confidence. Villagers prioritize avoiding risk, preferring to report to those who can act immediately, potentially favoring local law enforcement over military intelligence who need to report to headquarters.  A common problem is finding safe ways for potential informers to share information. In Malaya, police would surround a village during curfew, leaving blank paper at each house. Villagers could anonymously write information on the paper and drop it in a box collected the next morning. Catholic priests can also be information channels, especially if the enemy is communist or represents another ungodly cause.",

    "text": "The British War Office recognized early on that communication failures hampered military operations in Malaya. Despite adequate intelligence and military power, it couldn't be effectively deployed due to communication limitations. Colonel Shirley, a communications engineer and operations-research specialist, was tasked with improving communications in Malaya using existing materials.  The forces were operating beyond their equipment's range. Battalions used high-frequency (HF) equipment, despite a post-World War II shift to very high frequencies (VHF). VHF, while free from interference, depended on an unbroken direct ray, unsuitable for Malaya's terrain.  The military reverted to discarded HF equipment. Infantry signalers, surprisingly, managed to communicate over 50-60 miles using Morse code and wire aerials, exploiting the skywave (indirect ray) despite a limited groundwave range.  The main drawback was the need to halt for communication, as movement with a long antenna was impossible.  Shirley's team focused on optimizing the skywave method, identifying the E layer of the ionosphere, around 80 miles up, as more efficient than the higher F layer.  This discovery, based on data from the University of Singapore, was adopted in Malaya and signal manuals. They also realized that skywave signals travelled almost vertically, allowing directional radio techniques for vertical beaming.  Given the terrain and fixed headquarters locations, a simple, cheap, broadly directional antenna using two half-waves was recommended and adopted, despite initial skepticism. It proved effective and was later improved with two full waves. Another issue was signal failure despite adequate equipment. The main cause was minor frequency mismatches between patrols and headquarters, easily corrected once identified.  Malayan forces didn't change frequencies daily, preferring a single, familiar frequency. This practice was accepted, as the enemy either wasn't intercepting or wasn't exploiting intercepted intelligence.  However, Colonel Shirley warned against misinterpreting enemy capabilities, emphasizing the need to verify that interceptions were the source of enemy intelligence to avoid compromising a good communication system unnecessarily. Tuning remained a problem. Supply drop failures occurred due to slight frequency mismatches, but the suggestion to switch to crystal control was rejected due to the number of crystals needed and the risk of losing usable channels due to unexpected interference.  Besides optimizing frequencies and introducing simple antennas, the team addressed general antenna problems. Jungle patrols developed resourceful techniques to raise wires above trees, using quarter-wave antennas.",

    "text": "half-wave; some, three-quarter-wave. There were different theories also about the most desirable angle at which to point the aerial, though, as COL. SHIRLEY's group was able to show, the use of the skywave made the orientation of the antenna quite unimportant. Given a free choice, and especially if they were using some groundwave as well, the patrols were advised, for maximum radiation, to point their antenna at right angles to the direction in which they were trying to communicate. On the whole, however, no major solutions to the antenna problem were found, and no significant changes introduced, as a result of these research efforts. The troops did not take to the idea of using target-marking balloons to raise their antennas, for fear that these might give their positions away. Although the strung aerials that they continued to use worked well enough, there is much room for research, COL. SHIRLEY believes, into the question of just how much would be gained in strength of transmission by elevating the antenna to the maximum height to which the troops are physically able to raise it.\nThe rest of the team's effort was directed toward the design of equipment with a form factor better suited to the operation in Malaya than the heavy and awkward World War II radio sets that were then being used. COL. SHIRLEY was able to look at some excellent light and compact American sets that were being designed at the time. But being VHF equipment, they were not usable over the large distances in Malaya, where the rugged terrain made it impossible to build and, if necessary, to defend the relay stations that would have been required. In Kenya, by contrast, though the distances were comparable, it was possible to use VHF. Much of the activity there took place outside the jungle, the high points on the rolling terrain were often accessible by road and hence suitable spots for relay stations, and police stations, which were nearly always on high ground and had radio communications, could be used as temporary radio headquarters from which, with antennas sufficiently raised, VHF was made to work. Even here, however, the British had difficulty finding suitable, horizontally directional, antennas among their own combat VHF equipment at that time, and eventually were able to obtain these only from America.\nFinally, a severely limiting factor, and a problem never fully solved, was the supply of batteries and power for the radio sets. The infantry were persuaded to carry batteries in their packs. In addition, there were larger, heavier batteries for higher-powered, more reliable sets. Unless it was possible to resupply batteries by air, however, transmission and reception time had to be kept to the minimum necessary to make the batteries last (Air supply became easier as the war went on.) The few generators available were most unpopular with the troops because of the strain of carrying and pedaling them. In a few special cases, small gasoline generators were dropped into the jungle by helicopter. (CAPT. JEAPES, to COL. SHIRLEY's surprise, had never received or even seen one of these, though he had had occasion to admire the American model.) A British generator that was fired by wood and could produce enough watts for a lower-powered set was devised during World War II but never reached Malaya; and an idea for using thermoelectric power was not developed. The solution of the power-supply problem, COL. SHIRLEY thought, might lie in the much-publicized development by the United States of a generator fired by propane (presumably also by wood, if necessary), which could produce a few hundred watts — enough, that is, for the communications requirements of any counterinsurgency operation — and would have the virtue, above all, of being absolutely silent. Although these generators would not be light, they would obviously be far superior to anything the British were compelled to use in Malaya and Kenya.",

    "text": "Unlike the British in the Malayan and Kenya campaigns, the Americans believe in crystal control. According to CAPT. JEAPES, their Special Forces are equipped with crystal sets today; and COL. FERTIG told of using crystals in the Philippines throughout World War II, chiefly for lack of personnel that could tune other sets accurately. As for power supply, COL. FERTIG recalled, the troops in the Philippines had some success with a steam generator that worked best when it could be fired on straight coconut shell (its firebox being too small for anything else). Mainly, however, the forces benefited by the fact that International Harvester, some time before the war, had brought in large numbers of 5- to 7-horsepower single-cylinder engines that drove a generator (with even a built-in radio-noise suppressor). This self-contained unit, which ran on any kind of fuel available, could be turned into a small power plant, and it became the main source of power despite the fact that it required two strong men to carry one set. The available gas generators were useless for lack of gas (They would not run on alcohol.) The best generators for continual rugged use in the tropical climate turned out to be a few World War I models that had been sold to the Japanese as surplus and recaptured from them in World War II. Batteries were a great problem in the Philippines, as was all equipment that came off the shelves and had not been designed for the tropics. Most communications problems were solved by the fortuitous arrival of a medical officer who turned out to be an ingenious ham operator and was placed in charge of the signal section. Thereafter, portable sending sets were built on the spot, on small boards, from tubes, coils, and crystals that had been shipped in. Another lucky break was the fact that every municipality in COL. FERTIG's area had been equipped before the war with a fine Phillips tropic-proof all-band receiver, which, though heavy to carry, was very rugged, packed easily, and worked beautifully. As for high-wattage units for central stations, the best 100-watt set available — the so-called \"suitcase\" set that could be charged on almost any voltage — had been designed specifically for Europe (and was therefore not to be issued through channels to any other theater); but it had been possible to \"steal\" some of these sets in Washington and have them brought into Manila with the first penetration party. Like other American army equipment not built for the tropics, their cases had to be waterproofed at once with varnish or wax and then kept as cool as possible.\nCOL. SHIRLEY, in a final comment on his own and COL. FERTIG's account of the technical inadequacies of equipment, pointed out that many of these shortcomings had meanwhile been corrected. The HF tuning problem, for example, does not exist with the newest sets, which have all the advantages of easy, accurate tuning of the crystal-control set, without the disadvantage of rigid confinement to a limited number of fixed frequencies. There are also available today sets no larger or heavier than the old half-watt sets but capable of putting out over 100 watts. Having a large number of fairly high-powered sets operating in a single country (for example, in Vietnam) does, of course, increase the likelihood of interference among the various groups. But this problem can be solved partly through wise frequency selection and the use of proper directional antennas; in addition, it will require discipline and training to keep air messages to minimum verbiage and thereby permit the largest possible number of operators to share a single frequency without undue interference.",

    "text": ".S. Air Force: The technology of a village alarm device, MR RUTKOWSKI concluded, is at the most a secondary problem; the crucial question is what happens at the end where the message is received. For without the facilities and procedures for instant action, a signal system quickly becomes worthless. COL VALERIANO, fully alert to that problem, had evolved an elaborate, and apparently very successful, standard procedure in his area of command in the Philippines, which he now described in some detail. All the large towns in the area maintained regular telephone contact with battalion headquarters. Against the possibility that the Huks might cut telephone wires, and because they invariably attacked at night, the local defense forces were equipped with flares and kites, whose working condition was periodically tested by detachments. Also, COL. VALERIANO had sporadic test runs to show just how fast a mobile reserve could rush from the camp to the point of contact; and how promptly the local defenders could attack from the other side. The cutting of telephone lines might herald either an attack on the town or an ambush of reinforcements, and the troops had to prepare to meet the Huks from both directions. Throughout the night, beginning with the 4:00 P.M. change-over to the new officer of the day, and working by a strict timetable, officers or other members of the guard would call up the various telephone contacts at specified times. Whenever one failed to answer, a scout or armored car would be dispatched; it was preceded, however, by the so-called honeymoon team: an enlisted man and a woman agent, disguised as peasants and traveling in a dilapidated civilian vehicle as though late returning from market, who thus blended naturally into local landscape and customs. As the pattern of the Huk ambush included a signaler at each end of the ambush zone, the woman of the team was trained to look backward. If she noted a signal behind she would flash the alarm as soon as she and her companion reached the next town; if there was no sign of trouble, the scout car could safely proceed and be followed by the telephone repair truck. As another part of the standard operating procedure, and an effective counter-check on the routine just described, any town that failed to receive its telephone signal at the appointed time would send out shooting flares, which were relayed by intelligence teams hidden throughout the area and equipped with radio sets. Needless to say, an automatic alarm system of the kind described earlier would greatly have facilitated the task, especially for the remoter spots, and COL VALERIANO admitted having 'dreamed about one.",

SHIRLEY pointed out that each scenario called for a different support program: Given the inevitable limitations in funds, and therefore the need for priorities, one area commander might request simple voice transmitters above all else, another would want to put available money into tighter military controls, a third would wish to have more in the way of orthodox communications for the central villages and perhaps some simple gadgets for the smaller ones, and so on. In Malaya, for example, police and wire communications were relatively good (if the rebels cut the wires, as they did almost nightly, this had the advantage of helping the defending forces to spot them), and no request for an automatic alarm system was ever put forward. On the other hand, the very simple voice alarm system that COL. SHIRLEY tended to favor – a set comparable to the \"Gibson Girl\" in cheapness and operating on one frequency – would not be difficult to design, and would afford the opportunity to pass on limited information if time permitted. CAPT. JEAPES argued strongly for the merits of such a system as compared to the automatic push-button set advocated by COL. GALULA; wherever a voice system was available in Malaya, he had found planters reporting information between rounds in the midst of a firing engagement. There was general agreement with MR HOSMER as to the importance of reaching the trouble spot in time to save the man under attack. COL. BOHANNAN pointed out, however, that there is psychological value to be derived from the very fact that the troops begin acting instantly, even though they may not always arrive in time. COL SHIRLEY added that the enemy, knowing that the defending forces have communications and are on their way, will often be prompted to clear out in advance of the troops' arrival, which amounts to an indirect military gain for the counterinsurgent side and can be an important factor in the general objective of keeping a war at the guerrilla level.",

VALERIANO then gave a detailed account of an incident that took place in a typical area near his battalion headquarters, an excellent illustration of the functioning of the communications system he had described earlier (See Fig. 5). At the time of the incident, although the army had regained control of the town and villages shown in the figure, the Huks were continuing to harass these settlements, chiefly because they had once been a center of supply activities. At the recommendation of his civil affairs officer, COL VALERIANO had assigned one of his best sergeants and a PFC to organizing and training a civilian guard of about fifty men, including both police and armed civilians, as the area's local defense force. One night at 11:45, battalion headquarters found the telephone connection to the municipal center to have been cut, presaging either a Huk attack on the town and villages or an ambush of the reinforcements that the enemy expected to be dispatched along the road to town. Simultaneously with the discovery at headquarters, the people in town who failed to receive the scheduled call sent up a blue flare (blue being the code that indicated \"line cut; but danger not imminent\"), and this signal was picked up and relayed to headquarters by individuals in each settlement whose job it was to watch in the direction of the town. The honeymoon team, followed by the scout car, was promptly sent out in the standard manner. Before reaching the second bend in the road, the man and woman, noticing lights by the side of the road that betrayed the presence of Huks at that natural ambush site, stopped their own vehicle and the scout team behind them. Meanwhile, the sergeant with his local defense force near the town, on the far side of the trouble spot, having seen no movement on the perimeter of the town, suspected (correctly) that the enemy's plan was to attack the reinforcements rather than the town. Leaving behind only a small contingent of defenders, he marched most of the fifty-odd civilians and police down the road and caught the ambushers from the rear, killing nine of the thirty-six Huks in the party.",

    "text": "Mr. Hosmer introduced Lt. Col. Frank Kitson, a British officer with extensive operational experience in Kenya and Malaya, to speak about the campaign in Kenya. Col. Kitson acknowledged the importance of political and economic factors before addressing the military problem. He proposed generally applicable principles and related them to the Kenya case.\n\nThe most important objective is to obtain and use information about the enemy. The guerrilla's aim is to win control of the population, not necessarily to defeat the other side in battle. Therefore, the counterinsurgent must achieve direct contact with the population. This requires assembling background intelligence and developing it into 'contact information' to put troops in contact with the enemy. Developing this information is the main tactical job of company and battalion commanders, aided by 'special forces'.\n\nThe emergency in Kenya differed from other terrorist warfare cases. The rebellion was confined to a small area, but the number of terrorists (15,000 at its height) was far greater than in Cyprus or Malaya. The war was shorter but more concentrated and violent, with 12,000 killed in less than four years. The terrain was difficult, with two major mountain ranges. Only one tribe, the Kikuyu, was involved, making it a civil war within the tribe, also involving the European community.\n\nSecurity forces included district commissioners' forces (home guard and tribal police), regular uniformed police, and armed forces (East African army and British imperial troops). The main cause of the rebellion, in Col. Kitson's view, was the discontent of educated men like Jomo Kenyatta, who incited revolt over a bogus land issue, skillfully interwoven with a spiritualistic cult. The original leaders were captured early, leaving the movement with inferior leadership.\n\nThe active wing of the Mau Mau consisted of gangs based in the forests (10,000-15,000), organized into units resembling battalions, companies, and platoons. They lived in groups of about 100, sometimes combining for operations. The 'passive wing' consisted of committees in reserves and towns, responsible for collecting food, money, arms, and indoctrinating the population. The gangs concentrated on suppressing resistance among the Kikuyu, attacking those not supporting the movement. They tended to leave European farmers alone, fighting only European troops they encountered in small numbers. Security forces were largely (75%) Kikuyu home guard, with never more than six British battalions present.",

    "text": "The Mau Mau depended on the population for support and were prepared to stage large attacks to kill resisters and acquire arms. Counteraction required intelligence, collected by the Police Special Branch, initially very small. Col. Kitson joined and assisted them. He started with overt intelligence, driving around and passing facts to the district commissioner. Talking to prisoners through interpreters proved useless due to lack of background information. Sons of European settlers, fluent in the language and familiar with the Kikuyu, provided valuable help by talking to prisoners directly, obtaining more overt intelligence.\n\nDeveloping contact information was aided by captured documents. Prisoners were trapped in lies and broken down by confronting them with known information. One prisoner became a valuable informer, leading a gang into an ambush and infiltrating a larger group with local Africans and British soldiers disguised as Mau Mau.\n\nThis success led to a system of using informers to provide background information, which Col. Kitson and others developed and passed on to troops. They occasionally used the information for direct contact. British commanders often complained about lack of information, but Col. Kitson believed this stemmed from a misconception of intelligence in guerrilla warfare. They expected precise knowledge of enemy movements, which was impossible. Instead, they should have used available data as a starting point, developing their own intelligence by studying enemy patterns, tribal customs, and tangible evidence.\n\nA comprehensive intelligence system requires both information from special forces agents penetrating the enemy high command and low-level data from numerous sources. While many sources might be unreliable, together they provide a mosaic of enemy activity. Building such a network requires prioritizing speed over quality initially, with screening and sorting coming later. This principle, though initially controversial, gained acceptance.\n\nCol. Fertig agreed, citing his own difficulties convincing commanders of the need for diverse sources beyond top agents. He felt these methods were never fully accepted by Americans despite their proven results.",

    "text": "Col. Kitson addressed how to turn captured Mau Mau into counter-gangsters. The first step is understanding why someone joins the insurgency – usually due to social connections or the allure of adventure and loot, rather than ideology. These individuals can be won over by offering adventure, fulfilling basic needs, and reuniting them with friends. It's crucial to demonstrate power and present cooperation as the only alternative to execution or imprisonment – the carrot-and-stick method.\n\nAnother successful technique was sowing distrust among rebels, making them suspect each other of being counter-gangsters. This led to instances of rebels killing each other due to paranoia. One example involved a pseudo-gang killing a large number of rebels by pretending to suspect them and insisting on searching them.\n\nCol. Kitson emphasized the importance of not moving company commanders and their units too frequently, allowing them to fully exploit the situation they've built up. Brig. Powell-Jones concurred, reiterating the principle of clearing one area entirely before moving on to another.",

    "text": "But he pointed out that pressure from the top to produce quick, spectacular successes, or to clear up a given area by a given date as part of a larger program, was often responsible for premature withdrawal. Psychological warfare techniques (in answer to a question from MR. PHILLIPS) entered into the attempt to turn the Mau Mau against one another, though they were more likely to be called 'special operations' and were not handled by the official psychological warfare people: Nor were some of the established logical warfare methods, such as the distribution of propaganda leaflets, very useful where so many of the people were illiterate: Loudspeakers were effective at times, as when you wanted to tell terrorists who were cornered in a swamp that they were in fact trapped. More successful in getting to the rebels and sowing confusion and suspicion among them was the attempt to ascertain their courier system and inject messages into it: (They had a very efficient network of \"letter boxes;\" which actually consisted of trees, cleft sticks, and similar landmarks where notes could be left)\nIn the main, the entire pseudogang approach may be said to have been based largely on trickery, and to some extent on the fact that even in dedicated causes there are always (as BRIG. POWELL-JONES put it) venal men, and that everyone and every secret had a price. Thus, low-grade information could often be tricked away by bribery, though there was not much point in actually posting rewards, as few would have been able to read the posters. A more successful form of trickery involved extremely elaborate and protracted operations, some of which did not pay off for months. COL. KITSON cited examples: (1) In developing an area, his troops would find out the location of, say, four farms that were supplying the rebels with food, but would deliberately pick up only three of them, causing the Mau Mau to come to the fourth one more and more often and in growing numbers, to be eventually surrounded and caught. (2) On moving into an area where an elusive gang was known to be operating, the troops pretended to be gangsters themselves and built the entire region up from the Mau Mau point of view. They began by making contact with the passive supporting element; and eventually approached the gang itself. Once trust had been established, the pseudo-gang persuaded the genuine gang to come to joint meetings, on such pretexts as a conflict over poaching in each other's area. At the end of sometimes several such meetings, when all possible distrust had been allayed and the entire gang was assembled, the troops would close in (a dangerous maneuver, in which identities were sometimes confused and accidents happened).",

    "text": "A phenomenon peculiar to the war in Kenya, as compared to the other guerrilla warfare theaters discussed, was the role of magic. To this all of tribal Africa is dominated by magic, and the village witch doctor; far from being simply an evil man, is both priest and doctor; with tremendous influence. One of his functions, and a major source of his income, is the administration of oaths, a very effective means of controlling native behavior and approaching a system of justice: A man will not perjure himself under such an oath, for he is convinced that the witch doctor can decree a dreadful fate for him if he does. To some extent, their primitive superstitions made the Mau Mau highly unpredictable and a more difficult problem for the British than terrorists elsewhere. Whereas you could count on the Malayan Communists, for example, to act logically and according to plan (and you only needed to find out the plan in order to anticipate them), the Mau Mau were inconsistent. If the witch doctor declared that a certain night augured ill for a projected undertaking, it would be abandoned. Also, the terrorists used the power of the oath very effectively to bind people together in secrecy; or, in a sinister refinement of the method, they would administer it in ways that were taboo under tribal law, thereby pushing the sworn person outside the society (which was on the side of the government) beyond any chance of return. With time, the oath became a somewhat less powerful weapon, as the Mau Mau, pressed for money, resorted to readministering a single oath for the sake of the revenue. Also, captured prisoners, choosing between the death they feared from violating the oath of secrecy and a similar fate at the hands of the enemy if they did not talk, might decide to spill a secret and then find out that the oath did not kill after all. The counterinsurgents usefully exploited the factor of magic, administering oaths themselves (for example, to establish the authenticity of a pseudogang), and hiring the very able village witch doctors, who were on the side of the authorities and whose services were for sale to any bidder, to do individual jobs, such as persuading a recalcitrant terrorist or villager to talk.",

KITSON described the methods and the success of what became known in Kenya as \"villagization.\" The Kikuyu, a family-based tribe where normally members of one clan live in a group of huts that may be miles away from the next group, did not take readily to resettlement in villages, and many district commissioners and other administrators opposed the scheme as certain to drive people into the Mau Mau camp. But it was the only way of preventing food from getting to the terrorists, and, undertaken on a large scale, it proved very efficient. BRIG. POWELL-JONES noted that in Malaya, too, the Chinese initially hated having to live in the reserves, but were quick to realize their advantages, including schools for their children, and in most cases chose not to leave the reserve after they were free to do so. In Algeria, according to COL. GALULA, the main support for resettlement had come from the women, who enjoyed the more varied social life of these villages. Apart from putting moats around the villages, no serious attempt was made to \"fence in\" areas in which the Mau Mau were operating: COL. KITSON recalled the abortive effort to contain the rebels by clearing, at great expense, a half-mile strip around the jungle where they were hiding, with the idea that any terrorist within that strip could be readily spotted and shot. Within a year, instead of the former primal forest, which is not totally impassable, the area had become dense secondary jungle, and the rebels benefited.",

In answer t0 a question from MR RUTKOWSKI about differences in techniques between and night operations in Kenya: Generally speaking, jungle operations were undertaken by and those inside the reserves and European areas by night In the jungle the Mau Mau, like regular troops, depended on guides; who could find their way only by daylight Inside the perimeter the Mau Mau attacked at night, and that was also the time, therefore, for antiterrorist ambushes: The only exceptions occurred in the early period of large Mau Mau concentrations, when occasionally groups of up to five hundred rebels would come out of the bush and spend two or three and nights in continuous raiding: The Mau Mau were, on the whole, poorly equipped with weapons, and about two-thirds of the men in a typical platoon had only the most primitive, homemade guns (sometimes a piece of wood and a length of pipe tied together with a bit of wire, a contraption that might O might not work, but which could kill a man if he were hit at close range and in a vulnerable spot).

The Sten gun he regarded as less good, for it lacks the velocity that will fell the African who is swathed in blankets and, in any case, can absorb an unbelievable amount of lead without taking notice of it: The Bren gun is too heavy tO carry around in the circumstances of jungle warfare And the submachine gun is insufficient from the of view of velocity. In Malaya, by contrast; the light machine gun (in answer to BRIG. POWELL-JONES' question) was quite an effective ambush weapon, for the Chinese wore very few clothes, and their reactions to injufy and pain, in general, were much more like ours than like those of the African natives Even in Malaya, howevet, COL. KITSON's first choice would have been a rifle and, best of all, the five-round shotgun (the American Winchester); in Kenya he himself occasionally used his heavy English double- barreled shotgun: MR. HOSMER wanted to know when, precisely, the tide turned against the Mau Mau in Kenya, and hOw the British knew at a given point that were winning COL. KITSON: Politically, the tide turned shortly after the beginning of the emergency, in October 1952, with the arrest of all the intelligent, purposeful leaders, including Jomo Kenyatta (This carried out by the Special Branch with tWo Of three top agents, was the most efficient operation in the campaign ) Under the second-string leaders who took their place; the movement had neither a formulated aim nor real direction, and was doomed to eventual political failure Militarily, the tide turned in April 1954, when, in a single and unique opera- tion, the government forces broke the back of the elaborate committee system that ammunition, recruits, and money for the military organization: Concen- trating 0n the largest district in the south of the Kikuyu reserve (Kimbu, with a population of 350,000) and on the large Kikuyu element in Nairobi, the British began by rounding up the 70,000 Kikuyu in Nairobi and sending them to seashore camps 500 miles away; then isolated Nairobi from the Kimbu district by surrounding the with checkpoints at which intercepted supplies from Kimbu and tried to discover the identities of the committee members who had sent them. This was SO successful that for several months no supplies came through at all. When the organization seemed to be building up again, it took only another large pickup like the first to sever the connection permanently: And from June 1954 onward the gangs dwindled in size. They could no longer get the needed they point they feat, supplied they city they BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 135 recruits, and thus could not afford the tremendous losses that accompanied their previous large-scale operations; nor did they have the means with which to feed and equip such large numbers The government retained the offensive until the end\nof the emergency.",

General Collins, as Chief of Staff, directed that all officers with experience in guerrilla or counterguerrilla operations be designated by a letter following their serial number; which cut down greatly on the screening process. This procedure, followed at least through 1954 and possibly thereafter, runs counter to the Army's idea of the use of manpower; which is t0 eliminate the specialist; to make everyone capable in a wide variety of functions and situations, and to select personnel for their general usefulness rather than any special skill and experience: The British may have had a superior measuring system,to judge by the quality of their selection BRIG. POWELL-JONES doubted that the British had a system from which the Americans could profit They are quick to note a man' $ special experience and performance and to use him accordingly. But they have no machinery for testing a man's potential in advance of performance-an aim that BRIG. POWELL-JONES regards as the personnel man'$ civilian-life approach, and one impractical for any army, even a citizen'$ army. There is always in the British army a voluntary element ~a tradition that has produced Lawrence of Arabia and other geniuses But the run- of-the-mill man is spotted and selected for this kind of work because, at some time in his career, he has found himself; often by chance, in circumstances that afforded him an opportunity tO excel and show this special ability.

GALULA himself had frequently, and successfully, placed an able sergeant from among the draftees in charge of a unit, instead of a less suitable officer:) This is the principle followed also by the revolutionaries, and it makes for a very quick and effcient natural selection among them GEN LANSDALE, referring to the particularly difficult task of the American army in having to select from vast numbers of men (first through IBM-machine and other mechanical methods, and thereafter by a personal, close-up screening process) , stressed the final and virtually insoluble problem of choosing from a roster of men seemingly equal in experience and aptitude the one possessing what he called the X-factor' L such intangible qualities as imagination and empathy Sa= which makes him stand out above the others The British, BRIG. POWELL-JONES granted, never had a comparable problem, as worked only on a relatively small scale and in places far apart in time and space. With them; volunteers have always been a major selection factor: In addi- tion, he repeated, there has been the element of chance by which men like Wingate and Bernhard Fergusson revealed their unique qualifications for the command tions were subsequently given: The man who shows himself as peculiarly suited to leadership in fevolutionary warfare, however, frequently presents a problem to the army that chooses him; for he is likely to operate in unorthodox ways, spending money and effort recklessly, ignoring discipline, ill-treating prisoners, and the like COL. BOHANNAN quoted an earlier remark of CAPT. JBAPES t0 the effect that the most suitable person is often 'the chap who is slightly mad\" a view he regarded as characteristic of the British and French, and indubitably sound: Unfor- tunately, however; it was not likely to be shared by Americans, especially the 'personnel management' person, because America lacks those nations' traditional respect for the eccentric.

POWELL-JONES saw here a possible argument to support the con- tention that the civil and military top command should be centered in one man (as it had been in Malaya under Templer;, who was both High Commissioner and head of the m ilitary effort) Where this is organizationally not feasible, one will have to make sure that the civilian leadership is as unorthodox as the military: If it is not, the situation affords many opportunities for dangerous friction and disagreement: Turning from military problems to the discussion of nonmilitary techniques, MR HOSMER raised the question of what specific advice and indoctrination to give, for example, to Americans now going to South Vietnam. Aside from the aims already mentioned-understanding the needs and wishes of the populace, working with the civilians, and building up trust- S_ what should be the approach, especially in areas where the Western power is not in charge of operations and policy?

SHIRLEY to return once more to the question of just how to recognize in advance a man' s aptitude for the function just outlined by COL: VALERIANO. He himself favored relying on the knowledge and recommendations of people with experience in the area, whose judgment he trusted ~ a method preferable to card-index screening for small-scale operations, but one admittedly useless for mass selections 0r for choosing a few men from & vast reservoir: COL. GALULA stressed his earlier point that a single good man found in such a way can be expected to recognize, train, and influence others like himself: COL FERTIG, on the other hand, had found in his own experience that the problem would always remain complicated by the imponderable factor that sing ing speak they they learn, doing, capable again proof BRITISH KENYA CAMPAIGN AND PERSONNEL FOR COUNTERINSURGENCY 139 makes the seemingly unlikely person emerge as the ablest: When he was left behind in the Philippines with 180 Americans five officers and the rest enlisted men from the four services-all of whom had refused to surrender, 109 volun- teered to stay on as guerrillas The very mildest among them was captured and mis- treated by the Japanese, managed to escape On the night before his hanging, and thereafter became COL FERTIG s finest small-unit commander ~ a development quite unforeseeable in terms of his background and basic disposition: COL. FERTIG granted, however, that men who refused to surrender; Or who took to the hills after escaping, were already a select group likely to include the potential leaders The participants concluded their discussion of the topic with an attempt to list the criteria that each would use were he to select personnel for work in areas such as Vietnam: COL VALERIANO thought that the first requirement was a man'$ willingness to do the job. (There was general agreement that it was well to begin with volunteers ) Next; he would inquire whether the candidate had had experience in guerrilla warfare and, failing that; whether he had been a keen student of the subject If he had none of those qualifications, COL. VALERIANO would tend to give preference to the man with a good liberal education In his opinion, the service academies, because of their excellent liberal-arts curriculum, afe likely to produce guerrilla leaders provided they become oriented to that kind of warfare COL, FERTIG did not entirely agree with COL. VALERIANO. In the Philippines, he pointed out; the percentage of academy graduates in command positions had been surprisingly small: If he were forced to select a group hurriedly, he:would choose men from the mountains of Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, and the far West;or from the back country of Australia The mountaineer, in his experience, is the natural guerrilla fighter, able to use his wits and never afraid of being lost in the hills,as compared, for example, with from the Fast Coast of the United States, many of whom were terrified of the terrain in the Philippines To COL. KITSON, the theory about the value of special aptitudes and previous conditioning sounded convincing, but everything in his own: experience tended to disprove it: He and most of the men in his regiment had come from London, yet \"On reviewing his own and COL.

What are the precise factors to be included in a yardstick? What weight would you give, for example, to numbers of casualties Or to the incident fate of terrorism and guerrilla attacks? What are the most significant measurements?\" Distinguishing between two kinds of signs, the military and the nonmilitary, COL. GALULA listed as foremost among the military indicators (1) whether the guerrillas are developing to a higher stage of warfare Or are going back to a lower one (in Algeria, the legitimate forces knew were winging when the rebels were forced to go from large guerrilla battles to smaller engagements, and from there back to terrorism); (2) how much strength the guerrillas can muster for a single operation; (3) the chart that shows the number of weapons in the enemys hands; (4) the number of ambushes directed at convoys the rebels' prime targets once have organized the population and go after the defenders' weapons and #Present: Col.

GALULA thought; were to be sought essentially in the actions and attitudes of the civilian population The most significant of these were (a) the number of volunteers for the counterinsurgent forces, (b) the amount of information 'spontaneously offered, and (c) people's readiness to violate the guerrillas' orders (to abstain from smoking, to avoid contact with the counter- insurgents, and similar rules) COL. VALERIANO' s experience in the Philippines confirmed COL. GALULA'$ observations In that theater all field units were required t0 maintain statistics, which were useful for measuring, not only whether or not the government forces were winning, but also whether their individual tactics were effective or in need of modification (for example, they helped in comparing the virtues of small- as against large-unit operations). The most dramatic indicator of over-all success, in COL. VALERIANO' s experience, was the spontaneous response of the populace in offering information, and people's active participation in the capture or the dis- abling of guerrilla contact men who came to the villages for liaison between the inhabitants and the armed insurgents Both COL. KITSON and cOL. BOHANNAN agreed immediately that the people' S voluntary co-operation and their disregard for the guerrillas' orders were important signs of victory, and indeed perhaps the only reliable ones They had found that such other phenomena as the number of weapons in the enemys hands and the size of individual engagements often could be explained in other ways; if were, in indications of weakening enemy strength, their significance might not be immediately apparent: For example, the date COL. KITSON had mentioned as the moment when the tide turned in Kenya, and the military reasons for it, were knowledge gained only by hindsight: On the basis of the week' s discussions as well as of personal experience, several of the participants, at MR HOSMER'$ suggestion, set forth their views on the essential (military and political) elements, and the order of their importance, in any attempt to defeat a guerrilla movement: COL GALULA listed three: determination at the top level, selection of able leaders, and knowledge of how to conduct a counterguerrilla war: The primacy of {6 resolution he regarded as a matter of historical fact; one could not, fof example, imagine a guerrilla movement in Russia in the of Stalin they fact; days WINNING THE COUNTERGUERRILLA WAR 143 COL VALERIANO agreed in essence, adding that the factors mentioned by COL. GALULA must be present at every level, from government circles down to the lowest operating groups As the case of the Philippines shows, motivation and determination on the part of the population are not enough without theoutstanding leader: Until the emergence of Magsaysay, the people had a difficult time despite their unquestionable resolution The appearance of such a leader may be a matter of accident, and one of the problems, therefore, is to recognize a man'$ value and then to place him in the position in which he can do the country the most To COL KITSON, the single most important thing for the counterguerrilla side is t0 have a political (or \"civilian\") policy clearly superior to that of the insurgents, so that the people will support the government, not as a result of intimidation and terrorism, but because they are convinced that its victory would be in their interest Moreover, the military plan must fully accord with the political: policy. COL SHIRLEY' $ comment that much of the Communists' success could. be ascribed precisely to their consistency in promising the political millennium while pursuing its attainment by military means prompted BRIG. POWELL-JONES to emphasize the importance of a to counter and surpass the communist promise of the future In most cases, he said, it will not do merely to aim fof a return to the status quo. (Had that been satisfactory, there probably would not have been_ a guerrilla movement,) The postwar must be a recognizable improvement; in which the cancer in the prewar situation the cause of the insurgency_has been removed. ([ As for the element of 'resolution;' the situation today is a peculiarly compli- cated one for the Americans, with their problem of how to inject military advice and assistance into the areas they themselves are resolved must be defended. Unless the governments and people of those countries, who will have to do the actual defending, are similarly determined, may regard some of the measures advo- cated by the United States as politically unpalatable, and the American purpose may be defeated as a result Another important requirement; mentioned by COL. GALULA, is the abilicy of the counterinsurgent side to sustain a protracted war if necessary, since the guer- rillas' interest lies in maintaining a chronic state of warfare; avoiding an acute struggle until such time as they can be certain of winning it: COL FERTIG pointed to an organizational and conceptual weakness in the American military organization, in which guerrilla and counterguerrilla warfare two facets of a single problem, in his opinion are treated as distinct problems and operated by two separate sections (one under the Chief of Staff, the other top such good. goa] goal they staff 144 COUNTERINSURGENCY : A SY MPOSIUM under Military Government), instead of having the problem in its entirety brought into focus in & single department of counterinsurgency. A more realistic and effec- tive organization would provide, in the area of operations, for a task group, in which would be concentrated all the assets necessary for the military mission at hand, and which would not be encumbered with policing and similar respon- sibilities COL.

Mr. Phillips emphasized the complexities of operating in an advisory, rather than controlling, capacity, drawing on the US experience in South Vietnam. He advocated for a gradual, indirect approach, starting with pilot projects and working closely with local military commanders and leaders.  This bottom-up strategy aimed to foster local ownership of change and avoid resentment of external interference.  He stressed the importance of building relationships, allowing local leaders to drive reforms, and ultimately fostering the development of a stable political base.",

The situation improved with the combined initiative of a proactive military unit and a determined Secretary of Defense, leading to a successful pacification policy under Magsaysay.

    "text": "Insurgency, a multifaceted form of conflict, thrives on factors such as popular grievances, weak governance, and exploitable terrain.  Successful counterinsurgency requires a comprehensive approach addressing political, economic, and social dimensions alongside military operations.  Banditry, while sometimes an element of insurgency, differs in motivation and organization.  The timing and location of insurgent activities are often strategically chosen to maximize impact and exploit vulnerabilities. Individual leadership and motivational factors play crucial roles in the success or failure of insurgent movements.",
