    "text": "5GW AND THE XGW FRAMEWORK Most discussions of 5GW take place within the context of the xGW framework. This framework began as an attempt to clarify and rationalize earlier views of 5GW, specifically Lind’s (2004) idea of a yet-to-emerge generation of warfare and Hammes’s (2004) hints of a future generation in his work The Sling and the Stone. The approaches associated with Lind and Hammes include a theory of sequential emergence, as each generation of warfare is thought to emerge from previous generations of war in the same way that each human generation emerges from a previous human generation. The xGW framework rejects the theory of sequential emergence, and the Generations of Modern War (GMW) school that is associated with it. While some theorists in the xGW framework still use the term generation, the elements of the taxonomy are now generally known as gradients. The gradients of war, like gradients we see in other elements of social organization (wealth, height, skin color, and so on) flow indefinitely into each other, and their emergence pre-dates written history. The first 0GW occurred thousands of years ago. According to the xGW framework, the first 5GW was fought and lost before the dawn of time.",

    "text": "THE XGW FRAMEWORK (DANIEL H. ABBOTT) An earlier version of this chapter appeared as “Chapter 2. The Generations of Modern War,” in Revolutionary Strategies in Early Christianity(Abbott 2008). According to the xGW framework, warfare exists along a gradient of violence, which is more focused on one end and more diffused on another. Militant forces that better focus their violence can overcome less-focused militant forces many times their size. At the fifth gradient of warfare (5GW), violence is so diffuse that only a single murder or outrage may separate it from politics. The Zeroth Gradient of War, or 0GW At the zeroth gradient of warfare (0GW), war is a genocide and a holocaust. In 0GW, the entire able population fights. As such, there is no difference between civilians and soldiers. Likewise, as there is no distinct army to destroy, 0GWs are genocidal. Ant colonies regularly engage in 0GWs. The Holocaust is another example. Because 0GWs are total wars, counterinsurgency (COIN) in 0GW typically involves ethnic cleansing in kind. Thus, the Great Sioux Uprising that temporarily removed all whites from what is now South Dakota, for instance, was rapidly followed by the removal of most Sioux Indians onto reservations. The First Gradient of War, or 1GW 1GW is characterized",

    "text": "Chimpanzees are capable of 1GW, with rival troops forming insertion teams, engaging in pitch battles, and other civilized behaviors. Many European conflicts around the time of Napoleon were also 1GWs. The Second Gradient of War, or 2GW: The concentration of firepower describes 2GW. If the majority of fighters are armed only with spears and swords (as in medieval Europe), or powerful forearms (as with chimps), 2GW is impossible. However, from bands of archers to the powerful artillery guns of the First World War, 2GW allows victory through producing deadly goods and aiming them at the same place at the same time. More of the fighting society is now involved in essentially economic or technical roles, taking men away from the front lines while keeping them in the fight. The Third Gradient of War, or 3GW: While 0GW relies on wiping out the enemy, 1GW on defeating him with larger numbers, and 2GW on defeating him with better machines, victory in 3GW comes from better minds. The most famous 3GW was the German Blitzkrieg against France in 1940. Contrary to myth, the French had better fortifications, better equipment, and even better tanks. However, the Germans had a better trained officer corps that knew how to create uncertainty by maneuvering inside and out of the French lines, preventing any meaningful counterattack and paralyzing the French. The “Shock and Awe” defeat of Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 2003 relied heavily on 3GW, as did the 100-hour campaign during the first Gulf War. The Fourth Gradient of War, or 4GW: 4GW is more complex and subtle yet. As in 0GW, the boundary between war and peace breaks down, but the reason is different: while in 0GW peace is so violent that the bureaucrat becomes a killer, in 4GW war is so peaceful that the warfighter becomes a criminal. The wars America has lost, including Vietnam, Lebanon, and Somalia, have all been 4GWs (Hammes 2004). Defeat in Vietnam so broke America's will to fight that America's institutional knowledge of occupation warfare was eliminated, and would not be restored until years into the Iraq War. COIN in 4GW often involves either degrading the opponent into an earlier generation of warfare that can be defeated conventionally, or else providing incentives for some part of the 4GW force to turn on their comrades. Proponents of 4GW, such as Paul of Tarsus in the Christian revolt against the Senate and People of Rome (Abbott, Revolutionary Strategies in Early Christianity 2008) and the Chinese Communists in their wars against Japan and the KMT (Mao 1961), accept a more violent path to power than in 5GW as the cost of not being able to blind the enemy to the existence of a war. The Fifth Gradient of War, or 5GW: In 5GW, violence is so dispersed that the losing side may never realize that it has been conquered. The very secrecy of 5GW makes it the hardest generation of war to study. Because 5GW attacks occur below the threshold of observation, COIN in 5GW is the preemptive, system-wide, automatic degeneration of 5GW forces into more primitive gradients of warfare. The 5GW warfighter hides in the static, and the most successful 5GWs are those that are never identified.",

    "section": "Battling for Perception",
    "text": "BATTLING FOR PERCEPTION: INTO THE 5TH GENERATION? (SHANE DEICHMAN) What is the role of perception in modern conflict and how has the evolution of technology changed its importance? In 1989, Bill Lind et al. published a seminal article in the Marine Corps Gazette entitled “The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation” (Lind, Nightengale, et al. 1989). The article identified “three distinct generations” in “the development of warfare in the modern era,” sounding a clarion cry to alert us to the emergence of a “4th Generation.” Specifically, Lind et al. warned of widely dispersed and undefined conflict without a clear distinction between “civilian” and “military.” Lind’s “Generations of Modern War” (GMW) model has elicited a number of follow-on theories and revisions. In many revisions, an additional level focusing on information and perception —“5th Generation War”—is introduced. Adam Herring (Searching for 5GW 2009) includes taxonomies of both the Generations of Modern Warfare and xGW frameworks in his chapter in this volume. In a similar vein, I define the generations of warfare, or what others describe as gradients, as follows: 1GW: Marked by regimental structure and strict discipline. Noted historians Keegan and van Crevald have attributed this to the advent of firearms, which create a need for more rigorous safety mechanisms. 2GW: In response to 1GW rank-and-file formations, fires (i.e., explosive and kinetic energy delivered by a variety of means, such as artillery) are massed to shatter their cohesion. 3GW: Massed fires are countered by maneuverability. 4GW: Maneuver forces are proved inadequate in the face of an asymmetric adversary who exploits the full breadth of the maneuver space (not only military but also civil) by denying sanctuary to 3GW units. 5GW: Moral and cultural warfare is fought through manipulating perceptions and altering the context by which the world is perceived. Rather than defend the Generations of Modern Warfare framework, or attempt to discriminate between 4GW (culture-based asymmetrical warfare focused on the “rage of the people”) and 5GW (perception-based warfare focused on the context of conflict), I will instead use this model to illustrate the importance of command, information and human cognition in the conduct—and resolution—of conflict.",

    "section": "Foundation, Context, and Command",
    "text": "Foundation The foundational theories of modern war are described in Carl von Clausewitz’s magnum opus, On War. In addition to defining the nature of war (a “duel on a larger scale”) and its purpose (“a continuation of politics by other means”), Clausewitz also provided the three core elements of any campaign: · Rationality (of the state) · Probability (in military command) · Rage (of the population). Much of the “Cold War” ethos of warfighting was vested in the first premise: the rationality of the state (q.v., “Mutually Assured Destruction” doctrine in nuclear warfare). Similarly, insurgencies like the U.S. faced in Vietnam forty years ago—and in Iraq today—are driven by the third premise: the rage of the people. Mark Safranski (2009) provides us with an excellent analysis of several case studies on the impact such insurgencies have had on regimes of paranoid character in his essay “5GW: Into the Heart of Darkness,” which appears later in this volume. Could 5th Generation Warfare (where perception and context are key) be described as a fusion of popular rage with political rationality, where the very idea of “conflict” is altered in order to create conditions favorable to the 5th Generation warrior? Such a feat would logically factor the second premise (the probabilistic calculus of the military commander) out of the equation—or at least reduce its relevance in the larger battle of ideas. Context In the first chapter, “Muhammad the Enemy,” of a biography of the Prophet, Muhammad, Karen Armstrong (1993) describes the 9th century CE monk Perfectus of Cordova, in Andalusia (formerly the capital of the Muslim state of al-Andalus). Perfectus’s diatribe against the Prophet of Islam warranted a death sentence, and inspired dozens of others from all levels of society to similarly insult Muhammad—and receive similar fates from the Qadi. Perfectus, his contemporaries Eulogio and Alvaro, and the many other “Cordovan martyrs” were influenced by an apocalyptic biography of Muhammad that (with extensive artistic liberties) linked the Prophet of Islam to the “Great Deceiver” predicted in the Apostle Paul’s second epistle to the Thessalonians. The association of Muhammad with the “rebel [who] would establish his rule in the Temple of Jerusalem and mislead many Christians with his plausible doctrines,”1 and with John’s Book of Revelation through “selective addition” (claiming Muhammad died in the year 666 CE—even though he lived another 38 years), were what we may call a “5th generation war”: a secret war that exploited cultural icons in order to diminish and defeat an opponent. My personal epiphany while reading Armstrong is that none of the “generational” models is necessarily exclusive—nor, for that matter, are they strategic. Rather, they are simply tactical methods that one may choose to apply in the achievement of an objective or the fulfillment of a task. Whether a commander chooses to align his forces in columns (a staple of “close order drill,” one of the most basic elements of modern-day “Basic Training” in the armed services), or to mass fires, or to exploit maneuver, or to focus on “creating political support among the population” as General Petraeus has done with “the Surge” in Iraq, the fact of the matter is that ALL of these are valid tactics at some point. In fact, I submit that the methods are force structure neutral in many respects. Whether a given force is comprised of professional soldiers, ragtag irregulars or an enraged mob, each has the capacity to apply destructive force (though obviously some force structures are optimized for certain methods).The crux of the matter is that warfare is no longer the sole purview of the nation-state. The proliferation of information technologies and ready access to design “best practices” is collapsing the barriers to entry in the bazaar of violence, as author and blogger John Robb has been telling us for some time.2 Even seemingly advanced weapon systems like cruise missiles (the “rich man’s IED”) will soon become accessible to self-subsidized organizations with Do-It-Yourself ingenuity, GPS-enabled cell phones and a modicum of propellant and guidance. And we have all seen the power of networks for manipulating and influencing perceptions. While the nation-state is optimized for the first of the late Col. John Boyd’s three “Categories of Conflict” (Attrition, Maneuver and Moral),3 the latter two have very low barriers to entry and are readily accessible for nearly any size of organization. On Command Command and Control (C2) theory is very well developed for 1GW, 2GW and 3GW campaigns. Joint Publication (JP) 6-0: Joint Communications Systems lays a solid foundation for communications between different elements of a joint force, and each uniformed service has well-developed doctrine with respect to C2. In 4GW contests, C2 becomes more problematic. Lines of authority are often blurred, and effective 4th-generation warriors rely on mission-type orders (Auftragstaktik) and operational empowerment seldom seen in more strictly regimented militaries. Similarly, 4GW’s reliance on “Mass”—one of the nine principles of war in conventional military thought—is also dramatically different, allowing them to exploit a very small signal-to-noise ratio through dispersion in the general populace and leveraging commercial communications (mobile phones, IM, Internet) to convey “intent” or “objectives.” In addition to 4GW being primarily a moral conflict, there is something else—something deeper that can be manipulated, influenced and exploited to achieve desired objectives. The morality of a 4GW campaign is not the most fundamental force that drives people and shapes their support for, or opposition to, or acquiescence to, a campaign. That distinction belongs to the context by which we perceive the world. By altering how the world is perceived, one can achieve what Sun Tzu called the “acme of skill”: victory without fighting. This raises some interesting questions. For instance, does a 5GW force require cohesion and unity of effort? (I have argued in the past that it does not—rather, that a 5GW force becomes increasingly effective the more disparate its efforts become.) But what does this do to the notion of “command”? There’s a stream of American thought that loves hierarchies—rigid, singular command structures with no doubt as to who is “in charge.” But is such a command structure valid for a 5GW campaign? Or could a 5GW opponent be “commanded” simply through the naturally emergent behavior of complex systems? Is “self- synchronization” valid as a method of C2 for a 5GW campaign? And is the notion of a “campaign” even relevant in this context? Or is our lexicon lacking in describing emergent methods of influencing thought—and, by extension, limiting our actions to those that a faceless adversary allows?",

The technology only provides a medium by which information can be shared, the same way that Roman signal towers allowed information to be conveyed rapidly across great distances millennia ago. Our modern technology, though impressive, has not ushered in a unique “Information Age.” In fact, today’s technologies have not created wholly new capabilities; they have simply enriched capabilities that have existed for centuries. Rather than living in “The Information Age,” I believe we are actually living in the fifth “information age”: 1st: Verbal exchange of information (oral communication) 2nd: Physical representation of information (Sumerian writing) 3rd: Portability of information and popular literacy (papyrus; fourth century BCE Greece) 4th: Mass-production of information (Gutenberg’s movable type press) 5th: Information freed from constraints of physical space (telegraph, Internet) A significant effect of proliferating information technology and communications capabilities has been to neuter the initiative and empowerment of subordinates—stunting the audacity that makes (or breaks) battles.

    "text": "important applications, rigid hierarchies coupled with pervasive communications grids—with “Net- Centricity”—are demonstrably less effective than ones with “weak” links(Barabási 2002). Consider the “Operational Level of War”—the level between “Tactics” and “Strategy,” known as “Grand Tactics” during the nineteenth century. Many organizations of the US Department of Defense invest inordinate numbers of labor hours in developing an idea that peaked in Napoleon’s time, but is not as relevant today. Napoleon’s logic was simple: he commanded an army so vast that its interior lines could exceed the distance of daily information propagation. (Information in the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century could propagate at approximately 100 miles per day.) But while technology increased the bandwidth of information transfer (as well as the speed, thanks to decoupling it from physical form and allowing velocity = c), the intermediate layer that once served as a proxy for the Imperial edict (i.e., empowerment of the on-scene commander to act on behalf of the Emperor) has remain entrenched. Modern C4ISR tools have served to perpetuate this folly, giving today’s commanders a beguiling sense of “Situational Awareness.” MIL STD 2525: Common Warfighting Symbology, the military standard for unit icons and symbols, merged with theater-scale maps can give a commander a “real-time snapshot” of the entire physical battlespace. As the scale increases (since warfare is not scale invariant4), though, the trade-off between “relevance” and “intelligibility” becomes akin to Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle: as one becomes more precise, the other becomes dangerously less so. Later in this book, Stephen Pampinella (2009) provides a lucid analysis of identity construction and misperception as insurgent goals. “Quo Vadis” The temptation to treat warfare like a game of chess (with its ordinal moves and perfect battlefield intelligence) is fallacious. Clausewitz’s description of “Genius” in battle is the antithesis of a reductionist thinker who seeks the unique solution to a given problem. Complex adaptive environments can have multiple solutions—but an even larger number of incorrect options.5 If Clausewitz was correct that war is a “duel on a larger scale,” then it would follow that the intent is to use the threat of violence to shape the will of the adversary. For the unified, loyalist state, only the leader need be influenced. But in more diffuse command structures, this influence must be far more widespread. This is the challenge of our day: how do we influence a large, disparate population distributed across multiple states? It is clear that the ubiquity of information access, coupled with the increased prosperity of individuals across all socioeconomic strata, creates a value structure incompatible with a rigid hierarchy. Therefore, perhaps a better description of an effective leader is not simply “charisma,” but “network fitness”: per Barabási, the ability to “attract” links in order to influence their perceptions. A message not heard is akin to the tree that falls in the forest with nobody around: though it may create spherically propagating pressure fluctuations in the surrounding air, it does not make a “sound.” And a leader who cannot attract followers is destined to fail. Barabási’s description of analysis by Ginestra Bianconi shows that network fitness models do not correlate well to power law (i.e., scale invariant) models. Rather, they are more similar to the properties of Bose-Einstein condensates (where all “nodes” collapse into one shared state—a “winner-take-all” model). The end result is the “fittest” node grabs all the links, shaping the network into a star topology. This applies not only to quantum fluids, but also to counterinsurgencies (COIN), Information Warfare, Public Diplomacy and the fermenting clash of civilizations between a globalized free- market economy and a nomadic, tribally organized world. Chad Kohalyk (2009) delves deeper into the applicability of social networks in another chapter of this book. Conclusion Technology has significantly enhanced our awareness of the world, both as individuals and collectively as an interconnected, globalized society. It has also made the tools of violence far more accessible to organizations with limited means. “War” is no longer the sole purview of the nation-state. The convergence of ubiquitous networks with pervasive sensors can elicit tectonic shifts in geopolitics. While Lind et al. (1989) underscored the expansion of the battlespace beyond professional militaries serving a rational state, the nature of perception in conflict deserves our attention. The ability to shape the perception—and therefore the opinions—of a target audience is far more important than the ability to deliver kinetic energy, and will determine the ultimate victor in tomorrow’s wars.",

    "text": "THE END OF THE RAINBOW: IMPLICATIONS OF 5GW FOR A GENERAL THEORY OF WAR (L. C. REES) For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. (Ephesians 6:12) Three implications of 5GW are particularly significant for a general theory of war: · War is more than the threat and use of violence. · The major features of the power used to wage war are energy and visibility. · War is a spectrum of power that falls between an absolute concentration of power at one extreme and an absolute absence of power at the other extreme. 5GW is the deliberate manipulation of an observer's context in order to achieve a desired outcome (Herring 2009). This implies that war is more than the threat and use of violence. While, to paraphrase LTG James Mattis, it is true that sometimes the best way to manipulate the context of the enemy commander is to put a bullet in it, violence is not the only way to manipulate context. Other tools are available. Yet violence is war's most obvious feature. Indeed, the simplest definition of war is that war is violence. If pressed for more detail, we might expand this definition a bit: War is nothing but a duel on a large scale. Countless duels go to make up war, but a picture of the whole can be formed by imagining a pair of wrestlers. Each tries through physical force to compel the other to do his will; his immediate aim is to throw his opponent in order to make him incapable of further resistance. War is thus an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will. (Clausewitz 1989) While this definition covers some forms of war, it misses other, more subtle forms of war. A more expansive definition of war is needed, a definition that emphasizes the second part of Clausewitz's formulation, “compelling the enemy to do our will” (the goal of war) more than the first part, the “act of force” (the means of war). The goal of war is essential in defining the nature of war. The means of war are not. Making the enemy do our will is essential to war. An act of force is not. 5GW is the manipulation of observational context in order to make the enemy do our will. Since an act of force is not required to manipulate observational context, force is not required to wage 5GW. Since 5GW is undoubtedly war, war must be more than a mere act of force. However, making the enemy do our will remains an essential part of 5GW and, by extension, war. Since “our will” is critical to defining what war is, we have to include the critical dimension of politics since it is through politics that we arrive at “our will.” Clausewitz observes: When whole communities go to war—whole peoples, and especially civilized peoples—the reason always lies in some political situation, and the occasion is always due to some political object. Politics, however, cannot be divorced from the dimension of culture. The nature of politics is heavily shaped by the nature of the culture that employs it: the strengths and flaws of culture become the strengths and flaws of politics. Culture is the realm where information about the world is structured, where, as Adam Eklus has remarked, “the values, norms, and goals of organizations, societies, and nations are defined.” It is also where the desires of a human community, its values, norms, and goals, are prioritized. Most of this process is completely unconscious: culture is the art of the unspoken assumption. However, unconsciousness is a feature, not a bug. Once desire is entrenched in unconsciousness, it's difficult to dislodge. The height of cultural achievement is embedding a desire so deeply in the human mind that the conscious mind is completely unaware of either its presence or its potency. Desires that attain maximum priority will achieve maximum unconsciousness. Only then will they be safe from the whims of fickle fashion. All that a desire needs to achieve priority is power, and to achieve that power, desire needs politics. Politics is the division of power between cultural desires. The amount of power available at any one time is finite. There will never be enough power to give every cultural desire the priority it is clamoring for. What power there is, therefore, must be divided between a clamoring multitude of cultural desires. The process of dividing power is both an internal and an external process. Externally, power is divided between the competing cultural desires of different political communities. Internally, power is divided between the competing cultural desires within a political community. Once a desire becomes associated with a particular division of power, it becomes a political desire. The division of power within a political community heavily shapes the division of power between political communities. The division of power between political communities in turn heavily influences the division of power within a political community. Due to the finite nature of power, the process of political division will usually degenerate into a struggle for power. To prevail in this virtuous political cycle, each side must employ strategy. Strategy is the reconciliation of the quantity and quality of cultural desire with the quality and quantity of the power available to achieve that cultural desire. While politics is the instrument of culture, strategy is the instrument of politics: its nature is a direct reflection of the politics that employs it. Since war is a strategy, its nature is highly dependent on the politics that employs it. The nature of politics, more specifically the nature of the internal division of power and the internal struggle for power, determines the nature of war. The strengths and flaws of politics become the strength and flaws of war. Healthy politics makes healthy war. Unhealthy politics makes unhealthy war. Adding the critical dimension of politics gives us our definition of war: war is a strategy intended to make the enemy conform to our political desires when doing so is contrary to what they would do if they possessed both the power to resist us and sufficient knowledge about our true political desires. This definition of war captures several aspects of war that are not immediately obvious: · Since war, as a strategy, is an instrument of politics, the intentions of war, as strategic intentions, should remain subordinate to political intentions. · War is intended to satisfy political desires. There is no guarantee, however, that what is intended will significantly correspond to what actually happens. · The enemy may know enough about our true political intentions to want to resist our efforts to achieve them, but may be powerless to do so. On the other hand, the enemy may have the power to resist us but they may accede to our activities because they believe we're motivated by something else. If they knew enough about our true political motives, they might contest our efforts to satisfy them. War is a mixture of two forms of strategic power: violence and influence:",

    "text": "Violence is the strategic form of power used to physically deny the enemy the power to resist our efforts to satisfy our desires. Influence is the strategic form of power used to shape the enemy’s knowledge in ways that help us satisfy our desires. Influence takes many forms: diplomacy, propaganda, subversion, commerce, agitation, intelligence, education. However, the most elemental form of influence in war is deception, the strategic form of power used to distort enemy perceptions in ways that help us satisfy our desires. Since 5GW is a war of deception, it's almost entirely a war of influence. This doesn't mean 5GW is violence-free. However, most of the violence it incites will be committed by third parties whose observational context is manipulated through a war of influence. 5GW doesn't need to dirty its hands with violence. Its aspirations lie beyond violence. As T. E. Lawrence (1920) wrote: [S]uppose we were an influence...an idea, a thing invulnerable, intangible, without front or back, drifting about like a gas? Armies were like plants, immobile as a whole, firm-rooted, nourished through long stems to the head, we might be a vapour, blowing where we listed. Our kingdoms lay in each man’s mind, as we wanted nothing material to live on, so perhaps we offered nothing material to the killing. It seemed a regular soldier might be helpless without a target. He would own the ground he sat on, and what he could poke his rifle at. If influence and violence are in harmony, they reinforce each other and make the war effort stronger. If influence and violence are in disarray, the war effort will become weak and ineffective. The nature of the politics that blends violence and influence determines how harmonious or how conflicted the mixture will be. The second implication of 5GW, that the major features of the power used to wage war are energy and visibility, will shape what portion of influence and what portion of violence get mixed in to a war. Energy is how much power it takes to make the enemy conform to our political desires while visibility is how easy it is for the enemy to gather knowledge we don't want them to have. There's a trade-off between visibility and energy. The more energy that's concentrated into a form of strategic power, the more visible it is. The smaller the amount of energy that's concentrated into a form of strategic power, the less visible a form of strategic power is. Influence has low visibility and low energy while violence has high visibility and high energy. It’s hard to hide the energy of an atom bomb and it's hard to light a city with invisible ink. To become “an influence...an idea, a thing invulnerable, intangible, without front or back, drifting about like a gas,” 5GW must become a",

    "text": "True war of influence...must influence others to expend energy on its behalf rather than expending energy itself. Any visibility caused by energy expenditure is death to its political desires. To wage a 5GW campaign, 5GW politics must have low energy and low visibility. It must become invisible politics. Only then will 5GW become a war of influence instead of a feeble war of violence. High energy and high visibility 5GW is not 5GW. The possibility that 5GW could degenerate into other forms of war characterized by greater visibility and greater energy leads us to the third implication of 5GW: war is a spectrum of power that falls between an absolute concentration of power at one extreme and an absolute absence of power at the other extreme.\n\nClausewitz provides many examples of the spectrum of war. ... Following Clausewitz's own logic, we must look beyond his narrower spectrum of war to discover all of the ways that politics can wage war. What separates one form of war from another on Clausewitz's spectrum is energy: for example, a war of annihilation involves more energy than simple armed observation. However, as 5GW implies, energy is only one feature of the power used to wage war. For a spectrum of war that includes both energy and visibility, we need to turn to the Indian strategist Kautilya. His spectrum of war has three wavelengths: · Open war: ... · Secret war: ... · Silent war: ... Though Clausewitz described elements of secret war, he mostly dealt with open war. This means that he mostly dealt with energy and violence. However, Kautilya's two other forms of war can only be understood if the spectrum of war covers energy and visibility, violence and influence. This is particularly true of silent war, the form of Kautilyan war closest to 5GW. ... Contemporary war is shifting from the more violent, energetic, and visible end of Kautilya's spectrum (open war) to the less violent, less energetic, and invisible end (silent war). Existing general theories of war must adapt to this shift in order to remain useful.... 5GW is valuable because it forces us to pay attention to the unseen wavelengths of the spectrum of war. It forces us to see war as more than violence. It forces us to see war as a spectrum that is constantly shifting between extremes of energy and visibility. It forces us to develop a definition of war that is broader than the definitions found in most contemporary general theories of war. The problem with using a narrower definition of war is that the enemy may fight you with a form of war that you not only can’t see, but, even worse, don’t even believe in. ... In discussing silent war, the progenitor of 5GW, Kautilya includes a chapter on how to use black magic and other occult practices against the enemy. This is strangely appropriate: any sufficiently advanced 5GW is indistinguishable from magic.",

    "text": "The distributed networks of both 4GW and netwar have proven resilient to the identification of a center of gravity that may be attacked, destroying the enemy. But what if even those nebulous leader-hubs were to disappear? One idea comes from a former Grand Dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan through the article “Leaderless Resistance,” which attempted to outline a new organizational design to fight against perceived state tyranny (Beam 1992). Beam calls for the abolition of a pyramid-style organization because “nothing is more desirable” for federal agencies than opposing groups who are “unified in their command structure.” He advises using a cell structure, but to defend against attacks by the federal government the structure must be deeply decentralized with no headquarters giving command or direction. He dubbed these “phantom cells.” Arguing that “in any movement, all persons involved have the same general outlook, are acquainted with the same philosophy, and generally react to given situations in similar ways” Beam put the onus on the individual to acquire the necessary skills and intelligence to carry out missions for the “cause.” Coordinating attacks will be possible because: Organs of information distribution such as newspapers, leaflets, computers, etc., which are widely available to all, keep each person informed of events, allowing for a planned response that will take many variations. No one need issue an order to anyone. Those idealist [sic] truly committed to the cause of freedom will act when they feel the time is ripe, or will take their cue from others who precede them. Beam credits the idea of the phantom cells to one Col. Ulius Louis Amoss, who apparently first wrote of leaderless resistance in 1962, thirty years before Arquilla and Ronfeldt conceived of netwar. The type of organization described by Beam is known as an “emergent network.” Emergence is a phenomenon that is evidenced in many places, from multicellular biological organisms, to metropolitan zoning, to no-limit poker. Emergence is a dynamic process of self-organization where nodes behave individually under a set of simple rules, and yet as a whole render a complex pattern.

    "text": "values of the indigenous population. In creating new social relations that validate the discriminate use of force by 5GW counterinsurgents, counterinsurgency is thus consistent with 5GW as it instigates societal change, solves the practical problem of insurgency, and penetrates the social relations and cultural values of insurgents and indigenous peoples (Safranski 2009). Abbott provides the essential conceptual framework regarding how 5GW counterinsurgency alters the social environment in which 4GW insurgency takes place. If the strategic goal of 4GW insurgents is to demoralize counterinsurgents and mobilize the indigenous population against them, then the strategic goal of 5GW counterinsurgency is to deny the insurgency an adversary to against which to mobilize indigenous peoples. This is how 5GW attacks the intellectual strength of insurgent adversaries, by literally denying them an enemy against which to fight: “A 5GW might be fought with one side not knowing who it is fighting” (Abbott, Dreaming 5th generation war 2009). From this description, we can infer that 5GW strategies seek to problematize an insurgency’s knowledge of who it fights against and why the adversary must be resisted. In other words, Abbott writes, “[the] enemy must not feel that he is not on your side.” Strategically, 5GW must then alter how insurgents and the indigenous population perceive and anticipate the identities and intentions of counterinsurgents. Consistent with Boyd’s epistemological approach to strategy, 5GW presents new observations that falsify the cognitive and cultural “master frames” (Snow and Benford 1988) that insurgencies deploy to rationalize indigenous mobilization and popular resistance. Instead, these new observations are part of a competing counterinsurgent master frame that rationalizes counterinsurgent-indigenous cooperation and the identification of insurgents as the enemy. Therefore, if 5GW is understood as counterinsurgency, it succeeds by manipulating how insurgents and the indigenous population perceive their own identity in relation to each other as well as to counterinsurgents. The basic objectives of counterinsurgency serve to create these nonhostile perceptions between indigenous peoples and counterinsurgents. According to the recently published U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual (Nagl 2007), the objective of any population-centric counterinsurgency campaign should be the protection of the indigenous population from threats to its well-being and survival. Thus, the master frame of counterinsurgency is popular security, and “creating safe space” is the message that counterinsurgents disseminate to the people and forms the basis of friendly and cooperative identities (Weeks, Kilcullen narratives on Iraq 2009). A popular security frame also falsifies the insurgent master frame of injustice and counterinsurgent oppression, and serves to empower indigenous peoples in relation to the insurgents embedded within them. There is, however, a paradoxical element to this form of 5GW and its relation to Barnett’s understanding of the role of the System Adminstrator in contemporary warfare. According to Weeks (On the Barnettian 5GW 2009), the provision of security by counterinsurgent forces can potentially dispower an indigenous population by creating relationships of dependence. Thus, counterinsurgency (and 5GW) can only be successful when indigenous populations are empowered to take security into their own hands, yet in conjunction with the temporary provision of security by counterinsurgents. One example of failing to resolve this paradox is the international community’s long-running supervision of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a technically sovereign state ruled as a protectorate of the United Nations that lacks any institutional (and security) capacity of its own. This example of the modern European Raj (Knaus and Martin 2003) suggests that 5GW actors must resist the neocolonial temptation to solve all indigenous political problems directly and without participation by the local population. Thus, empowerment through 5GW requires mutual negotiation of how counterinsurgents provide security to the people. In turn, indigenous peoples come to learn how to secure themselves from threatening insurgents, permitting 5GW counterinsurgents to leave the conflict.",

    "text": "Identity and Social Constructivism To illustrate how 5GW manipulates perceptions of identity and empowers indigenous peoples, I now turn to the International Relations paradigm of social constructivism. War and peace have always been central topics to the IR subfield of international security, with international war given greater attention than intrastate war. To keep IR relevant, scholars should seek to apply IR theories to the problem of intrastate war, insurgency, and counterinsurgency. This section fulfills this goal by showing how social constructivism provides the conceptual mechanics whereby identity can be actively manipulated. Anglo-American International Relations (IR) has been traditionally defined by the First Debate between classical realists and liberals and reconfigured into general social science theories known as neorealism and neoliberalism. Neorealism assumes that the anarchical structure of the international system makes cooperation difficult (Waltz 1979) and war likely, while neoliberalism proposes that cooperation is possible despite anarchy (Keohane 1984). Despite these differences, both neorealism and neoliberalism share the assumption that states are rational egoists whose self-interest is derived internally, and that culture only influences how interests are fulfilled. In contrast, constructivist theorists such as (Wendt 1999)Wendt (1999) place culture at the center of analysis, and argue that self-interest is externally derived through one’s social experiences, memories, and definition of one’s identity (pp. 174-75). These aspects of identity are intimately bound up with the cultural norms and values a state learns through experiences developed during social interaction. This social process of identity formation is based on the theory of symbolic interactionism, originally developed by seventy-five years ago (Mead 1934). Symbolic interactionism assumes identity formation is based on the principle of reflected appraisals: “actors come to see themselves as a reflection of how they think Others see or ‘appraise’ them, in the ‘mirror’ of Others’ representations of Self” (Wendt 1999, 327). An actor’s identity, or sense of Self, is thus produced by interaction with Other actors who then altercast Self with a particular identity. For Self, being altercasted with a particular identity implies it should adhere to specific roles in social interaction consistent with the identity imposed by Others. In this way, culture is a self-fulfilling prophecy that tells actors how to interact with Others based on their expectations of Self’s behavior (Wendt 1999, 184- 188). This implies that identity is not fixed based on the internal characteristics of any particular actor, but instead is dependent upon that actor’s social relations and the norms and values exchanged through social interaction. As social relations change and actors are exposed to new norms and values, we can expect an actor’s identity to change as well. And, since “self” interest cannot be formulated without reference to an actor’s identity, we can expect interests to be updated and dependent upon that actor’s socially derived identity. This should not imply that changing one’s identity is easy, or that hostile perceptions of identity can be easily converted to friendly ones. Consider an actor that expects hostility from those surrounding it, thereby “altercasting” Others with a hostile identity. This constitutes Self with a hostile identity in relation to the anticipated hostility of Others, and rationalizes an interest revising the existence of those actors (often violently) as a means of guaranteeing one’s survival. Once these beliefs are acted upon, hostility becomes actually instantiated in actors’ social relations, regardless of whether or not hostility initially existed in the minds of both actors (Wendt 1999, 273). Of course, self-fulfilling prophecies can be broken, particularly if one actor deliberately altercasts Others with nonhostile role identities. This would imply an expectation of cooperation with Others and indicate to those Others no interest in revisionism on the part of Self. In this way, Self demonstrates restraint and respect for the autonomy of potentially hostile Others and communicates expectations of self restraint to those same Others. Wendt considers self-restraint the “permissive variable” in the development of a shared identity between two actors, as it allows them to develop closer forms of interaction, which leads to interdependent social relations. As these two self-restraining actors are treated similarly by third parties, they come to develop a common fate in relation to the outside world. Finally, as these actors realize they perform similar social functions and have similar social practices, they perceive each other to be homogenous. In this way, when self-restraint permits the emergence of interdependence, common fate, and homogenization, a shared identity emerges between actors that constitutes them with similar, cooperative, and nonconflictual interests (Wendt, 1999, Chap. 7). Thus, if social actors can overcome the initial temptation to perceive hostility, demonstrate self-restraint, and altercast Others as friends, those Others will learn to adopt self-restraint and friendly role-identities in future instances of social interaction.",

    "text": "Although Wendt adopts symbolic interactionism to explain cultural change in the international system of states, we can take the same process of identity formation and apply it to 5GW. As a form of warfare that prevents potential adversaries from identifying a 5GW actor as a enemy, symbolic interactionism suggests that success in 5GW requires 1) taking on friendly role-identities and practicing self- restraint, and 2) altercasting potentially hostile Others with friendly role-identities and cooperative interests. In Boydian terms, this involves presenting potential adversaries with new observations that falsify hostile orientations and socialize those actors into developing more cooperative orientations. This strategy does imply a degree of risk on the part of the 5GW actor, as its adoption of self-restraint may ignore real hostility on the part of Others. However, if those hostile actors continually observe self-restraint, are repeatedly altercasted with friendly role-identities, and experience no threat or revision to their existence, symbolic interactionism tells us they will eventually learn to abandon hostility and be socialized into a shared identity with the 5GW actor. If so, then the Barnettian interpretation of 5GW is based upon the principles of social constructivism. By presenting a new reality to potential adversaries, 5GW actors reconstruct social relations to ensure that all relevant individuals cooperate with their policy objective. One question repeatedly raised by critiques of this interpretation asks if such strategies should even be considered war. Because violence is not directly employed to change or alter an adversary’s political goal, perhaps 5GW is simply another form of politics. To rebut this argument, below I present idealized models of successful insurgent (4GW) and counterinsurgent (5GW) strategies supported by examples from the ongoing Iraq war and illustrate the centrality of identity manipulation in determining the outcome of insurgencies and counterinsurgencies. Misperception and Demoralization as Insurgent Goals As stated above, the ultimate aim of 4GW is the demoralization of a stronger state adversary and the erosion of its moral will to continue its policy goals. To achieve demoralization, 4GW insurgents selectively use violence not to defeat state forces in pitched battles, but instead to prevent such forces from identifying insurgents and separating them from the population. In doing so, 4GW insurgents seek to provoke indiscriminate state repression that aids in the mobilization of the indigenous population. The Sunni insurgency based in Iraq’s al-Anbar Province provides a contemporary example of 4GW insurgent strategy. Following the downfall of Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime in March 2003, American military forces occupied Iraq and took up positions in major towns and cities. In Fallujah, a conservative city in the heart of al- Anbar, American forces set up a base in a local school, prompting protests from aggrieved civilians. At one such protest on April 28, American forces reported insurgents firing small arms from within a crowd of mostly unarmed civilians. In response, American forces fired back and killed several Iraqis (Hashim 2006, 23). In another example during late April, an American convoy confronted with protesters on Highway 10 fired into another crowd of Iraqis protesting their presence (Ricks 2006, 140). Because American forces were only trained in conventional warfare and had no experience operating amidst a potentially hostile indigenous population, troops often employed repressive violence due to the uncertainty presented by their surrounding social environment. The events of April 28-30 would serve to be the spark of the Sunni insurgency, and American forces regularly came under attack in following months. In response, American forces sought to capture or kill insurgents by surrounding suspected villages, forcefully searching indigenous homes, and occasionally detaining the family members of suspected insurgents. These “cordon-and-sweep” tactics and the lack of self-restraint by American forces only served to create greater hostility between indigenous Iraqis and American soldiers (Ricks 2006, 241-251). American security practices— breaking down doors, searching rooms occupied by women, and roughly handling male heads of households in front of family members-–confirmed Iraqis’ worst suspicions of Americans. Because Iraqi cultural norms stress the maintenance of one’s honor and the importance of revenge to redress grievances related to public humiliation, these repressive security practices accelerated insurgent mobilization. The demoralizing effects of the Sunni insurgency were felt both among American forces in Iraq and in the United States. Fighting an enemy that never presented itself to American forces caused psychological strain among many soldiers and contributed to instances of abuse and intimidation of the indigenous population (Ricks 2006, 272-276). Tactically and strategically, this led to a greater emphasis on force protection among American forces. Since they could not identify and isolate insurgents from the indigenous population, US troops pulled back to large forward-operating bases outside of major population centers. This was also supported by the belief that the indigenous population had a fundamental hatred of the American military, whose social presence created a perception of occupation. This belief was accepted by many American commanders including Gen. John Abizaid of Central Command (West 2008). As the insurgency dragged on, many felt that there was no way that American forces could ever defeat the insurgency, despite adjustments in tactics and strategy. In the United States, the loss of faith in the war effort was evident as support for the Iraq War steadily declined and contributed to the Republican Party’s defeat in the",

    "text": "Into 2006, American forces in al-Anbar began to experiment with a population-centric counterinsurgency strategy that capitalized on the excesses of insurgent control over the indigenous population. The most violent insurgent groups, like Al Qaeda in Iraq, often used fear and intimidation to coerce local Sunnis to submit to their strict religious rule. This included repressive actions such as extortion, infringement on traditional Sunni smuggling routes, and attempts to “marry into” the Sunni tribal hierarchy. Although some Sunni tribes attempted to resist Al Qaeda, they were ultimately outnumbered and defeated as Al Qaeda mobilized allied tribes against these dissidents. Because Al Qaeda created insecurity for local Iraqis, American forces were presented with a strategic opportunity to turn the tribes of Anbar against it.\nBeginning in 2005 and into 2006, along the towns and cities of the Euphrates River, United States Marines embedded themselves along with Iraqi security forces in major population centers. Compared with the previous force protection strategy that sought separation between soldiers and the indigenous population, the new population-centric strategy was certainly more risky, as it required greater interaction with a potentially hostile population while employing self-restraint unless the insurgent threat could be positively identified. This new set of security practices involved hunting down insurgents, yet in a culturally appropriate way. For example, American forces refrained from peering inside houses and conducted searches only with partnered Iraqi forces. Arrests were rarely made in front of relatives, as a means of preserving the dignity and honor of male family members. Mounted American patrols shared roadways with Iraqi drivers instead of demanding right of way. These security-providing practices demonstrated American recognition of Iraqi norms and values, and served to contradict assumptions of hostility held by ordinary Iraqis.\nBy summer 2006, a population-centric counterinsurgency strategy was applied to the provincial capital and insurgent stronghold of Ramadi, where American forces had only controlled the Government Center that came under daily fire. The First Brigade of the US Army’s First Armored Division spread out across the city and performed daily patrols, actively conveying to the population an interest in their protection and security. Over time, this led to interdependence: while residents of Ramadi depended on American forces security, those same American forces depended on local residents for intelligence about the identity and location of the insurgents. As American forces came under insurgent attack and residents endured Al Qaeda’s repressive intimidation, both groups experienced a common fate and perceived a common threat from the most extreme insurgents. Finally, as both Americans and Iraqis came to fight side-by-side against Al Qaeda, they began to perceive themselves as being functionally similar, or homogenous. These events set the stage for the birth of the Awakening, or Sahwa, in September 2006. Under the leadership of Sheik Abdul Sattar Buzaigh al-Rishawi, the Awakening sought to rally the Sunni tribes of Anbar against Al Qaeda in cooperation with American forces, who paid each Awakening volunteer (sponsored by tribal leaders) approximately $300 for manning checkpoints and participating in the provision of security. The US-Awakening alliance would prove itself at the battle of Sufia, where American and Sunni tribal forces drove out Al Qaeda after it attacked the Albu Soda tribe. Once the tribes observed that American forces could be reliable partners in creating security, they joined the Awakening en masse and in defiance of Al Qaeda’s intimidation. By the end of the year, Al Qaeda was in decline and losing its hold in Anbar.",

    "section": "Reconsidering Counterinsurgency as 5GW and Conclusion",
    "text": "In the above analysis, I have argued that the strategic presentation of identity is fully consistent with insurgency and counterinsurgency, and 5GW succeeds when former enemies engage in friendly and cooperative social relations. However, one can critique this interpretation based on its apparent duplicity: if identity manipulation is inherent in both insurgency and counterinsurgency, then how different is this understanding of counterinsurgency and 5GW different from insurgency and 4GW? After all, Mao Zedong sought to co-opt the Chinese peasant in his insurgent war against the Kuomintang. Rather than an example of the emergence of 5GW, the development of population-centric counterinsurgency represents the adoption of 4GW by a regular state military force and the defeat of Al Qaeda should be explained by its inability to provide popular security on the indigenous population’s own terms. This critique does have substantial merit, and it suggests every insurgency or counterinsurgency strategy has elements of its counterpart that must be fulfilled to achieve victory. However, these similarities are limited by the objectives of insurgents and counterinsurgents when employing violence. For 4GW insurgents, violence is meant to frustrate, demoralize, and provoke a disproportionate violent response that leads to the escalation of conflict. As long as it continues, the insurgency can present itself as an unstoppable movement that can only be defeated by using genocidal levels of violence. However, for 5GW counterinsurgents, violence is used only in minimal levels as a means to create security for both the indigenous population and the counterinsurgent. Instead of demoralization, co-opting former enemies is intended to empower newly found allies and aid them in the provision of their own security, on their own culturally defined terms. These different objectives— demoralization and empowerment—provide a reliable theoretical foundation upon which we can separate counterinsurgency as a variant of 4GW and understand it as 5GW.\nThis essay has attempted to frame the evolution of 5GW in the context of International Relations Theory. If 5GW necessitates identity manipulation and co-opting one’s enemies, then social constructivism suggests the necessity of breaking self-fulfilling prophecies and mechanisms that contribute to the formation of a shared identity. The first mechanism, self-restraint, is entirely congruent with modern counterinsurgency doctrine’s emphasis on providing popular security. The history of the Iraq war in al-Anbar testifies to how identity manipulation is of central importance to the opposing objectives of demoralization and empowerment. The history of the Iraq War is not yet complete, and further research is needed given the recent arrest of Awakening leaders in Baghdad and accusations of American betrayal. However, the development of counterinsurgency by the American military, once confronted with 4GW insurgency, suggests the arrival of 5GW and another turn in the long history of organized warfare.",

[...] This generational evolution in the era of industrialized state-on-state warfare embodies the increasing dispersion of the battlefield, the increasing agility and speed of maneuver elements, and the increasing focus on the morale of the enemy as the opponent’s center of gravity.  This, however, is only the smallest part of the article. The main thrust of “The Changing Face of War” was the attempt to describe the decentralized and amorphous guerilla warfare and insurgencies of what Lind and his coauthors call “fourth generation warfare” (4GW), which signals the end of the modern era of state-on-state warfare and the rise of warfare against the state by non-state actors.  In the nonlinear fourth generation, the difference between war and peace becomes increasingly blurred. In “The Changing Face of War,” 4GW is seen to take two potential paths. The first path is a technological path that leverages technology to increase the destructive ability of small, swarming, groups to make devastating attacks. The second is an idea-driven path that wages warfare in and against the “hearts and minds” of a target population. The example given of the idea-driven path is terrorism. I found the Generations of Modern Warfare (GMW) to be significant for several different reasons, but chief among them is that each generation, as an adaptation to the previous generation, has an inherent advantage over previous generations.  [...] However, Al Qaeda, the opponent we were facing in Iraq and elsewhere, the opponent who had struck at us so terribly on September 11, 2001, did not represent a state. Al Qaeda had no army in the field that we could send our ships, planes or tanks against, but had hidden cells that could appear, do us harm, and then disappear. Al Qaeda represented an ideology that opposed the United States, and the culture it represents and spreads, as a competing ideology that could not be tolerated. They had unilaterally declared a violent war of ideas upon us, and they would fight us using an approach to warfare of the fourth generation, a form of warfare that could strike deeply into the very heart of our society, a form of warfare that had no front line and treated both soldier and civilian as legitimate target. By this time, around March 2006, the United States armed forces had invaded Afghanistan and overthrown the Taliban, and were nearly three years into the invasion, occupation, and rebuilding of Iraq. In spite of those successes and achievements, Al Qaeda was hardly defeated. In fact, the sectarian violence and attacks by insurgents in Iraq...",

    "text": "Afghanistan and Iraq were at an all-time high. It was painfully obvious that fourth-generation warfare...placed our third-generation forces...at a very distinct disadvantage. T. X. Hammes defines fourth generation warfare as:\n\n>Fourth-generation warfare (4GW) uses all available networks—political, economic, social, and military—to convince the enemy’s political decision makers that their strategic goals are either unachievable or too costly for the perceived benefit. It is an evolved form of insurgency...Unlike previous generations of warfare, it does not attempt to win by defeating the enemy’s military forces. Instead, via the networks, it directly attacks the mind of enemy decision makers to destroy the enemy’s political will. Fourth-generation wars are lengthy—measured in decades rather than months or years. (Hammes 2004, 2)\n\nMy immediate question was how to best defend against fourth-generation warfare...if each generation of warfare is a response to the previous generation of warfare, and 4GW signaled the end of the monopoly of warfare by the state and the rise of non-state-versus-state warfare, then what would the next generation of warfare look like? It seemed obvious to me that what was needed was a form of warfare that allowed the state to combat non-state opponents...a 5GW.\n\nHammes addressed fifth generation warfare...as the anthrax and ricin attacks on Capitol Hill...Although similar to fourth-generation attacks, they seem to have been conducted by an individual or...small group...super-empowered individuals or small groups would be in keeping with several emerging global trends—the rise of biotechnology, the increased power of knowledge workers, and the changing nature of loyalties. (p. 290)\n\nTo my thinking, this sort of biological warfare or terrorism wasn’t...the most effective way to combat practitioners of fourth-generation warfare...This may have been an exponentially more destructive and disruptive method of asymmetric warfare, but it didn’t seem to embody a generational shift...it seemed that this was, rather than an evolution to 5GW, an improved form of 4GW...This debate...had already been going on between military practitioners and theorists for more than two years...aided by very smart individuals, and their discussions about 5GW...my vision of 5GW began to grow and mature...\n\nFifth Generation Warfare (5GW): An emergent theory of warfare premised upon manipulation of multiple economic, political, social and military forces, in multiple domains, to effect positional changes in systems and achieve a consilience of effects to leverage a specific goal or set of circumstances.

    "text": " of GMW research forked into two alternate streams. The first of these, the xGW framework, abandons the theory of sequential emergence. The xGW framework is the focus of the first portion of this volume. However, other researchers have responded by insisting on sequential emergence, and from there extrapolating trends in science, engineering, and technology to determine what the new generations of war may look like. While the thinkers in this section disagree on which technologies will lead to the emergence of 5GW, all agree that 5GW will be a form of conflict that would have been impossible in the past. TRANSHUMAN POLITICS AND FIFTH GENERATION WAR (DANIEL MCINTOSH) There are emerging technologies which have the potential to overshadow nuclear power in their effects on the politics and the conduct of war. These Nano-Bio-Info-Cogno (NBIC) technologies have progressed to the point that they raise the prospect of the redesign of human beings—as individuals, as societies, and as a species. By challenging our most basic assumptions regarding what it means to be a human in society, NBIC technologies may well render much of contemporary sociology, political theory, and economics obsolete. They raise the possibility of a “transhuman” era, with transhuman or even “posthuman” politics. By altering what have been many of the defining characteristics of humanity they change the context—although not the nature—of politics. By empowering individuals and groups to a degree never before seen, these technologies will make possible a fifth generation of war more subtle, more complex, and more dangerous than anything seen today. The transition to a transhuman world will not be smooth. It will not affect all persons at once, nor to the same degree. It will also be shaped by current structures and conflicts, and by divergent notions of what improvement means. It will emerge within from a system of competitive states, firms, nongovernmental organizations, and “superempowered individuals,” each with an interest in the application of NBIC technologies for relative advantage. And while the designs will not be random, there will still be the interaction of types within a competitive environment that leads to evolution, and evolution by its nature leads to unexpected and contingent outcomes. The security implications are enormous, up to and including the possible extinction of the human species. Technologies of Superempowerment NBIC technologies are a constellation of four converging trends. Nanotechnology involves the construction and manipulation of objects on the scale of 10-9 meters, or a single molecule. Biotechnology is the modification and use of organisms, or parts or products thereof, to achieve ends. Information technology includes the integrated systems of computer hardware, software, and networking. The cognitive sciences and their applications refer to the study of intelligence and intelligent systems, both cybernetic and biological. The convergence of these fields comes from the fact that at the nanometer scale the differences between living and nonliving systems become indistinguishable. The body (including the brain, and whatever we might call “mind”) can be restructured. Medical devices can be implanted that will produce as well as dispense drugs inside of the host, including the brain. Supercomputers the size of a cell may be introduced, monitoring for and preventing disease (Canton 2005). More generally, while at one time the physical evolution of the human species relied upon the random mutation, distribution, and environmental selection of genes, NBIC technologies make it possible to conceive of a self-designed and self-modified organism. Already, the development of these technologies has been affected by cultural differences, competitive pressures, and the lack of a common regulatory regime. The debate over biopolitics already under way (for examples, see Fukuyama 2002, Hughes 2004, Bailey 2007), with differing outcomes in various societies. For the most part, these debates have occurred within nations, and while the UN and EU have encouraged the development of common standards, many states have left the issues in a regulatory void. In regard to stem-cell research, for example, a survey of thirty countries found that “policymakers must accept the reality of international \"dissensus\" (Pattinson and Caufield 2004). As NBIC technologies advance, any global debate on their applications will be all the more immune to compromise, as it will reflect basic disagreements over values. And, of course, history indicates that even when there is a formal consensus on the limits of human testing, it may be deficient or ignored in practice. Consider, for example, what Dr. Mengele could have done with genetic engineering. With NBIC technologies come new possibilities.",

    "text": "Some of the more speculative possibilities for directed evolution include: · The mind, once understood, could be loaded and run on different hardware. Bodies would be understood to be temporary. Death would not be permanent so long as one maintained a “backup.” · Movement from “meat” to electronics opens the possibility of increasing the speed of thought. Electrical impulses among neurons would be replaced by nanosecond-speed electronics. · Transhumans could inhabit environments, including outer space, without cumbersome life-support systems. · Knowledge could be downloaded at computer speeds, and integrated instantly into memory. · High-bandwidth communications could lead to mental networking, or a hive mind. (Or competing hive-minds.) The potential, as well as the risks, for first adopters are enormous, but the risks for those who do not push the limits of this technology could be even greater. In any case the transition will not be equitable or rational. If it follows the standard model of technological change it will consist of three stages: invention, innovation, and diffusion. Invention is the idea and the demonstration of its feasibility. Innovation is the process by which the invention is brought into use. Diffusion is the spread of the innovation into general use. The process resembles an S-curve, where the cost for early adopters limits diffusion, the costs drop while diffusion increases, and diffusion stabilizes when economies of scale maximize and innovation slows (Schumpeter 2005; Girifalco 1991). Historically, it is the period of maximum diffusion that has been the most disruptive for social and political structures predicated on the old level and type of technology. The spread of nuclear power and nuclear weapons is a case in point. Given this pattern, what does it say for disruptions that may be associated with biotechnology, “among the most radical innovation clusters ever introduced” (Adams 2004, 4), let alone the constellation of mutually-reinforcing changes under the rubric of NBIC? There is no reason to expect a practical limit on the proliferation of NBIC technologies only to users who are able and willing to use them without harm to the innocent, or even agreement on what constitutes harm. Fifth-Generation War What will this mean for the conduct of war? That depends, in large part, on how one defines “war.” Authors in this handbook provide various definitions, but a consensus is beginning to emerge. Two things are essential to any definition. First, war is political. Politics is the social activity of making and enforcing collective decisions. It is social in the sense that it requires at least two participants, and the potential to disagree. It is collective in the sense that it involves decisions that apply to the whole, even if individual elements disagree. It is decision-making within an environment—a structure of roles, rules, and resources—that influences outcomes, and can be shaped by outcomes. It involves an enforcement mechanism to impose behaviors on participants who otherwise would not act as instructed. This mechanism—the ability to cause another actor to do what he otherwise would not do—is power. Power may be based in legitimacy, in force, or in exchange: “lawyers, guns, and money.” It almost always involves a combination of the three. Second, war is violent. When a contest is between actors who are sufficiently large, organized and capable of capable of doing harm, it enters the sphere of coercive diplomacy. When that violence is used to reach a political end, it is war. At one time these actors were assumed to be states, but no longer. The decline of the state to one political institution among many, plus the empowering of individuals and small groups by modern technologies, has remade the possibilities for war. Although this is a handbook of fifth generation war (5GW) it is important to note that war is not easily divided into “generations,” other than as ideal types. Contra Lind (1989) or Hammes (2004) change does not have to be a “progressive” sequential emergence (Juno 2009). Assuming progress means imposing a teleology which may not exist. Moreover, the evolution of a system does not imply that all elements are changing, or to the same degree. On the other hand, some things can accumulate over time—technologies, doctrines, information—and these affect war. Thus war of the zeroth gradient (0GW) may be the only option available for some participants in a conflict. To do anything more would require a degree of social organization and technology they do not have. It is only with the division of labor (1GW) that one has the possibility of organizing and acting strategically, to maximize effect. New technology, in the sense of weapons that can be massed against a target at a distance (and the economy that can produce those weapons) makes the second gradient (2GW) possible. It does not make 2GW necessary, in any logical sense, but to forgo it when others are applying it to the battlefield can be catastrophic. The competition between forms of organization, in the case of Europe, made a significant contribution to the development of the modern nation-state. In many cases, there was first the army, then the state, and then the nation. 2GW helped to make the modern state. Note that later gradients can be a response to earlier breakthroughs. War is violent competition, and competition is interactive. Thus 3GW is often conceived of as the doctrinal solution to the problem of massed firepower, by means of maneuver and psychologically disruption of the opponent, conducted by one state against another. It is, as Clausewitz observed, not merely a duel on a larger scale, but a mix of strategic rationality (centered in the state), technical proficiency (centered in the military), and mass support (the population). 3GW is the high point of development for the state. A fourth gradient, or 4GW, starts at the point where violent competition continues, but the distinctions between war and crime break down. Terror attacks by non-state actors fall into this category. In many cases, the primary conflict is not over territory, but over minds, particularly the minds of opposition leaders. Each side (and there may be several) wishes to manipulate the decision-making of the other, to weaken the will, to set the parameters of moral discourse, or to control the situation on the ground by redefining the identity of the other—for himself, and for relevant audiences, in an open (if amorphous) competition. It is not the bomb that is critical, it is the warning that precedes it and the communiqué that follows. Or as Brian Michael Jenkins (1974) put it, “terrorism is theater.” Fifth gradient war (5GW) takes this to the next level. It moves from violent crime to manipulation of information and identity at a level where the practitioners are recognized neither as soldiers or criminals. Instead, we are back to individuals and small groups, empowered by technologies and often removed from one another, who act to shape their environment—particularly the nonphysical environment—in ways that are not clear. The conflict is not to conquer the state, or to divide the state, but to undermine the state. It is not so much to rule as it is to make certain nobody else can. There are no warnings, no communiqués, no explanations—or, at least, none that can be trusted—only events which may or may not be random. If a 5GW is successful, a target state will have so lost its legitimacy that it cannot be certain of anyone’s primary loyalty. If war can be conceptualized as an unbroken gradient, it raises the question of when it ceases to be war at all. If, in the fifth gradient, “violence is so diffuse that only a single murder or outrage may separate it from politics” (Abbott, Dreaming 5th generation war 2009), it is only in the intent of the perpetrator that one can determine if he was at war. The target of the campaign may never know. A transhuman is, by his very nature, a potential 5GW warrior. The Politics of the Transhuman Politics will not become obsolete, but motives and goals may change if “freed from the limits of the human meat- machine...humans can change and improve their own hardware” (Robinett 2002). Even so, new goals emerge as a result of the process and prior choices that lead to transhuman politics. What would they be? An imaginary team of protohumans, if it were tasked with designing their next evolutionary step, might have focused on doing better the things they already knew how to do, with the capabilities they already had. They might have chosen be to be larger, or stronger, or better able to climb. Would they have imagined the range of possibilities opened by intelligence, language, and technology? When we consider the prospect of a radical breakthrough in capabilities, we proto-posthumans may be in a similar situation. The most important developments will literally be the things we cannot imagine. One possible indicator of the scope of our dilemma is the Fermi paradox, named for Enrico Fermi, the nuclear physicist who is credited with first articulating it. Science starts from the assumption that our species and our world do not have a privileged position in the universe. Given the age of the universe, the probability of life- bearing star systems far older than our own, the potential for technology to accomplish more and more, and the adaptive quality of intelligence, we should expect to see evidence of older, more technologically advanced civilizations. Fermi’s paradox is this: where are they? If they don’t exist, what happened to them? Several possible solutions have been offered to Fermi’s paradox, but none so far is universally accepted. Many of these solutions suggest that there is some natural function that prevents the development of advanced technological civilizations past the point where we are today. (With available instruments, a civilization at a technological level similar to our own could already be detected at the range of nearby stars.) Past this point, advanced technology may not, in",

Feedback loops, where a cause effects more of itself, create S-curve jumps in variables like population size or processor efficiency. Positive feedback loops, sometimes hyperbolic, can break the originating system when approaching infinity. The 2008 financial crisis exemplifies a break loop stemming from regulatory arbitrage. Banks selling loans as securities led to a hyperbolic expansion of money supply and debt, ultimately damaging the global financial system.  This could be considered a 5GW strategy: instigating a model-breaking feedback loop and wielding it as a weapon. Each generation of war was instigated by a break loop that invalidated established models. The proliferation of global communication networks is one such loop. Fifth-generation warfare hinges on initiating feedback loops that destroy the context of an opponent's strength.  Beyond break loops lies effecting a feedback loop in self-modifying organization that preempts all organizations capable of effecting break loops.

This heightened existential risk presents a dilemma for policymakers and elites. Recognizing the potential dangers of greater-than-human intelligence, they are pressured to develop it first to prevent others from gaining an advantage.  This leads to efforts to marginalize independent research through means like engineered economic crises, reducing liquidity and driving researchers towards state-controlled networks.",

This aligns with Younghusband's writings, particularly when considering the Trinitarian (Clausewitzian) aspects of conflict.  Disassembling the theory reveals the OODA loop as a sensible component.  Analyzing different systems models, such as the waterfall and rapid application development models from software development, allows for consideration of new tactics that struggle to fit within previous generational warfare paradigms. Layering these aspects creates a richer model (figure 4), revealing relationships and strategies of generational warfare models across conflict intensities (low to high) and within the Boyd OODA loop. This model explains new strategies like cyber warfare and cyber terrorism within the fifth-generation construct.  It also accommodates elements of national power (DIME or MIDLIFE), although this discussion uses DIME for simplicity.  Combining DIME with the generational paradigm, the OODA loop, and MOOTK (military operations other than killing) further enhances the model's utility. The challenge lies in analyzing this model's depth and the effort/violence differential between low and high-intensity conflict.",

Similarly, the conflict model progresses from low to high intensity, with each cone (representing a generation of warfare) growing larger.  For instance, the first generation's set-piece warfare lacks the targeting discrimination of the third generation.  Cone size represents scope, not casualties or damage. This dynamic model allows adversaries to escalate or de-escalate conflict, transitioning between generational constructs via the OODA loop.  The model acknowledges the coexistence of different conflict forms (e.g., counterinsurgency with conventional conflict) within a spectrum, not a hierarchy.

This final model uses a multidimensional generational warfare representation, including the theorists' comprehensive three-dimensional view and Boyd's OODA loop for escalation and change.

    "text": "Though small compared to the victims of the Great Terror at large, these networks compose a formidable list that included Old Bolsheviks, former Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Jewish Socialist Bund, Trotskyites (real followers of Trotsky, not those sentenced under Article 58), former Mensheviks, Ukranian Communist Party leaders, Cheka, GPU, OGPU and NKVD officials prior to Yezhov, Leningrad Communist Party leadership under Kirov, the Red Army officer corps, especially general officers, Comintern agents, especially those who went to Spain and China, GRU officers, foreign communists resident in the USSR, among others. The methodical nature of Stalin’s “inner terror” can be seen by looking at a few examples. The Polish Communist Party, in Soviet exile from the Pilsudski dictatorship, had its entire leadership arrested along with 50,000 followers and relatives, of whom 10,000 were shot outright. In 1938, the effectively defunct Polish Party was formally dissolved (Tucker 1990). The Ukranian Communist Party, and Kosior, who was the Soviet satrap in Kiev, particularly irritated Stalin because of their Ukranian “nationalism” and paid a heavy price when Khrushchev was dispatched to deal with them. Khrushchev personally ordered the shooting of 55,741 Ukrainian party officials, including thirty-five out of thirty-eight provincial secretaries. Lavrenty Beria, who would succeed Yezhov as NKVD boss and oversee his predecessor’s murder, had a staggering 268,950 Transcaucasian Communists and their family members arrested and liquidated 10% of the Georgian Communist Party (Montefiore 2003). Approximately 90% of the Red Navy officers were killed in 1937-1938, and the Red Army, though less thoroughly savaged at the lower ranks, lost 154 out 168 division commanders and almost every army and army corps commander, along with their political commissars. A frequent Stalinist purge technique was to liquidate not only the holder of an important post in an organization, but his immediate replacement as well (and not infrequently, the replacement’s replacement), thus not only atomizing existing social networks, but terminating institutional memory in the bargain as the documentary records were purged with the same severity as the staff. This permitted a complete reshaping of organizations in any fashion the dictator desired as Stalin could be sure the ”new blood” was completely loyal to him and untainted by previous “enemies.” Soviet society had been so thoroughly terrorized by the end of the Yezhovschina that no effective opposition of any kind existed to Stalin’s will. Neither the Soviet government nor the Communist Party nor the general staff of the Red Army retained any independent functionality after 1938, and after 1948 the politburo itself fell into gradual disuse under Stalin’s paranoid eye as he arrested the wives and families of his closest collaborators.",

    "text": "Cambodia Despite being a secretive, almost cultlike, ultra-Maoist movement, Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge leadership aped Stalin’s bureaucratic totalitarian regime in conducting a two-tiered auto-genocide designed to exterminate specific networks even as it is deconstructed Cambodian society as a whole. Submerged within the most radical and terrifying democidal expression of Marxist-Leninism in history was a sinister racial and religious subtext that would have warmed the heart of Heinrich Himmler; and like Stalin’s Great Terror, Pol Pot’s “Year Zero” left Cambodian society completely prostrate and incapable of even conceiving of resistance. “They treated us like dogs; we dared not protest,” recalled one ethnic Chinese Cambodian peasant who was doubly suspect for having converted to Protestant Christianity (Biernan The Pol Pot Regime). As Khmer Rouge cadres would say, “To keep you is no gain; to kill you is no loss” (p. 294). The Khmer Rouge ideologically idealized a peasant Communist utopia and followed revolutionary tradition in targeting “bourgeoisie,” a category the Khmer Rouge radically expanded to embrace all urban dwellers or with education, famously killing those who wore eyeglasses on the presumption that they could read. Like other Marxists, the Khmer Rouge sought an atheistic state and targeted the Buddhist clergy for liquidation along with those Cambodians who had been contaminated by converting to foreign religions like Islam or Christianity. But the Khmer Rouge leadership also had deep pseudoracialist antipathy for Muslim Chams, ethnic Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese, all of whom as non-Khmers were slated for destruction (though to appease Beijing’s sensibilities, ethnic Chinese were always classed as “bourgeois” and not, specifically, killed for their ethnicity, unlike the Vietnamese minority). As with Stalin’s purges of the CPSU, Polish and Ukranian Communist Parties, the Khmer Rouge achieved a chilling thoroughness in their elimination of leadership networks in “traitorous” or “enemy” groups. Of the Islamic leaders in Cambodia categorized as “community leaders,” “deputies,” “Haji,” and “teachers,” the death toll was approximately 90%. The primary political vehicle of the Chams, the Islamic Central Organization, was killed off to almost the last man (Biernan at. 271). Islam and the Cham language were banned. An innovation in genocide, if it can be called that, instituted by the Khmer Rouge and later perfected by the Interahamwe militias of Rwanda, was the devolution from elite to a granular social level of state-sanctioned mass murder. Unlike the Nazi Gestapo and special Totenkopf SS division that ran Hitler’s death camps, or Stalin’s NKVD, which executed political prisoners in secret or in faraway gulags, Pol Pot ordered that village officials, ordinary soldiers, peasants, or even children be enlisted to execute enemies, hacking them to death with farm implements in order to save bullets. One former Khmer Rouge official confessed to personally killing 5,000 people by wielding a pickaxe (Power 2002). This downward dissemination of responsibility for genocide created situations where victims were frequently compelled to become perpetrators, demonstrating their “loyalty” by slaughtering neighbors, friends, spouses, parents, or children. These survivors under the Khmer Rouge regime were left with their social relations atomized, unable to reconstruct new social networks as forming bonds of trust was impossible so long as the rule of Pol Pot endured.",

    "section": "Rwandan Genocide",
    "text": "Rwanda The most “granular” genocide in history occurred in Rwanda in 1994, where between 800,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsis and “moderate” Hutus were systematically murdered over the course of just 100 days by radical Hutu mobs mobilized and directed by Interahamwe and Impuzamugambi militiamen and the Rwandan government, possibly abetted by French military intelligence officers (France accused in Rwanda Genocide 2008). One of the most publicized genocides in recorded history, the Rwandan genocide is notable for the recruitment of enormous numbers of participants, where every Hutu citizen was expected to play the role of an enthusiastic SS man, and for the failure of the genocide to affect the military capabilities of the Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front, which ultimately overthrew the Hutu government in Kigali. Philip Gourevitch, author of We Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families, described the unique character of the genocide in Rwanda in an interview with PBS Frontline:\nWhat distinguishes Rwanda is a clear, programmatic effort to eliminate everybody in the Tutsi minority group because they were Tutsis. The logic was to kill everybody. Not to allow anybody to get away. Not to allow anybody to continue. And the logic, as Rwandans call it, the genocidal logic, was very much akin to that of an ideology very similar to that of the Nazism vis-à-vis the Jews in Europe, which is all of them must be gotten rid of to purify in a sense the people. There's a utopian element in genocide that's perplexing. But it is an effort to create community in the most strict sense of \"us versus them,\" by literally eliminating them and bonding all of us in complicity, in the course of that elimination. The idea was that all Hutus should participate in killing of Tutsis. And there have been cases of mass political murder, there have been cases of massacres and genocidal massacres, but never a country and a society so completely and totally convulsed by an effort at pure, unambiguous genocide since the end of World War II, since the passage of the Genocide Convention by the United Nations in the aftermath of the Holocaust. (Interviews: Gourevitch 2008) As with the genocide of Communist regimes, the radical Hutu state was targeting latent social networks of potential opposition in trying to destroy the Tutsi population, but unlike Stalin or Pol Pot, Hutu generals also faced an active military opponent in the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) with which they were locked in a civil war: “Note that in 1991 Rwandan Major General Augustin Ndindiliyimana originally proposed creating the self-defense militias that became monstrous killing machines over the next three years. That same general as commander of the National Gendarmerie was a member of the \"Zero Network\" used by the conspirators of the genocide. His case is hardly unusual; there was nothing spontaneous about the Rwandan genocide. Even as the interim government of Rwanda crossed to safety in Zaire in July\n1994, Melvern quotes Prime Minister Kambanda proclaiming, \"We have lost the military battle but the war is by no means over because we have the people behind us.\" That statement and hundreds of pages of government records, testimony at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and countless first person accounts from the genocidal killers document what the genocide was all about: continued Hutu political domination of Rwanda. (Odom 2008) The genocide failed to stabilize the radical Hutu government and, instead, led directly to its overthrow by its Tutsi rebel enemies. The RPF rebels were based in Uganda and, unlike most insurgents, their military effectiveness in the field was not impaired by the Hutu destruction of their civilian Tutsi “base.” By contrast, Rwandan society and governmental machinery were severely disrupted by the genocide, both by the loss of Tutsi personnel throughout the private and public sector and by the mobilization of the Hutu population and prioritization of genocidal killings over their normal activities. The regime was less able to field effective military resistance to the RPF during the genocide than had been the case prior to the Arsuha Accords, and it collapsed in July of 1994.",

    "section": "Genocide as Statecraft and 4GW",
    "text": "Analysis These historical case studies point not only to the persistence of genocide as a historical tragedy, but to its perceived utility as a tool of statecraft by regimes of a paranoid character that consider themselves surrounded by enemies, real or imagined. The siege mentality that is an inherent characteristic of governmental elites in states like Burma, Algeria, North Korea, Zimbabwe, and Sudan are like gasoline waiting to be ignited by the spark of 4GW into a monstrous overreaction. 4GW entities like Hezbollah or complex decentralized insurgencies seen in Iraq or the narco-insurgency raging in Mexico, operate at what strategist John Boyd referred to as the mental and moral levels of war, seeking to erode the legitimacy of the state and win over the primary loyalty of the population, or a segment of it, to itself. It would be hard to conceive of a more antagonizing type of opponent for a paranoid, statist, elite than a 4GW group whose existence and successes tend to inflame the worst kind of conspiracy theorizing. For elites of this kind, a democidal response to the challenge or the potential of 4GW conflict offers pragmatic and psychological benefits. The pragmatic benefit is that genocide is often, though not always, effective at eliminating the capacity of a targeted population to resist while terrorizing observers within the society into passivity or even active complicity with the regime. Algeria in the 1990s, Iraq in the 1980s, Guatemala in the 1970s, and Indonesia in the 1960s all successfully used “death squads” on a massive scale and in conjunction with regular military and security forces to brutally put down Islamist terrorists, Communist guerillas or restive minority populations. Nor does genocide require the sophisticated and expensive state security apparatus fielded by the Nazis to carry out. As Rwanda and Cambodia demonstrated, political mobilization and recruitment of a “perpetrator population” is enough; Rwandan Hutu militiamen actually murdered more efficiently with their machetes than the SS did with Auschwitz. Psychologically, a regime that opts for so extreme a policy as genocide to crush an insurgency is akin to Cortez burning his boats before assaulting the Aztec empire. The state backs itself into a moral corner where the only sure path for safety for its high-level apparatchiks is to prevail and retain power indefinitely. The bonds between members of the regime are tightened by mutual guilt and a common enemy (or perhaps the enmity of the whole civilized world) and frequently, an increasingly distorted worldview as the need to rationalize or minimize the genocide as justifiable becomes a critical imperative when the genocide is “discovered” by other states. For many illiberal and less than legitimate states in the twenty-first century, embarking down the path of unspeakable crimes will become their likely adaption to the challenges of a 4GW threat. Their 5GW will be entering into the heart of darkness.",

    "section": "Robert Taylor and the 5GW Framework",
    "text": "One of the barriers to writing about the fifth gradient of war is that there is quite a bit of debate over what exactly constitutes each gradient of warfare. So I must begin this chapter by stipulating a few assumptions I am making as I lay out my example of 5GW. Those assumptions include:\n\n· Warfare is organized violence.\n· Each successive grade of warfare represents a tighter focus of violence (aka kinetics) and a more sophisticated division of labor required to create the kinetics.\n· As a corollary to the point above, as the violence becomes more focused the role of the non-kinetic (aka “everything else”) becomes more important in determining the outcome of the conflict.\n\nThere are two overall schools of thought when it comes to classifying warfare. The first is the Generations of Modern War (GMW) that is perhaps best explained (at least to me) in Col. Thomas X. Hammes’s The Sling and The Stone (2004). GMW theory is a Hegelian view of war; that is, the history of war since 1648 is linear, with each subsequent generation of war emerging out of social and technological developments to counter the previous generation of war. In this view first generation war is Napoleonic linear warfare, second generation war is industrialized war with massed artillery fire (such as The American Civil War and WWI), third generation war is Blitzkrieg and fourth generation war is asymmetrical warfare (such as Vietnam and Iraq).\n\nThe second system of classifying warfare is the xGW framework, which is similar in many ways to GMW, but does not necessarily assume that warfare progresses chronologically. Instead, xGW is concerned with the “basic principle behind an expression of force” (Herring 2009); in other words, xGW examines the specific goal that is sought in each generation of warfare. In this context, for example, 3GW has as its goal locating and focusing kinetics on the weak point(s) in the enemy’s network. Some of my coauthors in this volume, including Abbott (The xGW Framework 2009) and Herring (Searching for 5GW 2009), have suggested that 5GW is concerned with manipulating what can be or is observed, and in my example I am going to expound upon that idea by showing that a 5GW campaign could be used to attack and eventually alter a battlespace, thus making it more difficult for a given actor to orient himself within the battlespace and therefore reducing the actor’s effectiveness as a fighter.",

    "section": "5GW: The Battle of Who Could Care More",
    "text": "In a 4GW, caring is important. In a battle of ideas (capitalism/communism, Jihadism/Liberal Democracy) the fighter— especially the insurgent—is generally a passionate advocate for their position. A 5GW is, like a 4GW, typically an insurgency that pits a smaller force against a much stronger opponent, but unlike 4GW there is no ideology involved. 5GW fighters don’t care about ideology —and they hope their opponent does not care that there is a battle going on:\n\nEvery other form of modern-warfare requires people to care. The aggressor needs to be able to morally and physically support his military forces for over a period of time—often a long time. The defender, once he realizes he is being attacked, will care about his own survival and fight back.(Abbott, Dreaming 5th generation war 2009)\n\nIn many ways getting an enemy to not care is the essence of what happened in the Robert Taylor between the mid 1980s and mid 1990s as the BKs rose to prominence. The gangs needed the City of Chicago to not care that they were operating. This was no Maoist insurgency; the BKs were not really looking for converts or comrades; they just needed enough space to operate freely. Much of what the BKs did, from paying off local elites to tamping down violence at the behest of the police, was designed to make potential troublemakers not care just enough to decide that taking on the gang was more trouble than going along. On the flip side, anyone inside any level of government that really wanted to fight the gangs was fighting a battle to get someone to care: get the FBI to care about the racketeering, get the City to care about the conditions inside the projects, and get the police to care more about a strong rule of law than a hassle-free peace. And once this was accomplished, once the government started caring enough to dump resources into solving the problem, the war was won. Once the authorities cared, they set off a series of developments that substantially weakened the Black Kings. To explain how that happened, I shall steal another concept from Abbott’s (Dreaming 5th generation war 2009) post on 5GW: waterfall development. In a waterfall development model:\n\nRequirements must be known a long time before fighting begins Figure 9. The waterfall requirements model. Requirements will be rigid and non- adaptable. There is a long time between proposal and victory.\n\nIn the 5GW I am describing, the insurgents, like all insurgents, draw strength from their environment. Not unlike the way the Viet Cong hid in the jungle and used the natural landscape of Vietnam as a weapon against American soldiers and marines, the Black Kings used their immense store of local knowledge and ability to blend into the environment of Robert Taylor as their primary defense. So the CHA et al. defeated them by launching a 5GW against the environment itself. In their grand strategy to destroy the gangs of Chicago, the government turned construction workers, real estate developers, and nonprofit organizations into unknowing soldiers in a massive counterinsurgency campaign. And when they were finished, the insurgents found the environment had been so radically altered that they were unable to reorient themselves, and many wound up walking away from insurgency all together.",

    "text": "The Robert Taylor housing project was built with the best of intentions. When they opened in 1962, the 4,500 apartments in Robert Taylor Homes were to be a mixed-income public housing project that would serve as a kind of stepping-stone between poverty and entry into the middle class for the primarily black, low-income residents on Chicago’s South Side (Venkatesh, American project 2002). Venkatesh describes Robert Taylor as a large-scale “social engineering project” (p. 15) because every aspect of Robert Taylor seemed somewhat experimental: the high-rise design with copious amounts of open spaces was all the rage in Europe (p. 16); the CHA would purposefully place poor and working class families side by side, to reduce the “isolation” felt by the poor (p. 20); and the CHA would also maintain social and educational services nearby, to help the residents find a way out of poverty (p. 23). Ultimately, Robert Taylor was envisioned as a sort of mini-city unto itself, designed especially for those who the authorities felt did not quite fit in the rest of Chicago.\n\nThe rise of the Local Advisory Council\nThe grand visions of the CHA had one major weakness: in order for the experiment to work a lot of things had to go right, a number of city bureaucracies had to learn how to work together, and budgets would have to be maintained at levels which fully funded the educational and social programs or the goal of helping the tenants move up and out from public housing would be difficult to realize, especially crucial in the late 1960s as opportunities in manufacturing disappeared (p. 45). Also, law enforcement would have to be committed to policing the local area and the private sector would have to be willing to invest in the kinds of businesses any thriving community needs, including stores and places of employment. Robert Taylor began accepting residents in the mid-1960s and it did not take long before the various forces that would have to align for the project to work began to show signs of stress. Very quickly the formal institutions that had official jurisdiction over Robert Taylor began to demonstrate that they were not ready for the challenges at hand. As early as 1965, residents began complaining that it was hard to get police protection in Robert Taylor. The CHA was also increasingly and conspicuously absent from Robert Taylor as the physical infrastructure quickly deteriorated to the point where several children died in accidents as a result of a faulty fence (p. 49). The failings of local law enforcement and the CHA led residents of Robert Taylor to begin look to closer to home, to less formal solutions and organizations, to deal with their problems. One local solution that would become part of the landscape of Robert Taylor was the Local Advisory Council. The LAC (p. 60) was an elected body made up of and voted on by the residents of each building that would work with the CHA to address tenant issues. The LAC became very important both because it empowered local residents, to an extent, and also because the LAC members became the first, but not the last, local organization who would use extortion to make money off the growing underground economy in Robert Taylor (p. 90). LAC members would often take bribes to look the other way while people ran various scams and businesses out of their apartments, including bars and brothels.",

    "text": "There is a flow of legitimacy, meaning the people who are recognized by both the residents and by city officials as community leaders; this often included members of LAC (because they were duly elected to represent the residents) and officials from the local church and community center. The BKs harnessed the goodwill that these local institutions had by paying off and providing services for the leaders. The LAC, community center and church, in turn, by accepting the BKs’ money and using them to provide services essentially—for lack of a better term—blessed the BKs and made them a legitimate local institution. Another flow was the flow of wealth. In Robert Taylor wealth might come from lawful economic activity (i.e., having a job in the regular economy), but was more likely to come from “hustling” (which could include prostitution, drug dealing, gambling, or running an unlicensed small business such as an auto-repair business) or wealth transfers, which include welfare from federal, state and city governments. The BKs managed to capture the flow of wealth both by “taxing” (aka running a protection rackets on) local hustlers and also by selling drugs to the residents. The BKs would then transfer part of that wealth to the local elites (such as donations to the local church or the aforementioned Grace Center (Venkatesh 2008)). Besides buying the allegiance of local leaders, the BKs were also empowering LAC officials to provide more services to the local residents, which improved the standing of the LAC but also made their power position increasingly dependent upon the goodwill of the BKs and the success of the BKs in various illicit business ventures. The flow of security is the local monopoly of violence. In most American communities the uniformed police fill this role, but in Robert Taylor it was often filled by the BKs. By not pushing for a greater presence, and by essentially acquiescing to the BKs’ control of Robert Taylor, the Chicago Police ceded their role as local Leviathan and that vacuum was quickly filled by the BKs. As an example of the police ceding their authority, Venkatesh reports witnessing a meeting where police and the leader of the local community center met with two rival gang leaders and negotiated cessation of hostilities in a gang war in exchange for one gang gaining exclusive rights to sell crack in the local park (Venkatesh, Gang leader for a day: A rogue sociologist takes to the streets 2008). The problem, of course, was that the same monopoly of violence that the BKs used to beat up those accused of domestic violence and warn away strangers could also be utilized to threaten any resident who refused to play by the BKs’ rules. Finally, we see a flow of social services. In most communities the government, often with the help of local charities, provides social services. The government sent a fair amount of welfare to Robert Taylor (recall that about 90 percent were on public assistance), but many local services were performed by the LAC with gang money; among them were local basketball leagues, car services to take elderly people on errands, and a program to buy school supplies for local kids. Occasionally the BKs even helped clean up the apartment lobby. This is the tangled web the BKs wove which allowed them the space to operate with impunity. By the early 1990s, with the LAC (and by extension the preferred contact between the police and local residents) in their pocket and with residents increasingly recognizing the BKs as the local security service provider, the Kings had created a TAZ—Temporary Autonomous Zone—an area of the city that they effectively controlled, and they were able to leverage that control to extract greater and greater amounts of wealth out of the local population.",

    "text": "By the mid 1990s, political and economic forces were aligning to provide the City of Chicago, CHA, and federal government the means to kick off a waterfall-style redevelopment of the environment the BKs had come to rely on. Crime was increasingly a concern among the American public; politicians were terrified of being dubbed “soft on crime.” As murder rates spiraled upward, long mandatory prison sentences became the norm and police departments across the country were given the money they needed to add officers. To put it another way, the BKs were losing the battle of who could care less; the authorities were starting to care. Federal law enforcement cared enough to bring RICO prosecutions against the leadership of all Chicago area gangs and the distributors they used to bring drugs in from Mexico. While being prosecuted for possession or trafficking had always been a risk of gang life, federal prosecutors were now applying a full court press, taking down the leaders of Chicago area gangs and prosecuting them for being involved in organized crime. With each successive grade of war kinetics becomes more and more focused; as the 5GW campaign against the BKs kicked off the kinetics were focused on a list of high-value individuals who had been key in the BKs’ C2 structure. The prosecutions were affecting life in Robert Taylor in at least three ways. First, and most obviously, taking gang leaders off the street prevented them from making deals and handing out bribes, although it must be noted that most gang leaders were able to exert some influence from prison, but they would never have the day-to- day ability to get a “feel” for the ever-changing situation on the street that they might have when they were free. Second, Chicago police, who had been fairly amiable to gang control of the area for many years, had to become much more careful about even the slightest hint that they allowed gang activity to proceed unimpeded in their jurisdiction. Finally, the prosecutions were making gang members more and more paranoid about other members cutting deals to become witnesses in exchange for leniency in the face of prosecution. Upper-level gang members suspected their underlings and the underlings assumed that, when push came to shove, the higher-ups on the board of directors would cut deals at the expense of their junior officers. As fear began to grip the BKs their level of cohesion decreased; key members started looking for a way out of the gang and recruitment was being hindered by another phase of the 5GW war being waged against the BKs. The second front in the 5GW involved a federal project known as HOPE VI, which sought to replace all high-rise public housing projects in the US with mixed-income single-family and multifamily structures. This is where the concept of waterfall development comes into play. Remaking Robert Taylor was no easy task and involved agencies at the local, state and national levels as well as private sector firms and NGOs (Levy and Gallagher 2007) working with at least half a billion dollars in funding (Micheals Development Company 2003). All of these resources, as well as the political will to use them, had to be in place before Robert Taylor could be torn down, but once those resources were put in place and the process was begun it would move forward with its own inertia, because by that time there were simply too many interested parties to stop the process. Figure 10. Waterfall development model for the victory against the Black Kings. In each previous generation of war, fighters had to care. Many of the people who fought the war against the Black Kings probably never even heard of the local gang. The private sector investors really did not care about the BKs; they were interested in prime real estate. The construction workers were interested in fulfilling their duties to operate machinery, pour concrete, and collect a paycheck on Friday; they had no idea they were fighting a COIN campaign with each old structure they destroyed. As the HOPE VI construction got under way the BKs began to feel the pressure of losing their resources. Residents were being relocated to other projects or given vouchers to move into private apartments. Efforts to spread the gang were met with little success (Venkatesh, Gang leader for a day: A rogue sociologist takes to the streets 2008), partially because Chicago had decided to attack all the projects in the city with the HOPE VI program simultaneously (and the Feds were going after all the gangs at the same time as well), and partially because the BKs’ success in Robert Taylor had been heavily correlated with the unique conditions within the projects; a large number of people living outside the law (easy prey for extortion), a large number of customers (drug users) living in close proximity, and a large potential labor pool (all the unemployed young men), when combined with a city that generally did not care what happened inside Robert Taylor, had allowed the BKs to flourish for several years. To make matters worse, as the residents were moved out and construction workers moved in, the Chicago police began increasing their patrols to protect the workers. The reduction in power for the BKs was also reducing the power of other local elites. The LAC, which had been working hand-in-hand with the BKs, was losing their power both because the money was drying up and because the residents were forced to rely directly upon the CHA relocation assistance; as much power as the LAC had developed within the projects they were relatively powerless outside Robert Taylor. All of these changes worked to isolate the BKs from all the flows they had previously employed to stay in power. The BKs were destroyed in two distinct phases. First, the big bang of the federal indictment, which can be thought of as extremely focused kinetics, disrupted the OODA of the BKs’ leadership. Then the second phase sought to remake the BKs’ environment right out from under them by kicking off a waterfall development remaking of the battlespace the BKs had learned not only to operate in, but to dominate. In the end, the 5GW campaign ended with the area of Chicago that had been Robert Taylor—now renamed Legends South —gang-free. And J.T., who had been a key leader of the BKs and at his height had commanded hundreds of foot soldiers and dozens of officers, was reduced to working in the dry cleaning business. (The once powerful gang leader also attempted a career as a barber. Luckily, he had enough money left over from his dealing that he did not have to work.)",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Historian Mark Safranski has pointed out that genocide could be a form of 5GW used to put down a 4GW insurgency that was supported by an ethnic minority (5GW: Into the heart of darkness 2009). My example shows almost the exact same thing occurring, but with a much lower level of physical violence. If the Robert Taylor Homes are viewed objectively, one can see a unique culture with its own norms, values and institutions. Residents, feeling underserved by America’s procedural justice system, devised their own honor based justice system that included lists of crimes and punishments up to and including a death penalty for severe infractions. They developed their own economic system that mixed entrepreneurial capitalism with a barter system. And they developed their own security forces whose activities undermined the authority of the political elites. When the government forces decided to destroy the BKs, they recognized that they had to destroy the entire culture within which the BKs operated. Just as in Safranski’s example the Rwandan government inspired the Hutu majority to take up arms against the Tutsi minority in 1994, the government in Chicago wanted to empower a decentralized coalition of actors, including investors, NGOs, and real estate developers to act against the culture that supported the BKs. In America, those actors would be armed not with machetes but with zoning permits, but the result was similar: the removal of a local population and the destruction of a culture that had supported an insurgency. The above argument is not meant to infer a moral equivalency between a violent genocide and the breakup of a violent gang. If one believes (as I do) that America’s justice system is preferable to an honor-violence based kleptocracy, then the actions of the City of Chicago and CHA were completely justified. What my analogy is designed to illustrate are the essential elements of 5GW that could be observed in both my and Mark Safranski’s examples: a central authority empowering groups of actors to work ostensibly for individual gain while also affecting an outcome desired by the central authority, and also a focus on getting those actors to affect the human terrain of a given geographic area with the goal of robbing an insurgency of its power base.",

    "text": "The fourth generation of war entailed irregular combatants fighting for an ideological cause, seeking to remake society according to their ideals. Fifth-generation war, or 5GW, now coalescing, is less clearly ideological but just as sweeping in its goals. 5GW is when a party exploits or encourages an existing or emerging crisis to achieve strategic goals that those most directly involved in the crisis might not even be aware of. 5GW is a form of stealthy proxy war. \"The systematic alteration, or replacement of, an existing rule set is your strategic goal,\" Thomas Barnett wrote of 5G fighters. \"You're not happy with things the way they are, so you make those around you unhappy enough that they too, are unhappy with the ways things are. Shock them hard enough, and you can trigger their own movement toward new rule sets that move the pile for you\" (Barnett, My own personal 5GW dream 2006). Where fourth-generation combatants might blend in with the surrounding populace most of the time, they still periodically emerged to form military-style units. 5G fighters, by contrast, remain \"subtle actors.\" They may never once wear a uniform or carry a rifle. Their weapon is the desperate population of a society on the brink; their major tactic is unrest; their goal is to undermine the established order in the interest of changing it, or just leaving it in ruins. No continent poses less of a traditional military threat to the United States than Africa. But in an age of 5GW, where subtle actors can exploit humanitarian, economic, and other crises to undermine the power and legitimacy of the industrial state, no continent poses a greater nontraditional threat. An increasingly volatile Africa begs for greater US intervention and risks corrupting that very intervention, turning American strength into weakness. For America, 5GW in Africa is a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you- don't proposition. There are no easy answers to Africa's worsening crises, and there is no consensus on how, or whether, the United States should intervene.",

Persistent political and humanitarian crises, and a disastrous early US intervention, gave rise to seething and spreading anti-Americanism, escalating economic warfare by way of sea piracy and a campaign of secretive US intervention whose benefits, and costs, are unclear. The conditions were ripe for exploitation by a subtle actor aiming to overturn US designs for Somalia. Washington fought to keep Islamists out of Somalia, in the interest of preventing terrorists from taking root in the country. But the Islamists hijacked muddled US efforts and strengthened their cause. After years of fighting that left hundreds of thousands dead, in February 2009 Islamists took advantage of the escalating chaos, and growing frustration in Washington, to reassert control of the country, essentially inflicting an indirect battlefield defeat on America.\n\nIn 2009, thousands of Somali pirates employed by sophisticated criminal enterprises threaten some two million square miles of ocean, including all of the Gulf of Aden and vast swaths of the Indian Ocean. In 2008 pirates seized more than 40 large vessels headed to and from the Suez Canal, ransoming them for an average price of more than $1 million. With access to GPS, satellite phones, and commercial satellite imagery—not to mention small arms and rockets readily available across Africa—pirates have managed to capture large cargo ships and even supertankers. Pirates' surprising success has had the effect of driving up insurance rates for shippers and forcing some companies to abandon the Suez Canal route between Europe and Asia, in turn raising consumer prices at a time when most consumers have less to spend. Around 20 warships from a dozen navies have deployed to combat piracy, but they can only hope to mitigate the threat.  Ending piracy requires law and order and a measure of prosperity on land, at the source of the problem. Fundamentally, Somali pirates are aggrieved fishermen whose livelihoods suffered from Somalia's collapse in 1991. In the absence of any Somali authority, foreign countries were fishing in their international waters, stealing their fish.  Piracy \"is beyond a military solution.\" Pirates' continued success demonstrates the power of the individual and the impotence of old-fashioned military force in this age of powerful, accessible consumer technology. A few thousand plugged-in pirates have rendered ineffective the combined might of the world's navies, and undermined the notion that the traditional state can protect its interests with displays of force.  Pirates have no clear or stated political aims. Their intent is only to get rich, but their effect is to rattle the very foundation of the state. In this way, pirates are a 5G threat. Somalia's Islamists are the subtle third-party actors benefiting from the havoc pirates wreak. For Islamists seeking to rewrite the global order, one country at a time, piracy might represent a form of economic warfare. Ironically, Islamists and pirates are, ultimately, incompatible. Sharia law comes down hard on bandits on land and sea. An established Islamic order has no place for pirates. But Islamist still in the phase of sowing chaos, from which their new order might eventually emerge, might find pirates a useful, temporary, proxy weapon.",

    "text": "Somali piracy wasn't inevitable. It's the result of a tragic chain of events playing out over 20 hard years for the East African nation. US intervention represents several key links in that chain.  This hijacking of US designs is characteristically 5G.  The deceptive allure of both massive action and total inaction—was an open invitation to 5G hijacking. Confusion is one of the 5G fighter's favorite conditions, for it chips away at the perception that the current world order actually works.\nWhen civil war toppled dictator Siad Barre's regime in 1991, clans began fighting for dominance in Somalia. The fighting disrupted food distribution and threatened millions with starvation. It was this dark prospect that prompted the first major US military-humanitarian intervention of the post-Cold War era. In 1992, US Marines launched a three-year peacekeeping operation, coordinated with the UN. Operation Restore Hope helped end the starvation crisis, but this success was overshadowed by the deaths of 18 US troops. The American deaths led to a rapid end to the US and UN intervention. What followed was a decade during which Somalia was almost entirely on its own, ungoverned, hungry and ignored. It was during this decade of isolation and neglect that Somalis got into the piracy business in a big way.  In the absence of a widely accepted Somali government, an effective international peacekeeping force or substantial economic assistance, piracy quickly evolved into Mafia-style organized crime. Somalia's isolation and neglect also proved a perfect breeding ground for militant Islamists. Promising peace, rallying desperate thousands around the banner of anti-Westernism, Somali Islamists emerged in the early 2000s and quickly organized across clan lines. The Islamists' rapid spread began to pull together Somalia's fractured landscape of warlord enclaves.  The prospect of an Islamified Somalia terrified Washington, even more than pirates did, at first.",

    "text": "The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, awoke the United States to the dangers posed by militant Islamists—especially those based in ungoverned spaces. Suddenly Washington thought it could no longer ignore Somalia. In October 2002, a force of 800 US Marines landed in Djibouti, north of Somalia. The resulting \"Joint Task Force Horn of Africa\" grew to 2,000 people. Gunships and drones launched several air raids on suspected Al Qaeda enclaves inside Somalia. But the air strikes didn't stem the \"Islamification\" of Somalia or the spread of piracy. In fact, American attacks may very well have accelerated both processes, by fueling Somali suspicion of the Christian West and boosting popular support for the Islamists and pirates.  In 2006, an alliance of Islamists calling itself the Islamic Courts Union defeated Somalia's entrenched warlords and gained control of Mogadishu. They imposed a moderate form of Sharia law, suppressed banditry and opened up Somalia to foreign investment.  In Mogadishu, residents bristled under the harsher aspects of Sharia, but welcomed the law and order the Courts enforced. Piracy waned during the Courts' rule. But the US State Department had branded the Courts' armed wing, Al Shabab, a terrorist organization, so Washington never accepted the Courts as Somalia's legitimate government. Washington, the UN, the African Union, and Ethiopia all backed the unpopular, clan-based \"Transitional Federal Government\" (TFG). In 2006, Ethiopia launched an invasion of Somalia, with Washington providing key support. In a matter of weeks, the Courts had been routed. Al Shabab melted into the countryside. Soon, Al Shabab would reemerge to challenge the occupying Ethiopian troops, turning the Somalia conflict into an insurgency. What followed was two years of urban bloodshed, punctuated by periodic US air strikes. By 2007, Mogadishu residents seethed at the mere mention of America. Not coincidentally, it was the period of Ethiopian occupation in 2007 and 2008 that saw piracy escalate from a regional nuisance to a global economic threat.",

    "text": "By 2009, with tens of thousands dead on all sides, the Ethiopians had had enough. And with Somalia now threatening world trade, the US State Department had had enough, too. Where before, Washington had preferred anarchy to Islamic government for Somalia, now the State Department just wanted order—any order. Even if that meant the Islamists return. For Islamists, State's change of heart represented a subtle victory. The chaos unleashed first by the Somali civil war in 1991, and anew with the 2006 destruction of the Islamic Courts, had resulted in seemingly intractable economic warfare that seemed to have convinced Washington that maybe Islamists weren't so bad, after all. That's model 5GW. The Islamists had only to let the pirates do what pirates do best. The pirates, for their part, probably weren't even aware that they were helping the Islamists wage a winning war.\nThe Ethiopians' withdrawal in January sparked a dramatic sequence of events. The TFG fled to Djibouti, where the unpopular body promptly signed a peace deal with a coalition of moderate Islamic groups, then elected the former head of the Islamic Courts as the country's new president. President Shariff Sheikh Ahmed installed his new government in Mogadishu, restored Sharia, and began offering truces to holdout Islamists. Only Al Shabab resisted the olive branch, and the fighting finally subsided. As far as piracy is concerned, the return of Sharia law offers hope of a long-term solution. Sea banditry is incompatible with Islamists' obsession with lawfulness. If peace holds and Sheikh Ahmed's government lasts, pirates might finally face real justice in their own enclaves. But the price, for Washington, is the firm establishment of a government led by a man formerly associated with a \"terror group.\"",

    "section": "Somalia Strategy and 5GW",
    "text": "One reason for Washington's failures should be clear. America's Somalia strategy has been dominated by the military doing traditionally military things. This in a country, on a continent, in an era, where military force is often worse than ineffective. In Africa, in an age of 5GW, the only meaningful security is individuals' security, and that's a condition that's rarely improved by the imprecise application of massive firepower. To prevent 5GW, the US must prevent subtle actors from \"socializing their problem,\" to borrow Barnett's phrase. That means preventing the kinds of widespread desperation that makes individuals and populations vulnerable to exploitation by subtle actors. The unconscious collective actions of individuals seeking security—the mass movement of refugees, for instance, or spiraling tensions over food, water and firewood—are potentially more destructive, globally and in the long term, than most imaginable conventional military conflicts between African states. Desperation is the 5G actor's favorite state—for others. It's for those reasons that some military planners have begun to reconceptualize US national security as a facet of world security, which is itself anchored in human security. \"What we're going to see in the future is that security is not going to be based as much on state-centric models,\" said Major Shannon Beebe, the US Army's top intelligence officer for Africa. \"[Security] is not going to be based as much on state-versus-state type of engagement, but the insecurities and the conditions of human beings that create these insecurities across state borders.\" In other words, \"security\" no longer means detente between superpowers. In the age of instantaneous communications and empowered individuals, security is a person's freedom from fear, disease, and hunger. People who feel secure are peaceful, or so the thinking goes. By that line of reasoning, insecure people pose a threat to secure people, for the insecure might seek to destroy, with gestures big and small, the global systems that they believe have failed them. 5G actors wait in the wings to pick up the pieces, and rebuild the world according to their designs. Somali piracy, for one, \"is a typical case in which failed states and a poor representation of marginalized sectors of the population can become a threat to the security of others around the world,\" Gonzalo Peña, a Utah-based consultant with a humanitarian background. The 5G effect of that threat was to help change US policy to embrace the very people Washington had once branded an enemy. In some circles, that's called \"defeat.\"",

    "section": "Researching 5GW",
    "text": "What is to be done? 5GW UNDER THE MICROSCOPE (DANIEL H. ABBOTT) The excellent examples in this volume by Mark Safranski (5GW: Into the heart of darkness 2009), Brent Grace (The War for Robert Taylor 2009), and David Axe (Piracy, human security, and 5GW in Somalia 2009) demonstrate that despite its secretive nature, 5GW can be studied. The same research tools that are used by historians, sociologists, and journalists can be used to understand 5GW as well. This is fortunate, as the “academics, researchers, and analysts” (Abbott, The xGW Framework 2009) who most need to know about 5GW are also those most likely to need to study it on their own. The study of 5GW is not limited to the methods used to compose this handbook. Rather, the full spectrum of quantitative and qualitative methods can be used to investigate 5GW. Broadly, future research on 5GW will cluster in three broad categories. The first of these, qualitative research, is the tradition that has been embraced by the authors in this Handbook. The second category, quantitative research, will allow researchers to make accurate and precise predictions about how 5GWs will unfold. The third category, mixed methods research, is perhaps the most promising, and will allow analysts, researchers, and academics to gain a 360-degree understanding of 5GW. Qualitative research is a flexible tool that occurs in a natural setting, uses the researcher as a research tool, focuses on the meaning of the phenomenon, and relies on the perspectives of those who have experienced a phenomenon (Hatch 2001). Qualitative research can be narrative, which focuses on telling a story, a case study, or an examination of a group of participants united by a process, grounded theory, action research, in which the goal is to improve the world or win a battle, or some other type (Creswell, Hanson, et al. 2007). In qualitative research, a sample is recruited based on some characteristic, such as being typical of the population, representing the extremes of the population, knowing each other, or so on (J. Creswell 2008). The examples of 5GW in this volume are exemplars of how qualitative research on 5GW should be conducted. Quantitative research, sometimes called confirmatory research, is focused on hard numbers. It is a scientific approach that is focused on conjectures and refutation, the process of developing and discarding ever more precise hypotheses (Popper 1963). Two broad traditions within quantitative research are correlational research and experimental research. Correlational research is concerned with identifying trends in real-world data, while experimental research artificially manipulates and environment to determine what behaviors will change as a result. Quantitative research can be used to study 5GW. For instance, 5GWs such as the ones described by Axe, Grace, and Safranski, could be studied, and variables of influence (the number of known combatants, the complexity of the operation, and so on) could be entered. This would be an example of correlational 5GW research, and is similar to ongoing research in political science. Alternatively, the reaction of highly trained individuals to 5GW-like assaults could be studied in a laboratory. The different reaction styles of lawyers and engineers, say, could be examined. This would be an example of experimental 5GW research. Quantitative data analysis could range from simple procedures, such as multiple regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA), to more complex procedures such as multivariate analysis and structural equation modeling (Tabachnick, Fidell and L.S. 2006). A new category of research is mixed methods research. In mixed methods research, quantitative and qualitative tools are used alongside each other to provide a better view of a phenomenon. The major types of mixed methods research—the triangulation design, the embedded design, the explanatory design, and the exploratory design—all mix quantitative and qualitative methods in different ways (Creswell and Plano Clark, Designing and conducting mixed methods research 2007). The advantage of mixed methods research is that quantitative and qualitative tools can be used to compensate for each other’s weaknesses with respect to a specific research question.",

    "text": "For instance, consider an analyst who wishes to study the relative weakness of the Chinese and American governments to a 5GW assault. One approach to studying this might be the triangulation design, where quantitative and qualitative results are analyzed with an eye to convergence. So, for instance, in a quantitative phase, an experimental treatment could be used to test the reaction of those with professional legal degrees (the typical background of American policymakers) and engineering degrees (the typical background of Chinese policymakers) to “subtle... [exploitation of] humanitarian, economic, and other crises to undermine the power and legitimacy of the industrial state” (Axe 2009) within the context of a strategic game. Simultaneously, a comparative case study of the reaction to America and Chinese to failed 5GWs could be used. At the end of the study, the results of the quantitative and qualitative inquiries could be contrasted to gain a better view of Chinese and American reactions to 5GW. 5GW is the fifth gradient of warfare (Herring, Searching for 5GW 2009). It is part of the same phenomenon of force and violence studied by Clausewitz and other military thinkers (Deichman 2009). Recently, Lexington Green (Green) lamented the theoretical emphasis of many 5GW writers, and wrote: But the clown show is not funny because (1) major, serious, dangerous threats are emerging, (2) they are novel and need to be understood so they can be dealt with, (3) accurate, clear assessments are at a premium, and (4) this current terminology is at the point that it is an obstacle not an aid to clear thinking and clear discussion. With Lexington Green, I share disappointment at the role that hype and popularity play in many discussions of the nature of war. This is one reason I am editing this volume. I also share with Lexington the belief that “major, serious, dangerous threats are emerging,” that “they are novel and need to be understood so they can be dealt with,” and “accurate, clear assessments are at a premium.” While the terminology of 5GW may have been confused when Lexington wrote his comment, the purpose of this Handbook is to clear that confusion. Clear thinking and clear discussion–by academics, analysts, historians, policymakers, and warfighters—is needed. Better thinking and better discussion will come from better research. The examples provided by Brent Grace, Mark Safranski, and David Axe, as well as the theoretical context provided by other chapters in this volume, are an invaluable start for this research. But more is left to be done. The first 5GW was fought and lost before the dawn of time. Without research, the lessons of how to avoid defeat, protect our treasure, and save lives will be relearned and re-forgotten with every new generation of warfighters and policy makers. We owe our country better than that. We owe our world better than that.",

The contributions of these thinkers to the study of 5GW are immense, and no discourse can ignore their contributions entirely. However, many writers have contributed to our understanding of 5GW in the last five years. Indeed, the greatest part of this discourse--—the xGW framework--—is often left out entirely by analysts who begin only with Lind and Hammes. Therefore, many 5GW articles that are referenced by writers in this volume are attached in the following section. The order of these articles is roughly chronological, beginning with Mark Safranski’s reaction to Lind’s first use of the term 5GW, and continuing through Younghusband’s outline of the xGW framework.",

    "section": "Unto the Fifth Generation of War",
    "text": "UNTO THE FITH GENERATION OF WAR (MARK SAFRANSKI) Originally published July 18, 2005:[2] “[E]ach new generation required developments across the spectrum of society. Technological change alone has never been sufficient to produce a major change in how man wages war. It requires a complete societal change-- —political, economic social and technological--—to create the conditions necessary for major changes in war.” (Hammes 2004) William Lind, one of the fathers of 4GW theory, has welcomed, yet cautioned against, attempts to ascertain with too much precision any outlines of a 5th Generation Warfare that might be evolving within the dynamic of 4GW conflicts we see in Iraq, Afghanistan and in transnational terrorism. Yet according to theorists and practitioners of 4GW like Colonel Hammes, that form of warfare, although just now coming in to its own. has already been present for some seventy years! Undoubtedly then 5GW is also here with us, waiting for the next Mao or Rommel to fit the disparate puzzle pieces into a coherent pattern. 4GW advocates disdain an overemphasis on particular technological breakthrough, criticizing in particular the Network- centric Warfare theory developed by Admiral Arthur Cebrowski. Or at least the celebration of high-tech warfare capabilities by some of Cebrowski’s followers in the Pentagon (for a critique of both schools shaping of current policy, see ”The Pentagon’s Internal war Over what Iraq Means” by Dr. [Thomas P.M.] Barnett). Therefore, I will generally accept some major premises of 4GW theory as articulated by Hammes in speculating about the parameters of 5GW, specifically: 1. Generational changes in warfare require complete societal change. 2. Practitioners of warfare drove the evolution of warfare by seeking solutions to practical problems 3. Each succeeding generation reaches deeper in to enemy territory to defeat him. The first question we should ask are what changes are driving society, nationally and globally? Very briefly at the planetary level we have Globalization--—an acceleration of the rate and degree of complexity of all forms of exchange (in PNM theory Barnett’s “Four Flows“); Post-Westphalianization--—the rise of International, Transnational, Subnational and NonstateNon-state Actor challengers to the sovereign primacy of the Nation-State; and finally, State- Failure or severe State dysfunction where the ability of a State to constrain and police anarchic, nihilistic and disconnective forces is overwhelmed by post-Westphalian challengers, economic collapse and natural disasters. Additionally, in the scientific and economic realm, the drivers of future societal changes in the next twenty to fifty years would most likely come from the following fields--—Artificial Intelligence, Genomics, Alternative Fuels, Quantum Computing, Human Brain Research, Complexity and Chaos Theory, Nanotechnology and String Theory. It is impossible to assume the implications of any one of these fields over such a long timeline, much less all these fields in combination but what is a safe assumption is that the magnitude of changes that are coming will be very significant and result in substantial economic, social and political transformations. In sum the global trends I have listed have in my view some fairly direct logical implications for warfare, already visible even today: Superempowerment: The range of effect for each individual soldier (or terrorist) will be vastly increased even as the economic costs are driven down by market forces and proliferation of dual-use technology to the civilian consumer.

    "text": "Adaptable in a Darwinian sense. Multidimensional Battlespace: War occurs in the context of everything else--physical space, cyberspace, the logosphere, financial, legal and societal networks--shaping the battlespace itself to the disadvantage of actual and potential opponents will become crucial aspects of strategy and not merely moving more effectively within it. Autonomous Surrogates: Active regular military forces are seconded by a variety of substitutes to carry some aspect of the warfighting load--PMC’s, NGO’s, Paramilitary and Subnational networks, International Peacekeeping missions and increasingly, robotic agents. Today’s Predator drones and other prototype UAV are going to evolve and inevitably merge with AI technology so that we will have, shades of science fiction, autonomous war machines that will have basic programming but also the capacity to learn, make independent decisions, cooperate with one another and adapt to changing circumstances on the battlefield. These however are simply aspects of the emerging warfare and not the strategic purpose behind such a shift that make one generation of warfare different from its predecessor. The rise of 5GW will represent the solution to defeating 4GW forces in the field and here we come to a very troubling moral possibility. 4GW forces like Al Qaeda erase the distinction between Combatant and non-combatant and target an enemy’s will to resist, often moving submerged within society itself as a clandestine network structure. Such forces have proven exceptionally difficult to defeat for traditional militaries. 4GW strategy has allowed inferior forces to defeat even the superpowers (Hammes 2004). A strong possibility exists that given successive generations of warfare tend to drive ”deeper” into enemy territory, that 5GW will mean systemic liquidation of enemy networks and their sympathizers, essentially a total war on a society or subsection of a society. There is no where ”deeper” for 5GW to go but here. At the high tech end 5GW would be precisely targeted to winnow out ”the bad guys” in a souped-up version of Operation Phoenix but at the low-tech end we could see campaigns that would be indiscriminate, democidally-oriented death squad campaigns that shred 4GW networks by the same actuarially merciless logic that led the Allies to firebomb German and Japanese cities in WWII. This is a terrible prospect but there is evidence that 5GW tactics of this kind have defeated 4GW Communist revolution in Guatemala and El Salvador, stymied FARC and ELN in Colombia, beat back Islamists in Algeria and the Kurdish PKK in Turkey. Contravening data would include the Hutu militia genocide in Rwanda designed to eviscerate the ethnic supporters of the Tutsi rebels but instead led to the rebels toppling the Hutu regime and spreading disorder to neighboring states. My efforts here to outline 5GW are purely speculative. A second potential form of 5GW might be a “System Administration” based Global Transaction Strategy to export security and connectivity to the Gap, short-circuiting the political appeal of 4GW movements before they grow out of all control, along the lines of (Barnett, The Pentagon",

    "text": "uit of the state in war. Likewise, consider that the fourth generation of modern war (4GW), based on ideological coherency, is the strong-suit of the insurgent in war. From this we can place the third generation of modern war (3GW), based on mobility, in between the state’s and the insurgent’s spheres of influence. And this makes sense. In Patterns of Conflict, John Boyd described maneuver warfare as “blitz/guerrilla.” There are two remaining generations of modern war, and both fall outside the realms of the state and non-state. The first generation (1GW), built on total mobilization, was designed for states able to conscript a large fraction of the male population but unable to communicate effectively enough to effectively combine firepower. Thus we place 1GW to the left of 2GW, as belonging to an actor which we would describe as a state . . .almost. Likewise, place the fifth generation of modern warfare (5GW) to the right of 4GW. 5GW is the domain of non-states ... almost. When a 5GW is used by a state, it’s actually the province of a “state within” that acts as an internal insurgency. The Military-Industrial-Complex devised by President Truman is the work of such a 5GW conspiracy- within-the-state.\n\nEarlier I argued that war is evolving “deeper into the Observe- Orient-Decide-Act loop. I also argued: If traditional war centered on an enemy’s physical strength, and 4GW on his moral strength, the 5th Generation of War would focus on his intellectual strength. A 5th Generation War might be fought with one side not knowing who it is fighting. Or even, a brilliantly executed 5GW might involve one side being completely ignorant that there ever was a war. It’s like the old question of what was the perfect robbery: we will never know, because in a perfect robbery the bank would not know that it was robbed. I kept trying to imagine what this would look like.  Fortunately, I got in communication with a genius who helped me understand that the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act look might be better pictured. The original analysis is still valid. Just now it is clear that most actions are not decided upon. They are implicitly guided and controlled by orientation, based on our observations. Then a comment hit me like a hammer:\nWe all have a tendency to some degree to run on a mental ” autopilot”--— whether you want to call this phenomena ”framing”, worldview, paradigms, schemas, ideological constructs, etc.--—the precise meaning vary but the effect is to shape our perceptions of the world (highlighting or omitting data) and to an extent predetermine our responses in a large picture sense. Ideological blinders concentrate our vision but they distort our view of reality. . . . A critical skill is to be able to periodically attempt to step outside one’s worldview and look at an event from multiple perspectives other than one’s own. You have become a strategic thinker when you know *when* to do this as well as *how*.\nNow it’s clear exactly what If traditional war centered on an enemy’s physical strength, and 4GW on his moral strength, the 5th Generation of War would focus on his intellectual strength means.",

The idea of fast transients suggests that to win, we should operate at a faster tempo than our adversaries—or better yet, get inside their OODA loop.  Even better, arrange the enemy’s OODA loop so their thoughts never flow into orient-decide-act relative to you, your plan, or your organization. Diminish their capacity for independent action, deny them the opportunity to survive on their own terms, or make it impossible for them to survive at all. In limited 5GWs, removing the enemy’s “capacity for independent action” is the goal. The fighter tries to entangle the enemy in obligations that reharmonize them without their knowledge of “conditional surrender.” Fire and movement, like cheng/ch’i or Nebenpunkte/Schwerpunkt, tie-up, divert, or drain adversary attention and strength to expose, menace, and exploit vulnerabilities elsewhere. In a successful 5GW, the enemy’s attention is misdirected from ever attaining focus. Create tangles of threatening and/or non-threatening events/efforts and repeatedly generate mismatches between those the adversary observes (cheng/Nebenpunkte) and those they must react to (ch’i/Schwerpunkt).

They create two shadow organizations: Islamophiles and Islamaphobes. These groups, while genuinely pursuing their stated goals, ultimately serve the Nativists' purpose. Both publicly support the US Government. The Islamophobes provoke and antagonize the Arab Muslim population, agitating for their removal or internment and escalating to political assassinations and attacks. The Islamophiles defend Arab Muslim civil rights, maintain communication networks, and create “self-defense” networks, increasing militancy and facilitating physical communication with the Arab world. They also stage “phony” attacks on each other.  A spectacular terrorist attack then occurs.  The details are irrelevant, but a consequence will be increased border security.

Shaping the environment influences emerging memes.  Controlling space is a powerful message. There’s a disconnect between the concrete and abstract.  The US wants Iraqis to see safety and act for a better Iraq, but these are abstract messages.  Iraqis see safety as contingent on the US presence. They see the US role in shaping Iraq. In 5GW terms, this isn’t “gaining hands in the field” but creating a field we control. We’re telling Iraqi leaders to be our proxies, openly. We’re telling all Iraqis we want a stable, pro-US Iraq and will stay until we get it.  We should either annex Iraq or leave it (the latter isn’t a real option, though a 5GW approach could create that illusion).",

    "text": "Originally published June 10, 2007, at: http://dreaming5gw.com/2007/06/on_the_barnettian_5gw.php\n\nI’m bumping up a comment I left in another thread: And this is where 5GW on a grand scale may diverge from the current Robb/Hammes approach, which emphasizes one superempowered individual as opposed to generating empowerment across an entire society. (Steve 2007) I responded as follows: Yes. I once included a consideration of the two types of superempowerment when contrasting Barnett with Robb. It would seem that Barnett’s approach (which we at D5GW have often labeled “5GWish”) requires the general superempowerment of individuals across the spectrum, as an antidote to the Robbian one-man-killing-crew. With regard to some recent considerations on the idea of kinetics, this means creating more routes for the channeling of powers, not only as a distracting maneuver (“jobs” vs “guns”) but also as a method of equalizing the kinetics across the system, or forcing kinetics into indirection. It is a kind of perpetual, systemic, mass deflection. (Weeks, Steve 2007) Superempowerment The post I linked in that comment (Weeks, Global Guerillas as 5GW Warriors 2006) included 5 keys I used for unlocking the door to the future of Global Guerrillas (Robb, THE CHANGING FACE OF WAR: Into the 5th Generation (5GW) 2006). One of those keys: Superempowerment of the Individual. There is a term used variously and vaguely in these discussions; I myself conflated two interpretations of the term. The Robbian view seems to depend on unequal distribution of powerment, in which some individuals or groups become more powerful than the general human population; whereas, at heart the Core/Gap paradigm (Barnett, The Pentagon's new map: War and peace in the 21st century 2004) and strategy seem to depend upon an eventual equalization, or a relative equalization (which is a type of oxymoronic phrase), of individual empowerment across the globe. Nonetheless, in my characterization of the two ideas in the older post, I conflated these concepts of empowerment under one heading: superempowerment. One supposes a kind of monopoly on greater powers; the other, a general but increased power for each and all. The term and the old conflation remind me of the kid superhero Dash (Bird 2004). On the way home after being sent to the principal’s office, Dash complains that he is never able to use his natural powers. Dash’s mom tries to explain how everyone is special in some way, not just those with superhuman powers, to which, Dash responds that, if everyone is special then no one is. (This startling intellection was a pleasant surprise early in the movie, followed by others later.) Should superempowerment also follow such a rule? In fact, upon infecting the human mind, the idea of superempowerment seems to follow that rule; so we see actors on the global stage trying to be special. Can the rule be broken? We also see a split in types of empowerment, between the Barnettian and the Robbian paradigms. If superempowerment is to be conflated: The Robbian view of superempowerment hinges upon the ability to cause concrete damages via technology--—whatever the level of technology. The Barnettian view of the term would assume an economic empowerment via which those in the Gap are first brought up to the level of individual economic empowerment seen in the Core, and then all upon the globe continue to experience an increase in economic empowerment. For the Barnettian view, we should not equate economic empowerment only with the size of the personal bank account, but with the ability to secure resources, or personal property, necessary for individual happiness or at least contentment.",

    "text": "Also, if we conflate these superempowerments, we should make the distinction which then arises concerning the prefix super-. In John Robb’s world, the prefix stands for present inequalities among individuals and groups, but in Thomas Barnett’s strategic vision, the term would need to be understood as designating an inequality between the past and present/future. In the Robbian world, some people are already super in relation to others currently existing; indeed, in the future he sees, this disparity would also continue and even increase. In the Barnettian vision, the present or, more likely the future peoples will be super in relation to those living in the past (their own past selves or their ancestors or both). I know that Thomas Barnett is aware of the term superempowerment, and that, as with most who discuss these things, he tends to use it in the sense John Robb would give the term. But I’m playing with the term. Barnettism vs. Robbism From being a bystander in the various Robb vs. Barnett debates (not only between the two principal actors, but also between their supporters and even between the subjects they study when forming their theories), I have developed the sense that the Robbian view is dichotomous and vaguely Manichean. If the Barnettian globalization proceeds and everyone is made special, no one will be special; if the Barnettian globalization ever settles over the world, then the general equalization of means must translate into extraordinary weakening for all individuals. The two theorists aside, this either/or style of viewing is probably what motivates the putative Global Guerrillas and other anti-globalists to act. My own criticisms of GG theory and Robb (Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of Globalization 2007)—-one of which both Armstrong (Book Review: Brave New War 2007) and Abbott (Brave New War, Aftermath: Mountainrunner's Review 2007) have recently highlighted--—hinge upon the utter insolvency of the dichotomy which stands like an overstuffed though unobserved elephant in the center of that room. To the degree that these anti- globalists seek to become special, they must more and more resemble the nation-states who have already achieved that feat. Put another way: as they try to develop their own monopolies on power in response to the perception that a general deflection of kinetic powers will weaken them, they will be creating exactly the same sort of structures they would weaken! Inequalities and disparities galore. A house divided. I have not forgotten the title of this post. In a previous cursory examination of divergent theories of 5GW (Weeks, Empires of the Mind 2007), I noted that Barnett seems to have a theory much like that theory often propounded here on D5GW, but that his vision assumes that nation-states and corporations can initiate the 5GW-- —and do so openly. This approach is characterized as being top- down by the Robbian crew, occasionally derided as such. Given many of the preceding paragraphs, I wonder if the Robbian crew is correct. The Barnettian Paradox Steve, in commenting on the thread about Iraq, put forth the paradox: WRT Iraq, yes, our specter prevents Iraqis from assuming responsibility. It is an ironic paradox of state/nation building that cannot be avoided: how do we get indigenous groups to act on their own when we try to do everything for them? It is this transition that we still cannot manage, maybe because we have yet to find pols on the ground who have the resources to act independently. (Steve 2007) —to which, I responded: This consideration is itself paradoxical. I.e., our foes are the “pols on the ground” who seem quite capable of finding the resources to act independently of us. (Weeks, Steve 2007) This is the Barnettian paradox: To the degree that nation-states and corporations continue to exercise conglomerate powers when initiating conflict, they will be the special ones. The ideal equalization cannot occur globally, and even the oxymoronic relative equalization cannot occur. So long as small groups or indeed individuals remain at the head of nation-states and corporations, those individuals will always wield greater powers with respect to everyone else within the system--—they are the superempowered actors. (Albeit, given the distinction I have already drawn, their power may be economic more than anything else if Barnett’s vision comes to fruition.) Even despite the fact that Barnett’s superempowered actors are few but actual, the impression that they exist in the first place creates cognitive conflict. We see the distinct case in Iraq and with the go-it- alone nation-state; but we may also infer this cognitive conflict in the growing distrust for some corporations, such as those in the military- industrial complex, pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies (viz. Katrina), and the oil industry. (For an American Rightist list, just substitute the MSM and Hollywood.) The resolution to the Barnettian paradox is not something Barnett himself has offered: a true 5GW approach. Although he speaks in the language of co-optation, he uses the term when addressing international relations; e.g., that Iran can be co-opted. Barnett does not descend to the street level although he does support improving the lives of the persons on the street; he has yet to formulate a clear plan for co-opting the many individuals of which nations and corporations are comprised. For the most part, he seems to assume that nation-states and corporations, if they only do the right things, will be received as benevolent dictators--—or, scratch that term, as benevolent superempowered entities. He may be half right. Many people seek saviors of one sort or another; many are happy to delegate responsibility for the things they themselves cannot touch or do not have the time or motivation to fix themselves--—or do not understand, themselves. The crux of the Barnettian paradox involves the manner and method of assigning these delegations so that the general man-on-the-street can rest easily knowing his prosperous future is assured. Even within the Core, much doubt about this process of delegation exists; various superempowerments within and without the Core threaten to upset faith in the systems of the Core. For his theory of 5GW, Barnett needs to reduce the footprint of his preferred superempowered entities, and this will require a re-think about how they operate--—in fact, perhaps also about who they are.",

    "section": "TOWARDS A GENERAL XGW FRAMEWORK (FRANCIS EDWARD YOUNGHUSBAND)",
    "text": "Originally published January 6, 2009, at: http://cominganarchy.com/2009/01/06/towardss-a-general-xgw-framework/\n\nxGW theory has been under scrutiny in the Twitterverse, and by the usual suspects. Although xGW theory has seemed to progress in the past few years it is still a solution for a problem that we cannot seem to figure out. I have even asked, what use is xGW? Selil offers his drawing skills to find a unified generational warfare theorem (Liles 2009). His visualizations are very inspiring--—so, in fact, that they motivated me to think about my own diagrammatical solution to the xGW problem. Liles (2009) raises the usual problem with generational warfare theory: chronology. Abbott (The Terminology of xGW 2009) addressed this by suggesting the “G” from xGW be revised from “generation” to “grade” to deemphasize the dependence on time. I suggested returning to Boyd’s original categories that served as the basis of 4GW theory and are time independent. However, that precludes any relationship between the different grades of warfare. That is a core problem of xGW: what is the relationship between the various grades (if a relationship exists at all)? It seems to me that Liles is trying to solve this problem with his pretty pictures. I also have tried to capture this problem in a series of diagrams I present to you below. Be forewarned: these diagrams represent the problem with xGW theory, not the solution. They may be a step towards the framework that makes xGW useful, a goal that Liles and I--—among others--—find worthy. My hypothetical diagrammatical framework aims to help us think not only about what direction we should take the debate, but also the types of insights such a framework could offer. This hypothetical framework is centered upon relationships, specifically the overlaps between the various grades of warfare. Below I will present a number of examples. I offer no real-world examples to warrant my selections of the categories, and there are numerous unstated assumptions in the models. This is purely an intellectual exercise meant to engender more discussion. Example 1: take grades 1 through 4 and assume they have an equal and overlapping relationship. The result reveals four (a, b, c, d) transitional types of war. Question: could the variously defined",

Example 2 shows a much tighter Venn diagram resulting in a much more complex set of relationships: beta, mu, omega, delta and the elusive apeiron, the singularity of conflict. Assuming one could devise a set of stringent rules of demarcation, data could be gathered about specific conflicts, diagrammed and compared. Diagrams could be analyzed for patterns useful in decision-making. Example 3 uses Boydian categories of conflict (Attrition Warfare, Maneuver Conflict, Moral Conflict) rather than the 1 to 4 generations in fashion recently. Here we have four sub-categories of conflict: beta, mu, delta and infinity. To add another layer of complexity, we could include the spectrum of conflict--—from high intensity conflict (HIC) to low intensity conflict (LIC). Each of the grade circles could be gradients of the spectrum (from dark to light). In the example below the darker shades would represent HIC while lighter shades represent LIC. This hypothetical diagram would cause us to ask the question: Are the overlapping “sub”-grades of conflict compatible with HIC? It seems only the three major types of conflict reach to the outer boundaries. That would be an interesting insight. All said and done, this is simply speculative blue-sky engineering to get people to think about the relationships between the various grades of war. A general (and unified) framework is still needed to guide discussion of xGW, even if a use for it has yet to be discovered.",

Therefore, two final resources are now presented. First, Curtis Gale Weeks’s 5GW Theory Timeline is reproduced in text form. While the associated web site provides greater depth and metadata that will be of interest to historians of 5GW, the version that follows complements the Source Documents of the proceeding section. Finally, a comprehensive reference list of this volume is included. This reference list captures the universe of discourse that has encouraged the emergence of the xGW framework, and can be a guide for analysts who wish to build a library relevant for understanding 5GW and the xGW framework. THE 5GW TIMELINE (CURTIS GALE WEEKS) August 29, 2003: An apparent press release from OSS.net, through PRNewswire, in Windows .doc format, detailing need for fifth-generation tactics to create \"the necessary new national security paradigm,\" as described by Robert David Steele (Steele 2003).",

    "text": "February 3, 2004: William S. Lind, coauthor of \"The Changing Face of War: Into the Fourth Generation,\" which for the first time modeled modern warfare as a generational framework, and generally considered the \"father\" of the generational model, answers building speculation of a budding fifth generation style of warfare. In other words, the fourth generation of warfare has yet to fully materialize (or: has not been fully visualized, itself) (Lind, On War #53: Fifth Generation Warfare? 2004). September 12, 2004: The Sling and the Stone book, which primarily considers 4GW, mentions 5GW briefly in three places near the end (Hammes 2004): · First, by stating that innovative leadership training will be required \"not just to deal with the seventy-year-old phenomenon of 4GW but also to deal with 5GW as it evolves\" (pp. 274-275, paperback edition). · \"Only a highly flexible organization can hope to succeed in 4GW and still be prepared to deal with emerging 5GW,\" and \"We can continue to man 3GW organizations using an 1890s personnel system. . . .Or we can accept that 4GW has arrived and that 5GW is evolving and organize ourselves accordingly\" (p. 289, paperback edition). · \"Fourth-generation war has been around for more than seventy years; no doubt the fifth generation is evolving even as we attempt to deal with its predecessor. We may not recognize it as it evolves around us. Or we may look at several alternative futures and see each as fifth-generation war.\" The bio-attacks on Capitol Hill—anthrax in 2001in 2001 and ricin in 2004in 2004--—are considered a precursor of 5GW; Hammes emphasizes the superempowered destructive individual or small group as a viable, perhaps defining aspect of 5GW. He then reiterates his belief that the US should reorganize its military and societal capability for dealing with 4GW forces and 5GW forces that may evolve--—but does not suggest that America should develop 5GW force structures itself. I.e., 4GW and 5GW will characterize the opponent, not the US (pp. 290-291, paperback edition; last two pages of the book).",
