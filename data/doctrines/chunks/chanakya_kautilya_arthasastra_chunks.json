    "section": "Introductory Note",
    "text": "The Kautilya-Arthashastra, of which Mr. Shamasastry gives us here his translation, is a work of very exceptional interest and value. In the first place, it ascribes itself in plain terms to the famous Brahman Kautilya, also called Vishnugupta, and known from other sources by the patronymic Chanakya, who, tradition tells us, overthrew the last king of the Nanda dynasty, and placed the great Maurya Chandragupta on the throne: thus, the two verses with which the work ends state that it was written by Vishnugupta, who from intolerance of misrule rescued the scriptures, the science of weapons, and the earth which had passed to the Nanda kings and that he wrote it because he had seen many discrepancies on the part of previous commentators; and, in conformity with a common practice of Indian writers, the name Kautilya figures constantly through the book, especially in places where the author lays down his own views by differing from others which he cites. This work accordingly claims to date from the period 321-296 B.C.: and its archaic style is well in agreement with the claim.\n\nSecondly, as regards its nature and value. Kautilya is renowned, not only as a king-maker, but also for being the greatest Indian exponent of the art of government, the duties of kings, ministers, and officials, and the methods of diplomacy. That a work dealing with such matters was written by him is testified to by various other early Indian writers, who have given quotations from it. But the work itself remained hidden from modern eyes until it was found in the text of which the translation is laid before us here. The topic of this text is precisely that which has been indicated above, in all its branches, internal and foreign, civil, military, commercial, fiscal, judicial, and so on, including even tables of weights, measures of length, and divisions of time. And it seems to be agreed by competent judges that, though the existing text is, perhaps, not absolutely word for word that which was written by Kautilya, still we have essentially a work that he did compose in the period stated above. The value of it is unmistakable; it not only endorses and extends much of what we learn in some of its lines from the Greek writer Megasthenes, who, as is well known, spent a long time in India as the representative of the Syrian king, Seleucus I, at the Court of Chandragupta, but also fills out what we gather from the epics, from other early writings, and from the inscriptions, and explains statements and allusions in these last-mentioned sources of information which are otherwise obscure: in short, it throws quite a flood of light on many problems in the branch of Indian studies to which it belongs.\n\nFor our introduction to this work we are greatly indebted to Mr. Shamasastry. A manuscript of the text, and with it one of a commentary on a small part of it by a writer named Bhattasvamin was handed over by a Pandit of the Tanjore District to the Government Oriental Library. From these materials Mr. Shamasastry, who was then the Librarian of that Library, gave a tentative translation in the pages of the Indian Antiquary and elsewhere in 1905 and following years. By the enlightened encouragement of the Mysore Durbar, he was enabled to publish the text itself in 1909, as Vol. 37 of the Bibliotheca Sanskrita of Mysore. And, under the same appreciative patronage, he now lays before us a translation which has been improved in some details, in addition to being brought together in a connected and convenient form.",

    "section": "Preface",
    "text": "Little that is reliable is known of the author of the Arthashastra. He subscribes himself as Kautilya at the end of each of the hundred and fifty chapters of the work, and writes in a verse at its conclusion the overthrow of the Nanda dynasty as one of his exploits. Another name by which the author is known is Vishnugupta, and it is used only once by the author himself, in the concluding verse of the work. A third name by which he is designated by later writers is Chanakya.\n\nThat Kautilya overthrew the Nandas and placed Chandragupta on their throne, is also evident from the following passage of the Vishnu Purana (IV, 24): \"Mahapadma then his sons, only nine in number, will be lords of the earth for a hundred years. These Nandas Kautilya, a Brahman, will destroy. On their death, the Mauryas will enjoy the earth. Kautilya himself will install Chandragupta on their throne. His son will be Bindusara, and his son Asoka-vardhana.\"\n\nFrom Indian epigraphical researches it is known beyond doubt that Chandragupta was made king in 321 BC and that Asoka-vardhana ascended the throne in 269 BC. It follows, therefore, that Kautilya lived and wrote his famous work, the Arthashastra, somewhere between 321 and 300 BC. What Kalidasa has said about our author and his work in the introduction of Malavikagnimitra supports the same view. He says:\n\n\"During the second one-eighth part of the day to those quarreling with each other; during the third to bathe and dine; and during the fourth to receive gold. Until the food eaten has undergone digestion, the fear of poison never leaves him. During the second part he shall look to the affairs of both citizens and country people; during the third he shall not only bathe and dine, but also study; during the fourth he shall not only receive revenue in gold, but also attend to the appointment of superintendents. When the flame and smoke turn blue and crackle, the presence of poison shall be inferred.\"\n\nLikewise what Bana, the author of the Kadambari, says concerning the science of Kautilya seems to strengthen the authenticity of the work and the identification of Kautilya as the author of it. This is what he says (p. 100, Kadambari, Bombay Education Society Print): \"Is there anything that is righteous for those for whom the science of Kautilya, merciless in its precepts, rich in cruelty, is an authority; whose teachers are priests skilled in witchcraft; to whom ministers, always inclined to deceive others, are counselors; whose desire is always for the gold of wealth that has been carried away by thousands of kings; who are devoted to the application of destructive engines; and to whom brothers, affectionate with natural cordial love, are fit victims to be murdered?\"\n\nFurthermore, the author of the Panchatantra ascribes the authorship of the Arthashastra to Chanakya.",

Specific terminology, like “Prakrti” as an element of sovereignty (including enemies), suggests Kalidasa's reliance on Kautilya.  This usage appears in later texts like Manussmriti, indicating its post-Kautilyan origin.",

While Kautilya and Manusmriti use it broadly, including enemies as elements of sovereignty, earlier writers like Yajnavalkya seem to use it synonymously with \"anga,\" without the extended meaning.  This suggests Kautilya's innovation. Comparing Yajnavalkya's Yavaharakanda with the Arthasastra raises the question of influence, either way, or a common source. stylistic and phrasing differences are apparent, with Kautilya using sutra-style prose and sometimes obsolete terms, while Yajnavalkya employs verse with more modern language. Specific examples highlight these differences, such as Kautilya's \"akrliidraparinihatka\" versus Yajnavalkya's \"akr-liidra\" and \"apannsha.\"",

    "text": "While Kautaliya uses the word “Sapsthaviim-cyanu-yoga” in the technical sense of “the trial of a criminal on oath,” Yajnavalkya interprets and uses it in the modern sense of “an improper oath.” Again, while Kautilya uses the words “yukta,” “a government officer,” and “ayukta,” “one other than a government officer,” as used in the inscriptions of Asoka, Yajnavalkya translates them by the modern words “yogya” and “ayogya,” meaning “proper” and “improper,” and his commentator Vijnanesvara interprets them likewise. Also, while Kautilya makes accidental death due to surgical operation of a boil other than dangerous boils punishable, Yajnavalkya makes operation on boils in general a punishable offense. I presume that these points indicate a later time and place for Yajnavalkya than the time of Asoka.\n\nFurthermore, Kautilya does not seem to have been aware of the planets and the belief in their influence over the destinies of men and kings. In the concluding verses of IX, 1, he refers only to stars, condemning the frequent consultation of astral astrology (nakshatra) on the part of kings, and does not make even a remote reference to the use of the zodiac in measuring time. But Yajnavalkya makes a distinct reference to the planets (graha, I, Sloka 307) and asks the kings to worship them, since, in his opinion, their prosperity depends upon the planets. What still more strikingly proves the priority of the Arthashastra to the Smritis of Manu and Yajnavalkya, as now extant, is the marked difference between the states of societies presented in them. The state of society portrayed in the Arthashastra is in the main pre-Buddhistic, though Kautilya wrote long after the time of Buddha, while the Smritis depict the ideal of Hindu society as reconstructed and reformed consequent on its struggle for existence against the all-absorbing, but just then decadent, Buddhism. The Smritis allude to the previous existence of the state of society described by Kautilya, either by condemning some of its political, social and religious practices, or by discrediting the Arthashastra and other Smritis which authorized the practices characteristic of it.",

    "section": "Social and Political Practices in the Arthashastra Period",
    "text": "Owing partly to the influence of the highly moral and philosophical teachings of the Buddhists, and partly to the precepts of the Dharmashastra and the Vedanta of the reviving or reformed Brahmanism, several practices and customs previously existent seem to have gradually disappeared between the birth of Buddha and the close of the third or fourth century of the Christian era. The political practices which disappeared during this period appear to be the institution of espionage with its evil consequence, the vices of the harem life resulting in the cold-blooded murder of kings, princes, inmates and other high officers; the evils of the passport system; the taking of a census of men, women, children and beasts; the levy of several taxes, benevolences and special taxes to replenish empty treasuries; oppressive taxes on trade; the exaction of religious taxes and the robbing of temple money by imposing upon the credulity and superstition of the people; the confiscation of the property of the rich under the plea of embezzlement or of tiding over famine and other national calamities; the slaughter of beasts on a large scale for the supply of flesh to the people, including even the Brahmans; state-owned drinking saloons to supply liquor to men, women, and children of all castes; torture of criminals to elicit confession; deceitful treaties and treacherous battles; the evils wrought by spies in creating distrust between man and man and man and woman; and the use of destructive gases, medicines and poisons to murder people or to render them infirm either in war or in peace.\n\nThe social customs that fell out of practice seem to be divorce due to enmity between husband and wife; re-marriage of women whose husbands had long been absent abroad or had died; marriage of maidens at their own option after puberty; marriage of a Sudra-wife by a Brahman in addition to the three wives chosen from the upper castes; flesh-eating and drinking of liquor among Brahmans; and the embracing of the military profession by Brahmans. Among religious observances, the worship of Naisravana, Mahakachchha, and Sankarshana, and the practices of Atharvanic witchcraft and sorcery, seem to have been given up. These appear to be the practices and customs which Bana has succinctly condemned in the six pregnant sentences of his Kadambari quoted above.",

    "text": "A close coneidciMitiou of iheae and other reasons set forth by the learned scholars will ,-thow that instead of eatabiiahkng a later date to the Arthu-^tra they tend to involve it in considerable doubt. As nothing in positively known regarding tbo date of Kkinaudaka, the firfit reason m iy be left out of consideration.

The question of interpolation, in the absence of a positive evidence to prove it, is a matter of personal\nopinion. Regarding the age of the Kamasutra, there is no evidence to disprove that it was written about the commencement of the Andhra empire. As no celebrated Indian writer or reformer of antiquity has escaped from the fate of being represented in a supernatural garb, there is no reason why Kautilya should be classed among mythic personages while Panini, Patanjali, and a host of other writers and reformers whose lives are described in no less supernatural terms, pass for historical figures. There are no accepted data to assert that alchemy, metallurgy, and industries, as described in the Arthasastra, are the phenomena of the third century a.d. and not of the fourth century B.C. Whether the author was a southerner and changed his home to the north, and whether he was a pandit or statesman, are points which have nothing to do with the question at issue* Had there been a specimen, of the style of writing of Kautilya or of a statesman, this objection would have had some bearing on the ques¬ tion at issue. There does not appear any logical necessity to compel either the author of the Arthasastra to mention the names of Chandragupta, his capital and his companions, or the author of the Mahabhashya to speak of the Arthasastra and its author, much less of Buddha and Asoka. As to the question of Kautilya speaking of his own opinion in the third person, it is an ancient custom with Indian w riters to speak of themselves in the third persoit in their literary w’orks. Even Patanjali has followed this custom. While commenting on Pacini s satra, VII, 2, 101, he mentions his view by stating “ Gonardiya aha,” 44 Gonardiya says.” Again, w'hile commenting on the introductory verse of the Pari- bhashendusekhara, in which Nagesa, the author of the work, has used his own name in the third person, Bhairavamisra says in defence of the custom as follows: “ The prohibition that no one should use one’s own name in speaking of oneself or of one’s own view is not applicable here ; for that prohibition is applicable only to those cases in which a person xxvili K A Ufl LV±\\ S A P- i H ASAST KA iittompta to apeak q£ himself by using the name given to Kim hr bis father. 5 Her* Sagesa* like Gon&rdryt* iufid in the ‘fc Gonaritfyn djui/T in a YogarOdha word and not a hahu> given by bij father.

It is clear from this that the Arthasastra is a work of the age when a masha equalling one-sixteenth of a karshapana was current, and that during the time of Pataljali, a masha did not mean one-sixteenth of a karshapana, but something else. The other thing it meant was probably one-twentieth of a karshapana, as stated in the Katyayana-Smriti.

Hence he shall employ as ministers those who have proved faithful to him under difficulties fatal to life and are of tried devotion.’ ‘No,’ says Pisuna, ‘for this is devotion, but not intelligence. He shall appoint as ministers those who, when employed on financial matters, show as much as, or more than, the fixed revenue, and are thus of tried ability.’ ‘No,’ says Kautilya, ‘for such persons are devoid of other ministerial qualifications; he shall, therefore, employ as ministers those whose fathers and grandfathers had been ministers before, such persons, in virtue of their knowledge of past events and of an established relationship with the king, will, though offended, never desert him; for such faithful news is seen even among dumb animals; cows, for example, stand aside from strange cows and ever keep company with accustomed herds.’ ‘No,’ says Vatavyadhi, ‘for such persons, having acquired complete dominion over the king begin to play themselves as the king. Hence he shall employ as ministers such new persons as are proficient in the science of polity. It is such new persons who will regard the king as the real Sceptre-Wielder and dare not offend him.’ ‘No,’ says the son of Bahudanti, ‘for a man possessed of only theoretical knowledge, and having no experience of practical politics, is likely to commit serious blunders when engaged in actual works. Hence he shall employ as ministers such as are born of high family and possessed of wisdom, purity of purpose, bravery and loyal feelings, inasmuch as ministerial appointments shall purely depend on qualifications.’ ‘This,’ says Kautilya, ‘is satisfactory in all respects; for a man's ability is inferred from his capacity shown in work. And in accordance with the difference in the working capacity. Having divided the spheres of their powers and having definitely taken into consideration the place and time where and when they have to work, such persons shall be employed not as councillors, but as ministerial officers.’",

Such as are possessed of one-half or one-quarter of the above qualifications come under middle and low ranks. Of these qualifications, native birth and influential position shall be ascertained from reliable persons; educational qualifications from professors of equal learning; theoretical and practical knowledge, foresight, retentive memory, and affability shall be tested from successful application in works; eloquence, skilfulness and flashing intelligence from power shown in narrating stories (i.e., in conversation); endurance, enthusiasm, and bravery in troubles; purity of life, friendly disposition, and loyal devotion by frequent association; conduct, strength, health, dignity, and freedom from indolence and ficklemindedness shall be ascertained from their intimate friends; and affectionate and philanthropic nature by personal experience. The works of a king may be visible, invisible, and inferential. That which he sees is visible; and that which he is taught by another is invisible; and inference of the nature of what is not accomplished from what is accomplished is inferential. As works do not happen to be simultaneous, are various in form, and pertain to distant and different localities, the king shall, in view of being abreast of time and place, depute his ministers to carry them out. Such is the work of ministers. Him whose family and character are highly spoken of, who is well educated in the Vedas and the six Angas, is skilful in reading portents, providential or accidental, is well versed in the science of government, and who is obedient and who can prevent calamities, providential or human, by performing such expiatory rites as are prescribed in the Atharvaveda, the king shall employ as high priest. As a student his teacher, a son his father, and a servant his master the king shall follow him. That Kshatriya breed which is brought up by Brahmans, is charmed with the counsels of good councillors, and which faithfully follows the precepts of the Fastras, becomes invincible and attains success though unaided with weapons.",

All the ascetics (under the recluse) shall severally send their followers on similar errands. A cultivator, fallen from his profession, but possessed of foresight and pure character, is termed a householder spy. This spy shall carry on the cultivation of lands allotted to him for the purpose, and maintain cultivators, etc. A trader, fallen from his profession, but possessed of foresight and pure character, is a merchant spy. This spy shall carry on the manufacture of merchandise on lands allotted to him for the purpose. A man with shaved head or braided hair and desirous to earn livelihood is a spy under the guise of an ascetic practising austerities. Such a spy surrounded by a host of disciples with shaved head or braided hair may take his abode in the suburbs of a city, and pretend as a person barely living on a handful of vegetables or meadow grass taken once in the interval of a month or two, but he may take in secret his favourite foodstuffs. Merchant spies pretending to be his disciples may worship him as one possessed of preternatural powers. His other disciples may widely proclaim that 'this ascetic is an accomplished expert of preternatural powers.' Regarding those persons who, desirous of knowing their future, throng to him, he may, through palmistry, foretell such future events as he can ascertain by the nods and signs of his disciples concerning the works of highborn people of the country—viz. small profits, destruction by fire, fear from robbers, the execution of the seditious, rewards for the good, forecast of foreign affairs, saying, 'This will happen today, that tomorrow, and that this king will do.' Such assertions of the ascetic his disciples shall corroborate. He shall also foretell not only the rewards which persons possessed of foresight, eloquence, and bravery are likely to receive at the hands of the king, but also probable changes in the appointments of ministers. The king's minister shall direct his affairs in conformity to the forecast made by the ascetic. He shall appease with offer of wealth and honour those who have had some well-known cause to be disaffected, and impose punishments in secret on those who are for no reason disaffected or who are plotting against the king. Honoured by the king with awards of money and titles, these five institutes of espionage shall ascertain the purity of character of the king’s servants.",

Those who are deluded with false promise of large rewards; those of whom one party, though equally skilful as another party in artistic work or in turning out productive or beneficial works, is slighted by bestowing larger rewards on its rival party; those who are harassed by courtiers; those who are invited to be slighted; those who are harassed by banishment; those who, in spite of their large outlay of money, have failed in their undertakings; those who are prevented from the exercise of their rights or from taking possession of their inheritance; those who have fallen from their rank and honours in government service; those who are shoved to the corner by their own kinsmen; those whose women are violently assaulted; those who are thrown in jail; those who are punished in secret; those who are warned of their misdeeds; those whose property has been wholly confiscated; those who have long suffered from imprisonment; those whose relatives are banished—all these come under the group of provoked persons.\nHe who has fallen a victim to misfortune by his own misdeeds; he who is offended (by the king); he whose sinful deeds are brought to light; he who is alarmed at the award of punishment on a man of like guilt; he whose lands have been confiscated; he whose rebellious spirit is put down by coercive measures; he who, as a Superintendent of all government departments, has suddenly amassed a large amount of wealth; he who, as a relative of such a rich man, still fails to inherit his wealth; he who is disliked by the king; and he who hates the king—all these come under the group of persons alarmed.\nHe who is impoverished; he who has lost much wealth; he who is niggardly; he who is addicted to evil propensities: and he who is engaged in dangerous transactions—all these constitute the group of ambitious persons.\nHe who is self-sufficient; he who is fond of honour; he who is intolerant of his rivals honour; he who is esteemed low; he who is of a fiery spirit; he who is foolhardy as well as he who is not content with what he has been enjoying—all these come under the group of haughty persons.\nOf these, he who clings to a particular faction shall be so deluded by spies with shaved head or braided hair as to believe that he is intriguing with that party. Partisans under provocation, for example, may be won over by telling that “Just as an elephant in rut and mounted over by a driver under intoxication tramples under its foot whatever it comes across, so this king, dispossessed of the eye of science, blindly attempts to oppress both citizens and country people; it is possible to restrain him by setting up a rival elephant against him; so have forbearance enough (to wait). ”\nLikewise alarmed persons may be won over by telling that “Just as a hidden snake bites and spits poison over whatever alarms it, so this king, apprehensive of danger from thee, will ere long emit the poison of his resentment on thee; so thou mayest better go elsewhere.”\nSimilarly ambitious persons may be won over by telling that “Just as a cow teased by dog-keepers gives milk to dogs, but not to Brahmans, so this king gives milk (rewards) to those who are devoid of valour, foresight, eloquence and bravery, but not to those who are possessed of noble character: so the other king, who is possessed of power to discriminate men from men, may be courted.”\nIn like manner haughty persons may be won over by telling that “Just as a reservoir of water belonging to Chandalas is serviceable only to Chandalas, but not to others, so this king of low birth confers his patronage only on low-born people, but not on Aryas like thee; so the other king, who is possessed of power to distinguish between men and men, may be courted.”\nAll these disaffected persons, when acquiescing to the above proposals, may be made under a solemn compact to form a combination together with the spies to achieve their end. Likewise friends of a foreign king may also be won over by means of persuasion and rewards, while implacable enemies may be brought round by sowing dissensions, by threats, and by pointing out the defects of their master.",

    "text": "Having gained a firm hold on the affection of both local and foreign parties, both in his own and enemy’s state, the king shall proceed to think of administrative measures. All kinds of administrative measures are preceded by deliberations in a well-formed council. The subject matter of a council shall be entirely secret, and deliberations in it shall be so carried that even birds cannot see them; for it is said that the secrecy of counsels was divulged by parrots, minas, dogs and other low creatures of mean birth. Hence without providing himself with sufficient safeguard against disclosure, he shall never enter into deliberations in a council. Whoever discloses counsels shall be torn to pieces. The disclosure of counsels may be detected by observing changes in the attitude and countenance of envoys, ministers, and masters. Change in conduct is change in attitude; and observation of physical appearance is countenance. Maintenance of the secrecy of a council matter, and keeping guard over officers that have taken part in the deliberation over it (shall be strictly observed) till the time of starting the work so considered approaches. Carelessness, intoxication, talking in sleep, love, and other evil habits of councillors, are the causes of the betrayal of counsels. Whoever is of hidden nature or is disregarded will disclose counsels. Hence steps shall be taken to safeguard counsels against such dangers. Disclosure of counsels is advantageous to persons other than the king and his officers. “Hence,” says Bharadvaja, “the king shall singly deliberate over secret matters; for ministers have their own ministers, and these latter some of their own; this kind of successive line of ministers tends to the disclosure of counsels. Hence no outside person shall know anything of the work which the king has in view. Only those who are employed to carry it out shall know it, either when it is begun or when accomplished.”\n“No deliberation,” says Visalaksha, “made by a single person will be successful; the nature of the work which a sovereign has to do is to be inferred from the consideration of both the visible and invisible causes. The perception of what is not, or cannot be seen, the conclusive decision of whatever is seen, the clearance of doubts as to whatever is susceptible of two opinions, and the inference of the whole when only a part is seen—all this is possible of decision only by ministers. Hence he shall sit at deliberation with persons of wide intellect. He shall despise none, but hear the opinions of all. A wise man shall make use of even a child’s sensible utterance.”\n“This is,” says Parasara, “ascertaining the opinions of others, but not keeping counsels. He shall ask his ministers for their opinion on a work similar to the one he has in view, telling them that ‘this is the work; it happened thus; what is to be done if it will turn out thus’ and he shall do as they decide. If it is done thus, both the ascertainment of opinions and maintenance of secrecy can be attained.”\n“Not so,” says Pisuna, “for ministers, when called for their opinions regarding a distant undertaking, or an accomplished or an unaccomplished work, either approach the subject with indifference or give their opinions half-heartedly. This is a serious defect. Hence he shall consult such persons as are believed to be capable of giving decisive opinion regarding those works about which he seeks for advice. If he consults thus, he can secure good advice as well as secrecy of counsel.”\n“Not so,” says Kaundilya, “for this (kind of seeking for advice) is infinite and endless. He shall consult three or four ministers. Consultation with a single minister may not lead to any definite conclusion in cases of complicated issues. A single minister proceeds wilfully and without restraint. In deliberating with two ministers, the king may be overpowered by their combined power or imperilled by their mutual dissension. But with three or four ministers, he will not come to any serious grief, but will arrive at a satisfactory result. With ministers more than four in number, he will have to come to a decision after a good deal of trouble; nor will secrecy be maintained without much trouble. In accordance with the requirements of place, time, and nature of the work in view, he may, as he deems it proper, deliberate with one or two ministers or by himself. Means to carry out works, command of plenty of men and wealth, allotment of time and place, remedies against dangers, and final success are the five constituents of every council deliberation. The king may ask his councillors for their opinion, either individually or collectively, and ascertain their ability by judging over the reasons they assign for their opinions. He shall lose no time when the opportunity waited for arrives; nor shall he sit long at consultation with those whose parties he intends to hurt.”\n“The school of Manu say that the assembly of ministers shall consist of twelve members. The school of Brihaspati say that it shall consist of sixteen members. The school of Usanas say that it shall consist of twenty members. But Kautilya thinks that it shall consist of as many members as the needs of his dominion require.”",

    "section": "The Mission of Envoys (continued)",
    "text": "Kind face and eyes of the enemy; respectful reception of the mission; enquiry about the health of friends; taking part in the recitation of Vedas; giving a seat close to the throne; respectful treatment of the envoy; remembrance of friends; closing the mission with satisfaction—all these shall be noted as indicating the good graces of the enemy, and the reverse his displeasure. A displeased enemy may be told: ‘Messengers are the mouthpieces of kings, not only of thyself, but of all; hence messengers who, in the face of weapons raised against them, have to express their mission as exactly as they are entrusted with, do nothing to boast of, deserve death; where is then reason to put messengers of Brahman to death?’ This is another speech. This (i.e., delivery of that speech verbatim) is the duty of messengers. Not puffed up with these respects shown to him, he shall stay there till he is allowed to depart. He shall not care for the mighty of the enemy; shall strictly avoid women and liquor; shall take bed single; for it is well known that the intentions of envoys are ascertained while they are asleep or under the influence of liquor. He shall, through the agency of ascetic and merchant spies or through their disciples, or through spies under the disguise of physicians and heretics, or through recipients of salaries from two states (ubbayavetana), ascertain the nature of the intrigue prevalent among parties favorably disposed to his own minister, as well as the weakening of hostile factions, and understand the loyalty or disloyalty of the people to the enemy, besides any probable points. If there is no possibility of carrying on any such conversation with the people regarding their loyalty, he may try to gather such information by observing the talk of beggars, intoxicated and insane persons, or of persons babbling in sleep, or by observing the signs made in places of pilgrimage and temples, or by deciphering paintings and secret writings (chitra-gidha-lokya- lipi- samjha). Whatever information he thus gathers, he shall try to test by intrigues. He shall not check the estimate which the enemy makes of the emblems of sovereignty of his own master; but he shall only say in reply, ‘All is known to thee.’ Nor shall he disclose the means employed (by his master) in achieving an end in view. If he has not succeeded in his mission, but is still detained, he shall proceed to infer thus: ‘Whether seeing the imminent danger into which my master is likely to fall and desirous of averting his own future; whether in view of inciting against my master an enemy threatening in the rear or a king whose dominion in the rear is separated by other intervening states; whether in view of ensuring internal rebellion in my master’s state or of inciting a wild chief (atavika) against my master; whether in view of destroying my master by employing a friend or a king whose dominion is in the rear of my master’s state (akrandu); whether with the intention of averting the internal trouble in his own state or of preventing a foreign invasion or the inroads of a wild chief; whether in view of causing the approaching time of my master’s expedition to lapse; whether with the desire of collecting raw materials and merchandise, or of repairing his fortifications, or of recruiting a strong army capable to fight; whether waiting for the time and opportunity necessary for the complete bringing of his own army; or whether in view of making a desirable alliance in order to avert the present contempt brought about by his own carelessness, this king detains me thus?’ Then he may stay or get out as he deems it desirable, or he may demand a speedy settlement of his mission. Or having intimated an unfavorable order (Ajnana) to the enemy and pretending apprehension of imprisonment or death, he may return even without permission; otherwise, he may be punished. Transmission of missions, maintenance of treaties, issue of ultimatum (pratapa), gaining of friends, intrigue, sowing dissension among friends, fetching secret information, carrying away by stealth relatives and gems, gathering information about the movements of spies, bravery, breaking of treaties of peace, winning over the favor of the envoy and government officers of the enemy—these are the duties of an envoy (duta). The king shall employ his own envoys to carry works of the above description and guard himself against (the mischief of) foreign envoys by employing counter envoys, spies, and visible and invisible watchmen.",

We shall treat of ‘Protection of Wives’ in connection with ‘Duties towards the Harem.’\nEver since the birth of princes, the king shall take special care of them. For, says Bharadvaja, ‘Princes, like crabs, have a notorious tendency of eating up their begetter.’ When they are wanting in filial affection, they shall be punished in secret (uparati- dandub). ‘This,’ says Visalaksha, ‘means destruction of fortune and extirpation of the seed of the race of Kshatriyas. Hence it is better to keep them under guard in a definite place.’ ‘This,’ say the school of Parasara, ‘is akin to the fear from a lurking snake (ahi-bhayam); for a prince may think that, apprehensive of danger, his father has locked him up, and may attempt to put his own father on his lap. Hence it is better to keep a prince under the custody of boundary guards or inside a fort.’ ‘This,’ says Pisuna, ‘is akin to the fear from a wolf in the midst of a flock of sheep (vrka-bhayam); for after understanding the cause of his rustication, he may avail himself of the opportunity to make an alliance with the boundary guards. It is better to throw him inside a fort belonging to a foreign king far away from his own state.’ ‘This,’ says Kaunapadanta, ‘is akin to the position of a calf (vatsa-sthanam); for just as a man milks a cow with the help of its calf, so the foreign king may milk (reduce) the prince’s father. Hence it is better to make a prince live with his maternal relations.’ ‘This,’ says Vatavyadhi, ‘is akin to the position of a flag (dhvaja…",

Hence princes may be suffered to dissipate their lives by sensual excesses (gramyadharma) inasmuch as revelling sons do not dislike their indulgent father. ” “This,” says Kautilya, “is death in life; for no sooner is a royal family with a prince or princes given to dissipation attacked, than it perishes like a worm-eaten piece of wood. Hence when the queen attains the age favourable for procreation, priests shall offer to Indra and Brihaspati the requisite oblations. When she is big with a child, the king shall observe the instructions of midwifery with regard to gestation and delivery. After delivery, the priests shall perform the prescribed purificatory ceremonials. When the prince attains the necessary age, adepts shall train him under proper discipline.”\\n“Any one of the classmate spies,” say (politicians known as) Ambhiyas, “may allure the prince towards hunting, gambling, liquor, and women, and instigate him to attack his own father and snatch the reins of government in his own hands. Another spy shall prevent him from such acts.” “There can be,” says Kautilya, “no greater crime or sin than making wicked impressions on an innocent mind; just as a fresh object is stained with whatever it is brought in close association, so a prince with fresh mind is apt to regard as scientific injunctions all that he is told of. Hence he shall be taught only of righteousness and of wealth (artha) but not of unrighteousness and of non-wealth. Classmate spies shall be so courteous towards him as to say ‘thine are we.’ When under the temptation of youth he turns his eye towards women, impure women under the disguise of Aryas shall, at night and in lonely places, terrify him; when fond of liquor, he shall be terrified by making him drink such liquor as is adulterated with narcotics (yOgapana); when fond of gambling, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of fraudulent persons; when fond of hunting, he shall be terrified by spies under the disguise of highway robbers; and when desirous of attacking his own father, he shall, under the pretence of compliance, be gradually persuaded of the evil consequences of such attempts, by telling: a king is not made by a mere wish; failure of thy attempt will bring about thy own death; success makes thee fall into hell and causes the people to lament [for thy father] and destroy the only god (ekaditava-dhukcha, i.e., thyself).”\\nA prince though put to troubles and employed in an unequal task shall yet faithfully follow his father unless that task costs his life, enrages the people, or causes any other serious calamities. If he is employed in a good or meritorious work, he shall try to win the good graces of the superintendent of that work, carry the work to a profitable end beyond expectation, and present his father with the proportional profit derived from that work as well as with the extra profit due to his skill. If the king is not still pleased with him and shows undue partiality to another prince and other wives, he may request the king to permit him for a forest-life. Or if he apprehends imprisonment or death, he may seek refuge under a neighbouring king who is known to be righteous, inheritable, truthful, and not given to cunning, but also welcomes and respects guests of good character. Residing therein he may provide himself with men and money, contract marriage-connection with influential personages, and not only make alliance with wild tribes, but win over the parties (in his father",

Besides working in flower gardens, fruit gardens, vegetable ‘gardens, and paddy fields allotted to them, they (families) shall collect grains and merchandise in abundance as authorised. There shall be a water well for every ten houses. Oils, grains, sugar, salt, medicinal articles, dry or fresh veget¬ ables, meadow grass, dried flesh, haystock, firewood, metals, skins, charcoal, tendons (snayu), poison, horns, bamboo, fibrous garments, strong timber, weapons, armour, and stones shall also be stored (in the fort) in such quantities as can be enjoyed for years together without feeling any want. Of such collection, old things shall be replaced by new ones when received. Elephants, cavalry, chariots, and infantry shall each be officered with many chiefs, inasmuch as chiefs, when many, are under the fear of betrayal from each other and scarcely liable to the insinuations and intrigues of an enemy. The same rule shall hold good with the appointment of boundary guards, and repairers of fortifications. Never shall Bahirikas who are dangerous to the well-being of cities and countries be kept in forts. They may either be thrown in country parts or compelled to pay taxes.",

Having dug up a square well, not too deep to be moist with water, having paved both the bottom and the sides with slabs of stone, he shall, by using strong timber, construct in that well a cage-like underground chamber of three storeys high, the topmost being on a level with the surface of the ground, with many compartments of various design, with floor plastered with small stones, with one door, with a movable staircase and solemnised with the presence of the guardian deity. Above this chamber, the treasury house closed on both sides, with projecting roofs and extensively opening into the store-house, shall be built of bricks. He may employ outcaste men (abhityakta-purusha) to build at the extreme boundary of the kingdom a palatial mansion to hold substantial treasure against dangers and calamities. The trading-house shall be a quadrangle enclosed by four buildings with one door, with pillars built of burnt bricks, with many compartments, and with a row of pillars on both sides kept apart. The store-house shall consist of many spacious rooms, and enclose within itself the store-house of forest produce separated from it by means of walls and connected with both the underground chamber and the armoury. The court (dharmasthiya) and the office of the ministers (mahamatrlya) shall be built in a separate locality. Provided with separate accommodation for men and women kept apart, and with many compartments well-guarded, a jail shall also be constructed. All these buildings shall be provided with halls (Aala), pits (khata—privy [?]), water well, bathroom, remedies against fire and poison, with cats, mongooses, and with necessary means to worship the guardian gods appropriate to each. In (front of) the store-house, a bowl (kunc]a) with its mouth as wide as an aratni (24 ahgulas) shall be set up as rain-gauge (varshamana). Assisted by experts having necessary qualifications and provided with tools and instruments, the chamberlain shall attend to the business of receiving gems, either old or new, as well as raw materials of superior or inferior value. In cases of deception in gems, both the deceiver and the abettor shall be punished with the highest amercement; in the case of superior commodities, they shall be punished with the middlemost amercement; and in that of commodities of inferior value, they shall • be compelled not only to restore the same, but also pay a fine equal to the value of the articles. He shall receive only such gold coins as have been declared to be pure by the examiner of coins. Counterfeit coins shall be cut into pieces. Whoever brings in counterfeit coins shall be punished with the first amercement. Grains, pun- and fresh, shall be received in full measures; otherwise a fine of twice the value of the grains shall be imposed. The same rule shall hold good with the receipt of merchandise, raw materials, and weapons. In all departments, whoever whether an officer (yuktajr u d«* {lipajatta), or * servant (ralpuriisha), in inappropriate* sums from enu to four papa-p, or any other valuable things* shall be punished with the first, middlemost, and highest amercements and death respectively.

If with the intention of giving a hint, robbers are frightened by the guards, (the latter) be forfeited to death. Hence, assisted by trustworthy persons, the chamberlain shall attend to the business of revenue collection.

When they (the accountants of different districts) present themselves with sealed books, commodities, and net revenues, they shall all be kept apart in one place so that they cannot carry on conversation with each other. Having heard from them the totals of receipts, expenditures, and net revenue, the net amount shall be received. By how much the superintendent of a department augments the net total of his revenues either by increasing any of the items of its receipts or by decreasing any of the items of expenditure, he shall be rewarded eight times that amount. But when it is reversed (i.e., when the net total is decreased), the award shall also be reversed (i.e., he shall be made to pay eight times the damage). Those accountants who do not present themselves in time or do not produce their account books along with the net revenue shall be fined ten times the amount due from them. When a superintendent of accounts (karamika) does not at once proceed to receive and check the accounts when the clerks (kayasthas) are ready, he shall be punished with the first amercement. In the reverse case (i.e., when the clerks are not ready), the clerks shall be punished with double the first amercement. All the ministers (mahamatras) shall together examine the whole of the actual accounts pertaining to each department. Whoever of these (ministers or clerks) is of undivided counsel, or keeps himself aloof, or utters falsehood, shall be punished with the highest amercement. When an accountant has not prepared the table of daily account (aharaharikapahanam), he may be given a month more (for its preparation). After the lapse of one month, he shall be fined at the rate of 200 panas for each month (during which he delays the accounts). If an accountant has to write only a small portion of the accounts pertaining to net revenue, he may be allowed five nights to prepare it. Then the table of daily accounts submitted by him along with the net revenue shall be checked with reference to the regulated form of transactions and procedure and by applying such arithmetical processes as addition, subtraction, inference, and by reduction. It shall also be verified with reference to (such divisions of time as) days, five nights, pakshas, months, four-months, and the year. The receipts shall, on the Vyasana (new year’s day), be verified with reference to the place and time pertaining to them, the form of their collection (tax, capital, share), the amount of the present and past produce, the person who has paid it, the person who caused its payment, the officer who fixed the amount payable, and the officer who received it. The expenditure shall, on the Vyusana (new year’s day), be verified with reference to the cause of the profit from any source, the place and time pertaining to each item, the amount payable, the amount paid, the person who ordered the collection, the person who remitted the same, the person who delivered it, and the person who finally received it. Likewise, the net revenue shall, on the Vyusana day, be verified with reference to the place, time, and source pertaining to it, its standard of fineness and quantity, and the persons who are employed to guard the deposits and magazines (of grain, etc.). When an officer (yukta) does not facilitate, or prevents the execution of the king’s order, or renders the receipts and expenditure otherwise than prescribed, he shall be punished with the first amercement. Any clerk who violates or deviates from the prescribed form of writing accounts, enters what is unknown to him, or makes double or treble entries (punartikam) shall be fined 12 panas. He who keeps off the net total shall be doubly punished. He who eats it up shall be fined eight times. He who causes loss of revenue shall not only pay a fine equal to five times the amount lost (panchabandham), but also make good the loss. In case of uttering a lie, the punishment levied for theft shall be imposed. When an entry (lost or omitted) is made later or is made to appear as forgotten but added later on recollection, the punishment shall be double the above. The king shall forgive an offense when it is trifling, have satisfaction even when the revenue is scanty, and honour with rewards (pragraha) such of his superintendents as are of immense benefit to him.",

    "text": "All undertakings depend upon finance. Hence foremost attention shall be paid to the treasury. Public prosperity (pracarasamrddhih), rewards for good conduct (caritraanugrahah), capture of thieves, dispensing with (the service of too many) government servants, abundance of harvest, prosperity of commerce, absence of troubles and calamities (upasargapramokshah), diminution of remission of taxes, and income in gold (hiranyopayanam) are all conducive to financial prosperity. Obstruction (pratibandha), loan (prayoga), trading (vyavahara), fabrication of accounts (avastara), causing the loss of revenue (parihapanam), self-enjoyment (upabhoga), barter (parivartana), and defalcation (apahara) are the causes that tend to deplete (the treasury). Failure to start an undertaking or to realize its results, or to credit its profits (to the treasury) is known as obstruction. Herein a fine of ten times the amount in question shall be imposed. Lending the money of the treasury on periodical interest is a loan. Carrying on trade by making use of government money is trading. These two acts shall be punished with a fine of twice the profit earned. Whoever makes as unripe the ripe time or as ripe the unripe time (of revenue collection) is guilty of fabrication. Herein a fine of ten times the amount (panchabandha) shall be imposed. Whoever lessens a fixed amount of income or enhances the expenditure is guilty of causing the loss of revenue. Herein a fine of four times the loss shall be imposed. Whoever enjoys himself or causes others to enjoy whatever belongs to the king is guilty of self-enjoyment. Herein death sentence shall be passed for enjoying gems, middlemost amercement for enjoying valuable articles, and restoration of the articles together with a fine equal to their value shall be the punishment for enjoying articles of inferior value. The act of exchanging government articles for (similar) articles of others is barter. This offense is explained by self-enjoyment. Whoever does not take into the treasury the fixed amount of revenue collected, or does not spend what is ordered to be spent, or misrepresents the net revenue collected, is guilty of defalcation of government money. Herein a fine of twelve times the amount shall be imposed. There are about forty ways of embezzlement: what is realized earlier is entered later on; what is realized later is entered earlier; what ought to be realized is not realized; what is hard to realize is shown as realized; what is collected is shown as not collected; what has not been collected is shown as collected; what is collected in part is entered as collected in full; what is collected in full is entered as collected in part; what is collected is of one sort, while what is entered is of another sort; what is realized from one source is shown as realized from another; what is payable is not paid; what is not payable is paid; not paid in time; paid untimely; small gifts made large gifts; large gifts made small gifts; what is gifted is of one sort while what is entered is of another; the real donee is one while the person entered (in the register) as donee is another; what has been taken into (the treasury) is removed while what has not been credited to it is shown as credited; raw materials that are not paid for are entered, while those that are paid for are not entered; an aggregate is scattered in pieces; scattered items are converted into an aggregate; commodities of greater value are bartered for those of small value; what is of smaller value is bartered for one of greater value; price of commodities enhanced; price of commodities lowered; number of nights increased; number of nights decreased; the year not in harmony with its months; the month not in harmony with its days; inconsistency in the transactions carried on with personal supervision (samagamavishamah); misrepresentation of the source of income; inconsistency in giving charities; incongruity in representing the work turned out; inconsistency in dealing with fixed items; misrepresentation of test marks or the standard of fineness (of gold and silver); misrepresentation of prices of commodities; making use of false weights and measures; deception in counting articles; and making use of false cubic measures such as bhajana—these are the several ways of embezzlement. Under the above circumstances, the persons concerned, such as the treasurer (nidhayaka), the prescriber (nibandhaka), the receiver (pratigrahaka), the payer (dayaka), the person who caused the payment (dapaka), the ministerial servants to the officer (mantrivaiyavrtyakara) shall each be separately",

While engaged in work, they shall be daily examined ; for men are naturally fickle-minded, and, like horses at work, exhibit constant change in their temper. Hence the agency and tools which they make use of, the place and time of the work they are engaged in, as well as the precise form of the work, the outlay, and the results shall always be ascertained. Without dissension and without any concert among themselves, they shall carry on their work as ordered. When in concert, tier eat up (the revenue). When in disunion, they mar the work. Without bringing to the knowledge of their master (bhartr, the king], they shall undertake nothing except remedial measures against imminent dangers, A fine of twice the amount of their daily pay and of the expenditure (incurred by them} shall he fixed for any insubordination on their part. Whoever of the superintendents makes as much or more than the amount of fixed revenue shall he honoured with promotion and rewards, Easy) teacher holds that that officer who spends too much and brings in little revenue eats it up: while he who improves the revenue (i.e. brings in more than he spends) as well as the other who brings in as much as he spends does not eat up the revenue. But Kautilya holds that matters of embezzlement or no embezzlement can he ascertained through spies alone. Whoever lessens the revenue eats the king's wealth, If owing to inadvertence he causes diminution in revenue, he shall he compelled to make good the loss. Whoever doubles the revenue adds into the vitality of the country. If he brings in double the amount to the king, he shall, if the offence is small, he warned not to repeat the same; but if the offence be grave he should proportionally be punished. Whoever spends the revenue (without bringing in any profit) eats up the labour of workman. Such an officer shall be punished in proportion to the value of the work done, the number of days taken, the amount of capital spent, and the amount of daily wages paid. Hence the chief officer of each department (adhikartipa) shall thoroughly scrutinise the real amount of the work done, the receipts realised from, and the expenditure incurred in that departmental work both in detail and in the aggregate. He shall also check prodigal, spendthrift and niggardly persons. Whoever unjustly eats up the property left by his father and grand¬ father is a prodigal person (mudtha). Whoever eats all that he earns is a spendthrift (tadatvika). Whoever hoards money, entailing hardship both on himself and his servants is niggardly. Whoever of these three kinds of persons has the support of a strong party shall not be disturbed ; but he who has no such support shall be caught hold of. Whoever is niggardly in spite of his immense property hoards, deposits, or sends one aboard in his own house, deposits with citizens or country people or sends out to foreign countries : a spy shall find out the advisory friends, servants, relations, income and expenditure of such a niggardly person. Whoever in a foreign country carries out the work of such a niggardly person shall be prevailed upon to give out the secret. When the secret is known, the niggardly person shall be murdered apparently under the order of his avowed enemy. Superintendents of all the departments shall carry on their respective works in company with Accountants, writers, coin examiners, treasurers, and military officers (uttaradhyaksakab). Those who attend upon military officers and are noted for their honesty and good conduct shall be spies to watch the conduct of accountants and other clerks. Each department shall be officed by several temporary heads. Just as it is impossible not to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip of the tongue, so it is impossible for a government servant not to eat up, at least a bit of the king's revenue. Just as fish moving under water cannot possibly be found out either on drinking or not drinking water, so government servants employed in the government work cannot be found out (while taking money (for themselves). It is possible to mark the movements of birds flying high up in the sky ; but not so is it possible to ascertain the movement of government servants of hidden purpose. Government servants shall not only be confiscated of their ill-earned hoards, but also be transferred from one work to another, so that they cannot either misappropriate government money or vomit what they have eaten up. Those who increase the king's revenue instead of eating it up, and are loyally devoted to him, shall be made permanent in service.",

    "text": "A group of words conveying a complete sense is a sentence (vakya). Combination of words (varga) consisting of not more than three words and not less than one word, shall be so formed as to harmonize with the inclining of immediately following words. The word 'iti' is used to indicate the completion of a writ and also to indicate an oral message as in the phrase 'Yuchiku tatha yachati'. An oral message along with a written communication (lekha) is called a writ. Calumniation (ninda), commendation, inquiry, narration, request, refusal, censure, prohibition, command, conciliation, promise of help, threat, and persuasion are the thirteen purposes for which writs are issued. Calumniation (ninda) consists in speaking ill of one's family, body, and acts. Commendation (prasamsa) consists in praising one's family, person and acts. To inquire, 'How is this?' is inquiry. To point out the way as 'Thus,' is narration (akhyana). To entreat, as 'Give,' is request. To say that, 'I do not give,' is refusal. To say that, 'It is not worthy of thee,' is censure (uparsandhana). To say, as 'Do not do so,' is prohibition (pratishedha). To say that, 'This should be done,' is command (adhyapana). To say, 'What I am, that thou art; which ever article is mine is thine also,' is conciliation (sandhi). To hold out help in trouble is promise of help (abhayapratidana). Pointing out the evil consequences that may occur in future is threat (abhibharshana). Persuasion is of three kinds: that made for the purpose of money, that made in case of one's failure to fulfil a promise, and that made on occasion of any trouble. The writs of information, of command, and of gift; likewise writs of remission, of licence, of guidance, of reply, and of general proclamation are other varieties. 'Thus says (the messenger); so says (the king); if there is any truth in this statement of the messenger, then the thing (agreed to) should at once be surrendered; (the messenger) has informed the king of all the deeds of the enemy'—this is the writ of information which is said to be of various forms. Wherever, and especially regarding government servants, the king's order either for punishment or for rewards is issued, it is called writ of command (ajnapatra). Where the bestowal of honour for deserving merit is contemplated, taken as help to alleviate affliction or as gifts, then is issued writs of gift (paridana patra). Wherever favour (anugraha) to special castes, cities, villages, or countries of various description is announced in obedience to the king's orders, it is called writ of remission (parihari lekha). Likewise, licence (anujna) shall be enjoined either in word or deed; accordingly, it is styled verbal order or writ of licence. Various kinds providential visitations or well ascertained evils of human make are believed to be the cause for issuing writs of guidance (pravarta lekha) to attempt remedies against them. When having read a letter and discussed as to the form of reply thereto, a reply in accordance with the king's order is made, it is called a writ of reply (pratilekha). When the king directs his viceroys, ministers, and other officers to protect and give material help to travellers, either on roads or in the interior of the country, it is termed writ of general proclamation (sarvatraga lekha).",

    "text": "Negotiation, bribery, causing dissension, and open attack are forms of stratagem (upaya). Negotiation is of five kinds: Praising the qualities (of an enemy), narrating the mutual relationship, pointing out mutual benefit, showing vast future prospects, and identity of interests. When the family, person, occupation, conduct, learning, properties, etc. (of an enemy), are commended with due respect to their worth, it is termed praising the qualities (sanasasikirthana). When the fact of having agnate blood-relations, teachers, priestly hierarchy, family and friends in common is pointed out, it is known as narration of mutual relationship (sambandha pakhyana). When both parties, the party of a king and that of his enemy, are shown to be helpful to each other, it is known as pointing out mutual benefit (parasparapakara samdarsanam). Inducements such as 'This being done thus, such result will accrue to both of us,' is showing vast future prospects (vyayaprasdarsanam). To say, 'What I am, that thou art; thou mayest utilize in thy works whatever is mine,' is identity of interests (atmapatidadanam). Offering money is bribery (upagraha). Causing fears and suspicion as well as threatening is known as sowing dissension. Harassing and plundering is attack (danda). Clumsiness, contradiction, repetition, bad grammar, and misarrangement are the faults of a writ. Blank and ugly leaf and uneven and uncoloured writing cause clumsiness (akanti). Subsequent portion disagreeing with the previous portion of a letter, is contradiction (vyaghata). Stating for a second time what has already been said above is repetition. Wrong use of words in gender, number, time and case is bad grammar (upabadu). Division of paragraphs (varga) in unsuitable places, omission of necessary division of paragraphs, and violation of any other necessary qualities of a writ constitute misarrangement (samplava). Having followed all sciences and having fully observed forms of writing in vogue, these rules of writing royal writs have been laid down by Kautilya in the interest of kings.",

That amount of gold which they have received and the ornamental work which they were doing shall be put in the centre of the office. (Finished articles) shall be examined both morning and evening and be locked up with the seal of both the manufacturer and the superintendent, (karmantara) the owner getting the articles prepared.\n\nRekhasso, guna, and kshudra are three kinds of ornamental work. Setting jewels (kacha) glass bead) in gold is termed rekhasso. Thread making or string making is called guna. Solid work (ghana), hollow work (sushira), and the manufacture of girdles furnished with a rounded orifice is what is termed kshudra, low or ordinary work.\n\nIn setting jewels in gold, five parts of kanchana (pure gold) and ten parts of gold alloyed with four parts of copper or silver shall be the required quantity (mana). Here the pure gold shall be preserved from the impure gold. For setting jewels in hollow ornaments (sparshamachcha karmanah), three parts of gold to hold the jewel and four parts for the bottom shall be the required quantity). For the work of guna, copper and gold shall be mixed in equal quantities. For silver articles, either solid or hollow, silver may be mixed with half of the amount of gold; or by making use of the powder or dilution of vermilion, gold equal to one-fourth the amount of silver of this ornament may be painted (vasayet) on it.\n\nTempered and glittering gold is tapanlya. This combined with an equal quantity of lead and heated with rock salt (saindhavaka) to inciting point under dry cow-dung becomes the basis of gold alloys of red, white, yellow (harita), parrot and pigeon colours. The colouring ingredient of gold is one kakani of the ore which is of the colour of the neck of a peacock, tinged with white, and which is ductile and full of copper (pitapingalatara).\n\nPure or impure silver (rajata) may be heated four times with Asthitapra (copper sulphate mixed with powdered bunch again four times with an equal quantity of lead, again four times with dry copper sulphate (sushka tuttha), again three times in skull (kapala), and lastly twice in cow-dung. Thus the silver acted upon seventeen times by tuttha (shodasatutthatikrantakam) and lastly heated to white light with rock salt may be made to alloy with suvarna to the extent of from one kakani to two mashas. Then the suvarna attains white colour and is called sveta-tara. When three parts of tapanlya (pure gold) are melted with thirty-two parts of sveta-tara, the compound becomes reddish white (svetalohitakam). When three parts of tapanlya are combined with thirty-two parts of copper, the compound becomes yellow (pita, red!). Also when three parts of the colouring ingredient (ragatri- bliaga, ue. tikshna referred to above) are heated with tapanlya, the compound becomes yellowish red (pita). When two parts of sveta-tara and one part of tapanlya are heated, the whole mass becomes as green as mudga (Phraseolus Mungo). When tapanlya is drenched in a solution of half the quantity of black iron (kalayasa), it becomes black. When tapanlya is twice drenched in (the above) solution mixed with mercury (rasa), it acquires the colour of the feathers of a parrot. Before these varieties of gold are put to use, their test streak shall be taken on touchstone. The process of assaying tikshna and copper shall be well understood. Hence the various counterweights (avaneyimana) used in weighing diamonds, rubies, pearls, corals, and coins (rupa), as well as the proportional amount of gold and silver necessary for various kinds of ornaments can be well understood.\n\nUniform in colour, equal in the colour of test streak to the standard gold, devoid of hollow bulbs, ductile (sthira), very free from alloys, pleasing in its uniform fineness, not dazzling though glittering, sweet in its uniformity of lustre and pleasing to the mind and eyes—these are the qualities of tapanlya, pure gold.",

The artisans employed in the office shall do their work as ordered and in time. When under the excuse that time and nature of the work has not been prescribed, they spoil the work, they shall not only forfeit their wages, but also pay a fine of twice the amount of their wages. When they postpone work, they shall forfeit one-fourth the amount of their wages and pay a fine of twice the amount of the forfeited wages. (The goldsmith of the mint) shall return (to the owners coins or ornaments) of the same weight and of the same quality (varna) as that of the bullion (rupopa) which they received (at the mint). With exception of those coins which have been worn out or which have undergone diminution (kshinaparinam), they shall receive the same coins (back into the mint) even after the lapse of a number of years. The state goldsmith shall gather from the artisans employed in the mint information concerning pure gold, metallic mass (pinda), coins (rupa), and rate of exchange (prayoga).\n\nIn getting a suvarna coin (of 16 mashas) manufactured from gold or from silver, one kakani (one-fourth masha) weight of the metal more shall be given to the mint towards the loss in manufacture. The colouring ingredient (ragaprakshepa) shall be two kakaris of tikshna (copper sulphate?), one-sixth of which will be lost during the manufacture. When the quality (varna) of a coin less than the standard of a masha is lowered, the artisans (concerned) shall be punished with the first amercement. When its weight is less than the standard weight, they shall be punished with the middlemost amercement. Deception in balance or weights shall be punished with the highest amercement. Deception in the exchange of manufactured coins (kritabhando- padhau) shall also be punished with the highest amercement. Whoever causes (gold or silver articles) to be manufactured in any place other than the mint or without being noticed by the state goldsmith shall be fined 12 panas, while the artisan who does that work shall, if found out, be punished with twice the above fine. If he is not found out, measures such as are described in Book IV shall be taken to detect him. When thus detected, he shall be fined 200 panas or shall have his fingers cut off. Weighing balance and counterweights shall be purchased from the superintendent in charge of them. Otherwise a fine of 12 panas shall be imposed.\n\nCompact work (ghana), compact and hollow work (ghana-sushira), soldering (samyuhya), amalgamation (avalepya), enclosing (samghatya), and gilding (vasitakam), are the various kinds of artisan work (karukarma). False balances (tulavishama), removal (apasarana), dropping (visravapa), folding (peshaka), and confounding (pishka) are the several means employed by goldsmiths to deceive the public. False balances are—that of bending arms (sannamini); that of high helm or pivot (utkarpika); that of broken head (bhinnamastaka); that of hollow neck (upakanthi); that of bad strings (kusikya); that of bad cups or pans (sakatukakshya); that which is crooked or shaking (parivellya); and that which is combined with a magnet (ayaskanta). When, by what is called Tripataka, which consists of two parts of silver and one part of copper, an equal portion of pure alluvial gold is replaced, that deceitful act is termed copper-removal (triputavasarpanam); when, by copper, an equal portion of gold is replaced, that act is termed copper-removal (tambravasarpanam); when by vellaka an equal portion of gold is replaced, it is termed vellaka-removal",

    "text": "…gold half of which is mixed with copper, it is termed gold-removal. A crucible with hidden metallic pieces; metallic excrement; pincers; tongs; metallic pieces; and borax—these are used by goldsmiths in stealing gold. When, intentionally causing the crucible to hunt, a few metal particles are picked up with base metal particles previously placed therein, and wrought into a coin or ornament, this is termed dropping. Deception by substituting silver for gold in inlaid ornament leaves, or substituting base metal particles for gold, is also termed dropping. Folding, either firm or loose, is practiced in soldering, preparing amalgams, and enclosing base metal with superior metal. A lead piece covered with gold leaf using wax is termed firm folding; loosely folded is the same, but loose. In amalgams, a single or double layer of superior metal covers a base metal piece. Copper or silver may be placed between two leaves of superior metal. A copper piece can be covered with gold leaf, the surface and edges smoothed; similarly, base metal can be covered with double leaf of copper or silver, smoothed. Folding forms are detected by heating, testing on touchstone, or observing absence of sound when rubbed. Loose folding is found out in badamalu juice or salt water—so much for folding. In compact, hollow pieces, small gold particles like mud or vermilion bits are heated to adhere inside. Even in compact pieces, Gundidra mud mixed with gold-like particles is heated to adhere. These impurities are removed by hammering red-hot pieces. In ornaments or coins, salt mixed with hard sand is heated to adhere. This is removed by boiling. In some pieces, mica is fixed inside with wax and covered with double leaf. When such a piece is suspended in water, one side dips more; or when pierced, the pin goes easily into mica layers. Spurious stones and counterfeit gold/silver may substitute real ones in compact, hollow pieces. They are detected by hammering red-hot—so much for confounding. Hence, the state goldsmith shall know the species, characteristics, color, weight, and formation of diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, and coins. Four deceptions occur when examining new or repairing old pieces: hammering, cutting, scratching, and rubbing. When, under the excuse of detecting folding in hollow pieces, threads, or cups, the articles are hammered, that is hammering. Substituting a lead piece (covered) for a real one and cutting off the interior is cutting. When compact pieces are scratched by sulphate of copper, that is scratching. When articles are rubbed with cloth containing powdered sulphur, red arsenic, vermilion, or black rukh, that is rubbing. By these acts, gold/silver articles diminish, but suffer no other injury. In hammered, cut, scratched, or rubbed pieces, theft is inferred by comparing with intact pieces. In cut amalgams, loss is ascertained by cutting an equal portion of a similar piece. Pieces with changed appearance should be heated and water-drenched. Deception is inferred when the artisan ignores: throwing away, counterweight, file, anvil, working balms, the seat, assaying balances, drafts, his head, thigh, looking at his body, water-pot, rooftop, silver smelling like rotten meat, any alloy, projection, and bad color, indicating adulteration. Thus, new/old, base/mutual color articles are examined, and punishments imposed.",

To the left of that mark, symbols such as 1 pala, 12, 15 and 20 palas shall be marked. After that, each place of tens up to 100 shall be marked. In the place of Akṣas, the sign of Nandi shall be marked. Likewise a balance called parimāṇi, of twice as much metallic mass as that of samavṛtta and of 96 aṅgulas in length, shall be made. On its lever, marks such as 20, 50 and 100 above its initial weight of 100 shall be carved.\n20 tulās = 1 bhāra. 10 dharaṇas = 1 pala. 100 such palas = 1 āyamāna (measure of royal income).

A pala in each of the above successively falls short of the same in avamāni by half a dharaṇa.\nThe metallic mass of the levers of each of the above successively decreases in weight by two ordinary palas and in length by six aṅgulas. Excepting flesh, metals, salt, and precious stones, an excess of five palas (prayāma) of all other commodities shall be given to the king when they are weighed in the two first-named balances.

But liquids shall always be measured level to the mouth of the measure. With regard to wine, flowers, fruits, bran, charcoal and salt-like substances, twice the quantity of the heaped-up portion shall be given in excess.\n1 paṇa is the price of a droṇa, ½ paṇa of an āḍhaka, ¼ paṇa of a prastha, ⅛ paṇa of a kuḍumba. The price of similar liquid measures is double. 20 paṇas is the price of a set of counterweights, 10 paṇas of a usual balance. The Superintendent shall charge four times the price for stamping weights or measures. A fine of 57½ paṇas shall be imposed for using unstamped weights or measures. Traders shall pay one kākaṇi to this superintendent towards the charge of stamping. Those who trade in clarified butter shall give ⅛ part more as tarapanya (compensation for decrease owing to its liquid condition). Those who trade in oil shall give ¼ part more.

Eligibility for time measurement, where the former word is used to describe the shadow of a gnomon of twelve angulas in height. Other measures include one prastha which is equal to 3 feet, and one chhatriyama which measures the shadow of 12 angulas in length cast by a gnomon of 13 angulas in height. The word prastha is used to measure 108 angulas when used in measuring the height of a perpendicular staff. This is used in measuring the lands gifted to priests and others, also used by the officials entrusted with the management of religious and other charitable institutions. A day and night happen in the months of Chaitra and Ashvayuja. Then after this period of six months, it increases or diminishes by three muhurtas.

Likewise, when the day declines, the same process in reverse order shall be observed. It is in the month of Ashadha that no shadow is cast at midday. After Ashadha during the six months from Kartika upwards, the length of shadow successively increases by two angulas, and during the next six months, from Magha upwards, it successively decreases by two angulas. Fifteen days and nights together make up one paksha. That paksha during which the moon waxes is white (shukla) and that paksha during which the moon wanes is krishna (dark). Two pakshas make one month (masa). Thirty days and nights together make one work-month (prakirnamasah). The same (30 days and nights) with an additional half a day makes one solar month (saura).",

Only so much light as is enough to examine the threads shall be kept. If the superintendent looks at the face of such women or talks about any other work, he shall be punished with the first amercement. Delay in paying the wages shall be punished with the middlemost amercement. Likewise when wages are paid for work that is not completed. She who, having received wages, does not turn out the work shall have her thumb cut off. Those who misappropriate, steal, or run away with (the raw material supplied to them) shall be similarly punished. Weavers, when guilty, shall be fined out of their wages in proportion to their offences. The superintendent shall closely associate with those who manufacture ropes and mail armour, and shall carry on the manufacture of straps (varatra) and other commodities. He shall carry on the manufacture of ropes from threads and fibres and of straps from cane and bamboo bark, with which beasts for draught are trained or tethered.\n\nPossessed of the knowledge of the science of agriculture dealing with the plantation of bushes and trees (kshetragulmavriksha- ayurvedajnah), or assisted by those who are trained in such sciences, the superintendent of agriculture shall in time collect the seeds of all kinds of grains, flowers, fruits, vegetables, bulbous roots, roots, palikya, fibre-producing plants, and cotton. He shall employ slaves, labourers, and prisoners (dandapratikartr) to sow the seeds on crown lands which have been often and satisfactorily ploughed. The work of the above men shall not suffer on account of any want in ploughs (karshanayantra) and other necessary instruments or of bullocks. Nor shall there be any delay in procuring to them the assistance of blacksmiths, carpenters, borers (medaka), rope-makers, as well as those who catch snakes, and similar persons. Any loss due to the above persons shall be punished with a fine equal to the loss. The quantity of rain that falls in the country of Jangala is 16 dronas; half as much more in moist countries (anupanam); in countries which are fit for agriculture (desava- panam)—13.5 dronas in the country of Asmakas; 23 dronas in Avanti; and an immense quantity in western countries (aparanta- nam), the borders of the Himalayas, and the countries where water channels are made use of in agriculture (kulyavapanam). When one-third of the requisite quantity of rain falls both during the commencement and closing of the rainy season and two-thirds in the middle, then the rainfall is (considered) very even (susamavrittih). A forecast of such rainfall can be made by observing the position, motion, and pregnancy (garbhasampat) of Jupiter (Brihaspati), the fire, heat, and motion of Venus, and the natural or unnatural aspect of the sun. From the sun, the sprouting of the seeds can be inferred; from (the position of) Jupiter, the formation of grains (granthakarita) can be inferred; and from the movements of Venus, rainfall can be inferred. Three are the clouds that continuously rain for seven days; eighty are they that pour minute drops; and sixty are they that appear with the sunshine—this is termed rainfall. Where rain free from wind and unmingled with sunshine falls so as to render three turns of ploughing possible, there the reaping of a good harvest is certain. Hence, as according to the rainfall is more or less, the superintendent shall sow the seeds which require either more or less water.",

If a man falsely denies his intercourse with his wife, though it be proved by eyewitnesses (drishtibhih), or through a spy, he shall pay a fine of 12 panas. A woman, hating her husband, will not dissolve her marriage with him against his will. Nor can a man dissolve his marriage with his wife against her will. But from mutual enmity, divorce may be obtained (parasparam dvikshanmokhah). If a man, apprehending danger from his wife, desires divorce (mokshanam), he shall return to her whatever she was given (on the occasion of her marriage). If a woman, under the apprehension of danger from her husband, desires divorce, she shall forfeit her claim to her property. Marriage contracts entered into in accordance with the customs of the first four kinds of marriage cannot be dissolved. If a woman engages in amorous sports, or drinking in the face of an order to the contrary, she shall be fined 12 panas. She shall pay a fine of 6 panas for going out at daytime to sport or to see a woman or spectacles. She shall pay a fine of 12 panas if she goes out to see another man or for sports. For the same offences committed at night, the fines shall be doubled. If a woman goes out while the husband is asleep under intoxication (suptam madyapapitam) or if she shuts the door of the house against her husband, she shall be fined 12 panas. If a woman keeps him out of the house at night, she shall pay double the above fine. If a man and a woman make signs to each other with a view to sexual enjoyment, or carry on secret conversation (for the same purpose), the woman shall pay a fine of 24 panas, and the man double the amount. A woman, holding out for sale, the tie of her dress round her loins, her teeth or her fingers shall pay the first amercement, and a man, doing the same, twice the first amercement. For holding conversation in suspicious places, whips may be substituted for fines. In the centre of the village, an untainted person (acharyavan) may whip such women five times on each of the sides of their body. She may get rid of being whipped by paying a pana for each whip (panakam viprahara mokshayer).  With regard to a man and a woman who, though forbidden to carry on any mutual transaction, help each other, the woman shall be fined 12, 24 and 54 panas respectively, according as the help refers to (i) small things, of (ii) costly things, and (iii) of gold or gold coins (hiranyavarnakayoh); and the man, at double the above rates. With regard to similar transaction between a man and a woman who cannot mix with each other (agamyayoh), half of the above punishment shall be levied. Similar punishment shall be meted out for any forbidden transaction with any men. Treason, transgression and wandering at will shall deprive a woman of her claim not only to (i) stridhana, some form of subsistence of above 2,000 panas and jewellery, (ii) and ahita, compensation she may have obtained for allowing her husband to marry another woman, but also (iii) to sulka, money which her parents may have received from her husband.",

If she allows into her house her neighbor, takes into her house the alms of any mendicant, or the merchandise of any merchant, she shall be fined 12 panas. If she deals as above though expressly forbidden, she shall be punished with the first amercement. If she goes out beyond the surrounding houses (parigrhatigatayam), she shall be fined 24 panas. If, under any other excuse than danger, she takes into her house the wife of another man, she shall be fined 100 panas. But she will not be guilty if the entrance is effected without her knowledge or against her orders to the contrary. My teacher says: With a view to avoid danger, it is no offence for women to go to any male person who is a kinsman of her husband, or is a rich and prosperous gentleman (sukhavastha), or is the headman of the village, or is one of her guardians (anvadhikula), or who belongs to the family of a mendicant woman, or to any one of her own kinsmen. But Kautilya questions: How is it possible for good women (sadhvijana) to know at least this fact, that the family of her own kinsmen consisting of a number of males is good? It is no offence for women to go to the houses of kinsmen under the circumstances of death, disease, calamities, and confinement of women. Whoever prevents her going under such circumstances, shall be fined 12 panas. If a woman conceals herself under such circumstances, she shall forfeit her endowment. If her kinsmen conceal her (with a view to exempt her from giving her aid under such circumstances) they shall lose the balance of sulka money due to them from her husband for giving her in marriage. Thus vagrancy is dealt with. If, leaving her husband's house, a woman goes to another village, she shall not only pay a fine of 12 panas, but also forfeit her endowment and jewels (sthapyabharapalopascha). If under any other excuse than receiving her subsistence or pilgrimage (dharmadanatirthagamanabhyamanyatra), a woman goes to any other place, even in company with an associable man, she shall not only pay a fine of 24 panas, but also lose all kinds of social privileges (sarvadharmalopascha). But the man who allows such a woman to accompany him in his journey shall be punished with the first amercement. If both of them (man and woman) have similar ideals in life (tulyasreyasoh) and are of sinful",

If a relative knowingly allows a forbidden woman to accompany him, he shall be punished with half the fine. If a woman is found in the company of a man in a secluded place or accompanies a suspicious man, she is guilty of elopement.  Women in the company of actors, players, singers, fishermen, hunters, herdsmen, vintners, or similar professions who travel with women are exempt. If a forbidden man and woman travel together, they receive half the usual fine. Wives of absent husbands should wait for their return for a period determined by caste and whether they have children.  If provided for, they wait twice as long. If not provided for, relatives should support them for a set period, after which they may remarry.  A Brahman student’s wife should wait ten years if childless, twelve if she has children. A king's servant's wife should wait until death, but may bear children by a man of the same gotra to preserve lineage. A deserted wife lacking support may remarry.  A young wife whose husband goes abroad without notice should wait seven months, or a year if notice was given. If unheard from, she waits five months, or ten if the husband's whereabouts are unknown. If only part of the dowry (sulka) was paid, she waits three months if unheard from, seven if he is heard from. If the full dowry was paid, she waits five months if unheard from, ten if he is heard from. Then, with judicial permission, she may remarry, as neglecting intercourse after menses is considered a violation of duty.",

Self-acquired property, except that earned using parental property, is not divisible. Sons and grandsons up to the fourth generation share property acquired through undivided ancestral property. Those beyond the fourth generation divide property equally. Those living together re-divide property regardless of previous divisions. A son improving ancestral property receives a share of the profit. If a man has no male issue, his brothers or cohabitants inherit. In their absence, daughters (from marriages other than the first four) inherit. If one has sons, they inherit. If only daughters from approved marriages exist, they inherit. If neither exists, the deceased’s father inherits, then his father's brothers and their sons.  Multiple brothers divide equally, with sons receiving their father’s share.  If brothers have different fathers, they divide based on their fathers’ shares. Among father, brother, and brother's sons, inheritance priority follows seniority. A living father distributes property equally. He cannot disinherit a son without reason. The eldest son supports younger ones if the father is unfit. Inheritance is divided when all heirs reach majority. Minors' shares are debt-free and held in trust.  Unmarried daughters receive dowries.  Poor people divide even mud and vessels equally.",

The blind of the same animals shall be the special shares to the middlemost sons; species of variegated colour of the same animals shall be the special shares to the youngest of sons. In the absence of 'quadruped, the eldest shall take an additional share of one-tenth of the whole property excepting precious stones; for by this act alone, he will be bound in his duty to his ancestors. The above method is in accordance with the rules observed among the followers of Usanas. The father being dead, his carriage and jewellery shall be the special share to the eldest; his bed, seat, and bronze plate in which he used to take his meals (bhuktankamsyam), to the middlemost; and black grains, iron, domestic utensils, cows and cart to the youngest. The rest of the property, or the above things,' too, may be equally divided among themselves.\n\nSisters shall have no claim to inheritance; they shall have the bronze plate and jewellery of their mother after her death. The eldest son having no manly qualities shall have only one-third of the special share usually given to the eldest; if the eldest son follows a condemnable occupation or if he has given up the observance of religious duties, he shall have only one-fourth of the special share; if he is unrestrained in his actions he shall have nothing. The same rule shall hold good with the middlemost and youngest sons; of these two, one who is endowed with manliness (manushopetah), shall have half the special share usually given to the eldest.\n\nWith regard to sons of many wives: Of sons of two wives of whom only one woman has gone through all the necessary religious ceremonials, or one of whom has married as a maiden, and the other not as a maiden, or one of whom has brought forth twins, it is by birth that primogeniture is decided. In the case of sons such as Suta, Magudha, Wya, and Rathakara, inheritance will go to the capable; and the rest will depend upon him for subsistence. In the absence of the capable, all will have equal shares. Of sons begotten by a Brahman in the four castes, the son of a Brahman woman shall take four shares; the son of a Kshatriya woman three shares; the son of a Vaisya woman two shares; and the son of a Sudra woman, shall take one-third.

    "text": "A preceptor says that the son born in the field of another shall belong to the owner of that field. Others hold that since the mother, being a source of dependence for the seed (bija), the child shall belong to him from whom seed it is born. Kanitya says that it shall belong to both the living parents. The son begotten by a man on his wife who has gone through all the requisite ceremonies is called aurasa, a natural son; equal to him is the son of an appointed daughter (putrika-putra); the son begotten on a wife by another man, appointed for the purpose, and of the husband's lineage, is called kshetraja. On the death of the begetter, the kshetraja son will be the son to both the fathers, follow the gotras of both, offer funeral libations to both, and take possession of the property (riktha) of both of them. Of the same status, as the kshetraja is he who secretly sleeps in the house of relatives and is called gudhaja, secretly born. He who is cast off by his natural parents is called apaviddha, and will belong to that man who performs necessary religious ceremonials to him; the son of a maiden (before wedlock) is called kanina; the son born of a woman married while carrying in her womb is called sahagothra; the son of a pregnant woman (punarbhu) is called paunarbhava. A natural son can claim relationship both with his father and his father's relatives; but a son born to another man can have relationship only with his father. Of the same status as the latter is he who is given in adoption with water by both the father and mother and is called dattaka. The son who, either of his own accord or following the will of his relatives, gives himself to be the son of another is called kritima. He who is appointed as a son is called kritrima; he who is purchased is called krita.\n\nIn the absence of a natural son, these sons shall have one-third of inheritance while asaurasa sons shall have only food and clothing. Sons begotten by Brahmans or Kshatriyas on women of the same caste (savarna) are called savarna; but sons of lower castes are called asavarna. Of such asavarna sons, the son begotten by a Brahman on a Vaisya woman is called Ambashtha; on a Sudra woman is called Nishada or Parasava. The son begotten by a Kshatriya on a Sudra woman is known as Ugra. The son begotten by a Vaisya on a Sudra woman is no other than a Sudra. Sons begotten by men of impure life of any of the four castes on women of unknown caste are called Vratya. The above kinds of sons are called anuloma, sons begotten by men of higher caste on women of lower castes. Sons begotten by a Sudra on women of higher castes are Ayogava, Kshattri, and Chandala; by a Vaisya, Magadha, and Vaidehaka; and by a Kshatriya, Suta.\n\nBut men of the names Suta and Magadha, celebrated in the Purana, are quite different and of greater merit than either Brahmans or Kshatriyas. The above kind of sons are pratiloma, sons begotten by men of lower caste on women of higher castes and originate on account of kings violating all (dharmas).\n\nThe son begotten by an Ugra on a Nishada woman is called Kukkutaka, and the same is called Paulkasa if begotten in the inverse order. The son begotten by an Ambashtha on a Vaidehaka woman is named Vena; the same in the inverse order is called Kushavi. An Ugra begets on a Kshattriya woman a Kvavika. These and other such are offspring of outcastes (Antyavasayin).",

Similarly if any one mars another's enjoyment of such a building, he shall be fined double the above. ♦With the exception of private rooms and parlour (angaria) all other open parts of houses as well as apartments where fire is ever kindled for worship or a mortar is situated shall be thrown open for common use.1 [Thus ends Chapter VlIT, “ House-building, ” in the section of “ Buildings,99 in Book III, “ Concerning Law ” of the Arthasastra of Kautilya. End of the sixty-fifth chapter from the beginning.] CHAPTER IX Sale of Buildings, Boundary Disputes, Determination of Boundaries, and Miscellaneous Hindrances Kinsmen, neighbours, rich persons, shall in succession go for the purchase of land and other holdings. Neighbours of good family, 168 *n uum^er anc* different from the purchasers above mentioned, shall congregate in front of the building for sale and announce it as such. Accurate description of the exact boundaries of fields, gardens, buildings of any kind, lakes or tanks shall be declared before the eldore of the village or of the neighbourhood. If, on crying aloud thrice, ** Who will purchase this at such and such a price * ” no opposition is offered, the purchaser may proceed 1 The whole Chapter is full of obscure technical words.

If at this time the value of the property is increased by bidding, even among persons of the same community, the increased amount together with the toll on the value shall be handed over into the king’s treasury. The bidder (vikrayapratikroshta) shall pay the toll. Bidding for a property in the abseuce of its owner shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas. If no real owner conies forward even on the expiration of seven nights, the bidder may take possession of the property. Sale of building, etc. (vastu), to other than the bidder shall be punished with a fine of 200 panas ; if the property is other than buildings, etc. (vastu), the fine for the above offence shall be 24 panas. Thus the sale of buildings is dealt with. (Boundary Disputes) In all disputes regarding the boundary between anv two villages, neighbours or elders of five or ten villages (pa lcbagniml dasagrmri va) shall investigate the case on the evidence to be furnished from natural or artificial boundary marks.1 Elders among1 cultivators and herdsmen, or outsiders who have had the experience of former possession in the place, or one or many persons (not) personally acquainted w*ith the boundary marks under dispute shall first describe the boundary marks, and then, wearing unusual dress (viparltaveshah), shall lead the people (to the place).1 If the boundary marks just described arc not found, a fine of 1,000 pages shall be imposed (on the misleading or guilty person). If, however, they arrive at the exact spot, the party who- have either encroached upon the boundary or have destroyed the boundary marks shall be similarly punished/ The king shall beneficially distribute among others those holdings which have no boundarv marks or which have ceased to be 169 enjoyed by any person.4 {Disputes about Fields) Disputes concerning fields shall be decided by the elders of the neighbourhood or of the village.' If they are divided in their opinions, decision shall be sought for from a number of pure and respectable people, or, the disputants may equally divide the disputed holding among themselves.

Occupation of a holding (vastu) by force shall be punished as theft. If a holding is taken possession of by another on some reasonable grounds, lie shall be made to pay to the owner some rent, the amount of which is to be fixed after mature considerations of what is necessary for the subsistence of the cultivator of tbe bolding by him. Encroachment upon boundaries shall be punished with the first amercement. Destruction of boundaries shall be punished with a fine of 24 panas.1 The same rules shall hold good in disputes concerning hermitage iu forests, pasture lands, high roads, crema¬ tion-grounds, temples, sacrificial places, and places of pilgrimage. Thus the determination of boundaries is dealt with. (M%scrlfo neous Fli ndranees) All kinds of disputes shall depend for their settlement on the evidence to be furnished by neighbours.* Of pasture lands, plains, fields (kedara), flower gardens, a threshing-floor (khala), houses, and stables of horses (vahanakoshtha), hindrance to any one coming late in order shall be removed in preference to the one or more coming later in the series. With the exception of forests of Brahmans and of Soma plants, temples, and places of gods, and sacrifice and pilgrimage, all other places are plains. Any person causing, while making use of tanks, rivers, or fields, damage to the seeds sown in the fields of others, shall pay as much compensation to the sufferers as is equivalent to the damage. If the owner of any one of the following, viz. wet fields, gardens, or any kind of buildings, causes damage to those owned by others, the fine shall be double the value of the damage. The water of a lower tank shall not submerge the field irrigated by a higher tank. Tbe natural overflow of water from a higher to a lower tank shall not be stopped unless the lower tank has ceased to be useful for three consecutive years. Violation of this rule shall be punished with the first amercement. The same punishment shall be meted * Y. 2, 155. *N. II, 12. »X. 11.2.

For repairing neglected or ruined works of similar nature, taxes shall be remitted for four years. For improving or extending or restoring water-works over-grown with weeds, taxes shall be remitted for three years.

The school of Manu hold that the fine for the direct seizure of precious stones and superior or inferior raw materials shall be equal to their value. It is equal to twice the value of the articles according to the followers of Usanas. But Kautilya holds that it shall be proportional to the gravity of the crime. In the case of such articles of small value as flowers, fruits, vegetables, roots, turnips, cooked rice, skins, bamboo, and pots (earthenware) the fine shall range from 12 to 24 panas; for articles of great value, such as iron (kalayasa), wood, roping materials, and herds of minor quadrupeds, and cloth, the fine shall range from 24 to 48 panas; and for such articles of still greater value as copper, brass, bronze, glass, ivory and vessels, etc., it shall range from 48 to 96 panas. This fine is termed the first amercement. For the seizure of such as big quadrupeds, men, fields, houses, gold, gold coins, fine fabrics, etc., the fine shall range from 200 to 500 panas, which is termed the middlemost amercement. My preceptor holds that keeping, or causing to keep, by force either men or women in prison, or releasing them by force from imprisonment, shall be punished with fines ranging from 500 to 1,000 panas. This fine is termed the highest amercement. He who causes another to commit sahasa after the plans prepared by himself, shall be fined twice the value (of the person or property seized). An abettor who employs a hireling to commit sahasa by promising, “I shall pay thee as much gold as thou makest use of,” shall be fined four times the value. The school of Brhaspati are of opinion that if with the promise, “I will pay thee this amount of gold,” an abettor causes another to commit sahasa, the former shall be compelled to pay the promised amount of gold and a fine. But Kautilya holds that if an abettor extenuates his crime by pleading anger, intoxication or loss of sense (moham), he shall be punished as described above. In all kinds of fines below a hundred panas, the king shall take in addition to the fine 8 per cent more as rupa and in fines above one hundred, five per cent more as vyaji; these two kinds of exaction are just, inasmuch as the people are full of sins on the one hand, and kings are naturally misguided on the other.",

Among abusive expressions relating to the body, habits, learning, occupation, or nationalities, that of calling a deformed man by his right name, such as “the blind,” “the lame,” etc., shall be punished with a fine of 3 panas; and by false name, 6 panas. If the blind, the lame, etc., are insulted with such ironical expressions as “a man of beautiful eyes,” “a man of beautiful teeth,” etc., the fine shall be 12 panas. Likewise when a person is taunted for leprosy, lunacy, impotency and the like. Abusive expressions in general, no matter whether true, false, or reverse with reference to the abused, shall be punished with fines ranging above 12 panas, in the case of persons of equal rank. If persons abused happen to be of superior rank, the amount of the fines shall be doubled; if of lower rank, it shall be halved. For calumniating the wives of others, the amount of the fines shall be doubled. If abuse is due to carelessness, intoxication, or loss of sense, etc., the fines shall be halved. As to the reality of leprosy and lunacy, physicians or neighbours shall be authorities. As to the reality of impotency, women, the scum of urine, or the low specific gravity of faeces in water (the sinking of faeces in water) shall furnish the necessary evidence. (Speaking ill of Habits) If among Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, Sudras, and outcastes (antavasayins), any one of a lower caste abuses the habits of one of a higher caste, the fines imposed shall increase from 3 panas upwards (commencing from the lowest caste). If any one of a higher caste abuses one of a lower caste, fines imposed shall decrease from 2 panas. Contemptuous expressions, such as “a bad Brahman,” shall also be punished as above. The same rules shall apply to calumnies regarding learning (sruta), the profession of buffoons (vagjivana), artisans, or musicians, and relating to nationalities, such as Prajjdaka, Gandhara, etc. (Intimidation) If a person intimidates another by using such expressions as “I shall render thee thus,” the bravado shall be punished with half as much fine as will be levied on him who actually does so. If a person, being unable to carry his threat into effect, pleads provocation, intoxication, or loss of sense as his excuse, he shall be fined 12 panas. If a person capable to do harm and under the influence of enmity intimidates another, he shall be compelled to give life-long security for the well-being of the intimidated. Defamation of one’s own nation or village shall be punished with the first amercement; that of one’s own caste or assembly with the middlemost; and that of gods or temples (chaitya) with the highest amercement.",

My preceptor holds that quarrels or assaults of a remote date shall not be complained of. But Kautilya bolls that there shall be no acquittal for an offender. My preceptor thinks that he who is the first to complain of a quarrel wins, inasmuch as it is pain that drives one to law. But Kautilya objects to it; for whether complaint is lodged first or last, it is the evidence of witnesses that must be depended upon. In the absence of witnesses, the nature of the hurt and other circumstances connected with the quarrel in question shall be evi¬ dences. Sentence of punishment shall be passed the ver) day that a defendant accused of assault fails to answer the charge made against him.

For washing the best garments, the wages shall be one pana; for those of middle quality, half a pana; and for those of inferior quality, 1/4 of a pana. For rough washing on big stones, the wages shall be 1/8 of a pana. [In the first wash of red coloured clothes, there is a loss of 1/5th part (of the colour); in the second wash, 1/10th part. This explains subsequent losses. The rules pertaining to washermen are also applicable to weavers]. Goldsmiths who, without giving information to the government, purchase from unclean hands silver or golden articles without changing the form of the article shall be fined 12 panas; if they do the same changing the form of the articles (i.e., melting), they shall be fined 24 panas; if they purchase the same from the hands of a thief, they shall be fined 48 panas; if they purchase an article for less than its value after examining it in secret, they shall be liable to the punishment for theft; likewise for deception with manufactured articles. When a goldsmith steals from a customer gold equal to the weight of a karsha (1/4th of a suvarna), he shall be punished 200 panas; when he steals from a silver bar a bit of silver equal to the value of a karsha, he shall be fined 32 panas. This explains the proportional enhancement of punishment. When a goldsmith removes the whole amount of the gold (karana) from a customer by any spurious method or by any other deceitful combination (yoga), he shall be punished with a fine of 500 panas. In case of copper and silver, in any way, the offence shall be regarded as loss of their intrinsic colour. One mashaka shall be the fee for the manufacture of a silver dharana; for the manufacture of a suvarna, 1/6 of the same; or fees may be increased to twice the above according to the skill of the manufacturer. This explains the proportional increase of fees. Fees for the manufacture of articles from copper, brass, vaikrntaka, and arakata shall be five per cent. In the manufacture of articles from copper (?), 1/16th of the copper will be lost. For the loss of a pala in weight, a fine of twice the loss shall be imposed. This explains the proportional increase of punishments. In the manufacture of articles from lead and tin, 1/20th of the mass will be lost. One kakani shall be the fee for manufacturing an article of a pala in weight of the above. In the manufacture of articles from iron, 1/40th of the mass will be lost; two kakanis shall be the fee for manufacturing an article of a pala in weight from iron.

When the examiner of coins misappropriates a masha from a current coin of a karshapana, the tax (vyaji) of five per cent on the coin having been duly paid, he shall be fined 12 panas. This explains the proportional increase of fines. When a person causes a counterfeit coin to be manufactured, or accepts it, or exchanges it, he shall be fined 1,000 panas; he who enters a counterfeit coin into the treasury shall be put to death.

He may either do such works as are usually resorted to in calamities; he may show favor by distributing either his own collection of provisions or the hoarded income of the rich among the people; or seek for help from his friends among kings. Or the policy of thinning the rich by exacting excessive revenue, or causing them to vomit their accumulated wealth, may be resorted to. Or the king with his subjects may emigrate to another kingdom with abundant harvest. Or he may remove himself with his subjects to sea shores or to the banks of rivers or lakes. He may cause his subjects to grow grains, vegetables, roots, and fruits wherever water is available. He may, by hunting and fishing on a large scale, provide the people with wild beasts, birds, elephants, tigers or fish.\n(Rats) To ward off the danger from rats, cats and mongoose may be let loose. The destruction of rats that have been caught shall be punished with a fine of 12 paṇas. The same punishment shall be meted out to those who, with the exception of wild tribes, do not hold their dogs in check. With a view to destroy rats, grains mixed with the milk of the milk-hedge plants, or grains mixed with such ingredients as are treated of in Book XIV may be left on the ground. Ascetics and prophets may perform auspicious ceremonials. On new and full moon days rats may be worshipped. Similar measures may also be taken against the danger from locusts, birds and insects.\n(Snakes) When there is fear from snakes, experts in applying remedies against snake poison shall resort to incantations and medicines; or they may destroy snakes in a body; or those who are learned in the Atharvaveda may perform auspicious rites. On new and full moon days (snakes) may be worshipped.",

If the judge accedes to the request, he shall be punished as the receiver of bribes, and banished. The same rule shall apply to commissioners.\n\nA spy may tell the congregation of villagers (gramakuta) or its superintendent that a wealthy man of wicked character is involved in some trouble, and that this opportunity may be availed of to acquire money from him. If either the one or the other complies with the spy, banishment shall be ordered under the proclamation of \"extortion.\"\n\nUnder the pretense of having been charged with a criminal offense, a spy may, with the promise of large sums of money, begin to deal with false witnesses. If they agree with him, they shall be proclaimed as false witnesses and banished. Manufacturers of counterfeit coins shall be treated similarly.\n\nWhoever is believed to acquire for others the love of women by means of magical charms, drugs, or ceremonies performed on cremation grounds may be approached by a spy with the request that the wife, daughter, or daughter-in-law of someone, whom the spy pretends to love, may be made to return his love, and that a certain amount of money may be accepted. If he consents to it, he shall be proclaimed as one engaged in witchcraft (krityakarmana), and banished. Similar steps may be taken against persons engaged in such witchcraft as is hurtful to others.\n\nWhoever is suspected of administering poison by reason of his talking of it, or selling or purchasing mercury, or using it in preparing medicines, may be approached with the tale that a certain enemy of the spy may be killed and that a certain amount of money may be received as reward. If he does so, he shall be proclaimed as a poisoner, and banished. Similar steps may be taken against those who deal with medicines prepared from poisonous plants.\n\nWhoever is suspected of manufacturing counterfeit coins, in that he often purchases various kinds of metals, alkalis, charcoal, bellows, pincers, crucibles, stoves, and hammers, has his hands and clothes dirty with ashes and smoke, or possesses such other accessories as are necessary for this manufacture, may be requested by a spy to take the latter as an apprentice, and being gradually betrayed by the spy, such person, on proclamation of his guilt as the manufacturer of false coins, shall be banished. Similar steps may be taken against those who lower the quality of gold by mixing it with an alloy, or deal with counterfeit gold coins.\n\nThere are thirteen kinds of criminals who, secretly attempting to live by foul means, destroy the peace of the country. They shall either be banished or made to pay an adequate compensation, according as their guilt is light or serious.",

Having opened the doors seemingly with the power of incantation, the youths may be asked to get in. Having, in the midst of wakeful watchmen under concert, rendered the youths invisible with incantation, they may be asked to go into the interior. Having caused the watchmen seemingly sleepy, the youths may, as ordered, move the beds of the watchmen with no hesitation. Persons under the guise of others’ wives may seemingly, under the influence of incantation, please the youths.\n\nSoon after the youths have actually experienced the powers of incantation, they may be taught the recitation and other accessory procedure of that art. They may afterward be asked to test the power of their new learning in plundering such houses as contain articles or money with marks of identification, and simultaneously caught hold of in the very act. They may either be arrested while selling, purchasing, or mortgaging articles with marks of identification, or caught hold of while under intoxication brought about by medicinal drinks.\n\nFrom these youths thus arrested may be gathered information regarding the past life of them and of their accomplices. Spies under the disguise of old and notorious thieves may similarly associate with robbers and, instituting similar measures, cause the latter to be arrested.\n\nThe collector-general shall exhibit these arrested robbers and announce to the public that their arrest is due to the instructions obtained from the king, who has learned the divine art of catching robbers: “I shall similarly catch hold of other robbers again and again, and you, people, ought to prevent any one of your own kinsmen from his wicked deeds.”\n\nWhoever is known, through the information of spies, to have been a robber of yoking ropes, whips and other agricultural implements may be arrested and told that his arrest is due to the omniscient power of the king. Spies under the guise of old and notorious robbers, herdsmen, hunters, or keepers of hounds may mix themselves with criminal tribes living in forests, and conspire with them to attack villages or caravansaries which, according to previous plan, contain plenty of counterfeit gold and other articles. During the tumult, they may be killed by armed men concealed for the purpose. Or on their securing plenty of stolen treasure, the robbers may either be made to eat such food as is mixed with the intoxicating juice of madana plant, or caught hold of either while sleeping with fatigue caused by incessant movements, or while under intoxication due to the drinking of medicinal beverage on the occasion of religious festivals.\n\nThe collector-general shall exhibit in public these and other arrested criminals, and proclaim the omniscient power of the king among the people at large.",

By cognising wisdom in others, he is pleased , he attends to the speech of others; he gives a seat; allows himself to be seen in private ; does not suspect in places of suspicion ; takes delight in conversation ; spontaneously looks to things without being reminded; tolerates what is said agreeably to reason ; orders with smiling face ; touches with the hand ; does not laugh at what is commendable ; commends the qualities of another behind him ; remembers (the courtier) while taking luncheon ; engages himself in sports accompanied by (the courtier) ; consults (the courtier) when in trouble; honours the followers of the courtier; reveals the secret ; honours the courtier more and more ; gives him wealth ; and averts his troubles ;—these are the signs of the king s satisfaction (with the courtier). The revere of the above indicates his (the king’s) displeasure. Still, we shall describe them in plain terms: Angry appearance when the courtier is in sight; evading or refusal to hear his speech; no inclination to give him a seat or to see I change in syllables and accents while talking to him; seeing with one eye; brow-beating; biting the lips; rise of sweat; hard breathing and smiliug with no palpable cause ; talking to himself; sudden bending or raising of the body ; touching the body or the seat of another; molestation to another ; contempt of lcurning, caste, and country (of the courtier) ; condemnation of a colleague of equal defects ; condemnation of a man of opposite defects; condemnation of his opponent; failure to acknowledge his good deeds ; enumeration of his bad deeds; attention to whoever enters into the chamber ;* too much gift ; uttering falsehood ; change in the conduct and attitude of visitors to the king;",

That foe who is equally of high birth and occupies a territory close to that of the conqueror is a natural enemy, while he who is merely contiguous and creates a menace to the conqueror is a factitious enemy. He whose friendship is derived from father and grandfather, and who is situated close to the territory of the immediate enemy of the conqueror is a natural friend; while he whose friendship is courted for self-maintenance is an acquired friend. The king who occupies a territory close to both the conqueror and his immediate enemy in front and who is capable of helping both the kings – whether united or disunited – or of routing either of them individually is termed a Madhyama (mediatory) king. He who is situated beyond the territory of any of the above kings, and who is very powerful and capable of helping the enemy, the conqueror, and the Madhyama king, together or individually, or of resisting any of them individually, is a neutral king (Udāsīna). These are the (twelve) primary kings.\nThe conqueror, his friend, and his friend's friend are the three primary kings constituting a circle of states. As each of these three kings possesses the five elements of sovereignty, such as the minister, the country, the fort, the treasury, and the army, a circle of states consists of eighteen elements. Thus, it needs no commentary to understand that the (three) Circles of States having the enemy (of the conqueror), the Madhyama king, or the neutral king at the centre of each of the three circles, are different from that of the conqueror. Thus there are four primary Circles of States, twelve kings, sixty elements of sovereignty, and seventy-two elements of state. Each of the twelve primary kings shall have their elements of sovereignty, power and end. Strength is power, and happiness is the end. Strength is of three kinds: power of deliberation is intellectual strength; the possession of a prosperous treasury and a strong army is the strength of sovereignty; and martial power is physical strength. The end is also of three kinds: that which is attainable by deliberation is the end of deliberation; that which is attainable by the strength of sovereignty is the end of sovereignty; and that which is to be secured by perseverance is the end of martial power. The possession of power and happiness in a greater degree makes a king superior to another; in a less degree, inferior; and in an equal degree, equal. Hence a king shall always endeavour to augment his power and elevate his happiness. A king who is equal to his enemy in the number of his sovereign elements shall, in virtue of his own righteous conduct or with the help of those who are hostile or conspiring against his enemy, endeavour to throw his enemy's power into the shade; or if he thinks: “Though my enemy is possessed of immense power, will yet in the near future hurt the elements of his own sovereignty by using contumelious language, by inflicting severe punishments, and by squandering his wealth; that though attaining success for a time, yet he will blindly take himself to hunting, gambling, drinking and women; that as his subjects are disaffected, himself powerless and haughty, I can overthrow him; that when attacked, he will take shelter with all his paraphernalia into a fort or elsewhere; that possessed as he is of a strong army, he will just fall into my hands, as he has neither a friend nor a fort to help him; that a distant king is desirous to put down his own enemy, and also me (in order to help me to put down my own considerable enemy when my resources are poor); that I may be invited as a Madhyama king” – for these reasons the conqueror may allow his enemy to grow in strength and in attaining success for the time being. Throwing the circumference of the Circle of States beyond his friends' territory, and looking upon the kings of these states as the spokes of that circle, the conqueror shall make himself the nave of that circle. A rebellious or a conquerable enemy will, when placed between a conqueror and the conqueror’s friends, appear to be growing in strength.",

    "section": "Book VII, Chapter I: The Sixfold Policy",
    "text": "The Circle of States is the source of the six-fold policy. By āsana, my teacher says that peace (sandhi), war (vigraha), observance of neutrality (āsana), marching (yātrā), alliance (samsraya), and making peace with one and waging war with another are the six forms of state policy. But Parāśara holds that there are only two forms of policy, peace and war, inasmuch as the six forms result from these two primary forms of policy. While Kauṭilya holds that, as their respective conditions differ, the forms of policy are six. Of these, agreement with pledges is peace; offensive operation is war; indifference is neutrality; making preparations is marching; seeking the protection of another is alliance; and making peace with one and waging war with another is termed a double policy (dvaidhībhāva). These are the six forms. Whoever is inferior to another shall make peace with him; whoever is superior in power shall wage war; whoever thinks, “No enemy can hurt me, nor am I strong enough to destroy my enemy,” shall observe neutrality; whoever is possessed of necessary means shall march against his enemy; whoever is devoid of hereditary strength to defend himself shall seek the protection of another; whoever thinks that help is necessary to work out an end shall make peace with one and wage war with another. Such is the aspect of the six forms of policy.\nOf these, a wise king shall observe that form of policy which, in his opinion, enables him to build forts, to construct buildings and commercial roads, to open new plantations and villages, to exploit mines and timber and elephant forests and at the same time to harass similar works of his enemy. Whoever thinks himself to be growing in power more rapidly both in quality and quantity (than his enemy), and the reverse of his enemy, may neglect his enemy’s progress for the time. If any two kings, hostile to each other, find the time of achieving the results of their respective works to be equal, they shall make peace with each other. No king shall keep that form of policy, which causes him the loss of profit from his own works, but which entails no such loss on the enemy; for it is deterioration. Whoever thinks that in the course of time his loss will be less than his acquisition as contrasted with that of his enemy, may neglect his temporary deterioration. If any two kings, hostile to each other, and deteriorating, expect to acquire equal amount of wealth in equal time, they shall make peace with each other. That position in which neither progress nor retrogression is seen is stagnation. Whoever thinks his stagnancy to be of a shorter duration and his prosperity in the long run to be greater than his enemy’s may neglect his temporary stagnation. My teacher says that if any two kings, who are hostile to each other, and are in a stationary condition, expect to acquire equal amount of wealth and power in equal time, they shall make peace with each other. “Of course,” says Kauṭilya, “there is no other alternative.”\nOr if a king thinks: “That keeping the agreement of peace, I can undertake productive works of considerable importance and destroy at the same time those of my enemy; or apart from enjoying the results of my own works, I shall also enjoy those of my enemy in virtue of the agreement of peace; or I can destroy the works of my enemy by employing spies and other secret means; or by holding out such inducements as a happy dwelling, rewards, remission of taxes, little work and large profits and wages, I can empty my enemy’s country of its population, with which he has been able to carry his own works: or being allied with a king of considerable power, my enemy will have his own works destroyed; or I can prolong my enemy’s hostility with another king whose threats have driven my enemy to seek my protection; or being allied with me, my enemy can harass the country of another king who hates me: or oppressed by another king, the subjects of my enemy will immigrate into my country, and I can, therefore, achieve the results of my own works very easily; or being in a precarious condition due to the destruction of his works, my enemy will not be so powerful as to attack me or by exploiting my own resources in alliance with any two (friendly) kings, I can augment my resources; or if a Circle of States is formed by my enemy as one of its members, I can divide them and combine with the others; or by threats or favour, I can catch hold of my enemy and when he desires to be a member of my Circle of States, I can make him incur the displeasure of the other members and fall a victim to their own fury” – if a king thinks thus, then he may increase his resources by keeping peace.",

    "text": "When the advantages derivable from peace and war are of equal value, one should prefer peace; for disadvantages such as the loss of power and wealth, sojourning, and ruin are ever attending upon war. The same holds good in the case of neutrality and war.\nOf the two forms of policy (double and alliance), double policy (i.e., making peace with one and waging war with another) is preferable; for whoever adopts the double policy enriches himself, being ever attentive to his own works, whereas an allied king has to help his ally at his own expense. One shall make an alliance with a king who is stronger than one’s neighboring enemy; in the absence of such a king, one should ingratiate oneself with one’s neighboring enemy, either by applying money or army or by ceding a port or one’s territory and by keeping oneself aloof; for there can be no greater evil than alliance with a king of inconsiderable power, unless one is actually attacked by one’s enemy. A powerless king should behave as a conquered king (towards his immediate enemy); but when he finds that the time of his own well-being is at hand, due to a fatal disaster in his enemy’s army, increase of army, or a friend with similarities that are using his enemy, then under the pretense of performing glorious expiatory rites to avert the danger of his enemy, he may get out of the enemy’s court; or if he is in his own territory, he should not go to see his enemy; or if he is near to his enemy, he may murder the enemy when opportunity affords itself. A king who is situated between two powerful kings shall seek protection from the stronger of the two: or from one of them on whom he can rely; or he may make peace with both of them on equal terms. Then he may begin to act against one of them against the other by telling each that the other tyrant is causing utter ruin to himself, and thus, cause dissension between them. When they are divided, he may put down each separately by secret or covert means. Or, throwing himself under the protection of any two immediate kings of considerable power, he may defend himself against an immediate enemy. Or, having made an alliance with a chief in a stronghold, he may adopt the double policy (i.e., make peace with one of the two kings and wage war with another). Or, he may adapt himself to circumstances, depending upon the cause of peace and war. Or, he may make friendship with traitors, enemies, and wild chiefs who are conspiring against both the kings. Or, pretending to be a close friend of one of them, he may strike the other at the latter’s weak point by employing enemies and wild tribes. Or, having made friendship with both, he may form a Circle of States. Or, he may make an alliance with the Madhyama or the neutral king; and with this help, put down one of them or both. Or when hurt by both, he may seek protection from a king of righteous character among the Madhyama king, the neutral king, and their friends or equals, or from any other king whose subjects are so disposed as to increase his happiness and peace, with whose help he may be able to recover his lost position, with whom his ancestors were in close intimacy of blood relationship, and in whose kingdom he can find a number of powerful friends. Of two powerful kings who are on admirable terms with each other, a king shall make an alliance with one of them who likes him and whom he likes; this is the best way of making alliance.",

    "section": "Chapter III: The Treatment of Equal, Inferior and Superior Kings; and Four Kinds of Agreements in Peace",
    "text": "A king desirous of expanding his own power shall make use of the six-fold policy. Agreements of peace shall be made with equal and superior kings, and all inferior kings shall be attacked. Whoever chooses to wage war with his superior king will be reduced to the same condition as that of a foot-soldier opposing an elephant. Just as the collision of an unbaked clay-vessel with a similar vessel is destined to cause the destruction of both, so war with an equal king brings ruin to both. Like a stone striking an earthen pot, a superior king obtains decisive victory over an inferior king. If a superior king discards the proposal of an inferior king for peace, the latter should take the attitude of a conquered king or play the part of an inferior king towards a superior. When a king of equal power does not accept peace, then the same amount of restitution as his opponent has received at his hands should be given to him in return; or it is pressure that brings about peace between any two kings: no piece of iron that is not made red-hot will combine with another piece of iron. When an inferior king is all submissiveness, peace should be made with him; for when provoked by causing him troubles and anger, an inferior king, like a wild fire, will attack his enemy and will also be favored by (the) Circle of States. When a king at peace with another finds that greedy, impoverished, and oppressed as are the subjects of his enemy, they do not yet immigrate into his own territory lest they might be called back by their master, then he should–though of inferior power–proclaim war against his ally. When a king at war with another finds that greedy, impoverished, and oppressed as are the subjects of his enemy, still they do not come to his side in consequence of the troubles of war, then he should, though of superior power, make peace with his enemy or remove the iron hiss of war as far as possible.\nWhen one of the two kings at war with each other and equally involved in trouble finds his own troubles to be greater than his enemy’s, and thinks that by getting rid of his enemy’s trouble his enemy can successfully wage war with him, then he should, though possessing greater resources, sue for peace.  When, either in peace or war, a king finds neither loss to his enemy nor gain to himself, he should, though superior, observe neutrality. When a king finds the trouble of his enemy to be irremediable, he should, though of inferior power, march against the enemy. When a king finds himself threatened by imminent danger or trouble, he should, though superior, seek the protection of another. When a king is sure to achieve his desired ends by making peace with one and waging war with another, he should, though superior, adopt the double policy. Thus it is that the six forms of policy are applied together.\nAs to their special application:\nWhen a powerless king finds himself attacked by a powerful king leading a Circle of States, he should forthwith sue for peace on the condition of offering treasure, army, himself, or his territory.\nAgreement made on the condition that with a fixed number of troops or with the flower of his army, a king should present himself (when called for), is peace termed skandhopaneya, “giving himself as flesh.”\nAgreement made on the condition that the commander of the army together with the heir-apparent should present himself (when called for) is peace termed purushantarasanidhi, “peace with hostages other than the king himself”; and it is conducive to self-preservation, as it does not require the personal attendance of the king.\nAgreement made on the condition that the king himself or someone else should march with the army to some place, as required, is peace termed adrishtopanayana, “peace with no specific person to serve as hostage”; and it is conducive to the safety of the king and the chiefs of his army.",

    "text": "Neutrality or marching after proclaiming war or peace has been explained. Sthana (keeping quiet), asana (withdrawn from hostility), and upekshana (negligence) are synonymous with the word \"neutrality.\" As to the difference between three aspects of neutrality:—Keeping quiet, maintaining a particular kind of policy is sthana; withdrawn from hostile actions for the sake of one's own interests is asana; and taking no steps or strategic measures against anyone is upekshana.\nWhen two kings, who, though bent on making conquests, are desirous of peace, are unable to proceed, one against the other, they may keep quiet after proclaiming war or after making peace. When a king finds it possible to put down by means of his own army, or with the help of a friend, or of wild tribes another king of equal or superior power, then having set up proper safeguards against both internal and external enemies, he may keep quiet after proclaiming war.\nWhen a king is convinced that his own subjects are brave, united, prosperous, and able not only to carry on their own works without interference, but also to harass his enemy's works, then he may keep quiet after proclaiming war. When a king finds that his enemy's subjects are ill-treated, impoverished, and greedy, and are ever being oppressed by the inroads of the army, thieves, and wild tribes they can be made through intrigue to join his side; or that his own agriculture and commerce are flourishing while those of his enemy are waning; or that as the subjects of his enemy are suffering from famine, they will immigrate into his own territory; or that, though his own returns of agriculture and commerce are falling and those of his enemy increasing, his own subjects will never desert him in favour of his enemy; or that by proclaiming war, he can carry off, by force, the grain, cattle, and gold of his enemy; or that he can prevent the import of his enemy's merchandise, which is destructive of his own commerce; or that valuable merchandise would come to his own territory, leaving that of his enemy; or that war being proclaimed, his enemy would be unable to put down traitors, enemies, and wild tribes and other rebels, and would be involved in war with them; or that his own friend would in a very short time accumulate wealth without much loss and would not fail to follow him in his march, since no friend would neglect the opportunity of acquiring a fertile land and a prosperous friend like himself—then in view of inflicting injuries on his enemy and of exhibiting his own power, he may keep quiet after proclaiming war. But our teacher says that, turning against such a king, his enemy may overthrow him. \"Not so,\" says Kautilya, \"impoverishment of the enemy who is free from troubles is all that is aimed at (when a king keeps quiet after proclaiming war). As soon as such a king acquires sufficient strength, he will undertake to destroy the enemy. To such a king, the enemy's enemy will send help to secure his own personal safety.\" Whoever is provided with necessary strength may keep quiet after proclaiming war. When the policy of keeping quiet after proclaiming war is found productive of unfavourable results, then one shall keep quiet after making peace. Whoever has grown in strength in consequence of keeping quiet after proclaiming war should proceed to attack his helpless enemy.\nWhen a king finds that his enemy has fallen into troubles: that the troubles of his enemy's subjects can by no means be remedied; that as his enemy's subjects are oppressed, ill-treated, disaffected, impoverished, become effeminate and disunited among themselves, they can be prevailed upon to desert their master; that his enemy's country has fallen a victim to the inroads of such calamities as fire, flood, pestilence, epidemics (maraka) and famine and is therefore losing the flower of its youth and its defensive power—then he should march after proclaiming war.\nWhen a king is so fortunate as to have a powerful friend in front and a powerful ally (mitra) in the rear, both with brave and loyal subjects, while the reverse is the case with his enemies, both in front and in the rear, and when he finds it possible for his friend to hold his frontal enemy in check, and for his ally to keep his rear-enemy (parshnigraha) at bay, then he may march after proclaiming war against his frontal enemy. When a king finds it possible to achieve the fruits of victory single-handed in a very short time, then he may march (against his frontal enemy) after proclaiming war against his rear-enemies; otherwise, he should march after making peace (with his rear enemies). When a king finds himself unable to confront his enemy single-handed and when it is necessary that he should march, then he should make the expedition in combination with kings of inferior, equal, or superior powers. When the object aimed at is of a definite nature, then the share of spoils should be fixed; but when it is of a manifold or complex nature, then with no fixity in the share of the spoils. When no such combination is possible, he may request a king either to supply him with the army for a fixed share, or to accompany him for an equal share of the spoil. When profit is certain, then they should march with fixed shares of profit; but when it is uncertain, with no fixity of shares. A share of profit proportional to the strength of the army is of the first kind; that which is equal to the effort made is the best; shares may be allotted in proportion to the profit earned or to the capital invested.",

My teacher says that, as a matter of easy conquest, the assailable enemy under worse troubles should be marched against first. Not so, says Kautilya: the conqueror should march against the strong enemy under less troubles, for the troubles of the strong enemy, though less, will be augmented when attacked. True, that the worse troubles of the assailable enemy will be still worse when attacked. But when left to himself, the strong enemy under less troubles will endeavour to get rid of his troubles and unite with the assailable enemy or with another enemy in the rear of the conqueror. When there are two assailable enemies, one of virtuous character and under worse troubles, and another of vicious character under less troubles, and with disloyal subjects, which of them is to be marched against first? When the enemy of virtuous character and under worse troubles is attacked, his subjects will help him; whereas, the subjects of the other vicious character and under less troubles will be indifferent. Disloyal or indifferent subjects will endeavour to destroy even a strong king. Hence the conqueror should march against that enemy whose subjects are disloyal. Which is to be marched against—an enemy whose subjects are impoverished and greedy or an enemy whose subjects are being oppressed? My teacher says that the conqueror should march against that enemy whose subjects are impoverished and greedy, for impoverished and greedy subjects suffer themselves to be won over to the other side by intrigue, and are easily excited. But not so the oppressed subjects whose wrath can be pacified by punishing the chief men (of the state). Not so, says Kautilya; for though impoverished and greedy they are loyal to their master and are ready to stand for his cause and to defeat any intrigue against him; for it is in loyalty that all other good qualities have their strength. Hence the conqueror should march against the enemy whose subjects are oppressed. Which enemy is to be marched against—a powerful enemy of wicked character or a powerless enemy of righteous character? The strong enemy of wicked character should be marched against. For when he is attacked his subjects will not help him, but either put him down or go to the side of the conqueror. But, when the enemy of virtue character is attacked, his subjects will help him or die with him.",

Hence no king should give room to such causes as would bring about impoverishment, greed or disaffection among his people. If, however, they appear, he should at once take remedial measures against them. Which (of the three) is the worse—an impoverished people, a greedy people, or a disaffected people? An impoverished people are ever apprehensive of oppression and destruction (by enemies, etc.) and therefore desirous of getting rid of their impoverishment or of waging war or of migrating elsewhere. A greedy people are ever discontented and they yield themselves to the intrigues of an enemy. A disaffected people rise against their master along with his enemy. When the dwindling of the people is due to want of gold and grain, it is a calamity fraught with danger to the whole of the kingdom and can be remedied with difficulty. The dearth of efficient men can be made up by means of gold and grain. Greed is partly found among a few chief old officers, and it can be got rid of or satisfied by allowing them to plunder an enemy's wealth. Disaffection and disloyalty can be got rid of by putting down the leaders, for in the absence of a leader or leaders, the people are easily governed. Having thus considered the causes which bring about peace or war, one should combine with kings of considerable power and righteous character and march against one's enemy.",

An agreement of peace may be made with promise to carry out a definite work (paripanita) or with no such promise (aparipanita). When the agreement is to the effect that, “Thou march to that place, and I shall march to this place,” it is termed an agreement of peace to carry out a work in a definite locality. When it is agreed upon that, “Thou be engaged so long, I shall be engaged thus long,” it is an agreement to attain an object in a fixed time. When it is agreed upon that, “Thou try to accomplish that work, and I shall try to finish this work,” it is an agreement to achieve a definite end. When the conqueror thinks that, “My enemy (now an ally) has to march through an unknown country, which is intersected with mountains, forests, rivers, forts and deserts, which is devoid of foodstuffs, people, pastoral grounds, fodder, firewood and water, and which is far away, different from other countries, and not affording suitable grounds for the exercise of his army; and I have to traverse a country of quite the reverse description,” then he should make an agreement to carry out a work in a definite locality. When the conqueror thinks that, “My enemy has to work with foodstuffs falling short and with no comfort during the rainy, hot or cold season, giving rise to various kinds of diseases and obstructing the free exercise of his army during a shorter or longer period of time than necessary for the accomplishment of the work in hand; and I have to work during a time of quite the reverse nature,” then he should make time a factor of the agreement.",

Likewise with space and time, with time and work, with space and work, and with space, time, and work, modes of terms of an agreement, it resolves itself into seven forms. Long before making such an agreement, the conqueror has to fix his own work and then attempt to overreach his enemy. When in order to destroy an enemy who has fallen into troubles and who is hasty, indolent, and not foresighted, an agreement of peace with no terms of time, space, or work is made, the conqueror should think thus: ‘Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror has reason to fear his ally though of equal power, when the latter attains success in his mission; having succeeded in his mission, an ally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the conqueror of superior power. An ally of superior power should not be relied upon, for prosperity changes the mind. Even with little or no share in the spoils, an ally of superior power may go back, appearing contented; but some time afterwards, he may not fail to sit on the lap of the conqueror and carry off twice the amount of share due to him. Having been satisfied with mere victory, the leading conqueror should discharge his allies, having satisfied them with their shares he may allow himself to be conquered by them instead of attempting to conquer them (in the matter of spoils); it is thus that a king can win the good graces of his Circle of States.’",

    "text": "Peace made with an enemy merely for mutual peace, and when, under cover of such an agreement, the enemy is caught hold of at his weakest point and struck, it is termed peace with no definite terms (upariplupta).  ‘Having kept a neighbouring enemy engaged with another neighbouring enemy, a wise king should proceed against a third king, and having conquered that enemy of equal power, take possession of his territory.’ Hence peace with no specific end (atirthikasandhi), peace with binding terms (kritasheshana), the breaking of peace (kritavaimokshana), and restoration of peace broken (punarukriya) are other forms of peace. Open battle, treacherous battle, and silent battle (i.e., killing an enemy by employing spies when there is no talk of battle at all) are the three forms of battle. When, by making use of conciliation and other forms of stratagem, a new agreement of peace is made and the rights of equal, inferior, and superior powers concerned in the agreement are defined according to their respective positions, it is termed an agreement of peace with no specific end (other than self-preservation). When, by the employment of friendly agents (in the Courts of each other), the agreement of peace made is kept valid and the terms are invariably observed and strictly maintained so that no dissension may creep among the parties, it is termed peace with terms. When, having proved through the agency of traitors and spies the treachery of a king who has made an agreement of peace, the agreement is broken, it is termed the breaking of peace. When reconciliation is made with a servant, a friend, or any other renegade, it is termed the reiteration of broken peace. There are four persons who run away from, and return to, their master: one who had reason to run away and to return; one who had no reason either to run away or to return; one who had reason to run away, but none to return; and one who had no reason to run away, but had reason to come back. He who runs away owing to his master's fault and returns in consideration of his master’s good nature, or he who runs away attracted by the good nature of his master’s enemy and returns finding fault with the enemy is to be reconciled as he had reason to run away and to return. Whoever runs away owing to his own fault and returns without minding the good nature either of his old or new master is a fickle-minded person having no explanation to account for his conduct, and he should have no chance of reconciliation. Whoever runs away owing to his master's fault and returns owing to his own defeat is unprincipled who had reason to run away but none to return: and his case is to be well considered before he is taken back. Whoever returns deputed by the enemy; or of his own accord with the intention of hurting his old master; or coming to know that his old master is attempting to put down the enemy, his new master, and apprehensive of danger to himself; or looking on the attempt of his new master to destroy his old master as cruelty—these should be examined; and if he is found to be actuated with good motives, he is to be taken back respectfully; otherwise, he should be kept at a distance. Whoever runs away owing to his own fault and returns owing to his new master's wickedness is a renegade who had no reason to run away but had reason to come back; such a person is to be examined. When a king thinks that, ‘This renegade supplies me with full information about my enemy’s weakness, and, therefore, he deserves to remain here; his own people with me are in friendship with my friends and at enmity with my enemies, and are easily excited at the sight of greedy and cruel persons of a band of enemies,’ he may treat such a renegade as deserved.  Whoever has failed to achieve profit from his works, lost his strength, or made his learning a commercial article, or is very greedy, inquisitive to see different countries, dead to the feelings of friendship, or has strong enemies, deserves to be abandoned. But it is humility, unprofessional business, and lack of forbearance (to do so). Whoever is injurious to the king's interests should be abandoned, while he who is injurious to the interests of the enemy should be reconciled; and whoever is injurious to the interests of both the king and his enemy should be carefully examined. When it is necessary to make peace with a king with whom no peace ought to be made, defensive measures should be taken at that point where he can show his power. In restoring broken peace, a renegade or a person inclined towards the enemy should be kept at such a distance that, till the close of his life, he may be useful to the state. Or, he may be set against the enemy or may be employed as a captain of an army to guard wild tracts against enemies, or thrown somewhere on the boundary, he may be employed to carry on a secret trade in new or old commodities in foreign countries, and may accordingly be accused of conspiracy with the enemy. Or, in the interests of future peace, a renegade who must be put to death may at once be destroyed. This bad character which has from the beginning grown upon a man owing to his association with enemies is, moreover, fraught with danger as constant living in company with a snake; and is ever threatening with destruction just as a pigeon living on the seeds of plaksha (holy fig-tree) is to the shimshapa (silk cotton) tree. When battle is fought in daylight and in some locality, it is termed an open battle. Threatening in one direction, assault in another, destruction of an enemy captured while he was careless or in trouble; and bribing a portion of the army and destroying another portion, are forms of treacherous fight; an attempt to win over the chief officers of the enemy by intrigue is the characteristic of silent battle.",

Or if he thinks that ‘(my enemy) will neither capture my rear nor make an alliance with my assailable enemy against whom I am going to march; I shall have double the strength with him, i.e. the enemy suing peace; (my ally) will not only facilitate the collection of my revenue and supplies and put down the internal enemies who are causing me immense trouble, but also punish wild tribes and their followers entrenched in their strongholds, reduce my assailable enemy to a precarious condition or compel him to accept the proffered peace, and having received as much profit as he desires, he will endeavour to endear my other enemies to me,’ then the conqueror may proclaim war against one and make peace with another, and endeavour to get an army for money or money for the supply of an army from among his neighbouring kings. When the kings of superior, equal or inferior power make peace with the conqueror and agree to pay a greater, or equal, or less amount of profit in proportion to the army supplied, it is termed even peace; that which is of the reverse character is styled uneven peace; and when the profit is proportionally very high, it is termed deception (atisandhi). When a king of superior power is involved in troubles, or is contented, or is afflicted with misfortune, his enemy, though of inferior power, may request of him the help of his army in return for a share in the profit proportional to the strength of the army supplied. If the king to whom peace is offered on such terms is powerful enough to retaliate, he may select war; otherwise, he may accept the terms. In view of more land for the purpose of exacting enhanced revenue to be utilised in recouping his own strength against enemies, an inferior king may request of a superior the help of the latter’s army for the purpose of guarding the land and the revenue of his territory in return for the payment of a greater share in the profit than the strength of the army supplied deserves. The king to whom such a proposal is made may accept the proposal if the proposer is of good intentions; otherwise, he may declare war. When a king of inferior power or one who is provided with the aid of forts and friends has to make a short march in order to capture an enemy or to receive expected profit, he may request a third king of superior power, involved under various troubles and misfortunes, the help of the latter’s army in return for the payment of a share in the profit less than the strength of the army supplied deserves. If the king to whom this proposal is made is powerful enough to retaliate, he may declare war; otherwise, he may accept the proposal. When the king of superior power and free from all trouble is desirous of causing to his enemy loss of men and money in the latter's ill-considered undertakings or of lending his own treacherous army abroad, or bringing his enemy under the clutches of an inimical army, or of causing trouble to a reducible and tottering enemy by setting an inferior king against that enemy, or is desirous of having peace for the sake of peace itself and is possessed of good intentions, he may accept a low share in the profit (from his army supplied to another), and endeavour to make wealth by combining with an ally if the latter is equally of good intentions; otherwise, he may declare war (against that ally). A king may deceive or help his equal as follows: When a king proposes peace to another king of equal power on the condition of receiving the help of the latter’s army strong enough to oppose an enemy’s army, or to guard the front, centre, and rear of his territory, or to help his friend, or to protect any other wild tracts of his territory, in return for the payment of a share in the profit proportionally equal to the strength of the army supplied, the latter may accept the terms if the proposer is of good intentions; otherwise, he may declare war. When a king of equal power, capable of receiving the help of his people from another quarter requests, instead of another king in trouble, due to the diminished strength of the elements of sovereignty, and with many enemies, the help of the latter’s army in return for the payment of a share in the profit less than the strength of the army supplied deserves, the latter, if powerful, may declare war;",

When, with the desire of putting down a king in trouble due to the diminished strength of the constituents of sovereignty, or with the desire of destroying an enemy's work of immense and unfailing profit, or with the intention of striking him in his own place or on the occasion of marching, one, though frequently getting immense subsidy from an assailable enemy of equal, inferior, or superior power, sends demands again and again, he may comply with the demands of the former if he is desirous of increasing his own power by destroying, with the army of the former, an impregnable fortress, an enemy, or a friend of that enemy, or laying waste the wild tracts of that enemy, or if he is desirous of exposing the army of the ally to wear and tear even in good roads and good seasons, or if he is desirous of strengthening his own army with that of his ally, and thereby putting down the ally or winning over the army of the ally. When a king is desirous of keeping under his power another king of superior or inferior power as an assailable enemy and of destroying the latter after routing out another enemy with the help of the latter, or when he is desirous of getting back whatever he has paid (as subsidy), he may send a proposal to another on the condition of paying more than the cost of the army supplied. If the king to whom this proposal is made is powerful enough to retaliate, he may declare war; or if otherwise, he may accept the terms; or he may keep quiet allied with the available enemy; or he may supply the proposer of peace with his army full of traitors, eunuchs, and wild tribes. When a king of superior power falls into trouble owing to the weakness of the elements of his sovereignty, and requests of an inferior king the help of the latter’s army in return for the payment of a share in the profit proportionally equal to the strength of the army supplied, the latter, if powerful enough to retaliate, may declare war; if otherwise, accept the terms. A king of superior power may request of an inferior the help of the latter’s army in return for payment of a share in the profit less than the cost of the army supplied; and the latter, if powerful enough to retaliate, may declare war, or accept the terms otherwise. The king who is sued for peace and also the king who offers peace should both consider the motive with which the proposal of peace is made, and adopt that course of action which on consideration seems to be productive of good results.",

    "section": "Book VII, Chapter VIII: The Attitude of an Assailable Enemy; and Friends that Deserve Help",
    "text": "When an assailable enemy who is in danger of being attacked is desirous of taking upon himself the condition which led one king to be combined with another against himself, or of splitting them from each other, he may propose peace to one of the kings on the condition of himself paying twice the amount of profit accruing from the combination. The agreement having been made, he may describe to that king the loss of men and money, the hardship of sojourning abroad, the commission of sinful deeds, and the misery and other personal troubles to which that king would have been subjected. When the king is convinced of the truth, the amount promised may be paid; or having made that king to incur enmity with other kings, the agreement itself may be broken off. When a king is inclined to cause to another loss of men and money in the ill-considered undertakings of the latter, or to frustrate the latter in the attempt of achieving large profit from well-begun undertakings; or when he means to strike another at his own price or while marching; or when he intends to exact subsidy while in combination with the latter’s assailable enemy; or when he is in need of money and does not like to trust his ally, he may for the time being be satisfied with a small amount of profit. When a king has in view the necessity of helping a friend or of destroying an enemy, or the possibility of acquiring much wealth (in return for the prior help), or when he is anxious to utilize in future the services of the one now obliged by him, he may reject the offer of large profit at the present for the purpose of a much larger gain in future. When a king means to help another from the clutches of traitors or enemies or of a superior king threatening the very existence of the latter, and intends thereby to set an example of rendering similar help to himself in future, he should esteem no profit either at the present or in the future. When a king means to harass the people of an enemy or to break the agreement of peace between a friend and a foe, or when he suspects another’s attack upon himself, and when owing to any of these causes, he wants to break peace with his ally, he may demand from the latter an enhanced amount of profit long before it is due. The latter under these circumstances may demand for a procedure (krama) either at the present or in the future. The same procedure explains the cases treated of before. The conqueror and his enemy helping their respective friends differ according as their friends are such or are not such as undertake possible, praiseworthy or productive works and as are resolute in their undertakings and are provided with loyal and devoted subjects. Whoever undertakes a tolerable work is a beginner of possible work; whoever undertakes an unblemished work is a beginner of praiseworthy work; whoever undertakes a work of large profits is a beginner of a productive work; whoever takes no rest before the completion of the work undertaken is a resolute worker; and whoever has loyal and devoted subjects is in a position to command help and to bring to a successful termination any work without losing anything in the form of favor. When such friends are guarded by the enemy or the conqueror, they can be of immense help to him; friends of reverse character should never be helped. Of the two, the conqueror and his enemy, both of whom may happen to have friends in the same person, he who helps a true or a truer friend over-reaches the other; for by helping a true friend he enriches himself, while the other not only incurs loss of men and money and the hardships of sojourning abroad, but also showers benefits on an enemy who hates the benefactor all the more for his gratification. Whoever of the two, the conqueror and his enemy, who may happen to have a friend in the same Madhyama king, helps a Madhyama king of true or truer friendship, over-reaches the other; for, by helping a true friend, he enriches himself, while the other incurs loss of men and money and the difficulties of sojourning abroad. When a Madhyama king thus helped is devoid of good qualities, then the enemy over-reaches the conqueror, for such a Madhyama king, spending his energies on useless undertakings and receiving help with no idea of returning it, withdraws himself away. The same thing holds good with a neutral king under similar circumstances. In case of helping with a portion of the army one of the two, a Madhyama or a neutral king, whoever happens to help one who is brave, skillful in handling weapons, and possessed of arrogance and unfriendly feelings will himself be deceived, while his enemy, helping one of reverse character, will over-reach him. When a king achieves this or that object with the assistance of a friend who is to receive the help of his army in return later on, then he may send out his various kinds of army—such as hereditary army, hired army, army formed of corporations of people, his friend’s army and the army composed of wild tribes—either that kind of army which has experience of all sorts of ground and of seasons or the army of enemies or of wild tribes, which is far removed in space and time. When a king thinks that, “Though successful, my ally may cause my army to move in an enemy’s territory or in wild tracts, and during unfavorable seasons, and thereby may render it useless to me,” then under the excuse of having to employ his army otherwise, he may help his ally in any other way; but when he is obliged to lend his army, he may send that kind of his army, which is used to the weather of the time of operation, under the condition of employing it till the completion of the work, and of protecting it from dangers. When the ally has finished his work, he should, under just excuse, try to get back his army or he may send to his ally that army which is composed of traitors, eunuchs and wild tribes; or having made peace with ally's assailable enemy, he may deceive the ally.",

Agreement under the condition, “Let us acquire a friend, etc.,” is termed even peace; when one acquires a friend and the other gold or land, it is termed uneven peace; and when one gains more than the other, it is deception. In an even peace (i.e. agreement on equal terms), whoever acquires a friend of good character or relieves an old friend from troubles, over-reaches the other; for help given in misfortune renders friendship very firm. Which is better of the two: a friend of long-standing but unsubmissive nature, or a temporary friend of submissive nature, both being acquired by affording relief from their respective troubles? My teacher says that a long-standing friend of unsubmissive nature is better, inasmuch as such a friend, though not helpful, will not create harm. Not so, says Kautilya: a temporary friend of submissive nature is better; for such a friend will be a true friend so long as he is helpful; for the real characteristic of friendship lies in giving help.",

My teacher says that a temporary friend of large prospects is better, inasmuch as such a friend can, in virtue of his large prospects, render immense service in a very short time, and can stand undertaking of large outlay. Not so, says Kautilya: a long-standing friend of limited prospects is better, inasmuch as a temporary friend of large prospects is likely to withdraw his friendship on account of material hiss in the shape of help given, or is likely to expect similar kind of help in return; but a long-standing friend of limited prospects can, in virtue of his long-standing nature, render immense service in the long run.\n\nWhich is better, a big friend, difficult to be roused, or a small friend, easy to be roused? My teacher says that a big friend, though difficult to be roused, is of imposing nature, and when he rises up he can accomplish the work undertaken. Not so, says Kautilya: a small friend easy to be roused is better, for such a friend will not, in virtue of his ready preparations, be behind the opportune moment of work, and can, in virtue of his weakness in power, be used in any way the conqueror may like; but not so the other of vast territorial power.\n\nWhich is better, scattered troops, or an unsubmissive standing army? My teacher says that scattered troops can be collected in time, as they are of submissive nature. Not so, says Kautilya: an unsubmissive standing army is better, as it can be made submissive by conciliation and other strategic means; but it is not so easy to collect in time scattered troops, as they are engaged in their individual avocations.\n\nWhich is better, a friend of vast population, or a friend of immense gold? My teacher says that a friend of vast population is better, inasmuch as such a friend will be of imposing power and can, when he rises up, accomplish any work undertaken. Not so, says Kautilya: a friend possessing immense gold is better; for possession of gold is ever desirable; but an army is not always required. Moreover, armies and other desired objects can be purchased for gold.",

    "text": "Which is better, a friend possessing gold or a friend possessing vast territory? My teacher says that a friend possessing gold can stand any heavy expenditure made with discretion. Not so, says Kautilya: for it has already been stated that both friends and gold can be acquired by means of territory. Hence a friend of vast territory is far better.\n\nWhen the friend of the conqueror and his enemy happen to possess equal population, their people may yet differ in possession of qualities such as bravery, power of endurance, amicableness, and qualification for the formation of any kind of army. When the friends are equally rich in gold, they may yet differ in qualities such as readiness to comply with requests, magnanimous and munificent help, and accessibility at any time and always.\n\nAbout this topic, the following sayings are current:\n•Long-standing, submissive, easy to be roused, coming from fathers and grandfathers, powerful, and never of a contradictory nature, is a good friend; and these are said to be the six qualities of a good friend;\n•That friend who maintains friendship with disinterested motives and merely for the sake of friendship, and by whom the relationship acquired of old is kept intact, is a long-standing friend;\n•That friend whose munificence is enjoyable in various ways is a submissive friend; and is said to be of three forms: one who is enjoyable only by one, one who is enjoyable by two (the enemy and the conqueror), and one who is enjoyable by all, is the third;\n•That friend who, whether as receiving help or as giving help, lives with an oppressive hand over his enemies, and who possesses a number of forts and a vast army of wild tribes is said to be a long-standing friend of unsubmissive nature:\n•That friend who, either when attacked or when in trouble, makes friendship for the security of his own existence is a temporary and submissive friend;\n•That friend who contracts friendship with a single aim in view and who is helpful, immutable, and amicable, is a friend never falling foul even in adversity;\n•Whoever is of an amicable nature is a true friend: whoever sides also with the enemy is a mutable friend: and whoever is indifferent to neither (the conqueror and his enemy) is a friend to both;\n\nThat friend who is indifferent to the conqueror or who is equally indifferent to the conqueror's enemy is a doubtful friend, whether he is giving help or is capable of helping;\n•Whoever helps the enemy's friend, protects a vulnerable person or a relation of the enemy is a friend common to (both) the enemy (and the conqueror);\n•Whoever possesses extensive and fertile territory and is not very strong but indolent will be indifferent (towards his ally) when the latter becomes despicable under troubles;\n•Whoever, owing to his own weakness, follows the ascendancy of both the conqueror and his enemy, not incurring enmity with either, is known as a common friend;\n•Whoever forsakes a friend, who is being hurt, with or without reason, and who seeks help, with or without means, despises his own danger.\n\nWhich is better, an immediate small gain or a distant large gain? My teacher says that an immediate small gain is better, as it is useful to carry out immediate undertakings. Not so, says Kautilya: a large gain, as a continuing productive seed, is better; otherwise an immediate small gain.\n\nThus, having taken into consideration the good aspects of permanent gain or of a share in a permanent gain, should a king, desirous of strengthening himself, march combined with others.\n\nThe agreement mode under the condition, \"Let us acquire land,\" is an agreement of peace for the acquisition of land. Of the two kings thus entering into an agreement, whoever acquires a rich and fertile land with standing crops over-reaches the other.",

True, there is beauty in acquiring land by putting down a weak enemy; but the land acquired will also be poor, and the king in the neighbourhood, who has hitherto been a friend, will now become an enemy. The enemies being equally strong, he who acquires territory after beating a fortified enemy over-reaches the other; for the capture of a fort is conducive to the protection of territory and to the destruction of wild tribes. As to the acquisition of land from a wandering enemy, there is the difference of having a powerful or powerless enemy close to the acquired territory; for the land which is close to a powerless enemy is easily maintained, while that bordering upon the territory of a powerful enemy has to be kept at the expense of men and money.\n\nWhich is better, the acquisition of a rich land close to a constant enemy, or that of sterile land near to a temporary enemy? My teacher says that a rich land with a constant enemy is better, inasmuch as it yields much wealth to maintain a strong army, by which the enemy can be put down. Not so, says Kautilya: for, a rich land creates many enemies, and the constant enemy will ever be an enemy, whether or not he is helped (with men and money to conciliate him); but a temporary enemy will be quiet either from fear or favour. That land, on the border of which there are a number of forts giving shelter to bands of thieves, Mlechchhas and wild tribes, is a land with a constant enemy; and that which is of reverse character is one with a temporary enemy.\n\nWhich is better, a small piece of land, not far, or an extensive piece of land, very far? A small piece of land, not far, is better, inasmuch as it can be easily acquired, protected, and defended, whereas the other is of a reverse nature. Of the above two kinds of land, which is better, that which can be maintained by itself, or that which requires external armed force to maintain? The former is better, as it can be maintained with the army and minor prodigals by itself, whereas the latter is of a reverse nature through its industrial station.\n\nWhich is better, acquisition of land from a stupid or a wise king? That acquired from a stupid king is better, as it can be easily acquired and secured, and cannot be taken back, whereas that obtained from a wise king, beloved of his subjects, is of a reverse nature. Of two enemies, of whom one can only be harassed and another is reducible, acquisition of land from the latter is better; for when the latter is attacked, he, having little or no help, begins to run away, taking his army and treasure with him, and he is deserted by his subjects, whereas the former does not do so, as he has the help of his forest-like friends.",

Of two kings, one owning a fort surrounded by a river, and another having mountainous fortifications, seizing the former's land is better, for a fort in the centre of a river can be assailed by a bridge formed of elephants made to float in a row in the river, or by wooden bridges, or by means of boats; and the moat will not always be deep and can be emptied of its water, whereas a fort in a mountain is of a self-defensive nature, and not easy to besiege or to assault; and where one portion of the army defending it is routed, the other portion can escape unhurt, and such a fort is of immense service, as it affords facilities to throw down heaps of stone and trees over the enemy.\n\nWhich is easier, seizing land from those who fight on plains or from those who fight from low grounds? Seizing the land from the latter is easier, inasmuch as they have to fight in time and space of adverse nature, whereas the former can fight anywhere and at any time.

    "text": "The agreement made under the condition, “Let us colonize waste land” is termed an interminable agreement. Whoever of the two parties of the agreement colonizes a fertile land, reaping the harvest earlier, over-reaches the other. Which is better for colonization: a plain or a watery land? A limited tract of land with water is far better than a vast plain, inasmuch as the former is conducive to the growth of crops and fruits throughout the year. Of plains, that which is conducive to the growth of both early and late crops, and which requires less labour and less rain for cultivation, is better than the other of reverse character. Of watery lands that which is conducive to the growth of grains is better than another productive of crops other than grains. Of two watery tracts, one of limited area and conducive to the growth of grains, and another, vast and productive of crops other than grains, the latter is better, inasmuch as it affords vast area not only to grow spices and other medicinal crops, but also to construct forts and other defensive works in plenty: for fertility and other qualities of lands are artificial (krtrimah). Of the two tracts of land, one rich in grains and another in mines, the latter helps the treasury while the former can fill both the treasury and the store-house; and besides this, the construction of forts and other buildings requires grains. Still that kind of land containing mines and which yields precious metals to purchase large tracts of land is far better.\n\nMy teacher says that of the two forests, one productive of timber and another of elephants, the former is the source of all kinds of works and is of immense help in forming a storehouse, while the latter is of reverse character. Not so, says Kautilya, for it is possible to plant any number of timber forests in many places, but not an elephant forest; yet it is on elephants that the destruction of an enemy’s army depends. Of the two, communication by water and by land, the former is not long-standing, while the latter can ever be enjoyed. Which is better, the land with scattered people or that with a corporation of people? The former is better, inasmuch as it can be kept under control and is not susceptible to the intrigues of enemies, while the latter is intolerant of calamities and susceptible of mice and other pests. In colonizing a land with four castes, colonization with the low caste is better, inasmuch as it is serviceable in times of war, plentiful, and peace-loving. Of cultivated and uncultivated tracts, the uncultivated tract may be suitable for various kinds of agricultural operations; and when it is fertile, adapted for pasturage, manufacture of merchandise, mercantile traffic, abundance of borrowing and lending, and attractive to rich merchants, it is still far better (than a cultivated tract). Which is better of the two, the tract of land with forts or that which is thickly populated? The latter is better; for that which is thickly populated is a kingdom in all its aspects. What can a depopulated country like a barren cow be productive of?\n\nThe king who has designs of getting back the land sold for colonization to another when the latter has lost his men and money in colonizing it, should first make an agreement with such a purchaser as is weak, base-born, devoid of energy, helpless, of unrighteous character, addicted to evil ways, trusting to fate, and indiscreet in his actions. When the colonization of a land entails much expenditure of men and money, and when a weak and base-born man attempts to colonize it, he will perish along with his people in consequence of loss of men and money. Though strong, a base-born man will be deserted by his people who dislike him lest they may come to grief under him; though possessing an army, he cannot employ it if he is devoid of energy; and such an army will perish in consequence of the loss incurred by its master; though possessing wealth, a man who hesitates to part with his money and shows favour to none, cannot find help in any quarter; and when it is easy to drive out a man of unrighteous character from the colony in which he has firmly established himself, none can expect that a man of unrighteous character would be capable of colonizing a tract of waste land and keeping it secure; the same fact explains the fate of such a colonizer as is addicted to evil ways; whoever, trusting to fate and putting no reliance on manliness, withdraws himself from energetic work, will perish without undertaking anything or without achieving anything from his undertaking; and whoever is indiscreet in his action will achieve nothing, and is the worst of the set of the colonizers. My teacher says that an indiscreet colonizer may sometimes betray the weak points of his employer, the conqueror. But Kautilya says that, just as he betrays the weak points, so also does he facilitate his destruction by the conqueror. In the absence of such persons to colonize waste lands, the conqueror may arrange for the colonization of waste land in the same way as we shall treat of later on in connection with the “Capture of an Enemy in the Rear.”\n\nThe above is what is termed verbal agreement (abhihitasandhih). When a king of immense power compels another to sell a portion of the latter’s fertile territory, of which the former is very fond, then the latter may make an agreement with the former and sell the land. This is what is termed “unconcealed peace” (anibhrtasandhih). When a king of equal power demands lands from another as above, then the latter may sell it after considering “Whether the land can be recovered by me, or can be kept under my control; whether my enemy can be brought under my power in consequence of his taking possession of the land; and whether I can acquire by the sale of the land friends and wealth enough to help me in my undertakings.” This explains the case of a king of inferior power, who purchases lands. Whoever, well versed in the science of polity, thus acquires friends, wealth, and territory, with or without population, will over-reach other kings in combination with him.",

    "section": "Agreement for Undertaking a Work",
    "text": "When an agreement is made on the condition, “Let us have a fort built,” it is termed agreement for undertaking a work. Whoever of the two kings builds an impregnable fortress on a spot naturally best fitted for the purpose with less labour and expenditure over-reaches the other. Of forts such as a fort on a plain, in the centre of a river, and on a mountain, that which is mentioned later is of more advantage than one previously mentioned; of irrigation works (setu-bandha), that which is of perennial water is better than that which is fed with water drawn from other sources; and of works containing perennial water, that which can irrigate an extensive area is better. Of timber forests, whoever plants a forest which produces valuable articles, which expands into wild tracts, and which possesses a river on its border over-reaches the other; for a forest containing a river is self-dependent and can afford shelter in calamities. Of game forests, whoever plants a forest full of cruel beasts, close to an enemy’s forest containing wild animals, causing therefore much harm to the enemy, and extending into an elephant forest at the country’s border, over-reaches the other.\n\nMy teacher says that of the two countries, one with a large number of effete persons, and another with a small number of brave persons, the latter is better, inasmuch as a few brave persons can destroy a large mass of effete persons, whose slaughter brings about the destruction of the entire army of their master. Not so, says Kautilya, a large number of effete persons is better, inasmuch as they can be employed to do other kinds of works in the camp: to serve the soldiers fighting in battlefields, and to terrify the enemy by its number. It is also possible to infuse spirit and enthusiasm in the timid by means of discipline and training. Of mines, whoever exploits with less labour and expenditure a mine of valuable output and of easy communication over-reaches the other. Which is better of the two, a small mine of valuable yields, or a big mine productive of commodities of inferior value? My teacher says that the former is better, inasmuch as valuable products, such as diamonds, precious stones, pearls, corals, gold and silver, can swallow vast quantities of inferior commodities. Not so, says Kautilya, for there is the possibility of purchasing valuable commodities by a mass of accumulated articles of inferior value, collected from a vast and long-standing mine of inferior commodities. This explains the selection of trade routes:\n\nMy teacher says that of the two trade routes, one by water and another by land, the former is better, inasmuch as it is less expensive but productive of large profit. Not so, says Kautilya, for a water route is liable to obstructions, not permanent, a source of imminent dangers, and incapable of defence, whereas a land route is of reverse nature. Of water routes, one along the shore and another in mid-ocean, the route along and close to the shore is better, as it touches at many trading port towns; likewise river navigation is better, as it is uninterrupted and is of avoidable or endurable dangers. My teacher says that of land routes, that which leads to the Himalayas is better than that which leads to the south. Not so, Kautilya, for with the exception of blankets, skins, and horses, other articles of merchandise, such as conch shells, diamonds, precious stones, pearls and gold are available in plenty in the south. Of routes leading to the south, either that trade route which traverses a large number of mines, which is frequented by people, and which is less expensive or troublesome, or that route by taking which plenty of merchandise of various kinds can be obtained is better. This explains the selection of trade routes leading either to the east or to the west. Of a cart-track and a footpath, a cart-track is better, as it affords facilities for preparations on a large scale. Routes that can be traversed by asses or camels, irrespective of countries and seasons, are also good. This explains the selection of trade routes traversed by men alone (amsa-patha, shoulder-path, i.e. a path traversed by men carrying merchandise on their shoulders).\n\nIt is a loss for the conqueror to undertake that kind of work productive of benefits to the enemy, while a work of reverse nature is a gain. When the benefits are equal, the conqueror has to consider that his condition is stagnant. Likewise it is a loss to undertake a work of less output and of a greater outlay, while a work of reverse nature is a gain. If the output and outlay of a work are at par, the conqueror has to consider that his condition is stagnant. Hence the conqueror should find out such fort-building and other works as, instead of being expensive, are productive of greater profit and power. Such is the nature of agreements for undertaking works.",

Troops taken being of equal strength, he who captures the rear of one who has gone against a wandering enemy gains more advantages: for one who has marched out against a wandering enemy has to put down the rear-enemy only after obtaining an easy victory over the wandering enemy; but not one who has marched out against an entrenched enemy, for one who has marched out against the entrenched enemy will be repelled in his attack against the enemy’s forts and will, after his return, find himself between the rear-enemy and the frontal enemy who is possessed of strong forts. This explains the cases of other enemies described before.\nEnemies being of equal description, he who attacks the rear of one who has gone against a virtuous king gains more advantages, for one who has gone against a virtuous king will incur the displeasure of even his own people, whereas one who has attacked a wicked king will endear himself to all. This explains the consequences of capturing the rear of those who have marched against an extravagant king, or a king living from hand to mouth, or a niggardly king. The same reasons hold good in the case of those who have marched against their own friends. When there are two enemies, one engaged in attacking a friend and another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the latter gains more advantages: for one who has attacked a friend will, after easily making peace with the friend, proceed against the rear enemy; for it is easier to make peace with a friend than with an enemy.",

When the conqueror and his enemy in their attack against the rear of an enemy mean to enforce the payment of what is not due to them, he whose enemy has lost considerable profits and has sustained great loss of men and money gains more advantages: when they mean to enforce the payment of what is due to them, then he whose enemy has lost profits and army, gains more advantages. When the assailable enemy is capable of retaliation and when the assailant's rear-enemy, capable of augmenting his army and other resources, has entrenched himself on one of the assailant's flanks, then the rear-enemy gains more advantages; for a rear enemy on one of the assailant’s flanks will not only become a friend of the assailable enemy, but also attack the base of the assailant, whereas a rear-enemy behind the assailant can only harass the rear.\nKings capable of harassing the rear of an enemy and of obstructing his movements are three: the group of kings situated behind the enemy, and the groups of kings on his two flanks. He who is situated between a conqueror and his enemy is called an antardhi (one between two kings); when such a king is possessed of forts, wild tribes, and other kinds of help, he proves an impediment in the way of the strong. When the conqueror and his enemy are desirous of catching hold of a Madhyama king and attack the latter's rear, then he who in his attempt to enforce the promised payment separates the Madhyama king from the latter's friend, and obtains, thereby, an enemy as a friend, gains more advantages; for an enemy compelled to sue for peace will be of greater help than a friend compelled to maintain the abandoned friendship. This explains the attempt to catch hold of a natural king.",

    "text": "a piece of land close to the territory of a powerful king; a corporation invincible in war with a piece of sand under both the above troubles; a spirited king desirous of war with a piece of land which affords no advantageous positions for the manoeuvre of the army; an enemy’s partisan with waste land; a besieged prince with a piece of land exhausted of its resources; a king who has renounced the observance of a treaty of peace after breaking it, with a piece of land which can be colonized at considerable cost of men and money; a deserted prince with a piece of land which affords no protection; and his own protector with an uninhabitable piece of land. (The king who is desirous of making conquests) should continue in following the same policy towards him, who, among the above kings, is most helpful and keeps the same attitude; should by secret means bring him round who is opposed; should favour the helpful with facilities for giving further help, besides bestowing rewards and honour at all costs upon him; should give relief to him who is under troubles; should receive visitors at their own choice and afford satisfaction to them; should avoid using contemptuous, threatening, defamatory, or harsh words towards them; should like a father protect those who are promised security from fear; should punish the guilty after publishing their guilt; and in order to avoid causing suspicion to the protector, the vassal king should adopt the procedure of inflicting secret punishments upon offenders. He should never covet the land, things, and sons and wives of the king slain by him; he should reinstate in their own estates the relatives of the kings slain. He should install in the kingdom the heir-apparent of the king who has died while working (with the conqueror); all conquered kings will, if thus treated, loyally follow the sons and grandsons of the conqueror. Whoever covets the lands, things, sons, and wives of the kings whom he has either slain or bound in chains will cause provocation to the Circle of States and make it rise against himself; also his own ministers employed in his own territory will be provoked, and will seek shelter under the Circle of States, having an eye upon his life and kingdom. Hence conquered kings preserved in their own lands in accordance with the policy of conciliation will be loyal to the conqueror and follow his sons and grandsons.",

    "section": "Chapter XVII, Making Peace and Breaking It",
    "text": "The words Kama (quiet), sandhi (agreement of peace), and samadhi (reconcilement), are synonymous. That which is conducive to mutual faith among kings is termed Kama, sandhi, or samadhi. My teacher says that peace, dependent upon honesty or oath, is mutable, while peace with a security or a hostage is immutable. No, says Kautilya, peace, dependent upon honesty or oath, is immutable both in this and the next world. It is for this world only that a security or a hostage is required for strengthening the agreement. Honest kings of old made their agreement of peace with this declaration: “We have joined in peace.” In case of any apprehension of breach of honesty, they made their agreement by swearing by fire, water, plough, the brick of a fort wall, the shoulder of an elephant, the hips of a horse, the front of a chariot, a weapon, seeds, scents, juice (rasa), wrought gold (suvarna), or bullion gold (hiranya), and by declaring that these things will destroy and desert him who violates the oath. In order to avoid the contingency of violation of oath, peace made with the security of such persons as ascetics engaged in penance, or nobles, is peace with a security. In such a peace, whoever takes as security a person capable of controlling the enemy gains more advantages, while he who acts to the contrary is deceived. In peace made with children as hostages, and in the case of giving a princess or a prince as a hostage, whoever gives a princess gains advantages; for a princess, when taken as a hostage, causes troubles to the receiver, while a prince is of reverse nature. With regard to two sons, whoever hands over a high-born, brave and wise son, trained in military art, or an only son, is deceived, while he who acts otherwise gains advantages. It is better to give a base-born son as a hostage than a high-born one, inasmuch as the former has neither heirship nor the right to beget heirs; it is better to give a stupid son than a wise one, inasmuch as the former is destitute of the power of deliberation; better to give a timid son than a brave one, inasmuch as the former is destitute of martial spirit; better a son who is not trained in military art than one who is trained, inasmuch as the former is devoid of the capacity for striking an enemy; and better one of many sons than an only son since many sons are not wanted. With regard to a high-born and wise son, people will continue to be loyal to a high-born son though he is not wise; a wise son, though base-born, is characterised with capacity to consider state matters; but so far as capacity to consider state matters is concerned, a high-born prince associating himself with the aged, has more advantages than a wise but base-born prince. With regard to a wise and a brave prince, a wise prince, though timid, is characterised with capacity for intellectual works; and a brave prince, though not wise, possesses warlike spirit. So far as warlike spirit is concerned, a wise prince over-reaches a brave one just as a hunter does an elephant. With regard to a brave and a trained prince, a brave prince, though untrained, is characterised with capacity for war; and a trained prince, though timid, is capable of hitting objects aright. Notwithstanding the capacity for hitting objects aright, a brave prince excels a trained prince in determination and firm adherence to his policy. With regard to a king having many sons and another an only son, the former, giving one of his sons as a hostage and being contented with the rest, is able to break the peace; but not the latter. When peace is made by handing over the whole lot of sons, advantage is to be sought in capacity to beget additional sons; capacity to beget additional sons being common, he who can beget able sons will have more advantages than another king (who is not so fortunate); capacity to beget able sons being common, he by whom the birth of a son is early expected will have more advantages than another (who is not so fortunate). In the case of an only son who is also brave, he who has lost capacity to beget any more sons should surrender himself as a hostage, but not the only son. Whoever is rising in power may break the agreement of peace. Carpenters, artisans, and other spies, attending upon the prince (kept as a hostage) and doing work under the enemy, may take away the prince at night through an underground tunnel dug for the purpose. Dancers, actors, singers, players on musical instruments, buffoons, court-bards, swimmers, and eaubhikas (?), previously set about the enemy, may continue under his service and may indirectly serve the prince. They should have the privilege of entering into, staying in and going out of, the palace at any time without rule. The prince may therefore get out at night disguised as any one of the above spies. This explains the work of prostitutes and other women spies under the garb of wives; the prince may get out, carrying their pipes, utensils, or vessels. Or the prince may be removed concealed under things, clothes, commodities, vessels, beds, seats and other articles, by cooks, confectioners, servants employed to serve the king while bathing, servants employed for carrying conveyances, for spreading the bed, toilet-making, dressing, and procuring water; or taking something in pitch dark, he may get out, disguised as a servant. Or he may (pretend to) be in communion with god Yanina in a reservoir (which is seen) through a tunnel, or to which he is taken at night; spies under the guise of traders dealing in cooked rice and fruits may (poison those things and) distribute among the sentinels. Or having served the sentinels with cooked rice and beverage mixed with the juice of madana plant on occasions of making offerings to gods or of performing an ancestral ceremony or some sacrificial rite, the prince may get out; or by bribing the sentinels; or spies disguised as a nagaraka (officer in charge of the city), a court-bard, or a physician may set fire to a building filled with valuable articles; or sentinels, or spies disguised as merchants, may set fire to the store of commercial articles; or in view of avoiding the fear of pursuit, the prince may, after putting some human body in the house occupied by him, set fire to it and escape by breaking open some house-joints, or a window, or through a tunnel; or having disguised himself as a carrier of glass beads, pots, and other commodities he may set out at night; or having entered the residence of ascetics with shaven heads or with twisted hair, he may set out at night, disguised as any one of them; or having disguised himself as one suffering from a peculiar disease or as a forest man, he may get out; or spies may carry him away as a corpse; or, disguised as a widowed wife, he may follow a corpse that is being carried away. Spies, disguised as forest people, should mislead the pursuers of the prince by pointing out another direction, and the prince himself may take a different direction. Or he may escape, hiding himself in the midst of carts or cart drivers; if he is closely followed, he may lead the pursuers to an ambuscade (sattra); in the absence of an ambuscade he may leave here and there gold or morsels of luscious food on both sides of a road and take a different road. If he is captured, he should try to win over the pursuers by conciliation and other means. If not, or serve them with poisoned food and, having caused another body to be put in a sacrifice performed to please god Varuna or in a fire that has broken out, (the prince’s father) may accuse the enemy of the murder of his son and attack the enemy. Or taking out a concealed sword, and falling upon the sentinels, he may quickly run away, together with the spies concealed before.",

    "text": "1’isunu says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and KAUTILYA’S ARTH AS ASTRA 351 to want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more serious; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend upon finance; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's fort may be carried cm; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and enemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can he encouraged and the establishment of the army and its operations conducted. It is possible to remove the treasures in times of danger, but not the fort. No, says Kautitya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the army are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war (intrigue) control over one’s partisans, the upkeep of the army, the reception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes are successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to the enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts there is no destruction. Kaunapadauta says that of distress due to want of finance or to an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient army is more serious; for control over one's own friends and enemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business of administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence of the army, it is certain that the treasury will be lost, whereas lack of finance can be made up by procuring raw-products and lands, or by seizing an enemy’s territory the army can be strengthened. With the army finance is secured. The army being ever at hand, it can exercise the functions of a minister. No, says Kantilya, the army is dependent upon finance. In the absence of finance the army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself, and bring about all kinds of troubles. But finance is the chief means of observing virtuous acts and of enjoying desires. Owing to a change in place, time, and policy, either finance or the army may be a superior power; for the army is (sometimes) the means of securing the wealth acquired; but wealth is (always) the means of securing both the treasury and the army. Since all activities are dependent upon finance, financial troubles are more serious. Yatavyadki says that of the distress of the army and of an ally, the distress of an ally is more serious—an ally, though he is not fed and is far off, is still serviceable; he drives off not only the rear-enemy and the friends of the rear-enemy, but also the frontal enemy and wild tribes; he also helps his friend with money, army, and lands on occasions of troubles.",

In times of sudden expedition and on occasions of troubles from an enemy, a wild tribe, or local rebels, no friend can be trusted. When calamities happen together, or when an enemy has grown strong, a friend keeps up his friendship as long as money is forthcoming. Thus the determination of the comparative seriousness of the calamities of the various elements of sovereignty. When a part of one of the elements of sovereignty is under troubles, the extent, affection, and strength of the serviceable part can be the means of accomplishing a work. When any two elements of sovereignty are equally under troubles, they should be distinguished in respect of their progressive or declining tendency, provided that the good condition of the rest of the elements needs no description. When the calamities of a single element tend to destroy 22g the rest of the elements, those calamities, whether they be of the fundamental or any other element, are verily serious.",

My teacher says that foreign rule which depends upon its winning the affection of the people is for the enjoyment of others in its own condition. No, says Kautilya: divided rule between father and son or between two brothers has similar consequences and is under the clutches of a minister. But foreign rule brought into existence by seizing the country from its king still alive thinks that the country is not its own, impoverishes it and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a commercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires, abandoning the country.",

My teacher says that a blind king, i.e., a king who is not possessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doing works, very obstinate, and is led by others; such a king destroys the kingdom by his own maladministration. But an erring king can be easily brought round when and where his mind goes astray from the procedure laid down in sciences. No, says Kautilya, a blind king can be made by his supporters to adhere to whatever line of policy he ought to. But an erring king, who is bent upon doing what is against the science, brings about destruction to himself and his kingdom by maladministration. Which is better, a diseased or a new king? My teacher says that a diseased king loses his kingdom owing to the intrigue of his ministers, or loses his life on account of the kingdom; but a new king pleases the people by such popular deeds as the observance of his own duties and the act of bestowing favors, remissions (of taxes), gifts, and presents upon others. No, says Kautilya, a diseased king continues to observe his duties as usual. But a new king begins to act as he pleases, under the impression that the country, acquired by his own might,.belongs to himself; when pressed by combined kings (for plunder), he tolerates their oppression of the country. Or having no firm control over the elements of the state, he is easily removed.

K.mmapadnnta says that of addiction to gambling and to women, gambling is a more mitigable evil; for gamblers always play even at night by lamp light, and even when the mother of one of the players is dead; the gambler exhibits anger when spoken to in times of trouble; whereas in the case of addiction to women, it is possible to hold conversation about virtue and wealth at the time of bathing, dressing, and eating. Also, it is possible to make, by means of secret punishments, a woman so good as to secure the welfare of the king, or to get rid of her or drive her out, under the plea of disease. No, says Kautilya, it is possible to divert the attention from gambling but not so from women. (The evils of the latter are: failing to see what one ought to see), violation of duty, the evil of interrupting works that are to be immediately done, incapacity to deal with politics. Contrasting the evil of drinking, VatAvyadhi says that of all addictions to women and to drinking, addiction to women is a more serious evil: there are various kinds of childbirth among women, as explained in the chapter on “The Harem,” whereas in drinking, enjoyment of sound and other objects of the senses, pleasing either people, honouring the gods, and the dissipation of fatigue in the evenings (are the advantages). No, says Kautilya, in the case of addiction to women, the consequences are the birth of children, self-protection, change of wives in the harem, and absence of such consequences in the case of unworthy outside women. Both the above consequences follow from drinking. The inauspicious effects of drinking are loss of money, lunacy in a sensate man, corpse-like appearance while living, nakedness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, loss of life, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering from pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in singing at the expense of wealth. Of gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of the stakes to one party or other. Even among dumb animals, it splits them into factions and causes provocation. It is especially due to gambling that assemblies and royal confederacies possessing the characteristics of assemblies are split into factions and are consequently destroyed. The reception of what is condemned is the worst of all evils, since it causes incapacity to deal with politics. The reception of what is condemned is (due to) desire; and anger consists in oppressing the good; since both these are productive of many evils, both of them are held to be the worst evils. Hence he who is possessed of discretion should associate with the aged, and, after controlling his passions, abandon both anger and desire, which are productive of other evils and destructive of the very basis (of life).",

My teacher says that of fire and floods, destruction due to fire is irremediable; all kinds of troubles, except those due to fire, can be alleviated, and troubles due to floods can be passed over. No, says Kautilya, fire can destroy a village, or part of a village, whereas floods carry off hundreds of villages. My teacher says that of pestilence and famine, pestilence brings all kinds of business to a stop by causing obstruction to work on account of disease and death among men, and owing to the flight of servants, whereas famine stops no work, but is productive of gold, cattle, and grain. No, says Kautilya, pestilence devastates only a part (of the country) and can be remedied, whereas famine causes trouble in the whole (of the country) and exposes dearth of livelihood to all creatures. This explains the consequences of maraka. My teacher says that of the loss of chief and vulgar men, the loss of vulgar men causes obstruction to work. No, says Kautilya, it is possible to recruit vulgar men, since they form the majority of people; for the sake of vulgar men nobles should not be allowed to perish; but in a thousand may or may not be a noble man; he it is who is possessed of excessive courage and wisdom and is the refuge of vulgar people. My teacher says that of the troubles arising from one’s own or allied enemy’s circle of states, those due to one’s own circle are doubly injurious and are irremediable, whereas an inimical circle of states can be fought out or kept away by the intervention of an ally or by making peace. No, says Kautilya, troubles due to one’s own circle can be ended by arresting or destroying the hinderers among the subjective people; or they may be injurious to a part of the country, whereas troubles due to an enemy’s circle of states cause oppression by inflicting loss and destruction and by burning, devastation, and plunder. My teacher says that of the quarrels among the people and among kings, quarrel among the people brings about disunion and thereby enables an enemy to invade the country, whereas quarrel among kings is productive of double pay and wages and of remission of taxes to the people. No, says Kautilya, it is possible to end the quarrel among the people by arresting the leaders, or by removing the cause of quarrel; and people quarrelling among themselves vie with each other and thereby help the country, whereas quarrel among kings causes trouble and destruction to the people and requires double the energy for its settlement.",

    "text": "My teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country, a sportive country is always ruinous to the pursuit of work, whereas a sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians, buffoons, and traders. No, says Kautilya, a sportive country, taking to sports for relaxation from labor, causes only a trifling effect; and after enjoyment, it returns to work, whereas a sportive king causes oppression by showing indulgence to his courtiers, by making and hugging, and by obstructing work in the manufacturing factories. My teacher says that of a favourite wife and a prince, the prince causes oppression by showing indulgence to his followers, by uniting and helping, and by disturbing the work in manufacturing factories, whereas a favourite wife is addicted to her amorous sports. No, says Kautilya, it is possible to prevent, through the minister and the priests, the oppression caused by the prince, but not the oppression caused by the favourite wife, since she is intensely stubborn and keeps company with wicked persons. My teacher says that of the iron hand due to a corporation of people and to a leader in chief, the corporation of people cannot be put down, since it consists of a number of men and causes oppression by theft and violence, whereas a leader causes troubles by obstruction to and destruction of work. No, says Kautilya, it is very easy to get rid of (the troubles from a) corporation, since it has to rise or fall with the king: or it can be put down by arresting its leader or a part of the corporation itself, whereas a leader backed up with support causes oppression by injuring the life and property of others. My teacher says that of the chamberlain and the collector of revenue, the chamberlain oppresses by spoiling works and by inflicting fines, whereas the collector of revenue makes use of the ascertained revenue in the department over which he presides. No, says Kautilya, the chamberlain takes to himself what is presented by others to be entered into the treasury, whereas the collector makes his own revenue great and then steals or he destroys the king’s revenue and presents as he pleases to seize the property of others. My teacher says that of the superintendent of the boundary and a trader, the superintendent of the boundary destroys traffic by allowing thieves and taking taxes more than he ought to, whereas a trader renders the country prosperous by a favourable barter of commercial articles. No, says Kautilya, the superintendent of the boundary increases commercial traffic by welcoming the arrival of merchandise, whereas traders unite in causing rise and fall in the value of articles, and live by making profits cent per cent in pahas or kumbhas (measures of grain). Which is more desirable, land occupied by a high-born person or land reserved for grazing a flock of cattle? My teacher says that the land occupied by a high-born person is very productive; and it supplies men to the army; hence it does not deserve to be confiscated lest the owner might cause troubles, whereas the land occupied for grazing a flock of cattle is cultivable and deserves therefore to be freed, for cultivable land is preferred to pasture land. No, says Kautilya, though immensely useful, the land occupied by a high-born person deserves to be freed, lest he might cause troubles (otherwise), whereas the land held for grazing a flock of cattle is productive of money and beasts, and does not therefore deserve to be confiscated unless cultivation of crops is impeded thereby. My teacher says that of robbers and wild tribes, robbers are ever bent on carrying off women at night, make assaults on persons, and take away hundreds and thousands of panas, whereas wild tribes, living under a leader and moving in the neighbouring forests, can be seen here and there causing destruction only to a part. No, says Kautilya, robbers carry off the property of the careless, and can be put down as they are easily recognized and caught hold of, whereas wild tribes have their own strongholds, being numerous and brave, ready to fight in broad daylight, and seizing and destroying countries like kings. Of the forests of beasts and of elephants, beasts are numerous and productive of plenty of flesh and skins; they arrest the growth of the grass and are easily controlled, whereas elephants are of the reverse nature and are seen to be destructive of countries even when they are captured and tamed. Of benefits derived from one’s own or a foreign country, benefits derived from one’s own country consist of grains, cattle, gold, and raw products, and are useful for the maintenance of the people in calamities, whereas benefits derived from a foreign country are of the reverse nature. Such is the group of molestations. Obstruction to movements caused by a chief is internal obstruction, and obstruction to movements caused by an enemy or a wild tribe is external obstruction. Such is the group of obstructions. Financial troubles due to the two kinds of obstruction and to the molestations described above are stagnation of financial position.",

When he, however, thinks that “by taking a repayable profit, I shall cause my enemy’s treasury, army and other defensive resources to dwindle; I shall exploit to impoverishment the mines, timber and elephant forests, irrigated works, and roads of traffic of my enemy; I shall impoverish his subjects, or cause them to migrate, or conspire against him; when they are reduced to this condition, my enemy will incur their hatred (by punishing them); or I shall set my enemy against another enemy: my enemy will give up hopes and run away to one who has some blood-relationship with him; having improved his lands, I shall return them to him, and when he is thus brought to ascendency, he will be a fitting friend of mine” — then he may take even a repayable profit.

When local persons are abetting (with foreigners), the means to be employed to suppress them are conciliation (sāma) and gifts (dāna).\nThe act of pleasing a man with a high rank and honour is conciliation; favour and remission of taxes or employment to conduct state works is what is termed gifts.

When guilt is got rid of, there will be no guilty persons; but when a guilty person is got rid of, the guilt will contaminate others. Hence, when foreigners carry on an intrigue, the king should employ the policy of dissension and coercion.

    "text": "Arid infantry can oppose an army consisting of the four constituents (elephants, chariots, cavalry, and infantry). Thus, considering the strength of the constituents of one's own tripartite army, one should recruit men to it so as to oppose the enemy’s army successfully. Considering the two things, slight annoyance in the rear and considerable profit in the front, slight annoyance in the rear is more serious; for traitors, enemies, and wild tribes augment besides the slight annoyance which one may have in the rear. The members of one's own state may be provoked about the acquisition of profit in the front. When one under the protection of another has come to such a condition (i.e., slight annoyance in the rear and considerable profit in the front), then one should endeavor so as to cause to the rear enemy the loss and impoverishment of his servants and friends. Hence, considering that profit is one in a thousand or that annoyance in the rear is one in a hundred, one should undertake no march. The saying is that calamities are as small as the point of a needle in the beginning. In case of annoyance in the rear, one should make use of magic, fire, and other forms of stratagem, and in order to gain the profit in the front, one should also employ the god of love. The army of the heir-apparent to lead the army or the king himself may go in person to receive the profit in the front if he is able to ward off the annoyance in the rear. If he is apprehensive of internal troubles, he may take with him the suspected leaders. If he is apprehensive of external trouble, he should march after keeping inside his capital hostages the sons and wives of suspected enemies, and after having split into a number of divisions the troops of the officer in charge of waste lands (Sunyapala) and having placed those divisions under the command of several chiefs, or he may abandon his march, for it has been already stated that internal troubles are more serious than external troubles. The provocation of any one of the minister, the priests, the commander-in-chief, and the heir-apparent is what is termed internal trouble. The king should get rid of such an internal enemy, either by giving up his own fault or by pointing out the danger arising from an external enemy. When the priest is guilty of the gravest treason, relief should be found either by confining him or by banishing him; when the heir-apparent is so, confinement or death is the remedy provided that there is another son of good character. From these, the case of the minister and the commander-in-chief is explained.",

Or he may be sent out on an expedition with an inimical force to receive the only punishment he deserves; or a conspiracy may be made with a frontier king or wild tribes, whose displeasure he has incurred; or the same policy that is employed in securing an imprisoned prince, or in firing an enemy’s villages may be resorted to. The provocation of ministers other than the prime minister is what is called the internal ministerial trouble. Even in this case, necessary strategic means should be employed. The provocation of the chief of a district (Sthanika), the officer in charge of the boundary, the chief of wild tribes, and a conquered king is what is termed external trouble. This should be overcome by setting one against the other. Whoever among these has strongly fortified himself should be caught hold of through the agency of a frontier king, or the chief of wild tribes, or a scion of his family, or an imprisoned prince; or he may be captured through the agency of a friend so that he may not combine with an enemy; or a spy may prevent him from combining with an enemy by saying: \"This enemy makes a cat’s-paw of you and causes you to fall upon your own lord; when his aim is realized, he makes you to lead an army against enemies or wild tribes, or to sojourn in a troublesome place; or he causes you to reside at a frontier station far from the company of your sons and wife. When you have lost all your strength, he sells you to your own lord; or having made peace with you, he will please your own lord. Hence it is advisable for you to go to the best friend of your lord.\" When he agrees to the proposal, he is to be honored; but when he refuses to listen, he is to be told: \"I am specially sent to separate you from the enemy.\" The spy should, however, appoint some persons to murder him; or he may be killed by some corrupted persons; or some persons pretending to be brave soldiers may be made to accompany him and may be told by a spy (to murder him). Thus the end of troubles. One should cause such troubles to one’s enemy and ward off those of one’s own. In the case of a person who is capable of causing or alleviating troubles, intrigue should be made use of; and in the case of a person who is of a reliable character, able to undertake works, and to favor his ally in his success, and to afford protection against calamities, counter-intrigue (pratijapa) should be made use of (to keep his friendship secure).",

There are two kinds of innocent persons, those who have disassociated themselves from traitors, and those who have kept themselves away from enemies. In order to separate citizens and country-people from traitors, the king should employ all the strategic means, except coercion! It is very difficult to inflict punishment on an assembly of influential men; and if inflicted at all, it may not produce the desired effect, but may give rise to undesirable consequences. He may, however, take steps against the leaders of the seditious, as shown in the chapter on “Awards of Punishments.” In order to separate his people from an enemy, he should employ conciliation and other strategic means as to frustrate the attempt of those who are the enemy’s principal agents or by whom the enemy’s work is to be carried out. Success in securing the services of capable agents depends upon the king; success of efforts depends upon ministers; and success to be achieved through capable agents is, therefore, dependent both upon the king and his ministers. When, in spite of the combination of traitors and loyal persons, success is achieved, it is mixed success; when people are united, success is to be achieved through the agency of local persons; for in the absence of a support, nothing that requires a support for its existence can exist. When succor is involved in the union of friends and enemies, it is termed a success contaminated by an enemy; when success is contaminated by an enemy, it is to be achieved through the agency of a friend; for it is easy to attain success through a friend, but not through an enemy. When a friend does not come to terms, intrigue should be frequently resorted to. Through the agency of spies, the friend should be won over after separating him from the enemy. Or attempts may be made to win him over who is the last among combined friends; for when he who is the last among combined friends is secured, those who occupy the middle rank will be separated from each other; or attempts may be made to win over a friend who occupies middle rank; for when a friend occupying middle rank among combined kings is secured, friends occupying the extreme ranks cannot keep the union. (In brief) all those measures which tend to break their combination should be employed. A virtuous king may be conciliated by praising his birth, family, learning, and character, and by pointing out the relationship which his ancestors had (with the proposer of peace), or by describing the benefits and absence of enmity shown to him. Or a king who is of good intentions, or who has lost his enthusiastic spirits, or whose strategic means are all exhausted and thwarted may think of peace, or who has lost his men and wealth, or who is suffering from suffering abroad, or who is suffering from calamities.",

A king who is greedy or who has lost his men may be won over by giving gifts through the medium of ascetic and holy men who have been previously kept with him for the purpose. Gifts are of five kinds: abandonment of what is to be paid; continuance of what is being given; repayment of what is received; payment of one's own wealth; and help for a voluntary raid on the property of others.\n\nWhen any two kings are apprehensive of enmity and seek aid from each other, seeds of dissension may be sown between them. The more timid of the two may be threatened with destruction and may be told: \"Having made peace with [someone], this king works against you; his friend is entrusted with the work of making peace, of which you are no party.\" When from one's own country or from another's country merchandise or commodities for manufacture in a factory are going to an enemy's country, spies may spread the information that these commodities are obtained from one whom the enemy wanted to make friends with. When commodities are thus gathered in an enemy's country, the owner of the articles may send a message to the enemy: \"These commodities and merchandise are sent by me to you; now...declare war against the combined kings or divert them; you will thus get the rest of the tribute.\" Then spies may inform the other kings of the combination: \"These articles are given to him by your enemy.\" The conqueror may gather some merchandise peculiar to his enemy's country and sell those elsewhere. Spies, under the garb of merchants, may sell that merchandise to other important enemies and tell them that that merchandise [is given to the conqueror] by this enemy [whose country's product it is].\n\nHaving presented with wealth and honour those who are highly treacherous among an enemy's people, the conqueror may cause them to live with the enemy, armed with weapons and fire. One of the ministers of the king may be expelled. His sons and wife may be concealed and declared that they were killed at night. Then the minister may introduce other ministers [to the enemy]. If they do [kill the enemy] as they are told, they may be caused to flee; if they are unable to do so, they may be caused to be caught hold of. Whoever has gained the confidence of the enemy may tell the enemy that he (the enemy) has to guard his own person from such and such a chief. Then the recipient of salaries from the two states [the conqueror's and the enemy's state] may send a messenger to the enemy to destroy the chief.\n\nHe who has a king as protected by enthusiasm and power may be told: \"Seize the country of this king, our treaty of peace holding as before.\" Then spies should inform the particular king of the attempt of these kings, and cause the destruction of the commissariat and of the followers of one of these kings. Other spies, pretending to be friends, should inform him that the other kings are aiming at his life. When an enemy's brave soldier, elephant, or horse dies, or is killed, carried on by spies, other spies may tell the enemy that the death is due to mutual conflict among his followers.",

Spies under concealment may, without the help of a fiery spy, murder by means of weapons, poison or other things a fortified enemy who is of mean character or who is under troubles; any one of the hidden spies may do the work when it is found easy: or a fiery spy alone may do the work by means of weapons, poison or fire; for a fiery spy can do what others require all the necessary aids to do. Thus the four forms of strategic means.\n\nOf these means, that which comes first in the order of enumeration is stated in connection with \"Invaders,\" easier than the rest. Conciliation is of single quality; gift is twofold, since conciliation precedes it; dissension is threefold, since conciliation and gift precede it; and conciliatory coercion is fourfold, since conciliation, gift, and dissension precede it. The same means are employed in the case of local enemies, too: the difference is this: the chief messengers known to the manufactories may be sent to any one of the local enemies in order to employ him for the purpose of making a treaty or for the purpose of destroying another person. When he agrees to the proposal, the messengers should inform (their master) of their success. Then recipients of salaries from two states should inform the people or enemies concerned in the local enemy's work: \"This person [the local enemy] is your wicked king.\" When an enemy has reason to fear or hate another, spies may augment dissension between them by telling one of them: \"This man is in mutiny or agreement with your enemy, and will soon deceive you; hence make peace with the king and attempt to put down this man.\" Or by bringing about friendship or marriage connection between persons who have not been hitherto connected, a spy may separate them from others; or through the aid of a neighbouring king, a wild chief, a scion of an enemy's family, or an imprisoned prince, local enemies may be destroyed outside the kingdom; or through the agency of a caravan or wild tribes, a local enemy may be killed along with his army; or persons, pretending to be the supporters of a local enemy and who are of the same caste, may under favourable opportunities kill him; or spies under concealment may kill local enemies with fire, poison, and weapons.\n\nWhen the country is full of local enemies, they may be got rid of by making them drink poisonous (liquids); an obstinate enemy may be destroyed by spies or by means of poisoned food given to him in good faith.",

Anger disturbs the feelings of one's own men. Those causes which are conducive to the prosperity of one's enemy are dangerous wealth, provocative wealth, and wealth of doubtful consequences. Wealth which, when obtained, increases the enemy's prosperity, or which, though obtained, is repayable to the enemy, or which causes loss of men and money, is dangerous wealth; for example, wealth which is enjoyed in common by neighbouring kings and which is acquired at their expense; or wealth which is asked for by an enemy; or wealth which is seized like one's own property; or wealth which is acquired in the front and which causes future troubles or provokes an enemy in the rear; or wealth which is obtained by destroying a friend or by breaking a treaty and which is therefore detested by the Circle of States—all these are the varieties of dangerous wealth.\n\nWealth which causes fear from one's own people or from an enemy is provocative wealth. When, in connection with these two kinds of wealth, there are doubts, such as: \"Is it provocative wealth or not? Harmless wealth or provocative wealth? First provocative and then harmless? Is it profitable to encourage an enemy or a friend? Will the bestowal of wealth and honour on an enemy's army excite hatred or not?\" Of the doubts, doubt regarding the acquirement of wealth is preferable to (doubts regarding harm or provocation).\n\nWealth productive of wealth; wealth productive of nothing: wealth productive of harm; loss or harm productive of wealth; endurance of harm for no profit; harm productive of harm—these are the six varieties of harmful wealth. Destruction of an enemy in the front resulting in the destruction of an enemy in the rear is what is termed “Wealth productive of wealth.” Wealth acquired by helping a neutral king with the army is what is called “Wealth productive of nothing.” The reduction of the internal strength of an enemy is “Wealth productive of harm.” Helping the neighbouring king of an enemy with men and money is a “Harm productive of wealth.” Withdrawal after encouraging or setting a king of poor resources (against another) is “Harm productive of nothing.” Inactivity after causing excitement to a superior king is “Harm productive of harm.” Of these, it is better to pursue that which is mentioned last in the order of enumeration than that which is subsequently mentioned. Thus the procedure of setting to work.\n\nWhen the surrounding fires or arms are conducive to wealth, it is known as wealth from all sides.

Instead of separate men to transport foodstuffs, the army itself should be entrusted with the business of carrying them; or they may be stored in a central place.\nIn front (the leader may ask); in the center the harem and the master (the king); on the sides huntsmen and bodyguards (bhogapati) at the extremity of the (marching) circular army, elephants and the surplus army: on all sides the army habituated to forest life; and mother troops following the camp. The commissariat, the army of an ally, and his followers should select their own road: for armies who have secured suitable positions will prove superior in fight to those who are in bad positions.\nThe army of the low quality can march a yojana (5½ miles a day); that of the middle quality a yojana and a half; and the best army two yojanas. Hence, it is easy to ascertain the rate of march. The commander should march behind and put up his camp in the front.\nIn case of any obstruction, the army should march in crocodile array in the front, in cart-like array behind, and on the sides in diamond-like array (i.e., in four or five rows, each having its front, rear and sides) and in a compact array on all sides. When the army marches on a path passable by a single man, it should march in pin-like array.\nWhen peace is made with one and war is to be waged with another, steps should be taken to protect the friends who are bringing help against enemies, such as an enemy in the rear, his ally, a Madhyama king, or a neutral king. Roads with obstructions should be examined and cleared. Finance, the army, the strength of the armies of friends, enemies, and wild tribes, the prospect of rains, and the seasons should be thoroughly examined.\nWhen the protective power of fortifications and stores (of the enemies) is on its decay, when it is thought that distress of the hired army or of a friend's army (of the enemy) is impending; when intriguers are not for a quick march; or when the enemy is likely to come to terms (with the invader), slow march should be made; otherwise quick march should be made.\nWaters may be crossed by means of elephants, planks spread over pillars erected, bridges, boats, timber and masses of bamboos, as well as by means of dry sour gourds, big baskets covered with skins, rafts, gapejika (?), and vepika (?).

He should destroy the enemy's army under such circumstances.\nWhen the enemy’s army is marching through a path traversable by a single man, the commander (of the invader’s army) should ascertain its strength by estimating the quantity of foodstuffs, grass, bedding, and other requisites, fire pots (agninidhana), flags and weapons.

Or he who possesses control over the elements of his own state may, through the aid of the enemy’s traitors, enemies and inimical wild tribes, make a false impression of his own defeat on the mind of the enemy who is entrenched in a favourable position, and having thus dragged the enemy into an unfavourable position, he may strike the latter.

Having struck the front of the enemy’s army, he may strike it again by means of his elephants and horses when it has shown its back and is running away. When frontal attack is unfavourable, he should strike it from behind; when attack on the rear is unfavourable, he should strike it in front; when attack on one side is unfavourable, he should strike it on the other. Or having caused the enemy to fight with his own army of traitors, enemies and wild tribes, the invader should with his fresh army strike the enemy when tired. Or having, through the aid of the army of traitors, given to the enemy the impression of defeat, the invader with full confidence in his own strength may allure and strike the over-confident enemy. Or the invader, if he is vigilant, may strike the careless enemy when the latter is deluded with the thought that the invader’s men, rebuilt camp and carriers have been destroyed. Or having made his strong force look like a weak force, he may strike the enemy's brave men when falling against him.

Or having made the enemy’s men sleepier by humming them at night, he may strike them during the day, when they are weary from want of sleep and are parched by heat, himself being under the shade. Or with his army of elephants enshrouded with cotton and leaf-like dress, he may order a night-battle to his enemy. Or he may strike the enemy’s men during the afternoon when they are tired by making preparations during the forenoon; or he may strike the whole of the enemy’s army when it is facing the sun and the wind. A desert, a dangerous spot, marshy places, mountains, valleys, waved routes, caves, curl-like array of the army, trust, and night are untras (ambushes). The beginning (of an attack) is the time for treacherous fights. As to an open or fair fight, a virtuous king should call his army together, and, specifying the place and time of battle, address them thus: “I am a paid servant like yourselves; this country is to be enjoyed (by me) together with you; you have to strike the enemy specified by me.” His ministers and priest should encourage the army by saying thus: “It is declared in the Veda that the gain which is secured by sacrificers after performing the Soma sacrifice in which the priests have been duly paid for, is the very goal which brave men are destined to attain.”\nHe should also make oblations into the fire, pronouncing the mantras of this Atharvaveda, and prayers to be offered for the good of the Kshatriyas as well as of those who attain to heaven by dying in the battlefield. He should also submit his person to Brahmans; he should make the central portion of his army consist of such men as are noted for their bravery, as are of high birth, and loyalty, and as are not displeased with the rewards and honours bestowed on them. The place that is to be occupied by the king in that portion of the army which is composed of his father, sons, brothers, and other men skilled in using weapons and having no flags and head-dress. He should mount an elephant or a chariot if the army consists mostly of horses; or he may mount that kind of animal of which the army is mostly composed or which is the most skilfully trained. One who is disguised like the king should attend to the work of arraying the army. Soothsayers and court bards should describe heaven as the goal of the brave, and hell for the timid; and also extol the caste, corporation, family, deeds, and character of his men. The followers of the priest should proclaim the auspicious aspects of the witchcraft performed. Spies, carpenters and astrologers…",

Amongst the corporations of warriors (kshatriyas) of Kambhoja, Surarashtra, and other countries that live by agriculture, trade, and wielding weapons, and the corporations of Lichchhavika, Vrijika, Mallaka, Madraka, Kukura, Kuru, Panchajana, and others that live by the title of a Raja or Svami, gaining access to all those corporations through spies, and finding out jealousy, hatred, and other causes of quarrel among them, should sow the seeds of a well-planned dissension. Spies, under the guise of teachers (acharya), should turn childish embroils among those of mutual enmity on occasions of disputations about certain points of science, arts, gambling, or sports. Fiery spies may occasion quarrels among the leaders of corporations by praising inferior leaders in taverns and theaters; or pretending to be friends, they may excite ambition in the minds of princes by praising their high birth, though they (the princes) are low-born; they may prevent the superior from inter-dining and inter-marrying with others; they may persuade the superiors to inter-dine or to intermarry with inferiors, or they may give publicity to the consideration of priority shown to inferior persons in social intercourse, in the face of the established custom of recognizing the status of other persons by birth, bravery, and social position; or fiery spies may bring about quarrels among them at night by destroying the things, beasts, or persons concerned in some legal disputes. In all these disputes, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the superior party. When they are divided, he should remove them (from their country); or he may gather them together and cause them to settle in a cultivable part of their own country, under the designation of “five households” and “ten households”; for when living together they can be trained in the art of wielding weapons. Specified fines should also be prescribed against any treacherous combinations among them. He may install as the heir-apparent a prince born of a high family, but dethroned or imprisoned. Spies, under the guise of astrologers and others, should bring to the notice of the corporations the royal characteristics of the prince, and should induce the virtuous leaders of the corporations to acknowledge their duty to the prince who is the son of such and such a king and who is the listener to their complaints. To those who are thus prevailed upon, the conqueror should send men and money for the purpose of winning over other partisans.",

    "text": "Keepers of harlots or dancers, players, and actors may set love in the minds of the chiefs of corporations by exhibiting women endowed with bewitching youth and beauty. By causing these women to go to another person or by pretending that another person has violently carried her off, they may bring about a quarrel among those who love that woman; in the ensuing affray, fiery spies may do their work and declare: “This man has been killed in consequence of his love.” A woman who has disappointed her lover and has been forgiven may approach a chief and say: “This chief is troubling me when my mind is set upon you; while he is alive, I cannot stay here,” and thus induce the former to slay the latter. A woman who has been violently carried off at night may cause the death of her violator in the vicinity of a park or a forest or near his house, by means of fiery spies or with poison administered by herself. Then she may declare: “This beloved person of mine has been killed by such and such a person.” A spy, under the garb of a physician, may apply to a lover such medical ointments as are harmful or as are capable of captivating the beloved woman and as are adulterated with poison; and then he may disappear. Other spies may ascribe the incident to an enemy’s act. Widows or women employed as spies with secret instructions may dispute among themselves about the claim for a deposit kept with the king and attract the chiefs of the corporations (by their beauty when they present themselves before the king). Harlots, or a dancing woman, or a songstress may make an appointment to meet a lover in some secret house, and when the lover comes to the house with the desire of meeting her there, fiery spies may kill him or carry him off bound in chains. A spy may tell the chief of a corporation who is fond of women: “In this village, the family of a poor man is bereaved (of the householder); his wife deserves to be the wife of a king.” Half a month after she has been seized, an ascetic spy may accuse the chief in the midst of the corporation by saying: “This man has illegally kept my chief wife, or sister-in-law, or sister, or daughter.” If the corporation punishes the chief, the conqueror may take the side of the corporation and set it against wicked persons. Fiery spies should always cause an ascetic spy to go abroad at night. Spies, selected suitably, should accuse (the chiefs) by saying: “This man is the slayer of a Brahman and also the adulterer of a Brahman woman.” A spy, under the guise of an astrologer, may describe to a chief the destiny of a maiden who is at the point of being married to another, and say: “This man’s daughter deserves to be the wife of a king and will bring forth a son destined to be a king; purchase her with all your wealth, or seize her by force.” When it is not possible to secure her, spies should enrage the parties; but when she is secured, quarrel will necessarily ensue. A mendicant woman may tell a chief who is fond of his wife: “This (another) chief, proud of his youth, has sent me to entice your wife; being afraid of him, I have taken with me his letter and jewelry (for your wife); your wife is free from sin; secret steps should be taken against him; and I am very anxious (about your success).” Thus, in these and other kinds of brawls which have originated of themselves or which have been brought about by spies, the conqueror should help the inferior party with men and money and set them against the wicked or cause them to migrate (to other parts of the country). Thus he should live as the only monarch of all the corporations; the corporations also, under the protection of such a single monarch, should guard themselves against all kinds of treachery. The chief of corporations should endear himself to all the people by leading a virtuous life, by controlling his passions, and by pursuing that course of action which is liked by all those who are his followers.",

    "text": "When a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful enemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the enemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water). Bharadvaja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong, bows down before Indra (the god of rain). But Visalaksha says that a weak king should rather fight with all his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles; this (fighting) is the natural duty of a Kshatriya, no matter whether he achieves victory or sustains defeat in battle. No, says Kautilya, he who bows down to all like a crab on the banks (of a river) lives in despair; whoever goes with his small army to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea without a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the protection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an impregnable fort. Invaders are of three kinds: a just conqueror, a demon-like conqueror, and a greedy conqueror. Of these, the just conqueror is satisfied with mere obeisance. Hence, a weak king should seek his protection. Fearing his own enemies, the greedy conqueror is satisfied with what he can safely gain in land or money. Hence, a weak king should satisfy such a conqueror with wealth. The demon-like conqueror satisfies himself not merely by seizing the land, treasure, sons, and wives of the conquered, but by taking the life of the latter. Hence, a king should keep such a conqueror at a distance by offering him land and wealth. When any one of these is on the point of rising against a weak king, the latter should avert the invasion by making a treaty of peace, or by taking recourse to the battle of intrigue (mantra-yuddha), or by a treacherous fight in the battlefield. He may reduce the enemy’s men either by conciliation or by giving gifts and should prevent the treacherous proceedings of his own men either by sowing the seeds of dissension among them or by punishing them. Spies, under concealment, may capture the enemy’s fort, country, or camp with the aid of weapons, poison, or fire. He may harass the enemy’s rear on all sides; and he may devastate the enemy’s country through the help of wild tribes. Or he may set up a scion of the enemy’s family or an imprisoned prince to seize the enemy’s territory. When all his mischief has been perpetrated, a messenger may be sent to the enemy (to sue for peace); or he may make peace with the enemy without offending the latter. If the enemy still continues the march, the weak king may sue for peace by offering more than one-fourth of his wealth and army, the payment being made after the lapse of a day and night. If the enemy desires to make peace on condition of the weak king surrendering a portion of his army, he may give the enemy such of his elephants and cavalry as are uncontrollable or as are provided with poison: if the enemy desires to make peace on condition of his surrendering his chief men, he may send over to the enemy such portion of his army as is full of traitors, enemies, and wild tribes under the command of a trusted officer, so that both his enemy and his own undesirable army may perish: or he may provide the enemy with an army composed of fiery spies, taking care to satisfy his own disappointed men (before sending them over to the enemy).",

Astrologers, soothsayers, horologists, story tellers (Pauranika), as well as those who read the forebodings of every moment, together with spies and their disciples, inclusive of those who have witnessed the wonderful performances of the conqueror, should give wide publicity to the power of the king to associate with gods throughout his territory. Likewise in foreign countries, they should spread the news of gods appearing before the conqueror and of his having received from heaven weapons and treasure. Those who are well versed in horary and astrology and the science of omens should proclaim abroad that the conqueror is a successful expert in explaining the indications of dreams and in understanding the language of beasts and birds. They should not only attribute the contrary to his enemy, but also show to the enemy’s people the shower of firebrand (ulka) with the noise of drums (from the sky) on the day of the birth-star of the enemy. The conqueror’s chief messengers, pretending to be friendly towards the enemy, should highly speak of the conqueror’s respectful treatment of visitors, of the strength of his army, and of the likelihood of impending destruction of his enemy’s men. They should also make it known to the enemy that, under their master, both ministers and soldiers are equally safe and happy, and that their master treats his servants with parental care in their weal or woe. By these and other means they should win over the enemy’s men as pointed out above, and as we are going to treat of them again at length : They should characterise the enemy as an ordinary donkey towards skilful persons; as the branch of lakucha (Artocarpus Lacucha) broken to the officers of his array ; as a goat on the shore to anxious persons; as a downpour of lightnings to those who are treated with contempt; as a reed, a barren tree, or an iron ball, or as false clouds to those who are disappointed ; as the ornaments of an ugly woman to those who are disappointed in spite of their worshipful service; as a tiger’s skin, or as a trap of death to his favourites ; and as eating a piece of the wood of pilu (Careva-Arborea), or as churning the milk of a she-camel or a she-donkey (for butter) to those who are rendering to him valuable help. When the people of the enemy are convinced of this, they may be sent to the conqueror to receive wealth and honour. Those of the enemy who are in need of money and food should be supplied with an abundance of those things. Those who do not like to receive such things may be presented with ornaments for their wives and children. When the people of the enemy are suffering from famine and the oppression of thieves and wild tribes, the conqueror’s spies should sow the seeds of dissension among them, saying: Let us request the king for favour, and, go elsewhere if not favoured. When they agree to such proposals, they should be supplied with money, grains, and other necessary help: thus, much can be done by sowing the seeds of dissension.",

    "text": "An ascetic, with shaved head or braided hair and living in the cave of a mountain, may pretend to be four hundred years old, and, followed by a number of disciples with braided hair, halt in the vicinity of the capital city of the enemy. The disciples of the ascetic may make presentations of roots and fruits to the king and his ministers and invite them to pay a visit to the venerable ascetic. On the arrival of the king on the spot, the ascetic may acquaint him with the history of ancient kings and their states, and tell him . Every time when I complete the course of a hundred years, I enter into the fire and come out of it as a fresh youth (bala). Now, here in your presence, I am going to enter into the fire for the fourth time. It is highly necessary that you may be pleased to honour me with your presence at the time. Please request three boons.” When the king agrees to do so, he may be requested to come and remain at the spot with his wives and children for seven nights to witness the sacrificial performance. When he does so, he may be caught hold of. An ascetic, with shaved head or braided hair, and followed by a number of disciples with shaved heads or braided hair, and pretending to be aware of whatever is contained in the interior of the earth may put in the interior of an ant-hill either a bamboo stick wound round with a piece of cloth drenched in blood and painted with gold dust, or a hollow golden tube into which a snake can enter aud remain. One of the disciples may tell the king: “ This ascetic can discover blooming treasure trove.99 When he asks the ascetic (as to the veracity of the statement), the latter should acknowledge it, and produce a confirmatory evidence (by pulling out the bamboo stick); or having kept some more gold in the interior of the ant-hill, the ascetic may tell the king : “ This treasure trove is guarded by a snake and can possibly be taken out by performing necessary sacrifice. When the king agrees to do so, he may be requested to come aud remain.(as before). When an ascetic, pretending to be able to find out hidden treasure trove, is seated with his body burning with magical fire at night in a lonely place, disciples may bring the king to see him and inform the king that the ascetic can find out treasure trove. While engaged in performing some work at the request of the king, the latter may be requested to come and remain at the spot for seven nights.(as before). An accomplished ascetic may beguile a king by his knowledge of the science of magic known as jambhaka, and request him to come and remain.(as before). An accomplished ascetic, pretending to have secured the favour of the powerful guardian deity of the country, may often beguile the king’s chief ministers with his wonderful performance and gradually impose upon the king. Any person, disguised as an ascetic aud living under a bat or in the interior of an idol entered into through a tunnel or an underground chamber, may be said by his disciples to be Varuna, the god of water, or of the king of snakes, and shown to the king. While going to accomplish whatever the king may desire, the latter may be requested to come aud remain.(as before). An accomplished ascetic, halting in the vicinity of the capital city, may invite the king to witness the person (of his enemy). When he comes to witness the invocation of his enemy’s life in the image to be destroyed, he may be murdered in an unguarded place. Spies, under the guise of merchants come to sell horses, may invite the king to examine and purchase any of the animals. While attentively examining the horses, he may be murdered in the tumult or trampled down by horses. Getting into an altar at night in the vicinity of the capital city of the enemy and blowing through tubes or hollow reeds the fire contained in a few pots, some fiery spies may shout aloud : “ We are going to eat the flesh of the king or of his ministers ; let the worship of the gods go on.” Spies, under the guise of soothsayers and horologists, may spread the news abroad. Spies, disguised as Nagas (snake-gods) and with their body besmeared with burning oil (tejanataila), may stand in the centre of a sacred pool of water or of a lake at night, and sharpening their iron swords or spikes, may shout aloud as before. Spies, wearing coats formed of the skins of bears and sending out volumes of smoke from their mouth, may pretend to be demons, and after circumambulating the city thrice from right to left, may shout aloud as before at a place full of the horrid noise of antelopes and jackals ; or spies may set fire to an altar or an image of a god covered with a layer of mica besmeared with burning oil at night, and shout aloud as before. Others may spread this news abroad ; or they may cause (by some contrivance or other) blood to flow out in floods from revered images of gods. Others may point to the flow of blood and say that it is an indication of defeat to the enemy. On the night of full or new moon days or in the vicinity of a cremation ground they may point to a Chaitya tree with a human corpse, the upper part of which is eaten away. One, disguised as a demon, may call from the tree for the offering of a human victim. If a man boldly comes out to witness this, others may beat him to death with iron rods and make the people believe that he was killed by demons. Spies and other witnesses may inform the king of this wonder. Then spies, disguised as soothsayers and astrologers, may prescribe auspicious and expiatory rites to avert the evil consequences which would otherwise overtake the king and his country. When the king agrees to the proposal, he may be asked to perform in person special sacrifices and offerings with special mantras every night for seven days. Then (while doing this, he may be slain) as before. In order to delude other kings, the conqueror may himself undertake the performance of expiatory rites to avert such evil consequences as the above, and thus set an example to others. In view of averting the evil consequences of unnatural occurrences, he (the conqueror) may collect money (from his subjects). When the enemy is fond of elephants, spies may delude him with the sight of a beautiful elephant reared by the officer in charge of elephant forests. When he desires to capture the elephant, he may be taken to a remote desolate part of the forest, and killed or carried off as a prisoner. This explains the fate of kings addicted to hunting. When the enemy is fond of wealth or women, he may be beguiled at the sight of rich and beautiful widows brought before him with a plaint for the recovery of a deposit kept by them in the custody of one of their kinsmen ; and when he comes to meet with a woman at night as arranged, hidden spies may kill him with weapons or poison. When the enemy is in the habit of paying frequent visits to ascetics, altars, sacred pillars (stupa), and images of gods, spies hidden in underground chambers or in subterranean passages, or inside the walls, may strike him down.",

Then going over to the enemy, they may catch hold of him on occasions of war, siege, or any other troubles; or they may sow the seeds of dissension between the enemy and his party, corroborating the causes of dissension by producing witnesses specially tutored. Spies, disguised as hunters, may take a stand near the gate of the enemy's fort to sell flesh, and make friendship with the sentine'g at the gate. Having informed the enemy of the arrival of thieves on two or three occasions, they may prove themselves to be of reliable character and cause him to splilt his army into two divisions and to station them in two different parts of his terriWry.

These and others are the spies aiming at the life of a king. The same spies, together with those described in “ Removal of Thorns,may, by employing thieves, destroy the flock of the enemy’s cattle or merchandise in the vicinity of wild tracts.

When it is in rebellion, it is to be pacified by bestowing rewards and remitting taxes, unless the conqueror means to quit it. Or he may select his battlefields in a remote part of the enemy’s territory, far from the populous centres; for, in the opinion of Kautilya, no territory deserves the name of a kingdom or country unless it is full of people. When a people resist the attempt of the conqueror, then he may destroy their stores, crops, and granaries, and trade. *By the destruction of trade, agricultural produce, and standing crops, by causing the people to run away, and by slaying their leaders in secret, the country will be denuded of its people. When the conqueror thinks : “ My army is provided with abun¬ dance of staple com, raw materials, machines, weapons, dress, labourers, ropes and the like, and has a favourable season to act, whereas my enemy has an unfavourable season and is suffering from disease, famine and loss of stores and defensive force, w hile his hired troops as well as the army of his friend are in a miserable condition *r — then he may begin the siege. Having well guarded his camp, transports, supplies and also the roads of communication, and having dug up a ditch and raised a rampart round his camp, he may vitiate the water in the ditches round the enemy’s fort, or empty the ditches of their winter, or fill them with water if empty, and then he may assail the rampart and the parapets by making use of underground tunnels and iron rods. If the ditch is very deep, he may fill it up with soil. If it is defended by a number of men, he may destroy it by means of machines. Horse soldiers may force their passage through the gate into the fort and smite the enemy. Now and then, in the midst of tumult he may offer terms to the enemy by taking recourse to one, two, three, or all of the strategic means.

Then the pretending friend may tell th# besieged : 44 Come out to help me, or let us combine and strike the besieger.” Accordingly, when the enemy comes out, he may be hemmed between the two forces (the conqueror’s force and the pretending friend’s force) and killed or captured alive to distribute his territory (between the conqueror and the friend).

Whoever has anointed his legs with the oil extracted from the paste prepared from the roots of paribhadraka (erythrina indica), prntiluki (?), vanjula (a kind of ratan or tree), vajra (andropogon muricatum or euphorbia), and kadali (banana), mixed with theserutn of the flesh of a frog, can walk over fire (without hurt). •Oil should be extracted from the paste prepared from the roots of pratibala, vanjula and piribhadraka, all growing near water, the pa-te being mixed with the serum of the flesh of a frog. Having anointed ones legs with this oil, one can walk over a white-hot mass of fire as though on a bed of roses. W ben birds such ns a liamsa (swan), kranficha (heron), maytlra 417 (peacock), and other large swimming birds are let to fly at nisht with a burning reed attached to their tail, it presents the appearance of a fire-brand falling from the sky (ulka). Ashes caused by lightning quench the fire. W hen, in a fireplace, kidney beans (mssha) wetted with the menstrual fluid of a woman, as well as the roots of vajra (andropogon muricatum) and kadali (banana), wetted with the serum of the flesh of a frog are kept, no grains can be cooked there. Cleansing the fireplace is its remedy. By keeping in the mouth a ball-like piece of pilu (careya arborea) or a knot of the root of linseed tree (suvarchala) with fire inserted within the mass of the ball and wound round with threads and cotton (pichu), volumes of smoke and fire can be breathed out. When the oil extracted from the fruits of ku<a (ficus religiosa) and amra (mango) is poured over the fire, it burns even in the storm. Sea-foam wetted with oil and ignited keeps burning when floating on water. The fire generated by churning the bone of a monkev by means of a bamboo stick of white and black colour (kalmishavepu) burns in water instead of being quenched. There will burn no other fire where the fire generated by churn¬ ing, by means of a bamboo stick of white and black colonr, the left side rib-bone of a man killed by a weapon or put to the gallows: or the fire generated by churning the bone of a man or woman by KAUTILYA'S ARTHASASTRA 449 means of the bone of another man is circumambulated thrice from right to left. ♦When the paste prepared from the animals, such as chuchundari (musk rat), khanjarita (?), and kharakita (?), with the urine of a horse is applied to the chains with which the legs of a man are bound, they will be broken to pieces. The sun-stone (ayaskanta) or any other stone (will break to pieces) when wetted with the serum of the flesh of the animals kulinda (?), and dardura (?), kharakita l?). The paste prepared from the powder of the rib-bone of naraka (?), a donkey,kanka (a kind of vulture), and bhasa (a bird), mixed with the juice of water-lily, is applied to the legs of bipeds and quadrupeds (while making a journey). When a man makes a journey, wearing the shoes made of the skin of a camel, smeared over with the serum of the flesh of an owl and a vulture and covered over with the leaves of the banyan tree, he can walk fifty yojanas without any fatigue. (When the shoes are smeared over with) the pith, inarrow or sperm of the birds, syena, kanka, kaka grdhra, hamsa, krauncha, and vichiralla (the traveller wearing them) can walk a hundred yojanas (without any fatigue). The fat or serum derived from roasting a pregnant camel together with saptaparna (lechites scholaris), or from roasting dead children in cremation grounds, is applied to render a journey of a hundred yojanas easy. ♦Terror should be caused to the enemy by exhibiting these and other wonderful and delusive performances; while anger causing terror is common to all, terrification by such wonders is held as a means to",

Whosoever anoints his own right eye with the powder of the left eyeball and his left eye with the powder of the right eyeball can clearly see things even in pitch dark at night.\nOne is the eye of a boar; another is that of a kbudyulu [firefly?], or a crow, or a hamsa bird. Having anointed one's own eyes with the above, one can clearly see things at night.\nHaving fasted for three nights, one should, on the day of the star Pushya, catch hold of the skull of a man who has been killed with a weapon or put to the gallows. Having filled the skull with soil and barley seeds, one should irrigate them with the milk of goats and sheep. Putting on the garland formed of the sprouts of the above barley crop, one can walk invisible to others.\nHaving fasted for three nights and having afterwards pulled out on the day of the star of Pushya both the right and the left of a dog, an owl, and a vaguli (!), one should reduce them to two kinds of powder. Then, having anointed one's own eyes with this ointment as usual, one can walk invisible to others.\nHaving fasted for three nights, one should, on the day of the star of Pushya, prepare a round-headed pin (sulaka) from the branch of purushaghiti (punnaga tree). Then having filled with ointment (anjana) the skull of any of the animals which roam at nights, and having inserted that skull in the organ of procreation of a dead woman, one should burn it. Having taken it out on the day of the star of Pushya and having anointed one's own eyes with that ointment, one can walk invisible to others.\nWhenever one may happen to see the corpse burnt or just being burnt of a Brahman who kept perpetual fire (while alive), there one should fast for three nights; and having on the day of the star of Pushya formed a sack from the garment of the corpse of a man who is dead from natural causes, and having filled the sack with the ashes of the Brahman's corpse, one may put the sack on one's back, and walk invisible to others.\nThe slough of a snake filled with the powder of the bones and marrow or fat of the cow sacrificed during the funeral rites of a Brahman, can, when put on the back of cattle, render them invisible.\nThe slough of prachalika bird (?) filled with the ashes of the corpse of a man dead from snake-bite, can render beasts (mrga) invisible.\nThe slough of a snake (ahi) filled with the powder of the bone or the knee-joint mixed with dust of the tail and dung (prasruta) of an owl and… can render birds invisible.\nSuch are the eight kinds of the contrivances causing invisibility.",

Having kept them in a basket (kavadalika), one should bury them apart in cremation grounds. Having unearthed them on the next fourteenth day, one should reduce them to a paste with kundri (aloe?) and prepare small pills out of the paste.

He must be wary of nuclear ability and assert his right to counter.  He must be impartial, even towards an enemy. The elements of a conquered territory must be understood. What to take away for life. A king must be wary of his own people as well as his enemies. Good relations must be maintained between king and his people. He must punish traitors.  A king's men should not be idle, dejected, and powerless. With money and army, one can be successful in intrigue. Power is multiplied by men. Those well-versed in intrigue will prevail. A king needs to be knowledgeable about attacks in a cabin or a forest, from behind an elevation, or on his flanks.  He must know how to break a combination of attacks.  How such combinations are respected. With what kind of troops to combine. What forces are to be relegated.  Which troops are enjoyable in ease or many ways. The conduct of friendly, neutral, and serviceable forces. How to distinguish forces that are to be quartered or apart.  Obtainment of forces by secret contrivances. Kautilya's political views.",

Kautilya, prime minister to King Chandragupta, compiled this comprehensive guide around 300 BC, addressing governance, foreign policy, and national goal achievement, including territorial expansion. Written within an anarchic international system, Arthaśāstra promotes realism, self-help, and power accumulation for state survival, emphasizing conquest or be conquered.  The treatise comprises three parts: country administration (internal organization), law and justice (legal codes and enforcement), and foreign policy (territorial acquisition). These align with the state's goals: wealth/welfare, justice, and growth.  Compiled from ancient Hindu political texts, traditions, and experience, Arthaśāstra contains 32 parts, 15 books, 180 sections, and 6000 verses.",

    "text": "Mandala theory maps the geopolitical landscape, categorizing twelve state types: vijigīṣu (conqueror), ari (enemy), mitra (ally), arimitra (enemy's ally), mitramitra (ally's friend), arimitramitra (ally of enemy's friend), parsnigraha (rear enemy), akranda (rear ally), parsnigrahasara (ally of rear enemy), akrandasara (ally of rear ally), madhyama (middle king/power), and udasina (neutral/major power). This symbolic constellation, with potential overlaps between kingdoms, isn't geographically fixed. Neighboring countries can be hostile, friendly, or subordinate. Cāṇakya acknowledged that not all neighbors are enemies, categorizing them as aribhavin (hostile), mitrabhavin (friendly), or bhrytyabhavin (brotherly), based on behavior, shared goals, interests, and alliances. Mandala theory guides foreign policy during the Maurya dynasty, determining cooperation or conquest, followed by ṣāḍguṇya (six-fold foreign policy) and catur upaya (four strategies: sama, dama, bedha, danda).  This constellation spread with Southeast Asian kingdoms. The Ayudhya kingdom, for example, utilized the mandala pattern for defense, achieving significant influence. Kautilya's Mandala concept was later adopted to describe pre-colonial Southeast Asian political formations, which prioritized the center over boundaries and accommodated tributary polities without administrative integration. Mandala theory embodies the plan for world conquest, prioritizing strength and power.",

Kautilya's focus was victory, world conquest, and the establishment of a unified empire, particularly encompassing the Indian territories between the Himalayas and the sea.  This theory, with its focus on interstate relations and geopolitical analysis, can be considered a theory of geopolitics. The Mandala geopolitical theory from Kautilya's Arthashastra found application in Classical Southeast Asia, notably during the Srivijaya and Majapahit periods.

Syangka, opposing the Chola kingdom, also became a Mitra. These alliances balanced the power of Majapahit's enemies. Ayudhya, a rising power in Central Indochina, was designated as Madhyama, while Ming Dynasty China, a major power, was Udasina. Majapahit pursued trade with China for regional stability but avoided political subordination.  The system differed from China's tributary system; kingdoms under Majapahit's protection retained autonomy. Diplomatic marriages further strengthened alliances.  This Mandala constellation mirrored the Mauryan system under Kautilya, reflecting the anarchic international order where alliances were crucial for protection and power preservation. While conquest (Vigraha) is often highlighted, Kautilya also advocated diplomacy: peace agreements (Samdhi), alliances (Samsraya), and neutrality (Asanas).  Majapahit prioritized cooperation, especially trade. ",

Geopolitics, emphasizing the political significance of geography, and geostrategy, formulating national strategy based on geographical factors, are central to Indonesia's defense. Geopolitics recognizes land (continental) and sea (maritime) power streams; historically, the Maurya focused on land, while Srivijaya and Majapahit on sea. Frontier regions remain crucial for defense.  Indonesia, a maritime nation, prioritizes sea power, exemplified by its Global Maritime Fulcrum (GMF) policy in the Indo-Pacific.  This echoes the historical importance of sea routes for Srivijaya and Majapahit. The GMF responds to the geopolitical dynamics of the Indo-Pacific, where major powers (US, China, India, Japan, Australia) compete for influence. Indonesia's central position requires careful navigation, balancing relations with China for investment and infrastructure against concerns about regional stability and ASEAN unity.",

His insights continue to be studied and have relevance in contemporary discussions of international relations and statecraft. Hypothesis 3: Ancient India's historical and cultural context is reflected in the Mandala Theory. The historical and cultural context of ancient India during Kautilya's time, commonly known as the Mauryan period (circa 4th to 3rd century BCE), had a significant impact on the development of Kautilya's Mandala Theory and his work, the Arthashastra. The following is a brief summary of the context:\n1. Political Fragmentation: Before the rise of the Mauryan Empire, India was politically divided into a multitude of small kingdoms and republics. This political environment influenced Kautilya's understanding of statecraft and diplomacy, as he sought to establish a powerful, centralized state capable of consolidating power and managing relations with neighboring entities.\n2. Social and Cultural Diversity: The cultural and religious diversity of ancient India was remarkable. Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, as well as numerous other religious and philosophical traditions, coexisted. This diversity contributed to a rich tapestry of ideas and values that shaped Kautilya's views on government and diplomacy.\n3. Foreign Intrigues: It had interactions with neighboring states and empires, such as the Seleucid Empire and the Nanda Empire. These interactions exposed the Mauryans to the complexities of international relations and diplomacy, influencing Kautilya's views on how to navigate these international relations.\n4. Political Philosophy: Ancient India provided a fertile intellectual environment for the development of political philosophy. The Arthashastra of Kautilya is regarded as one of the earliest works on statecraft and political science. It was influenced by the earlier writings of thinkers such as Manu and Brihaspati, as well as the contributions of contemporaries to the emerging field of political thought.\n5. Economic and Trade Networks: Ancient India's extensive trade networks, which included the famous Silk Road, facilitated economic interactions with neighboring regions. Kautilya's political and foreign policy strategies were fundamentally influenced by the economic factors of trade and resource acquisition. Mandala Theory and the Arthashastra were profoundly influenced by the historical, political, cultural, and philosophical context of ancient India during Kautilya's time. His work demonstrates a pragmatic approach to statecraft and diplomacy, tailored to the complexities of the time and the ambitions of the Mauryan Empire.",

    "section": "Case Studies and Discussion",
    "text": "There are real-world examples and case studies that demonstrate the application of the Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism in various historical and contemporary contexts. I will also provide a brief analysis of how these theories have influenced state policies, alliances, and conflicts in these instances.\n1. Cold War Power Dynamics: During the Cold War, the Mandala Theory had a profound effect on the strategies of both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. They focused on their respective neighboring regions and endeavored to establish spheres of influence. The United States, for instance, implemented the Mandala Theory by forming alliances in its adjacent regions, such as NATO in Western Europe. Influence of Geopolitical Realism: Modern geopolitical realism is compatible with the bipolar power structure of the Cold War era. States vied for power and influence, with a concern for balance of power at the forefront. In superpower strategies, the realist approach of deterrence and containment was evident.\n2. South China Sea Dispute: China's territorial claims and actions in the South China Sea can be analyzed using the Mandala Theory as a lens. China seeks to establish dominance in its immediate geopolitical environment and expand its sphere of influence, which frequently causes tensions with neighboring states like Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Modern geopolitical realism can be used to comprehend the power balance dynamics in the South China Sea. Reflecting realist concerns about maintaining power balance, the United States and its allies have engaged in containment efforts to counter China's rise in the region.\n3. Russian Annexation of Crimea and Ukraine War: The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 is an illustration of the Mandala Theory in action. Russia viewed Crimea as a part of its immediate geopolitical sphere and sought to maintain its influence there, resulting in a conflict with Ukraine. Influence of Geopolitical Realism: The international response to Russia's actions reflects realist principles. Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia and supported Ukraine to counterbalance Russian expansion, demonstrating a realist commitment to maintaining power balance and safeguarding national interests. Now these sanctions resulted in Russia invading Ukraine.\n4. India's Foreign Policy in South Asia: The Mandala Theory can be utilized to analyze India's foreign policy toward its South Asian neighbors. India seeks to maintain influence and form alliances in its neighboring regions, frequently engaging in diplomatic, economic, and military endeavors to protect its interests. Influence of Geopolitical Realism: India's realist approach aims to balance the power dynamics in South Asia, particularly in response to China's influence in the region. India's strategic alliances with Bhutan and Nepal reflect its realist concerns regarding the expansion of other regional powers. These cases demonstrate how the Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism can be applied to comprehend and analyze state policies, alliances, and conflicts in various historical and contemporary contexts. In today's complex geopolitical environment, these theories continue to be useful in the study of international relations and statecraft.",

    "section": "Conclusion and Recommendations",
    "text": "Conclusion:\n The Mandala Theory, an early form of Realism in international relations, emphasizes the importance of the state and self-interest. It recognizes the anarchic nature of the international system and stresses the need for a balance of power in the state's immediate neighborhood (mandala) to prevent any single neighbor from becoming overly powerful and posing a threat.\n Realism, on the other hand, acknowledges the absence of a global government or authority, which leads to self-help and competition among states. The Mandala Theory stresses the significance of pursuing self-interest and national security as a state's primary objective, advocating for strategies that increase a state's power and prosperity. It also takes into account geographical and geopolitical factors when assessing the behavior of neighboring states, suggesting that geography can affect alliances and strategies.\n In the Arthashastra, Kautilya offers extensive counsel on diplomacy, foreign policy, and dealing with neighboring states. He emphasizes the significance of establishing and maintaining cordial relations with neighboring states, forming alliances and treaties, espionage and intelligence gathering, war as a last resort, economic and trade policy, deception and psychological warfare, assessment of neighboring states, maintenance of internal strength, balance of power, pragmatism and flexibility in foreign policy, and self-interest.\n\nRecommendations:\n Encourage Further Comparative Research: Given the complexity and evolution of international relations, further comparative research exploring the overlaps and differences between Kautilya's Mandala Theory and modern geopolitical realism is important.\n Scholars should continue investigating how these theories apply to various regions and contexts, allowing for a deeper understanding of their implications for state conduct and alliances.\n Promote Cross-Cultural Dialogues: Cross-cultural dialogues between academics and policymakers can help bridge the gap between ancient Indian political thought and contemporary international relations. Encourage academic institutions and think tanks to organize conferences and seminars that bring together experts from diverse backgrounds to discuss the modern relevance of ancient theories.\n Diplomats and policymakers can benefit from understanding the insights provided by Kautilya's Mandala Theory and contemporary geopolitical realism. Promoting educational programs and training that acquaint practitioners with the historical and theoretical foundations of statecraft and diplomacy is crucial, allowing them to make more informed decisions within their roles.\n Analyze the Ethical Aspects: An examination of the ethical aspects of these theories should be encouraged. Academics and policymakers should investigate how applying Kautilya's Mandala Theory and contemporary geopolitical realism aligns with international norms, human rights, and ethical considerations. This can contribute to a more principled and ethical approach to state conduct and diplomacy.\n Raise Public Awareness: The significance of ancient political thought in the contemporary world should be brought to the public's attention. Educational institutions, the media, and government agencies can play a role in disseminating information about Kautilya's Arthashastra and other historical texts to improve public understanding of statecraft, diplomacy, and international relations.",
