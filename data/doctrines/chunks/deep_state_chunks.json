Senator INOUYE. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is meeting today and is joined by the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research...We are to hear testimony from the Director of Central Intelligence, Adm. Stansfield Turner, and from other Agency witnesses on issues concerning new documents supplied to the committee in the last week on drug testing conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency. It should be made clear from the outset that in general, we are focusing on events that happened over 12 or as long as 25 years ago...The reappearance of reports of the abuses of the drug testing program and reports of other previously unknown drug programs and projects for behavioral control underline the necessity for effective oversight procedures both in the executive branch and in the Congress...It is clear that effective oversight requires that information must be full and forthcoming. Full and timely information is obviously necessary if the committee and the public is to be confident that any transgressions can be dealt with quickly and forcefully...One purpose of this hearing is to give the committee and the public an understanding of what new information has been discovered that adds to the knowledge already available from previous Church and Kennedy inquiries, and to hear the reasons why these documents were not available to the Church and Kennedy committees. It is also the purpose of this hearing to address the issues raised by any additional illegal or improper activities that have emerged from the files and to develop remedies to prevent such improper activities from occurring again. Finally, there is an obligation on the part of both this committee and the CIA to make every effort to help those individuals or institutions that may have been harmed by any of these improper or illegal activities. I am certain that Admiral Turner will work with this committee to see that this will be done.",

    "text": "Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman...Some 2 years ago, the Senate Health Subcommittee heard chilling testimony about the human experimentation activities of the Central Intelligence Agency...Perhaps most disturbing of all was the fact that the extent of experimentation on human subjects was unknown. The records of all these activities were destroyed in January 1973, at the instruction of then CIA Director Richard Helms...Then one individual, through a Freedom of Information request, accomplished what two U.S. Senate committees could not. He spurred the agency into finding additional records pertaining to the CIA's program of experimentation with human subjects. These new records were discovered by the agency in March. Their existence was not made known to the Congress until July...The best safeguard against abuses in the future is a complete public accounting of the abuses of the past...The Central Intelligence Agency drugged American citizens without their knowledge or consent. It used university facilities and personnel without their knowledge. It funded leading researchers, often without their knowledge. These institutes, these individuals, have a right to know who they are and how and when they were used...So, I intend to do all I can to persuade the Agency to, at the very least, officially inform those institutions and individuals involved...Two years ago, when these abuses were first revealed, I introduced legislation, with Senator Schweiker and Senator Javits, designed to minimize the potential for any similar abuses in the future. That legislation expanded the jurisdiction of the National Commission on Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research to cover all federally funded research involving human subjects.",

    "text": "Mr. Chairman: In my letter to you of July 15, 1977, I reported our recent discovery of seven boxes of documents related to Project MKULTRA, a closely held CIA project conducted from 1953-1964. As you may recall, MKULTRA was an \"umbrella project\" under which certain sensitive subprojects were funded, involving among other things research on drugs and behavioral modification. During the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee investigations in 1975, the cryptonym became publicly known when details of the drug-related death of Dr. Frank Olson were publicized. In 1953 Dr. Olson, a civilian employee of the Army at Fort Detrick, leaped to his death from a hotel room window in New York City about a week after having unwittingly consumed LSD administered to him as an experiment at a meeting of LSD researchers called by CIA. Most of what was known about the Agency's involvement with behavioral drugs during the investigations in 1975 was contained in a report on Project MKULTRA prepared by the Inspector General's office in 1963. As a result of that report's recommendations, unwitting testing of drugs on U.S. citizens was subsequently discontinued. The MKULTRA-related report was made available to the Church Committee investigators and to the staff of Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health. Until the recent discovery, it was believed that all of the MKULTRA files dealing with behavioral modification had been destroyed in 1973 on the orders of the then retiring Chief of the Office of Technical Service, with the authorization of the then DCI, as has been previously reported. Almost all of the people who had had any connection with the aspects of the project which interested Senate investigators in 1975 were no longer with the Agency at that time. Thus, there was little detailed knowledge of the MKULTRA subprojects available to CIA during the Church Committee investigations. This lack of available details, moreover, was probably not wholly attributable to the destruction of MKULTRA files in 1973; the 1963 report on MKULTRA by the Inspector General notes on page 14: \"Present practice is to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs.\" When I reported to you last on this matter, my staff had not yet had an opportunity to review the newly located material in depth. This has now been accomplished, and I am in a position to give you a description of the contents of the recovered material. I believe you will be most interested in the following aspects of the recent discovery: How the material was discovered and why it was not previously found; The nature of this recently located material; How much new information there is in the material which may not have been previously known and reported to Senate investigators; and What we believe the most significant aspects of this find to be.",

    "section": "Discovery and Nature of MKULTRA Materials",
    "text": "To begin, as to how we discovered these materials. The material had been sent to our Retired Records Center outside of Washington and was discovered there as a result of the extensive search efforts of an employee charged with responsibility for maintaining our holdings on behavioral drugs and for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests on this subject. During the Church Committee investigation in 1975, searches for MKULTRA-related material were made by examining both the active and retired records of all branches of CIA considered at all likely to have had association with MKULTRA documents. The retired records of the Budget and Fiscal Section of the Branch responsible for such work were not searched, however. This was because financial papers associated with sensitive projects such as MKULTRA were normally maintained by the Branch itself under the project file, not by the Budget and Fiscal Section. In the case at hand, however, the newly located material was sent to the Retired Records Center in 1970 by the Budget and Fiscal Section as part of its own retired holdings. The reason for this departure from normal procedure is not known. As a result of it, however, the material escaped retrieval and destruction in 1973 by the then-retiring Director of the Office as well as discovery in 1975 by CIA officials responding to Senate investigators. The employee who located this material did so by leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to respond to FOIA requests. He reviewed all listings of material of this Branch stored at the Retired Records Center, including those of the Budget and Fiscal Section and, thus, discovered the MKULTRA-related documents which had been missed in the previous searches. In sum, the Agency failed to uncover these particular documents in 1973 in the process of attempting to destroy them; it similarly failed to locate them in 1975 in response to the Church Committee hearings. I am convinced that there was no attempt to conceal this material during the earlier searches. Next, as to the nature of the recently located material, it is important to realize that the recovered folders are finance folders. The bulk of the material in them consists of approvals for advance of funds, vouchers, accountings, and the like—most of which are not very informative as to the nature of the activities that were undertaken. Occasional project proposals or memoranda commenting on some aspect of a subproject are scattered throughout this material. In general, however, the recovered material does not include status reports or other documents relating to operational considerations or progress in the various subprojects, though some elaboration of the activities contemplated does appear.",

    "section": "Categorization and Significance of MKULTRA Subprojects",
    "text": "The recovered documents fall roughly into three categories: First, there are 149 MKULTRA subprojects, many of which appear to have some connection with research into behavioral modification, drug acquisition and testing or administering drugs surreptitiously. Second, there are two boxes of miscellaneous MKULTRA papers, including audit reports and financial statements from \"cut-out\" (i.e., intermediary) funding mechanisms used to conceal CIA's sponsorship of various research projects. Finally, there are 33 additional subprojects concerning certain intelligence activities previously funded under MKULTRA which have nothing to do either with behavioral modification, drugs, and toxins or with any other related matters. We have attempted to group the activities covered by the 149 subprojects into categories under descriptive headings. In broad outline, at least, this presents the contents of these files. The activities are placed in the following 15 categories:\n1. Research into the effects of behavioral drugs and/or alcohol\n2. Research on hypnosis\n3. Acquisition of chemicals or drugs\n4. Aspects of magicians' art useful in covert operations\n5. Studies of human behavior, sleep research, and behavioral changes during psychotherapy\n6. Library searches and attendance at seminars and international conferences on behavioral modification\n7. Motivational studies, studies of defectors, assessment, and training techniques\n8. Polygraph research\n9. Funding mechanisms for MKULTRA external research activities\n10. Research on drugs, toxins, and biologicals in human tissue; provision of exotic pathogens and the capability to incorporate them in effective delivery systems\n11. Activities whose objectives cannot be determined from available documentation\n12. Subprojects involving funding support for unspecified activities connected with the Army's Special Operations Division at Ft. Detrick, Md.\n13. Single subprojects in such areas as effects of electro-shock, harassment techniques for offensive use, analysis of extrasensory perception, gas propelled sprays and aerosols, and four subprojects involving crop and material sabotage.\n14. One or two subprojects on each of the following: \"Blood Grouping\" research, controlling the activity of animals, energy storage and transfer in organic systems; and stimulus and response in biological systems.\n15. Three subprojects cancelled before any work was done on them having to do with laboratory drug screening, research on brain concussion, and research on biologically active materials to be tested through the skin on human volunteers. Now, as to how much new the recovered material adds to what has previously been reported to the Church Committee and to Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee on Health on these topics, the answer is additional detail, for the most part: e.g., the names of previously unidentified researchers and institutions associated on either a witting or unwitting basis with MKULTRA activities, and the names of CIA officials who approved or monitored the various subprojects. Some new substantive material is also present: e.g., details concerning proposals for experimentation and clinical testing associated with various research projects, and a possibly improper contribution by CIA to a private institution. However, the principal types of activities included have, for the most part, either been outlined to some extent or generally described in what was previously available to CIA in the way of documentation and was supplied by CIA to Senate investigators.",

    "text": "For example: Financial disbursement records for the period 1960-1964 for 76 of the 149 numbered MKULTRA subprojects had been recovered from the Office of Finance by CIA and were made available to the Church Committee investigators in August or September 1975. The 1963 Inspector General report on MKULTRA made available to both the Church Committee and Senator Kennedy's Subcommittee mentions electro-shock and harassment substances; covert testing on unwitting U.S. citizens; the search for new materials through arrangements with specialists in universities, pharmaceutical houses, hospitals, state and federal institutions, and private research organizations; and the fact that the Technical Service Division of CIA had initiated 144 subprojects related to the control of human behavior between 1953-1963. The relevant section of a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division was also made available to the Church Committee staff. That report discusses techniques for human assessment and unorthodox methods of communication; discrediting and disabling materials which can be covertly administered; studies on magicians' arts as applied to covert operations; specific funding mechanisms for research performed outside of CIA; research being done on \"K\" (knockout) material, alcohol tolerance, and hypnotism; research on LSD; anti-personnel harassment and assassination delivery systems including aerosol generators and other spray devices; the role of Fort Detrick in support of CIA's Biological/Chemical Warfare capability; and material sabotage research. Much of this material is reflected in the Church Committee Report. The most significant new data discovered are, first, the names of researchers and institutions who participated in the MKULTRA project and, secondly, a possibly improper contribution by CIA to a private institution. We are now in possession of the names of 185 non-government researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with the 149 subprojects. The names of 80 institutions where work was done or with which these people were affiliated are also mentioned. The institutions include 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundations or chemical or pharmaceutical companies and the like, 12 hospitals or clinics (in addition to those associated with universities), and 3 penal institutions. While the identities of some of these people and institutions were known previously, the discovery of the new identities adds to our knowledge of MKULTRA. The facts as they pertain to the possibly improper contribution are as follows: One project involves a contribution of $375,000 to a building fund of a private medical institution. The fact that a contribution was made was previously known; indeed it was mentioned in a 1957 Inspector General report on the Technical Service Division of CIA, pertinent portions of which had been reviewed by the Church Committee staff. The newly discovered material, however, makes it clear that this contribution was made through an intermediary, which made it appear to be a private donation. As a private donation, the contribution was then matched by federal funds. The institution was not made aware of the true source of the original contribution.",

STANSFIELD TURNER, DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE, ACCOMPANIED BY FRANK LAUBINGER, OFFICE OF TECHNICAL SERVICES; AL BRODY, OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL; ERNEST MAYERFIELD, OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL; AND GEORGE L. CARY, LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL Admiral TURNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to begin by thanking you and Senator Kennedy for having a joint hearing this morning. I hope this will expedite and facilitate our getting all the information that both of your committees need into the record quickly. I would like also to thank you both for prefacing the remarks today by reminding us all that the events about which we are here to talk are 12- to 24-years old. They in no way represent the current activities or policies of the Central Intelligence Agency. What we are here to do is to give you all the information that we now have and which we did not previously have on a subject known as Project MKULTRA, a project which took place from 1953 to 1964. It was an umbrella project under which there were numerous sub- projects for research, among other things, on drugs and behavioral modification. What the new material that we offer today is a sup- plement to the considerable material that was made available in 1975, during the Church committee hearinas, and also to the Senate Sub- committee on Health and Scientific Research. At that time, the CIA offered up all of the information and docu- ments it believed it had available. The principal one available at that time that gave the greatest amount of information on this subject was a report of the CIA's Inspector General written in 1963, and which led directly to the termination of this activity in 1964, 13 years ago. The information available in 1975 to the various investigating groups was indeed sparse, first because of the destruction of material that took place in 1973. as detailed by Senator Kennedy a minute ago, with the concurrence of the then Director of Central Tntelliaence and under the supervision of the Director of the Office of Technical Services that supervised Project MKULTRA. The material in 1975 was also sparse because most of the CIA people who had been involved in 1953 to 1964 in this activity had retired from the Agency. I would further add that I think the material was sparse in part because it was the practice at that time not to keep detailed records in this category. For instance, the 1963 report of the Inspector General notes: - Present practice is to maintain no records of the planning and approval of test programs. In brief, there were few records to begin with and less after the destruction of 1973.",

It was discovered there as the result of an extensive search by an employee charged with the responsibility for maintain- ing our holdings on behavioral drugs and for responding to Freedom of Information Act requests on this subject. During the Church committee investigation of 1975, searches for MKULTRA-related material were made by examining both the active and the retired records of all of the branches of CIA considered likely to have had an association with MKULTRA documents. The retired records of the Budget and Fiscal Section of the branch that was respon- sible for such work were not searched, however. This was because the financial paper associated with sensitive projects such as MKULTRA were normally maintained by the branch itself under the project title, MKULTRA, not by the Budget and Fiscal Section under a special budget file. In the case at hand, however, this newly located material had been sent to the Retired Records Center in 1970 by the Budget and Fiscal Section of this branch as part of its own retired holdings. In short, what should have been filed by the branch itself was filed by the Budget and Fiscal Section, and what should have been filed under the project title, MKULTRA, was filed under budget and fiscal matters. The rea- son for this departure from the normal procedure of that time is simply not known, and as a result of it, however, the material escaped retrieval and destruction in 1973, as well as discovery in 1975. The employee who located this material did so by leaving no stone unturned in his efforts to respond to a Freedom of Information Act request, or several of them, in fact. He reviewed all of the listings of material of this branch, stored at the Retired Records Center, including those of the Budget and Fiscal Section, and thus discovered the MKULTRA-related documents, which had been missed in the previous searches. In sum, the agency failed to uncover these particular documents in 1973, in the process of attempting to destroy them. It similarly failed to locate them in 1975, in response to the Church committee hearings. I am personally persuaded that there is no evidence of any attempt to conceal this material during the earlier searches. Moreover, as we will discuss as we proceed, I do not believe the material itself is such that there would be a motive on the part of the CIA to withhold this, having disclosed what it did in 1975. Next, let me move to the nature of this recently located material. It is important to remember what I have just noted, that these folders that were discovered are finance folders. The bulk of the material in them consists of approvals for the advance of funds, vouchers, and accountings and such, most of which are not very informative as to the nature of the activities that they were supporting. Occasional proj- ect proposals or memoranda commenting on some aspect of a subproject are scattered throughout this material. In general, however, the re- covered material does not include overall status reports or other docu- ments relating to operational considerations, or to the progress on various subprojects, though some elaboration of the activities contem- plated does appear from time to time.",

Within this, there are 17 projects probably not involving human test- ing. There are 14 subprojects definitely involving testing on human volunteers. There are 19 subprojects probably including tests on human 'volunteers and 6 subprojects involving tests on unwitting human beings. Second, there is research on hypnosis, eight subprojects, including two involving hypnosis and drugs in combination. Third, there are seven projects on the acquisition of chemicals or drugs. Fourth, four subprojects on the aspects of the magician's art, useful in covert operations, for instance, the surreptitious delivery of drug- related materials. Fifth, there are nine projects on studies of human behavior, sleep research, and behavioral change during psychotherapy. Sixth, there are projects on library searches and attendants at semi- nars and international conferences on behavioral modifications. Seventh, there are 23 projects on motivational studies, studies of defectors, assessments of behavior and training techniques. Eighth, there are three subprojects on polygraph research. Ninth, there are three subprojects on funding mechanisms for MKULTRA's external research activities. Tenth, there are six subprojects on research on drugs, toxins, and biologicals in human tissue, provision of exotic pathogens, and the capability to incorporate them in effective delivery systems. Eleventh, there are three subprojects on activities whose nature simply cannot be determined. Twelfth, there are subprojects involving funding support for un- specified activities conducted with the Army Special Operations Divi- sion at Fort Detrich, Md. This activity is outlined in Book I of the Church committee report, pages 388 to 389. (See Appendix A, pp. 68-69). Under CIA's Project MKNAOMI, the Army assisted the CIA in developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems-for use against humans as well as against animals and crops. Thirteenth, there are single subprojects in such areas as the effects of electroshock, harassment techniques for offensive use, analysis of extrasensory perception, gas propelled sprays and aerosols, and four subprojects involving crop and material sabotage. Fourteenth, one or two subprojects on each of the following: blood grouping research; controlling the activities of animals; energy stor- age and transfer in organic systems; and stimulus and response in biological systems. Finally, 15th, there are three subprojects canceled before any work was done on them having to do with laboratory drug screening, re- search on brain concussion, and research on biologically active materials.",

For instance also, the relevant section of a 1957 Inspector General report was also made available to the Church committee staff, and that report discusses the techniques for human assessment and un- orthodox methods of communication, discrediting and disabling ma- terials which can be covertly administered, studies on magicians' arts as applied to covert operations, and other similar topics. The most significant new data that has been discovered are, first, the names of researchers and institutions who participated in MKULTRA projects, and second, a possibly improper contribution by the CIA to a private institution. We are now in the posses- sion of the names of 185 nongovernment researchers and assistants who are identified in the recovered material dealing with these 149 subprojects. There are also",

The institutions include 44 colleges or universities, 15 research foundation or chemical or pharmaceutical companies or the like, 12 hospitals or clinics, in addition to those associated with the universities, and 3 penal institutions. While the identities of some of these people and institutions were known previously, the discovery of the new identities adds to our knowledge of MKULTRA. The facts as they pertain to the possibly improper contribution are as follows. One project involves a contribution of $375,000 to a building fund of a private medical institution. The fact that that contribution was made was previously known. Indeed, it was mentioned in the 1957 report of the Inspector General on the Technical Service Division of CIA that supervised MKULTRA, and pertinent portions of this had been reviewed by the Church committee staff. The newly discovered material, however, makes it clear that this contribution was made through an intermediary, which made it appear to be a private donation. As a private donation, the contribution was then matched by Federal funds. The institution was not made aware of the true source of the gift. This project was approved by the then Director of Central Intelligence and concurred in by CIA's top management including the then General Counsel, who wrote an opinion supporting the legality of the contribution. The recently discovered documents also give greater insight into the scope of the unwitting nature of the drug testing, but contribute little more than that. We now do have corroborating information that some of the unwitting drug testing was carried out in what is known in the intelligence trade as safe houses in San Francisco and in New York City, and we have identified that three individuals were involved in this undertaking, whereas we previously reported there was only one person. We also know now that some unwitting testing took place on criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital, and that additionally research was done on a knockout or K drug in parallel with research to develop painkillers for cancer patients. These, then, are the principal findings identified to date in our review of this recovered material. As noted earlier, we believe the detail on the identities of researchers and institutions involved in CIA sponsorship of drug and behavioral modification research is a new element and one which poses a considerable problem. Most of the people and institutions involved were not aware of CIA sponsorship.",

I believe that we all have a moral obligation to these researchers and institutions to protect them from any unjustified embarrassment or damage to their reputations which revelation of their identities might bring. In addition, I have a legal obligation under the Privacy Act not to publicly disclose the names of the individual researchers without their consent. This is especially true, of course, for those researchers and institutions which were unwitting participants in CIA sponsored activities. Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I certainly recognize the right and the need of both the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research to investigate the circumstances of these activities in whatever detail you consider necessary. I am providing your committee with all of the documentation, including all of the names, on a classified basis. I hope that this will facilitate your investigation while still protecting the individuals and the institutions involved. Let me emphasize again that the MKULTRA events are 12 to 24 years in the past, and I assure you that CIA is in no way engaged in either witting or unwitting testing of drugs today. Finally, I am working closely with the Attorney General on this matter. We are making available to the Attorney General whatever materials he may deem necessary to any investigations that he may elect to undertake. Beyond that, we are also working with the Attorney General to determine whether it is practicable from this new evidence to identify any of the persons to whom drugs may have been administered unwittingly. No such names are part of these records. We have not identified the individuals to whom drugs were administered, but we are trying now to determine if there are adequate clues to lead to their identification, and if so how best to go about fulfilling the Government's responsibilities in this matter. Mr. Chairman, as we proceed with that process of attempting to identify the individuals and then determining what is our proper responsibility to them, I will keep both of these committees fully advised. I thank you, sir.",

Senator Kennedy, it is totally abhorrent to me to think of using a human being as a guinea pig and in any way jeopardiz- ing his life and his health, no matter how great the cause. I am not here to pass judgment on my predecessors, but I can assure you that this is totally beyond the pale of my contemplation of activities that the CIA or any other of our intelligence agencies should undertake. I am taking and have taken what I believe are adequate steps to insure that such things are not continuing today. Senator KENNEDY. Could you tell us a little bit about that? Admiral TURNER. I have asked for a special report assuring me that there are no drug activities extant, that is, drug activities that involve experimentation. Obviously, we collect intelligence about drugs and drug use in other countries, but there are no experimentations being conducted by the Central Intelligence Agency, and I have had a special check made because of another incident that was uncovered some years ago about the unauthorized retention of some toxic materials at the CIA. I have had an actual inspection made of the storage places and the certification from the people in charge of those that there are no such chemical biological materials present in our keeping, and I have issued express orders that that shall not be the case. Beyond that, I have to rely in large measure on my sense of com- mand and direction of the people and their knowledge of the attitude I have just expressed to you in this regard. Senator KENNEDY.

I mean, that is some other question, but I think you went to an awful lot of trouble, where these things could have been.

Admiral TURNER. There is no experimentation with drugs on human beings, witting or unwitting, being conducted in any way. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Or being supported indirectly? I mean, are you contracted out? Admiral TURNER. Or being in any way supported. Senator KENNEDY. All right. How about the nondrug experimenta- tion our Committee has seen-psychosurgery, for example, or psy- chological research? Admiral TURNER. We are continually involved in what we call as- sessment of behavior. For instance, we are trying to continually im- prove our polygraph procedures to, you know, assess whether a person is lying or not. This does not involve any tampering with the individ- ual body. This involves studying records of people's behavior under different circumstances, and so on, but it is not an experimental thing. Have I described that accurately, Al? Mr. BRODY. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is limited to those areas? Admiral TURNER. Yes; it does not involve attempting to modify be- havior. It only involves studying behavior conditions, but not trying to actively modify it, as was one of the objectives of MKULTRA.",

Maybe you can either respond now or submit it for the record, if you would do that. Would you provide that for the record? Admiral TURNER. Yes. [The material on psychological assessments follows:] Psychological assessments are performed as a service to officers in the opera- tions directorate who recruit and/or handle agents. Except for people involved in training courses, the subjects of the assessments are foreign nationals. The assessments are generally done to determine the most successful tactic to persuade the subject to accept covert employment by the CIA, and to make an appraisal of his reliability and truthfulness. A majority of the work is done by a staff of trained psychologists, some of whom are stationed overseas. The assessments they do may be either direct or indirect. Direct assessments involve a personal interview of the subject by the psychologist. When possible the subject is asked to complete a formal \"intelli- gence test\" which is actually a disguised psychological test. Individuals being assessed are not given drugs, nor are they subjected to physical harassment or torture. When operating conditions are such that a face-to-face interview is not possible, the psychologist may do an indirect assessment, using as source ma- terials descriptions of the subject by others, interviews with people who know him, specimens of his writings, etc. The other psychological assessments involve handwriting analysis or grapho- logical assessment. The work is done by a pair of trained graphologists, assisted by a small number of measurement technicians. They generally require at least a page of handwritten script by the subject. Measurements are made of about 30 different writing characteristics, and these are charted and furnished to the graphologist for assessments. The psychologists also give courses in psychological assessment to group of operations officers, to sharpen their own capabilities to size up people. As part of the training course, the instructor does a psychological assessment of each student. The students are witting participants, and results are discussed with them. It is important to reiterate that psychological assessments are only a service to the operations officers. In the final analysis, it is the responsibility of the operations officer to decide how a potential agent should be approached, or to make a judgement as to whether any agent is telling the truth.",

Well, why else would they give this money for the building fund if the building was not used for a purpose that benefited the CIA program? Admiral TURNER. I certainly draw the inference that the CIA expected to benefit from it, and some of the wording says the General Counsel's opinion was that this was legal only if the CIA was going to derive adequate benefit from it, but, sir, there is no evidence of what benefit was derived. Senator ScHW- EIKER. There must have been some pretty good benefits at stake. The Atomic Energy Commission was to bear a share of the cost, and when they backed out for some reason or another, the CIA picked up part of their tab. So, at two different points there were indications that CIA decisionmakers thought there was great benefit to be derived from whatever happened within the brick and mortar walls of that facility. Admiral TURNER. You are absolutely right. I am only taking the position that I cannot substantiate that there was benefit derived. Senator SCHWEIKER. The agreement documents say that the CIA would have access to one-sixth of the space involved in the construction of the wing, so how would you enter into an agreement that specifically says that you will have access to and use of one-sixth of the space and not perform something in that space? I cannot believe it was empty. Admiral TURNER. Sir, I am not disputing you at all, but both of us are saying that the inference is that one-sixth of the space was used, that experimentation was done, and so on, but there is no factual evi- dence of what went on as a result of that payment or what went on in that hospital. It is just missing. It is not that it didn't happen. Senator SCHTWEIKER. Admiral Turner, one other Senator KENNEDY. Would the Senator yield on that point? Senator SCHWEIKEu. I understand that in the agency's documents on the agreement it was explicitly stated that one-sixth of the facility would be designated for CIA use and made available for CIA re- search. Are you familiar- Mr. BnoDY. Senator, as I recall, you are right in that there is a men- tion of one-sixth, but any mention at all has to do with planning. There are no subsequent reports as to what happened after the construction took place. Senator SCIWKEnR. Admiral Turner, I read in the New York Times that part of this series of MKULTRA experiments involved an ar- rangement with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to test LSD sur- reptitiously on unwitting patrons in bars in New York and San Francisco. Some of the subjects became violently ill and were hos- pitalized. I wonder if you would just briefly describe what we were doing there and how it was carried out? I assume it was through a safe house operation. I don't believe your statement went into much detail. Admiral TURNER. I did mention the safe house operation in my statement, sir, and that is how these were carried out. What we have learned from the new documentation is the location and the dates at which the safe houses were run by the CIA and the identification of three individuals who were associated with running those safe houses. We know something about the construction work that was done in them because there were contracts for this. Beyond that, we are pretty much drawing inferences as to the things that went on as to what you are saying here.",

If you happened to be at the wrong bar at the wrong place and time, you got it. Mr. BRODY. Senator, that would be-contacts were made, as we understand it, in bars, et cetera, and then the people may have been invited to these safe houses. There really isn't any indication as to the fact that this took place in the bars. Admiral TURNER. We are trying to be very precise with you, sir, and not draw an inference here. There are 6 cases of these 149 where we have enough evidence in this new documentation to substantiate that there was unwitting testing and some of that involves these safe houses. There are other cases where it is ambiguous as to whether the testing was witting or voluntary. There are others where it was clearly voluntary. Senator SCHWEIKER. Of course, after a few drinks, it is questionable whether informed consent means anything to a- person in a bar anyway. Admiral TURNER. Well, we don't have any indication that all these cases where it is ambiguous involved drinking of any kind. There are cases in penal institutions where it is not clear whether the prisoner was given a choice or not. I don't know that he wasn't given a choice, but I don't positively know that he was, and I classify that as an ambiguous incident. Senator INoUYE. Your time is up, Senator. Senator Huddleston?

Admiral Turner, you stated in your testimony that you are con- vinced there was no attempt to conceal this recently discovered docu- mentation during the earlier searches. Did you question the individ- uals connected with the earlier search before you made that judgment? Admiral TURNER. Yes; I haven't, I don't think, questioned every- body who looked in the files or is still on our payroll who looked in the files back in 1975, but Mr. Laubinger on my left is the best author- ity on this, and I have gone over it with him in some detail. Senator HUDDLESTON. But you have inquired, you think, sufficiently to assure yourself that there was no intent on the part of any person to conceal these records from the previous committee? Admiral TURNER. I am persuaded of that both by my questioning of people and by the circumstances and the way in which these docu- ments were filed, by the fact. which I did not and should have men- tioned in my testimony, that these were not the official files. The ones that we have received or retrieved were copies of files that were work- ing files that somebody had used, and therefore were slipped into a different location, and again I say to you, sir, I can't imagine their deliberately concealing these particular files and revealing the other things that they did reveal in 1975. I don't see the motive for that, because these are not that damning compared with the overall material that was provided.",

But if it were going on with your knowledge, would you report it to the committee? I assume you would. Admiral TURNER. Yes. Well, it would not be going on with my knowledge, but theoretically the answer is yes, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON.

Would you suggest that it ought to be specifically out- lined in a statutory charter setting out the parameters of the per- missible operation of the various agencies? Admiral TURNER. I think that certainly is something we must con- sider as we look at the legislation for charters. I am not on the face of it opposed to it. I think we would have to look at the particular wording as we are going to have to deal with the whole charter issue as to exactly how precise you want to be in delineating restraints and curbs on the intelligence activities. Senator HUDDLESTON. In the case of sensitive type operations, which this certainly was, which might be going on today, is the oversight activity of the agency more intensive now than it was at that time? Admiral TURNER. Much more so. I mean, I have briefed you, sir, and the committee on our sensitive operations. We have the Intel- ligence Oversight Board. We have a procedure in the National Se- curity Council for approval of very sensitive operations. I think the amount of spotlight focused on these activities is many, manyfold what it was in these 12 to 24 years ago. Senator HUDDLESTON. How about the record keeping? Admiral TURNER.

Admiral, I was particularly interested in the activity that took place at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital at Lexington, Ky., in which a Dr. Harris Isbell conducted experiments on people who were presumably patients there. There was a narcotics institution, I take it, and Dr. Isbell was, according to the New York Times story, carrying on a secret series of correspondence with an individual at the agency by the name of Ray. Have you identified who that person is? Admiral TURNER\n. Sir, I find myself in a difficult position here at a public hearing to confirm or deny these names in view of my legal responsibilities under the Privacy Act not to disclose the names of individuals here. Senator HUDDLESTON. I am just. asking you if you have identified the person referred to in that article as Ray. I am not asking you who he was. I just want to know if you know who he is. Admiral TURNER. No. I am sorry, was this W-r-a-y or R-a-y? Senator HUDDLESTON. It is listed in the news article as R-a-y, in quotations. Admiral TURNER. No, sir, we have not identified him. Senator HUDDLESTON. So you have no knowledge of whether or not he is still a member of your staff or connected with the Agency in any way. Have you attempted to identify him? [Pause.] Admiral TURNER. Senator, we have a former employee whose first name is Ray who may have had some connection with these activities. Senator HUDDLESTON. You suspect that but you have not verified that at this time, or at least you are not in a position to indicate that you have verified it? Admiral TURNER. That is correct. Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INOUYE. Senator Wallopi? Senator WALLOP. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, not all of the-and in no way trying to excuse you of the hideous nature of some of these projects, but not all of the projects under MKULTRA are of a sinister or even a moral nature. Is that a fair statement? Admiral TURNER. That is correct. Senator WALLOP. Looking down through some of these 17 projects not involving human testing, aspects of the magician's art, it doesn't seem as though there is anything very sinister about that. Studies of human behavior and sleep research, library searches. Now, those things in their way are still of interest, are they not, to the process of intelligence gathering? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. I have not tried to indicate that we either are not doing or would not do any of the things that were involved in MKULTRA, but when it comes to the witting or unwitting testing of people with drugs, that is certainly verboten, but there are other things. Senator WALLOP. Even with volunteer patients? I mean, I am not trying to put you on the spot to say whether it is going on, but I mean, it is not an uncommon thing, is it, in the prisons of the United States for the Public Health Service to conduct various kinds of experiments with vaccines and, say, sunburn creams? I know in Arizona they have done so. Admiral TURNER. My understanding is, lots of that is authorized. but I am not of the opinion that this is not the CIA's business, and that if we need some information in that category, I would prefer to go to the other a'ppropriate authorities of the Government and ask them to get it for us r-ther than to in any way-",

A President would not have been horrified by the list of the legitimate types of things. Isn't that probably the case? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator WALLOP. And if it did in fact appear in the IG report, is there any reason to suppose that the President did not know of this project? You said there was no reason to suppose that he did, but let me reverse that. Is there any reason to suppose that they did not? Admiral TURNER. No. Senator WALLOP. Well, you know, I just cannot imagine you or literally anybody undertaking projects of the magnitude of dollars here and just not knowing about it, not informing your superior that these were going on, especially when certain items of it appear in the Inspector General's report on budget matters. Admiral TURNER. Well, I find it difficult when it is that far back to hypothesize what the procedures that the Director was using in terms of informing his superiors were. It is quite a different climate from today, and I think we do a lot more informing today than they did back then, but I find it very difficult to guess what the level of knowl- edge was.",

Your question is, was this vital? Did we view it as vital? Senator WALLOP. Well, your implication at the beginning was that it was a response to the kinds of behavior that were seen in Cardinal Mindszenty's trial and other things.

    "text": "[The material referred to follows:] \"TRUTH\" DRUGS IN INTERROGATION The search for effective aids to interrogation is probably as old as man's need to obtain information from an uncooperative source and as persistent as his impatience to shortcut any tortuous path. In the annals of police investigation, physical coercion has at times been substituted for painstaking and time-con- suming inquiry in the belief that direct methods produce quick results. Sir James Stephens, writing in 1883, rationalizes a grisly example of \"third degree\" prac- tices by the police of India : \"It is far pleasanter to sit comfortably in the shade rubbing red pepper in a poor devil's eyes than to go about in the sun hunting up evidence.\" More recently, police officials in some countries have turned to drugs for assist- ance in extracting confessions from accused persons, drugs which ara esumed 26 to relax the individual's defenses to the point that he unknowingly reveals truthiS he has been trying to conceal. This investigative technique, however humanitarian as an alternative to p~hysical torture, still raises serious questions of individual rights and liberties. In this country, where drugs have gained only marginal acceptance in police work, their use has provoked cries of \"psychological third degree\" and has precipitated medico-legal controversies that after a quarter of a century still occasionally flare into the open. The use of so-called \"truth\" drugs in police work is similar to the accepted psychiatric practice of narco-analysis; the difference. in the two procedures lies in their different objectives. The police investigator is concerned with empirical truth that may be used against the suspect, and therefore almost solely with probative truth: the usefulness of the suspect's revelations depends ultimately on their acceptance in evidence by a court of law. The psychiatist, on the other hand, using the same \"truth\" drugs in diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill, is primarily concerned with psychological truth or psychological reality rather than empirical fact. A patient's aberrations are reality for him at the time they occur, and an accurate account of these fantasies and delusions, rather than reliable recollection of past events, can be the key to recovery. The notion of drugs capable of illuminating hidden recesses of the mind, help- ing to heal the mentally ill and preventing or reversing the miscarriage of justice, has provided an exceedingly durable theme for the press and popular literature. While acknowledging that \"truth serum\" is a misnomer twice over-the drugs are not sera and they do not necessarily bring forth probative truth-journalistic accounts continue to exploit the appeal of the term. The formula is to play up a few spectacular \"truth\" drug successess and to imply that the drugs are more maligned than need be and more widely employed in criminal investigation than can officially be admitted. Any technique that promises an increment of success in extracting information from an uncompliant source is ipso facto of interest in intelligence operations. If the ethical considerations which in Western countries inhibit the use of narco- interrogation in police work are",

    "text": "felt also in intelligence, the Western services must at least be prepared against its possible employment by the adversary. An understanding of \"truth\" drugs, their characteristic actions, and their potentiali- ties, positive and negative, for eliciting useful information is fundamental to an adequate defense against them. This discussion, meant to help toward such an understanding, draws primarily upon openly published materials. It has the limitations of projecting from crimi- nal investigative practices and from the permissive atmosphere of drug psycho- therapy. SCOPOLAMINE AS \"TRUTH SERUM\" Early in this century physicians began to employ scopolamine, along with morphine and chloroform, to induce a state of \"twilight sleep\" during childbirth. A constituent of henbane, scopolamine was known to produce sedation and drowsi- ness, confusion and disorientation, incoordination, and amnesia for events ex- perienced during intoxication. Yet physicians noted that women in twilight sleep answered questions accurately and often volunteered exceedingly candid remarks. In 1922 it occurred to Robert House, a Dallas, Texas obstetrician, that a similar technique might be employed in the interrogation of suspected criminals, and he arranged to interview under scopolamine two. prisoners in the Dallas county jail whose guilt seemed clearly confirmed. Under the drug, both men denied the charges on which they were held; and both, upon trial, were found not guilty. Enthusiastic at this success, House concluded that a patient under the influence of scopolamine \"cannot create a lie . . . and there is no power to think or rea- son.\" [14] His experiment and this conclusion attracted wide attention, and the idea of a \"truth\" drug was thus launched upon the public consciousness. The phrase \"truth serum\" is believed to have appeared first in a news -report of House's experiment in the Los Angeles Record, sometime in 1922. House resisted the term for a while but eventually came to employ it regularly himself. He pub- lished some eleven articles on scopolamine in the years 1921-1929, with a notice- able increase in polemical zeal as time went on. What had begun as something of a scientific statement turned finally into a dedicated crusade by the \"father of truth serum\" on behalf of his offspring, wherein he was \"grossly indulgent of its wayward behavior and stubbornly proud of its minor achievements.\" [11] Only a handful of cases in which scopolamine was used for police interroga- tion came to public notice, though there is evidence suggesting that some police forces may have used it extensively. [2, 16] One police writer claims that the threat of scopolamine interrogation has been effective in extracting confessions from criminal suspects, who are told they will first be rendered unconscious by chloral hydrate placed covertly in their coffee or drinking water.[16] Because of a number of undesirable side effects, scopolamine was shortly dis- qualified as a \"truth\" drug. Among the most disabling of the side effects are hallucinations, disturbed perception, somnolence, and physiological phenomena such as headache, rapid heart, and blurred vision, which distract the subject from the central purpose of the interview. Furthermore, the physical action is long, far outlasting the psychological effects. Scopolamine continues, in some cases, to make anesthesia and surgery safer by drying the mouth and throat and reducing secre- tions that might obstruct the air passages. But the fantastically, almost painfully, dry \"desert\" mouth brought on by the drug is hardly conducive to free talking, even in a tractable subject. THE BARBITURATES The first suggestion that drugs might facilitate communication with emo- tionally disturbed patients came quite by accident in 1916. Arthur S. Lovenhart and his associates at the University of Wisconsin, experimenting with respiratory stimulants, were surprised when, after an injection of sodium cyanide, a catatonic patient who had long been mute and rigid suddenly relaxed, opened his eyes, and even answered a few questions. By the early 1930's a number of psychiatrists were experimenting with drugs as an adjunct to established methods of therapy. At about this time police officials, still attracted by the possibility that drugs migh help in the interrogation of suspects and witnesses, turned to a class of depressant drugs known as the barbiturates. By 1935 Clarence W. Muehlberger, head of the Michigan Crime Detection Laboratory at East Lansing, Was using barbiturates on reluctant suspects, though police work continued to be hampered by the courts' rejection of drug-induced confessions except in a few carefully circumscribed instances. The barbiturates, first synthesized in 1903, are among the oldest of modern drugs and the most versatile of all depressants. In this half-century some 2",

    "text": ",500 have been prepared, and about two dozen of these have won an important place in medicine. An estimated three to four billion doses of barbiturates are pre- scribed by physicians in the United States each year, and they have come to be known by a variety of commercial names and colorful slang expressions: \"goof- balls,\" Luminal, Nembutal, \"red devils.\" \"yellow jackets.\" \"pink ladies,\" etc. Three of them which are used in narcoanalysis and have seen service as \"truth\" drugs are sodium amytal (amobarbital), pentothal sodium (thiopental), and to a lesser extent seconal (secobarbital). As one pharmacologist explains it, a subject coming under the Influence of a barbiturate injected intravenously goes through all the stages of progressive drunkenness, but the time scale is on the order of minutes instead of hours. Outwardly the sedation effect is dramatic, especially if the subject is a psychiatric patient in tension. His features slacken, his body relaxes. Some people are momentarily excited; a few beocme silly and giggly. This usually passes, and most subjects fall asleep, emerging later in disoriented semi-wakefulness. The descent into narcosis and beyond with progressively larger doses can be divided as follows: I. Sedative stage. II. Unconsciousness, with exaggerated reflexes (hyperactive stage). III. Unconsciousness, without reflex even to painful stimuli. IV. Death. Whether all these stages can be distinguished in any given subject depends largely on the dose and the rapidity with which the drug is induced. In anesthesia, stages I and II may last only two or three seconds. The first or sedative stage can be further divided: Plane 1. No evident effect, or slight sedative effect. Plane 2. Cloudiness, calmness, amnesia. (Upon recovery, the subject will not remember what happened at this or \"lower\" planes or stages.) Plane 3. Slurred speech, old thought patterns disrupted, inability to inte- grate or learn new patterns. Poor coordination. Subject becomes unaware of paniful stimuli. Plane 3 is the psychiatric \"work\" stage. It may last only a few minutes, but it can be extended by further slow injection of drug. The usual practice is to bring the subject quickly to Stage II and to conduct the interview as he passes back into the sedative stage on the way to full consciousness. CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES The general abhorrence in Western countries for the use of chemical agents \"to make people do things against their will\" has precluded serious systematic study (at least as published openly) of the potentialities of drugs for interroga- tion. Louis A. Gottschalk, surveying their use in information-seeking inter- views, [13] cites 136 references; but only two touch upon the extraction of Intelligence information, and one of these concludes merely that Russian tech- niques in interrogation and indoctrination are derived from age-old police methods and do not depend on the use of drugs. On the validity of confessions obtained with drugs, Gottschalk found only three published experimental studies .that he deemed worth reporting. One of these reported experiments by D. P. Morris in which intravenous sodium amytal was helpful in detecting malingerers. [12] The subjects, soldiers, were at first sullen,.negativistic, and non-productive under amytal, but as the inter- view proceeded they revealed the fact of and causes for their malingering. Usually the interviews turned up a neurotic or psychotic basis for the deception. The other two confession studies, being more relevant to the highly special- ized, untouched area of drugs in intelligence interrogation, deserve more detailed review. Gerson and Victoroff [12] conducted amytal interviews with 17 neuropsychiatric patients, soldiers who had charges against them, at Tilton General Hospital, Fort Dix. First they were interviewed without amytal by a psychiatrist, who, neither ignoring nor stressing their situation as prisoners or suspects under scrutiny, urged each of them to discuss his social and family background, his army career, and his version of the charges pending against him. The patients were told only a few minutes in advance that narcoanalysis would be performed. The doctor was considerate, but positive and forthright. He indi- cated that they had no choice but to submit to the procedure. Their attitudes varied from unquestioning compliance to downright refusal. Each patient was brought to complete narcosis and permitted to sleep. As he became semiconscious and could be stimulated to speak, he was held in this stage with additional amytal while the questioning proceeded. He was questioned first about innocuous matters from his background that he had discussed before receiving the drug.",

    "text": "Whenever possible, the subject was manipulated into raising the charges against him before direct questioning. If he did this too consciously, he was asked to \"talk about that later\" and a less suspicious topic was introduced, delaying the interrogation until he was back in the proper stage of narcosis.  This differed from therapeutic narcoanalysis in the setting, the type of patients, and the \"truth\" sought. Subjects were kept in twilight consciousness longer, a state yielding more prejudicial admissions. Speech was thick and disconnected, but discretion was reduced. This valuable period, lasting five to ten minutes, could be reinduced with more amytal. Interrogation techniques varied based on the patient's background, the charges, attitude under narcosis, and rapport with the doctor. Sometimes pretending the patient had confessed during amnesia and urging elaboration worked. Denials were ignored, and questions reworded. Patients revealed fantasies, fears, and delusions, sometimes indistinguishable from reality. One claimed a non-existent child, another threatened a deceased stepfather, and another confessed to a robbery he hadn't committed. Testimony about dates and places was unreliable due to lost time-sense. Veracity about names and events was questionable.  Confusion about actual events and thoughts/fears sometimes unintentionally concealed the truth. As the subject revived, awareness of the interrogation led to negativity, hostility, or aggression, sometimes requiring restraint. Some, in anger and assuming confession, defiantly acknowledged guilt. As excitement subsided, some reverted to original stories, others verified confessions. In follow-up, nine of seventeen admitted confession validity; eight repudiated them. Gerson and Victoroff conclude persistent questioning reduces ambiguities but doesn't eliminate them. One experiment showed subjects could maintain lies under barbiturates. Redlich et al. gave sodium amytal to volunteers who'd revealed shameful episodes and then created cover stories.  Normal individuals with good defenses maintained their stories. Neurotic individuals confessed more easily, substituting fantasy. Recently, stimulants like amphetamine and methamphetamine have been used in therapy, producing an outpouring helpful for diagnosis. Their interrogation potential is understudied. Brussel et al. claim methedrine gives liars no time to think, trapping them. Gottschalk disputes this, citing lack of controls. Combined use of barbiturates, stimulants, and tranquilizers warrants exploration.",

Psychopaths resist drug influence. MacDonald describes a psychopath feigning amnesia and falsely confessing to murder, enjoying the examination and requesting more amytal. He concludes that pre-drug liars will lie under narcosis, drugs are ineffective for revealing deceptions, and are better for releasing repressed material than evoking suppressed information. L.Z. Freedman, working with mentally unstable subjects, found drug interviews psychiatrically beneficial but seldom clarifying objective reality. He couldn't determine if acts occurred based on narco-interrogation. Like MacDonald, he found psychopaths could deny crimes despite objective evidence. F.G. Inbau, a Northwestern University law professor, claims drug effectiveness is limited to those who would confess anyway and that determined liars can maintain deception. Grinker and Spiegel, military psychiatrists, concluded they could obtain similar material and emotional release without drugs given sufficient time. These professionals suggest drugs provide rapid access to psychiatrically useful information, but its empirical truth is doubtful. Non-drug psychotherapy and skillful interrogation can yield the same psychological information and more reliable truth.",

    "text": "Drugs can only aid interrogators understanding normal interrogation psychology and techniques. The mix of truth and fantasy in drug-induced output increases demands on skill, as does the heightened tendency to give desired responses. Suggestibility can be exploited with subjects feigning ignorance of a language or skill. Lipton found sodium amytal helpful in determining feigned language ignorance.  A drugged interrogatee might struggle to maintain pretense about professional idiom. Hostility in the interrogator-source relationship is problematic. Drug knowledge comes from trusting patient-physician relationships. Subjects are usually motivated to cooperate, even in anxious police settings where some trust exists. Drug interrogation rarely involves \"normal\" individuals in hostile settings.  Lindemann's \"normal\" subjects in a non-threatening setting reported euphoria, ease, confidence, and increased talkativeness. Gerson and Victoroff cite poor rapport as hindering confessions from coerced soldiers. Rapport seems crucial for unguarded disclosures.  Role-playing might be a solution. Sargent recommends distorting patient experiences in therapy for heightened emotional response. Drugged subjects may accept false constructions.  A drugged subject might communicate freely with an interrogator playing a role familiar to them. Even with poor rapport, the subject's feeling of having revealed much can be exploited for genuine confessions. Placebo reactors, responding to any administration, might be exploited. When guilt hinders interrogation, a placebo might absolve responsibility and facilitate communication. Placebos are most effective under stress, with anxious, self-centered individuals dependent on external stimulation. Non-reactors are more rigid with better emotional control. Combining drugs with hypnosis and post-hypnotic suggestion might prevent drug experience recollection.  However, inducing trance in resistant subjects is debated. Orne doubts trance can be induced against a subject's will or unaware, unless a positive relationship exists, unlikely in interrogation. Pentothal sodium is sometimes used in medical hypnosis for deeper narcosis after light trance induction.",

    "section": "Defensive Measures & Concerns",
    "text": "There is no known way of building tolerance for a \"truth\" drug without creating a disabling addiction, or of arresting the action of a barbiturate once induced. The only full safeguard against narco-interrogation is to prevent the administration of the drug. Short of this, the best defense is to make use of the same knowledge that suggests drugs for offensive operations: if a subject knows that on emerging from narcosis he will have an exaggerated notion of how much he has revealed he can better resolve to deny he has said anything.\n\nThe disadvantages and shortcomings of drugs in offensive operations become positive features of the defense posture. A subject in narco-interrogation is intoxicated, wavering between deep sleep and semi-wakefulness. His speech is garbled and irrational, the amount of output drastically diminished. Drugs disrupt established thought patterns, including the will to resist, but they do so indiscriminately and thus also interfere with the patterns of substantive information the interrogator seeks. Even under the conditions most favorable for the interrogator, output will be contaminated by fantasy, distortion, and untruth.\n\nPossibly the most effective way to arm oneself against narco-interrogation would be to undergo a \"dry run.\" A trial drug interrogation with output taped for playback would familiarize an individual with his own reactions to \"truth\" drugs, and this familiarity would help to reduce the effects of harassment by the interrogator before and after the drug has been administered. From the viewpoint of the intelligence service, the trial exposure of a particular operative to drugs might provide a rough benchmark for assessing the kind and amount of information he would divulge in narcosis.\n\nThere may be concern over the possibility of drug addiction intentionally or accidentally induced by an adversary service. Most drugs will cause addiction with prolonged use, and the barbiturates are no exception. In recent studies at the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital for addicts in Lexington, Ky., subjects received large doses of barbiturates over a period of months. Upon removal of the drug, they experienced acute withdrawal symptoms and behaved in every respect like chronic alcoholics. Because their action is extremely short, however, and because there is little likelihood that they would be administered regularly over a prolonged period, barbiturate \"truth\" drugs present slight risk of operational addiction. If the adversary service were intent on creating addiction in order to exploit withdrawal, it would have other, more rapid means of producing states as unpleasant as withdrawal symptoms.\n\nThe hallucinatory and psychotomimetic drugs such as mescaline, marihuana, LSD-25, and microtine are sometimes mistakenly associated with narcoanalytic interrogation. These drugs distort the perception and interpretation of the sensory input to the central nervous system and affect vision, audition, smell, the sensation of the size of body parts and their position in space, etc. Mescaline and LSD-25 have been used to create experimental \"psychotic states,\" and in a minor way as aids in psychotherapy. Since information obtained from a person in a psychotic drug state would be unrealistic, bizarre, and extremely difficult to assess, the self-administration of LSD-25, which is effective in minute dosages, might in special circumstances offer an operative temporary protection against interrogation. Conceivably, on the other hand, an adversary service could use such drugs to produce anxiety or terror in medically unsophisticated subjects unable to distinguish drug-induced psychosis from actual insanity. An enlightened operative could not be thus frightened, however, knowing that the effect of these hallucinogenic agents is transient in normal individuals. Most broadly, there is evidence that drugs have least effect on well-adjusted individuals with good defenses and good emotional control, and that anyone who can withstand the stress of competent interrogation in the waking state can do so in narcosis. The essential resources for resistance thus appear to lie within the individual.",

The barbiturates, by disrupting defensive patterns, may sometimes be helpful in interrogation, but even under the best conditions they will elicit an output contaminated by deception, fantasy, garbled speech, etc. A major vulnerability they produce in the subject is a tendency to believe he has revealed more than he has. It is possible, however, for both normal individuals and psychopaths to resist drug interrogation; it seems likely that any individual who can withstand ordinary intensive interrogation can hold out in narcosis. The best aid to a defense against narco-interrogation is foreknowledge of the process and its limitations. There is an acute need for controlled experimental studies of drug reaction, not only to depressants but also to stimulants and to combinations of depressants, stimulants, and ataraxics.",

If they are, I would assume that you would still try to find from either theirs or somebody else's information how to protect our people from that kind of activity.\nAdmiral TURNER. Yes.\nSenator WALLOP. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator INOUYE. Senator Chafee?\nSenator CHAFEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral Turner, I appreciate that these tawdry activities were taking place long before your watch, and I think you have correctly labeled them as abhorrent, 'but not only were they abhorrent, it seems to me they were rather bungled, amateurish experiments that don't seem to have been handled in a very scientific way, at least from the scanty evidence we have. It seems to me that there were the minimum of reports and the Agency didn't have the ability to call it quits. It went on for some 12 years, as you mentioned. What I would like to get to is, are you convinced now in your Agency that those scientific experiments, legitimate ones that you were conducting with polygraph and so forth, were being conducted in a scientific manner and that you are handling it in a correct manner to get the best information that you are seeking in the end?\nAdmiral TURNER. Yes, I am, and I also have a sense of confidence that we are limiting ourselves to the areas where we need to be involved as opposed to areas where we can rely on others.\nSenator CHAFEE. I am convinced of that from your report. I just do hope that you have people who are trained in not only handling this type of experiment, but in preparing the proper reports and drawing the proper data from the reports. You are convinced that you have this type of people?\nAdmiral TURNER. Yes, sir.\nSenator CHAFEE. The second point I am interested in was the final lines in your testimony here, which I believe are very important, and that is that the Agency is doing all it can in cooperation with other branches of the Government to go about tracking down the identity of those who were in some way adversely affected, and see what can be done to fulfill the government's responsibilities in that respect. I might add that I commend you in that, and I hope you will pursue it vigorously. A hospital in my State was involved in these proceedings, and it is unclear exactly what did take place, so I have both a parochial interest in this and a national interest as well, and I do hope you will press on with it. It involves not only you, I appreciate, but also HEW and perhaps the Attorney General.\nAdmiral TURNER. Thank you, sir. We will.\nSenator CHAFEE. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nSenator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Admiral Turner, MKULTRA subproject 3 was a project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD on unwitting persons,.was it not?\nAdmiral TURNER. Yes, sir.\nSenator INOUYE. In February 1954, and this was in the very early stages of MAKULTRA, the Director of Central Intelligence wrote to the technical services staff officials criticizing their judgment because they had participated in an experiment involving the administration of LSD on an unwitting basis to Dr. Frank Olson, who later committed suicide. Now, the individuals criticized were the same individuals who were responsible for this subproject 3, involving exactly the same practices. Even though these individuals were clearly aware of the dangers of surreptitious administration and had been criticized by the Director of Central Intelligence, subproject 3 was not terminated immediately after Dr. Olson's death. In fact. according to documents, it continued for a number of years. Can you provide this committee with any explanation of how such testing could have continued under these circumstances?\nAdmiral TURNER. No, sir, I really can't.",

Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator INOUYE. What would you do if you criticized officials of the technical services staff and they continued to carry on experimenta- tion for a number of years? Admiral TURNER. I would do two things, sir. One is, I would be sure at the beginning that I was explicit enough that they knew that I didn't want that to be continued anywhere else, and two, if I found it being continued, I would roll some heads. Senator INOUYE. Could you provide this committee with informa- tion as to whether the individuals involved had their heads rolled? Admiral TURNER. I don't believe there is any evidence they did, but I will double check that. [See p. 170 for material referred to.] Senator INOUYE. As you know, Senator Huddleston and his subcom- mittee are deeply involved in the drafting of charters and guidelines for the intelligence community. We will be meeting with the President tomorrow. Our concern is, I think, a basic one. Can anything like this occur again? Admiral TURNER. I think it would be very, very unlikely, first, be- cause we are all much more conscious of these issues than we were back in the fifties, second, because we have such thorough oversight proce- dures. I cannot imagine that this kind of activity could take place today without some member of the CIA itself bypassing me, if I were authorizing this, and writing to the Intelligence Oversight Board, and blowing the whistle on this kind of activity. I am also doing my very best, sir, to encourage an openness with myself and a free communication in the Agency, so that I am the one who finds these things if they should happen. The fact is that we must keep you and your committee and now the new committee in the House informed of our sensitive activities. I think all of these add up to a degree of scrutiny such that this kind of extensive and flagrant activity could not happen today without it coming to the attention of the proper authorities to stop it.",

I would appreciate it if you would report back to this committee in 3 months on what the Agency has done to notify these individuals and these institutions, and furthermore, to notify us as to what steps have been taken to identify victims, and if identified, what you have done to assist them, monetarily or otherwise. Admiral TURNER. All right, sir. I will be happy to. Senator GOLDWATER. Will the Senator yield? Senator INoUYE. Yes, Sir. Senator GOLDWATER. I wonder if he could include in that report for our information only a complete listing of the individuals and the experiments done on them, and whether they were'witting or unwitting, volunteer or nonvolunteer, and what has been the result in each case. I think that would be interesting. Admiral TURNER. Fine. Yes, Sir. Senator INOUYE. Senator Kennedy? Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. It is your intention to notify the in- dividuals who have been the subjects of the research, is that right, Admiral Turner? Do you intend to notify those individuals? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. If you can identify them, you intend to notify them? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And you intend to notify the universities or re- search centers as well? Admiral TURNER. Senator, I am torn on that. I understand your opening statement. I put myself in the position of the president of one of those universities, let's say. If he were witting-if his university had been witting of this activity with us, he has access to all that in- formation today. If he were not witting, I wonder if the process of informing him might put his institution's reputation in more jeopardy than letting them go on the way they are today, not knowing. I really don't know the equities here. Senator KENNEDY. Well, the problem is, all you have to do is pick up the newspapers and you see these universities mentioned. In many in- stances, I think you are putting the university people at an extraordi- nary disadvantage, where there is a complete change of administra- tion, and they may for one reason or another not have information that they are under suspicion. There is innuendo; there is rumor. I cannot help but believe that it will just get smeared all over the news- papers in spite of all the security steps that have been taken. It seems to me that those universities should be entitled to that infor- mation, so that the ones with other administrations can adapt proce- dures to protect those universities. The importance of preserving the independence of our research areas and the communities seems to me to be a very fundamental kind of question about the protection of the integrity of our universities and our research centers.",

You are saying that you feel that if we identify them privately to themselves, we can benefit them in an adequate way to cover the risk that this will lead to a more public disclosure? There are lots of the 80 who have not been identified publicly at this point. Senator KENNEDY. I think the universities themselves should be noti- fied. I think then the universities can take whatever steps in terms of their setting up the procedures to protect their own kinds of integrity in terms of the future. I would certainly hope that they would feel that they could make a public comment or a public statement on it. I think it is of general public interest, particularly for the people that are involved in those universities, to have some kind of awareness of whether they were used or were not used and how they were used. I think they are entitled to it, and quite frankly, if there is a public official or an official of the university that you notify and he wants for his own particular reasons not to have it public, I don't see why those in a lesser echelon or lower echelon who have been effectively used by it should not have the information as well. So, I would hopethat you would notify the universities and then also indicate to the public. I can't conceive that this information will not be put out in the newspapers, and it puts the university people at an extraordinary disadvantage, and of course some of it is wrong, which is the fact of the matter, and I think some university official saying, well, it isn't so, is a lot different than if they know it is con- firmed or it is not confirmed in terms of the Agency itself. I think that there is a responsibility there. Admiral TURNER. I have great sympathy with what you are saying. I have already notified one institution because the involvement was so extensive that I thought they really needed to protect themselves, and I am most anxious to do this in whatever way will help all of the people who were perhaps unwitting participants in this, and the diffi- culty I will have is, I can't quite do, I think, what you suggested, in that I may not be able to tell an institution of the extent and nature of its participation. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you can tell them to the best of your in- formation, and it seems to me that just because the university or an individual is going to be embarrassed is not a reason for classifying the information. So, I would hope-I mean, I obviously speak as an individual Senator, but I feel that that is an incredible disservice to the innocent individuals and, I think, a disservice to the integrity of the universities unless they are notified, to be able to develop pro- cedures you are developing with regards to your own institution and we are trying to in terms of the Congress. Certainly the universities are entitled to the same.",

Many of them were witting, and therefore they can take all those precautionary steps on their own, but I am perfectly open to doing this. I am only interested in doing it in a way that when identifying a university it will not lead to the public disclosure of the individuals, whom I am not allowed to disclose, and so on. Senator KENNEDY. That could be done, it seems to me. Admiral TURNER. So, we will see if we can devise a way of notifying these institutions on a private basis so that they can then make their own decision whether their equities are best served by their announc- ing it publicly or their attempting to maintain it- Senator KENNEDY. Or you. I wonder. What if they were to ask you to announce or indicate ? Admiral TURNER. My personal conscience, sir, at this time, is that I would be doing a disserve to these universities if I notified the public. Senator KENNEDY. Would you meet with some university officials and ask what their views are or whether they feel that the preserva- tion of the integrity of the universities would be better served or not? I think that would be useful to find out from small, large, private, and public universities' officials how they view the integrity Admiral TURNER. Fine. I will phone several university presidents today who are my friends and who are not involved in this, and ask them what they think the equities would be. Senator KENNEDY. All right. You let us know, too. Admiral TURNER. But I am not sure that I see that there is any great benefit in my notifying the public as opposed to the university notify- ing them. Let him have his choice whether he wants-each institution wants to have it made public. Senator KENNEDY. Yes. The fact would remain that the institution's credibility would be better served if the institution's president were to deny it and the university indicated that it did not participate in that program than if the university were to deny it and the Agency says nothing. It seems to me that that would be the strongest, and the only way that that is going to be credible. I would value it if you would get some input from universities as to what they believe is the fairest way in terms of the preservation of the integrity of the universities. Let me, if I could, ask on the question of the uses of these safe houses, as I understand from information that was provided to us in the course of our last committee, the testing of various drugs on in- dividuals happened at all social levels, high and low, it happened on native Americans and also on foreign nationals. That is what I under- stand was the nature of the project itself. Now, I am just wondering whether those tests were conducted at the two locations on the east coast and the west coast which were known as safe houses. To your knowledge, is that correct? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. In terms of the research in this particular pro- gram, it did not go beyond the safe houses located on the east coast and the west coast? I believe I am correct on that. Admiral TURNER. That type of unwitting testing of sort of ran- domly selected individuals, yes.",

Admiral Turner, I would like to come back to the experiments which may have been conducted at the hospital research facilities which the CIA helped to finance. It wasn't clear to me from your pre- vious answers what kind of work was done there. I gather you are un- clear on that, too, from your remarks, yet I find in the CIA docu- mentation which you have supplied us, a list describing some of the advantages the Agency hoped to gain. It says: (a) One-sixth of the total space in the new hospital wing will be available to the Chemical Division of TSS * * * ; (b) Agency sponsorship of sensitive research projects will be completely deniable; (c) Full professional cover will be provided for up to three biochemical employees of the Chemical Division; (4) Human patients and volunteers for experimental use will be available under controlled clinical conditions with the full supervision of and there is a blank, something has been deleted. It seems pretty clear to me what they intended to do in that par- ticular wing. Doesn't it to you? Why would you go to such elaborate preparations, to buy part of the wing, bring three of your own per- sonnel there, give them a cover, and give them access to patients? Why would you go to such trouble and expense to arrange all that, if you weren't planning to experiment on people in the hospital? Admiral TURNER. I agree with you 100 percent, sir. Those were clearly the intentions. I have no evidence that it was carried out in that way. I am not trying to be defensive, Senator. I am only trying to be absolutely precise here.",

So, I have trouble understanding why you don't know what was contemplated. Just the fact that similar programs are referred to in the document, though what they are is still deleted, should enable you to check it out.

[The material referred to follows:] Construction of the Gorman Annex was begun in 1957 and the Annex was dedicated in March 1959. Of the several MKULTRA projects conducted at Georgetown only one involving human testing covered a time span subsequent to March 1959. Subproject 45 ran from 1955 to 1963, thus it is possible that the final four years (1959-1963) of the subproject could have been spent in the Gorman Annex. However, there is no reference to the Gorman Annex or a \"new Annex\" in Subproject 45 papers, neither is there any mention of the sub- project moving to a new location in 1959 or later years. Authorization to contribute CIA funds toward construction of the Gorman Annex is contained in Subproject 35 of MKULTRA. Recently discovered material indicated that Dr. Geschickter continued his research for sleep- and amnesia- producing drugs under Project MKSEARCH through July 1967 at Georgetown University Hospital.

Well, I do believe the first year of the project in 1955 was carried out by the Office of Naval Research, according to the information that you supplied us. The CIA seems to have been par- ticipating in some way at that point, because the records go on to say that the experimenter at ONR found out about CIA's role, discovered that it was a cover, and then the project was transferred to MKULTRA in 1956. Again, this is all from the backup material you have given us. So, it was canceled at some time. I am not disagreeing with that, but apparently for at least a year or two, somebody was investigating the production of brain concussions with special black- jacks, sound waves, and other methods as detailed in the backup material.

It is surreptitious administration of material to someone, deceptive practices, how to distract someone's attention while you are doing something else, as I understand it. It was also some type of a covert communication project involved with the study of how magicians and their assistants perhaps communicate mformation to one another without having other people know it. This is the type of thing that was involved, sir.",

    "text": "Senator SCHWEIKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator INoUYE. Senator Huddleston? Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Admiral, in your checking these newly discovered documents and interviewing members of the CIA staff, did you find information that would confirm the contention described by the reporters for the New York Times that this type of experimentation was begun out of a fear at the Agency that foreign powers might have had drugs which would allow them to alter the behavior of American citizens or agents or members of the Armed Forces who were taken into custody, and which would have resulted in false confessions and the like? Is my question clear? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. I haven't personally read the documen- tation on that. In my discussions with the people who are well in- formed in this area at the Agency, I am told that that is the case. Senator HUDDLESTON. Was there any evidence or any indication that there were other motives that the Agency might also be looking for (1-ugs that could be applied for other purposes, such as debilitating an individual or even killing another person? Was this part of this kind of experimentation? Admiral TURNER. Yes; I think there is. I have not seen in this series of documentation evidence of desire to kill, but I think the project turned its character from a defensive to an offensive one as it went along, and there certainly was an intention here to develop drugs that could be of use. Senator HUDDLESTON. The project continued for some time after it was learned that, in fact, foreign powers did not have such a drug as was at first feared, didn't it? Admiral TURNER. That is my understanding. Yes, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON. Is there any indication that knowledge gained as a result of these experiments has been useful or is being applied in any way to present operations? Mr. BRODY. Senator, I am not sure if there is any body of knowledge. A great deal of what there was, I gather, was destroyed in 1973. I would like to defer to Frank here. Do you know of any? Mr. LAUBINGER. I know of no drugs or anything like that developed under this program that ever reached operational use or are in use -today.- Senator HUDDLESTON. So apparently any information that was gathered was apparently useless and not worth continuing, not worth further development on the part of the Agency. Mr. LAUBINGER. I am having difficulty hearing your questions. Senator HUDDLESTON. I can hardly hear myself. Admiral TURN",

    "text": "ER. I think the answer to your question is that we have no evidence of great usefulness on this, and yet I think we should remember- Senator HUDDLESTON. Well, is it accurate to say that this experimen- tation produced few useful results or had little application at all to the operations of the Agency or anybody else as far as we know? Admiral TURNER. I think that is basically correct. At the same time, I would point out that we had two CIA prisoners in China and one in the Soviet Union at this time, and we were concerned as to what kinds of things might be done to them, but I am not saying that- Senator HUDDLESTON. Have you detected any sign that any other na- tion is continuing or has in the past conducted experiments similar to this or with a similar objective? Admiral TURNER. I am not prepared to answer that one off the top of my head, sir, but I will get it to you. [The material referred to follows:] We maintain no files of up-to-date information on. the testing of drugs in foreign countries. Some years ago we occasionally would review foreign research on antibiotics and pharmaceuticals in connection with public bhealth and civil defense assesments. For a few years beginning in 1949 we assessed foreign research on LSD under Project ARTICHOKE because of concern that such drugs might be employed. gainst Agency and other U.S. personnel. Information relative to this work has already been provided to relevant Committees. In this early work we also occasionally looked at foreign human experimentation; we long ago eliminated our holdings on this subject and no collection requirements are any longer served. As consumer interest in this area has dropped off and higher priority areas need attention, we have virtually no present coverage with the possible exception of an occasional scanning of the literature for a specific program. To the best of our knowledge no other unit in the Intelligence Community is tracking this subject now. Senator HUDDLESTON. You don't know whether any of your agents anywhere in the world have been subjected to any kind of procedure like this? Admiral TURNER. We certainly know of other powers conducting research in these areas, yes. Senator HUDDLESTON. Do you know how they go about that research? Admiral TURNER. It is pretty sketchy, the information we have. Senator HUDDLESTON. Do you know of any other organization in this country or any institution that has conducted extensive research on unwitting individuals and through unwitting institutions? Admiral TURNER. Well, I have read something in the newspapers about this, but I have not familiarized myself with it in specifics. Senator HUDDLESTON. It is not a normal mode of operation for hu- man research, is it? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator HUDDLESTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",

    "text": "Senator INOUYE. Senator Wallop? Senator WVALLOP. Mr. Chairman, I only have one to follow up on Senator Huddleston's questions and my earlier ones. You are not really saying, are you, Admiral Turner, that there are no mind-altering drugs or behavior modification procedures which have been used by foreign powers? Adiniral TURNER. No, sir, I am not. Senator WALLOP. I drew that inference partly in answer to my ques- tion that you knew of no truth serum. Maybe that is a misnomer, but surely there are relaxants that make tongues looser than they would otherwise be. Isn't that true? Admiral TURNER. Yes. Senator WALLOP. So I think it is fair to say, too, that the experience of many American prisoners of war in the Korean conflict would indicate that there are behavior modification procedures in use by foreign powers of a fairly advanced degree of sophistication. Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator WALLOP. Again, I will just go back and say I think this must have been part of the motivation. I don't think you would have mentioned Cardinal Mindszenty had you thought his behavior was normal at the time or had anybody else. So, I would just again say I think it is a little bit scapegoating. I don't think the object of this hearing is in any way to lay blame on those passed or those dead or otherwise, but I think it is a little bit scapegoating to say that it stopped with the directors of the CIA or the DCI's of the time. Also I think it is a little bit scapegoating to say they didn't even know it, but that it was some lower echelon acting alone. I think this was a behavior pattern that was prevalent in those years, and I think the object lesson is that we have discovered, we think and we hope, through your assurances and other activities of the Congress, means of avoiding future incidents of that kind.

    "text": "Senator INOUYE. Senator Kennedy, I think you have another question. Senator KENNEDY. Just talking about the two safe houses on the east and west coast as being the sources for the unwitting trials, now, the importance of this and the magnitude of it, I think, is of signifi- cance, because we have seen from your records that these were used over a period of 8 or 9 years, and the numbers could have been con- siderable. You are unable to determine, at least in your own research, what the numbers would be and what the drugs were, how many people were involved, but it could have been considerable during this period of time. It would certainly appear to me in examining the documents and the flow charts of cash slips that were expended in these areas that it was considerable, but that is a judgmental factor on it, but I think it is important to try and find out what the Agency is attempting to do to get to the bottom of it. Now, the principal agent that was involved as I understand it is deceased and has been deceased for 2 years. The overall agent, Mr. Gottlieb, has indicated a fuzzy memory about this whole area. He has testified before the Intelligence Committee. Yet he was respon- sible for the whole program. Then, the Director had indicated the destruction of the various materials and unfamiliarity with the project. Now, you have indicated in your testimony today that there are two additional agents on page 9 of your testimony, you indicated there are two additional agents which you have uncovered at the bottom of it, and you say, the names of CIA officials who approved or monitored the various projects. You talk about the two additional agents in your testimony. Now, I am just wondering if you intend to interview those agents to find out exactly what is being done. I suppose, first of all, shouldn't the project manager know what was being done? Admiral TURNER. Our first problem, Senator, is that we have been unable to associate an individual with those names at this point. We are still burrowing to find out who these people are. We haven't identi- fied them as having been CIA employees, and we don't know whether these were false names. Senator KENNEDY. You are tracking that down, as I understand it? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. You are tracking that down, and you have every intention of interviewing those people to find out whatever you can about the program and project? Admiral TURNER. My only hesitation here is whether I will do this or the Justice Department. Senator KENNEDY. It will be pursued, though, I understand? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Either through the Agency or through the Jus- tice Department? Admiral TURNER. [Nods in the affirmative.] Senator KENNEDY. Is it plausible that the director of the program would not understand or know about the details of the program? Is it plausible that Dr. Gottlieb would not understand the full range of activities in those particular safe houses? 96-408 0 - 77 - 4 Admiral TURNER. Let me say it is unlikely. I don't know Mr. Gott- lieb.",

Not since this revelation? Well, why not? Armiral TURNER. He has left our employ, Senator. Senator KENNEDY. Does that mean that anybody who leaves is, you know, covered for lifetime? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Why wouldn't you talk with him and find out? You have new information about this program. It has been a matter of considerable interest both to our committee and to the Intelligence Committee. Why wouldn't you talk to Mr. Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Well, again, I think the issue is whether this should be done by the Justice Department or ourselves. Senator KENNEDY. Well, are we wrestling around because you and Attorney General Bell can't agree- Admiral TURNER. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. On who ought to do it? Admiral TURNER. We are proceeding together in complete agreement as to how to go. I have, in connection with trying to find all of these Americans or others who were unwittingly tested, I have some con- siderable concern about the CIA running around this country inter- viewing and interrogating people, because I don't want to give any impression that we are  doing domestic intelligence. Senator KENNEDY. I am just talking about one, in this case. That was the man who was responsible for the whole program, and to find out whether anyone within the Agency since you have had this new material has talked to Gottlieb since 1975, and if the answer is no, I want to know why not. Admiral TURNER. The reason he was not interviewed in connection with the 1975 hearings was that he had left the employ of the CIA and there was a concern on the part of the Agency that it would appear to the investigators that the CIA was in some way trying to influence him and influence his testimony before the committee. If these committees have no objection, we would be happy to contact Dr. Gottlieb and see if he can augment anything here in this new infor- mation, though I don't think there is much in this new information that he can add to as opposed to what was available in 1975. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you see, Admiral Turner, you come to the two committees this morning and indicate that now at last we have the information. We don't have to be concerned about anything in the future on it. Now, I don't know how you can give those assurances to the members of these committees as well as to the American people when you haven't since 1975 even talked to the principal person that was in charge of the program, and the records were destroyed. He is the fellow that was running the program, and the Agency has not talked to him since the development of this new material.",

Senator KENNEDY. Well, do I understand you have not contacted the Justice Department about this particular case since the development of this new material about Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Not about Gottlieb specifically. We have contacted him. Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is amazing to me. I mean, can you under- stand the difficulty that any of us might have in terms of comprehend- ing that when you develop a whole new series of materials that are on the front page of every newspaper in the country and are on every tele- vision, I mean, that means something, but it does not mean nearly as much as the interest that we have in the fact about the testing of un- witting Americans, and every single document that the staff reviews has Mr. Gottlieb's name on it and you come up to tell us that we don't have to worry any more, we have these other final facts, and Mr. Gott- lieb has not been talked to? Admiral TURNER. Sir, I am not saying that these are in any way the final facts. I am saying these are all the facts we have available. Senator KENNEDY. And you have not talked to the person who was in charge of the program, so what kind of value or what kind of weight can we give it? Admiral TURNER. We are happy to talk to him. I thinkthe issue here again is one of propriety and how to go about this. We have not, I believe, enough new information about Gottlieb's participation here to signal that his interview would be that much more revealing than what was revealed in 1975. Senator KENNEDY. The importance of it, I think, from our point of view, is, he would know the drugs that were administered, the vol- ume of drugs, how it was administered, and in terms of your ability to follow up to protect these people and their health, to the extent that it can be done, that opportunity is being lost. I want to get on to some others, but will you give us the assurance that you will get ahold of Gottlieb or that you will talk to Attorney General Bell and talk with Gottlieb? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And let us know as to the extent of it. I don't see how we can fufill our responsibility in this area on the drug test- ing without our hearing from Gottlieb as well, but I think it is im- portant that you do so, particularly since all of the materials have been destroyed.

With regards to the activities that took place in these safe houses, as I understand from the records, two-way mirrors were used. Is that your understanding? Admiral TURNER. Yes, sir. We have records that construction was done to put in two-way mirrors. Senator KENNEDY. And they were placed in the bedroom, as I understand. [Pause.] Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have documents Admiral TURNER. I believe that was in the Church record, but I don't have the details. Senator KENNEDY. And rather elaborate decorations were added, as I understand, at least, to the one in San Francisco, in the bedroom, which are French can-can dancers, floral pictures, drapery, including installation of bedroom mirrors, three framed Toulouse Lautrec posters with black silk mats, and a number of other-red bedroom curtains and recording equipment, and then a series of documents which were provided to the committee which indicate a wide proliferation of different cash for $100, generally in the $100 range over any period of time on the particular checks. Even the names are blocked out, as to the person who is receiving it. Cash for undercover agents, operating expenses, drinks, entertainment while administering, and then it is dashed out, and then the other documents, that would suggest, at least with the signature of your principal agent out there, that- \"called to the operation, midnight, and climax.\" What can you tell us that it might suggest to you about what techniques were being used by the Agency in terms of reaching that sort of broad-based group of Americans that were being evidently enticed for testing in terms of drugs and others? Do you draw any kind of conclusion about what might have been going on out there in these safe houses? Admiral TURNER. No, sir. [General laughter.] Senator KENNEDY. There is a light side to it, but there is also an enormously serious side. And that is that at least the techniques which are used or were used in terms of testing, and trying to find out exactly the range of drugs used and the numbers of people involved and exactly what that operation was about, as well as the constant reiteration of the use of small sums of cash at irregular intervals. A variety of different techniques were employed but there is an awful lot of documentation putting these matters together. When you look at the fact that it is a broad range population that has been tested, tested in these two areas, with the kind of cash slips that were used in this, payment mechanisms and decorations and all of the rest, we are not able to put a bottom line on it but one thing is for sure, and that is, Gottlieb knows. That is one thing for sure, because his name appears on just about every one of these documents, and it is, I think, very important to find out what his understanding is of the nature of that. So, we will hear more about that.",

That's right, he has, and in reviewing the record, it is not very satisfactory, and it just seems with the new information and the new documentation and the new memoranda-and he did not have the checks at that time-and with the wide variety of different memoranda with his name on it, his memory could be stimulated on that. Thank you. Senator INOUYE. I would like to thank the admiral and his staff for participating in this hearing. I believe the record should show that this hearing was held at the request of the Agency and the admiral. It was not held because we insisted upon it. It was a volunteer effort on the part of the Agency. I think the record should also indicate that Admiral Turner has forwarded to this committee a classified file including all of the names of the institutions and the persons involved as the experimentors. I should also indicate that this hearing is just one step involved in the committee's investigation of drug abuse. Just as you have had much work in going over the 8,000 pages, the staff of this committee has had equal problems, but I would like the record to show that you have made these papers and documents available to the committee. I thank you for that. As part of the ongoing investigation, we had intended to call upon many dozens of others, experimentors, or those officials in charge, and one of those will be Dr. Gottlieb. In thanking you, I would like to say this to the American people, that what we have experienced this morning in this committee room is not being duplicated in any other committee room in any other part of the world. I doubt that very much. Our Agency and our intelligence community has been under much criticism and has been subjected to much abuse, in many cases justified, but this is the most open society that I can think of. For example, in Great Britain there are about six people who are aware of the identity of the man in charge of intelligence. In other countries, similar conditions exist. Here in the United States we not only know Admiral Turner, we have had open hearings with him, such as this. The confirmation hearings were all open. In a few weeks, the Senate of the United States will debate a resolution to decide upon whether we should disclose the amounts and funds being used for counterintelligence and national intelligence. I would hope that in presenting this issue to the public, the media will take note that the Agency has cooperated and will continue to. The abuse that we have learned about this morning is one I hope will never happen again, but without constant oversight on the part of the Executive Office, on the part of the Congress, it could happen again. It is important therefore that we continue in this oversight activity.",

Mr. Chairman ? Senator INOUYE. Yes, sir? Senator KENNEDY. I, too, want to thank Admiral Turner for his responsiveness.

I want you to know, personally, I, too, would like to see this put behind us. I don't think we are quite there yet in terms of this particular area that we are interested in. I think the Intelligence Committee has special responsibilities in this area of the testing, so we look forward to working with you in expediting the time that we can put it behind, but it does seem to me that we have to dig in and finish the chapter. So, I want to personally express my appreciation to you, Admiral Turner, and thank you for your cooperation and your help, and I look forward to working with you. Admiral TURNER. Thank you. Senator HUDDLESTON. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure you emphasized this enough, but I think the record ought to show that Admiral Turner informed the Select Committee on his own initiative when the new documentation was found. The documentation has been made available to us voluntarily, in a spirit of cooperation. I think this shows a vast difference from the mode of operation that existed prior to the formation at least of the Church committee, and a difference that is very helpful. Senator INOUYE. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Admiral. We would now like to call upon Mr. Philip Goldman and Mr. John Gittinger. Mr. Goldman and Mr. Gittinger, will you please rise and take the oath. Do you solemly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God? Mr. GOLDMAN. I do. Mr. GITTINGER. I do. Senator INouYE.

Before we start in, we had a third witness, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Pasternac, who planned to testify, traveled to Washington-he lives in Washington, and was contacted recently-with the intention of testifying this morning. And something-he called us late this morning and indicated that he wanted to get a counsel before he would wish to testify. Senator INOUYE. Mr. Goldman.

Were you a member of the Agency at the time MKULTRA was in operation? Mr. GITINGER. Yes. Senator INouYE. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Senator KENNEDY. I want to welcome both of you to the committee. If we could start with Mr. Goldman. Were you the project engineer for the safe houses in either San Francisco or New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. I-know of -no safei-ouse irrSan Francisco. Senator KENNEDY. How about in New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. I knew of one facility that was established there, but I didn't know anything of its operation. Senator KENNEDY. Were you a monitor on any testing of drugs on unwitting persons in San Francisco? Mr. GOLDMAN. No. Senator KENNEDY. Well, we have a classified document here that was provided by the Agency that lists your name as a monitor of the pro- gram and I would appreciate it if you would look- Mr. GOLDMAN. I think the misunderstanding arises because I was project officer. Senator KENNEDY. Well, would you take a look at that? [Mr. Goldman inspected the document.] Mr. GOLDMAN. This document as it states is correct. However, my- Senator KENNEDY. That document is correct? Mr. GOLDMAN. As far as I see on the first page, the project. But my- Senator KENNEDY. Well, could I get it back, please. That would indicate that you were a monitor of the program. Mr. GOLDMAN. I was in charge of disbursing the moneys to Morgan Hall. Senator KENNEDY. To whom was that? Mr. GOLDMAN. To the individual whose name was listed at the top of that document. Senator KENNEDY. And you knew that he was running the project in San Francisco? Mr. GOLDMAN. I knew he was the person who was in charge out there. Senator KENNEDY. All right. Mr. GOLDMAN. But I had no knowledge nor did I seek knowledge of actually what he was doing, because there would be other things involved. I did receive Senator KENNEDY. What were you doing? Mr. GOLDMAN. I was collecting-I had to be sure that all the re- ceipts that ever were turned in balanced with the moneys that were paid out to see that everything was run all right. There was no illegal use of funds as far as we could determine by the receipts and cash.",

The only thing I can tell you about this and I am drawing completely on my memory is that this individual who was in charge out there conducted these things and reported them back to the Afrency. I didn't participate in any of them. All I know was that he furnished me with receipts for things that were done and told of the work that they had done. Senator KENNEnY. Well, that document covers more than receipts. Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes, it tells of what-they had conducted work out there. Senator KENNEDY. It describes, does it not? Read the paragraph 2. Mr. GOT DMAN. \"A numher of covert\" Senator KENNEDY. Well, you can't read it, it's a classified document, and I don't know why, quite frankly, but it relates to the substance of those programs and your name is signed to the memorandums on it. I am not interested in you trying to review for us now what is in the document, but I think it would be unfortunate if we were left with the opinion that all you were was a courier of resources when we see a document with your name on it, signed, that talks about the substance of the program. And what we're interested in is the substance of the program. We have the recent documents that were provided by the Agency, which do indicate that you were at least involved in the substance, and I'm just trying to find out whether you're willing to tell us about that. Mr. GOLDMAN. I am perfectly willing to tell you everything that I can remember. Senator KENNEDY. But you can't remember anything. Mr. GOLDMAN. I can't remember the substantive parts of these things, I really can't. Senator KENNEDY. Of the program that was taking place. Do you have any greater familiarity with what was happening in New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. No, no. Senator KENNEDY. And you have the same function with regards to New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. The same function with regard to New York. Senator KENNEDY.

Senator KENNEDY. You travel out there to find out about the work that's being done, and what does he tell you, that the work is being done well and- Mr. GOLDMAN. He told me that the work that they were doing was going along, progressing satisfactorily, but to be very frank with you- Senator KENNEDY. But he didn't tell you what the work was? Mr. GOLDMAN. To be very frank with you, Senator, I cannot re- member the things that happened back in those days. I've been away from the company-from the Agency for over 10 years, and that is even farther back than that, and that was just about the time when I first engaged in this, so it was my first- Senator KENNEDY. Did they disburse a series of $100 checks, to your recollection? Mr. GOLDMAN. I don't recollect it, but if you have it there, then they did. Senator KENNEDY. Did you know Dr. Gottlieb? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. How did you know Dr. Gottlieb? Mr. GOLDMAN. He had been head of the division when I was re- cruited. Senator KENNEDY. Did you talk to him about these programs? Did you have anything to do with him during this period of time? Mr. GOLDMAN. I didn't have anything to do with him until I would say probably in the sixties. Senator KENNEDY. And can you tell us what you had to do with him then? Mr. GOLDMAN. Just what you see there on the papers. Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is the request for the money and he approves it. Mr. GOLDMAN. That is the request for money and he approves it, and I am quite sure that I probably discussed with him whether the work was going along all right, whether his reports were being turned in, and whether he was satisfied with the way things were going and did he have any complaints about the way other people were requesting him, but I did not engage myself in anything he was doing. Senator KENNEDY. Well, did you get the impression that Gottlieb knew what was going on? Mr. GOLDMAN. I didn't ask. Senator KENNEDY. But you told him that your impression that what was going on even though you didn't know what was going on, was go- ing on well, I guess? [Laughter.] Mr. GOLDMAN. I told Gottlieb what you saw in there was that the things appeared to be going along all right. I was repeating and par- roting back the words that were giveh to me while I was there. Senator KENNEDY. What was the money being spent for, do you know? Mr. GOLDMAN. No; I can't recall that, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Would you remember if we told you it was red curtains and can-can pictures- Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Floral pictures and the rest. Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Recorders. Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Recorders and two-way mirrors. Mr. GOLDMAN. Wait, hold on. You're slipping a word in there now. Senator KENNEDY. But you would have authorized those funds, would you not, since you were the- Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you say two-way mirrors? Senator KENNEDY. Yes. Mr. GOLDMAN. Where? Senator KENNEDY. In the safe houses. Mr. GOLDMAN. Where? Senator KENNEDY. San Francisco. Mr. GOLDMAN. No. Senator KENNEDY. How about New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. You remember now that you approved expendi- tures for New York? Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. What were those expenditures for? Mr. GOLDMAN. That was a transfer of money over for the use in an apartment in New York by the Bureau of Narcotics. It was for their use. Senator KENNEDY. Do you have any knowledge of what was going on in the apartment? Mr. GOLDMAN. No, sir, other than I know that it had been used, ac- cording to the information that I have been given, it was used by the Bureau of Narcotics to make meetings with individuals who they were interested in with regard to pushing dope-not pushing dope, but sell- ing narcotics and that sort of thing. Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am sure you had many responsibilities and it's a long time ago, but the Agency does indicate that you were project monitor for that particular program. Mr. GOLDMAN. That's correct. Senator KENNEDY. Your own testimony indicates you went out to re- view the expenditures of funds to find out whether they were being wisely used, that you came back and talked to the project director, Mr. Gottlieb, to give him a progress report about what was going on out there. Mr. GOLDMAN. Yes, sir, I did. Senator KENNEDY. All those things are true, and yet you draw a complete blank in terms of what was the project itself. That's where the record is now. Mr. GOLDMAN. I did not go out there to review the projects nor did I come back and talk with Mr. Gottlieb and review what I had observed in terms of any projects that they-that is, other parts of the Agency might have in operation there. I simply reported back those things which were told to me by the individual out there who-and I carried them back and they are contained in the report that you have in front of you, word for word, just as it was given to me. Senator KENNEDY. The report that you examined here is a substan- tive report on the particular program and project. And I don't think anyone who wasn't familiar with the project-this is a personal evalu- ation-could write a report on the substance of it without knowing about it. Now, that's mine. Maybe you can't remember and recollect, and that's- Mr. GOLDMAN. No; everything I put down in there is things that I was told while I was out there, and if there was any -ancillary informa- tion involved in there I can tell you I just don't remember that. I really don't. At the time-that was some years ago. At the time-a lot of time has passed since then and I have made quite sure that if I could recollect it at all, I would do it. If you have some papers and you want me to cer- tify whether yes, this is so or that is so, I can do that, but I can't recall it mentally. Senator KENNEDY. You just certified the principal. There are others up here. I would like to go to Dr. Gittinger. Mr. GINGER. It's Mr. Gittinger. Senator KENNEDY. How long did you serve with the Agency? Mr. GIrrNGER. Twenty-six years. Senator KENNEDY. Excuse me? Mr. GITINGER. Twenty-six years., Senator KENNEDY. Twenty-six years. And at some point you moved into the operational support side, is that correct? Mr. GrlINGER. Yes. Senator KENNEDY. And did you know Sidney Gottlieb? Mr. GirrINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. And did he inform you about the research proj- ects involving LSD? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. It is my understanding that you were also aware of some of the drug testing projects conducted on unwitting subjects on the west coast using the Bureau of Narcotics people in the operation. Is that true? Mr. GITTINGER. I was. Senator INOUYE. Excuse me. Would you speak into the microphone? I cannot hear you. Mr. GITTINGER. Sorry. Senator KENNEDY. Do you know which drugs were involved in those tests? Mr. GIrrINGER. LSD. And I can't remember for sure much of the others. What is the substance of marihuana, cannabis, is that right, that can be delivered by other than smoking? Senator KENNEDY. Cannabis? Mr. GITTINGER. There had been some discussion of that; yes. Senator KENNEDY. And was heroin also used? Mr. GITTINGER. Heroin used by CIA? Senator KENNEDY. No. In the west coast operation. Mr. GITINGER. Absolutely not. Senator KENNEDY. Now, to your knowledge, how were the drugs ad- ministered to the unwitting subjects? Mr. GIrTINGER. I have no direct knowledge. Senator KENNEDY. Why did you go to the safe houses? Mr. GITTINGER. It's a very complicated story. Just in justification of myself, this came up just day before yesterday. I have not really had enough time to get it all straightened in my mind, so I ramble. Senator KENNEDY. Well, you take your time and tell us in your own words. We've got some time here. Mr. GITTINGER. My responsibilities which would involve any of the period of time that you were talking about really was not -directly related to drugs at all. I was a psychologist charged with the responsi- bility of trying to develop as much information as I could on various cultures, overseas cultures, anthropological type data, if you follow what I mean. I was also engaged in trying to work out ways and means of assessing people and understanding people. I originally became involved in this through working on Chinese culture, and over a series of time I was introduced to the problem of brainwashing, which is the thing that really was the most compelling thing in relationship to this, and became charged with the responsi- bility of trying to find out a little bit about interrogation techniques. And among other things, we decided or I decided that one of the best sources of interrogation techniques would be trying to locate and inter- view and become involved with experienced police interrogators in the country and experienced people who had real practical knowledge of interrogation. The reason for this is that we had become pretty well convinced after the experience of the brainwashing problems coming out of China, that it was the techniques of the interrogators that were causing the individuals to make confessions and so forth in relationship to this, rather than any kind of drugging and so forth. So we were very much interested in interrogation techniques, and this led to me being introduced to the agent in the west coast, and I began to talk to him in connection with these interrogation techniques. Senator KENNEDY. OK. Now, that is the agent that ran the tests on the west coast on the unwitting people. That's where you come in, correct? Mr. GirrlNGER. If I understand-would you say that again?

Senator KENNEDY. And you met at the safe house. Mr. GIrrINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Whom did you meet with in the safe house? Mr. GITTINGER. This is the part that is hard for me to say, and I am sorry that I have to. In connection with some work that we were doing, we needed to have some information on sexual habits. Morgan Hall provided informants for me to talk to in connection with the sex habits that I was interested in trying to find information. During one period of time the safe house, as far as I was concerned, was used for just these particular type of interviews. And I didn't see the red curtains. Senator KENNEDY. Those were prostitutes, were they? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. How many different times were you there that you had similar- Mr. GITTINGER. I couldn't possibly say with any certainty on that. Four or five times. Senator KENNEDY. Four or five times. Mr. GirrlNGER. Over-you remember now, the period that I'm talk- ing about when I would have any involvement in this is from about 1956 to 1961. So it's about a 4- or 5-year period which is the only time that I know anything about what you are talking about here today. Senator KENNEDY. Did Morgan Hall make the arrangements for the prostitutes to meet with you? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Did the interviews that you had have anything to do with drugs? Mr. GIrrINGER. Well, as I tried to explain earlier when this was being discussed a little bit beforehand, again I think it is pretty hard for most people now to recognize how little there was known about drugs at the period of time that we are talking about, because the drug age or the drug culture comes later on. Consequently, those of us who had any responsibility in this area were interested in trying to get as much information as we could on the subculture, the subculture drug groups, and obviously the Bureau of Narcotics represented a means of doing this. Consequently, other types of things that were involved in discussions at that time would have to do with the under ground use of drugs.. When 1 am talking about this I am talking about the folkways in terms of unwitting use of drugs. Did these people that I was talking to have any information about this and on rare instances they were able to tell me about their use, and in most cases this would largely turn out to be a Mickey Finn or something of that sort rather than anything esoteric. I also was very much interested because we had relatively little information, believe it or not, at that time, in terms of the various reactions that people were having to drugs. Therefore, these people were very informative in terms of they knew a great deal of informa- tion about reactions.",

At least you gathered-or am I correct in assum- ing that you gathered the impression that the prostitutes that you had talked to were able to slip the drugs to people as I understand it. Did you form any impression on that? Mr. GITTINGER. I certainly did not form the impression that they did this as a rule or- Senator KENNEDY. But they had the knowledge. Mr. GITTINGER. They had the knowledge or some of them had had knowledge of this being done. But again, as it turned out, it was largely in this area of knockout drops. Senator KENNEDY. Looking back now did you form any impression about how the Agency was actually testing the broad spectrum of social classes in these safe houses? With the large disbursal of cash in small quantities, $100 bills and the kinds of elaborate decorations and two-way mirrors in the bedrooms and all the rest, is there any question in your own mind what was going on in the safe houses, or the tech- niques that were being used to administer these drugs? Mr. GITTINGER. I find it very difficult to answer that question, sir. I had absolutely no direct knowledge there was a large number of this. I had no knowledge that anyone other than-than Morgan Hall was in any way involved in the unwitting administration of drugs. Senator KENNEDY. But Gottlieb would know, would he not? Mr. GITTINGER. I believe so, yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Could we go into the Human Ecology Founda- tion and talk about that and how it was used as an instrument in terms of the support of research? Mr. GITTINGER. Yes, sir. Senator KENNEDY. Could you describe it to us? Could you describe the Human Ecology Foundation, how it functioned and how it worked? Mr. GITTINGER. May I tell something about how it evolved, which I think is important? Senator KENNEDY. Sure. Mr. GITTINGER.

Well, we're not interested in names or institu- tions, so we prefer that you do not. That has to be worked out in arrangements between Admiral Turner and the individuals and the institutions. But we're interested in what the Foundation really was and how it functioned and what its purpose was. Mr. GirriNGER. Tell, it was established to undertake research in the general area of the behavioral -sciences. It definitely had almost no focus or interest in, say, drug-related type of activities except in a very minor way, because it was largely set up to attempt to gain a certain amount of information and to fund projects which were psychological, sociological, anthropological in character.",

    "text": "Is it classified? We may have it for the record, but may I ask you to briefly describe your training and background for us now? I hope it is no secret. Dr. GOLDMAN. Well, I was told if I was asked this to say that. I was told that by your staff people, but I have no objection to telling you. I am a resident from Pennsylvania, southwest Pennsylvania, Lan- caster County. I went to Penn State, and I am in nutrition. Senator SOHWEIKER. In what? Dr. GOLDMAN. Nutrition. Senator SCHWEIKER. Were you in charge of a section or segment of the CIA in your past capacity? Dr. GOLDMAN. During the time I was with that organization, I was in charge of one small section of it, one small segment of it; yes. 96-408 0 - 77 - 5 Senator SCHWEIKER. What was the function or purpose of that sec- tion that you headed? Dr. GOLDMAN. To provide support for the other parts of the division. Senator SCHWEIKER. Where in the chain of command would that put you in relation to Dr. Gottlieb? Dr. GOLDMAN. Pretty far down the line. Senator SCHWEIKER. Mr. Gittinger, I would just like to ask you a few questions. We appreciate your frankness and candor with the com- mittee, and we realize this is a very difficult area to go into. I am not quite clear on two matters that were raised earlier. First, were the safe houses we were talking about here used on occasion by the prostitutes you referred to? Mr. GITTINGER. I really have not the slightest idea. Senator SCHWEIKER. Were the prostitutes used in any way to slip the customers drugs for observation purposes? Mr. GrTiNGER. Not to my direct knowledge. Senator SCHWEIKER. Would you have been in a position to know the answer to either of these questions? Mr. GITTINGER. May I say, probably not, and may I make an aside to explain a little bit of this, please, sir?\nSenator SCHWEIKER. Mr. Gittinger, a moment ago you mentioned brainwashing techniques, as one area that you had, I guess, done some work in. How would you characterize the state of the art of brain- washing today? Who has the most expertise in this field, and who is or is not doing it in terms of other governments? During the Korean war there was a lot of serious discussion about brainwashing techniques being used by the North Koreans, and I am interested in finding out what the state of the art is today, as you see it. Mr. GITTINGER. Well, of course, there has been a great deal of work on this, and there is still a great deal of controversy. I can tell you that as far as I knew, by 1961, 1962, it was at least proven to my satis- faction that brainwashing, so called, is some kind of an esoteric device where drugs or mind-altering kinds of conditions and so forth were used, did not exist even though \"The Manchurian Candidate\" as a movie really set us back a long time, because it made something im- possible look plausible. Do you follow what I mean ? But by 1962 and 1963, the general idea that we were able to come up with is that brain- washing was largely a process of isolating a human being, keeping him out of contact, putting him under long stress in relationship to interviewing and interrogation, and that they could produce any change that way without having to resort to any kind of esoteric means.",

Detailed descriptions of the programs conducted by intelligence agencies in- volving chemical and biological agents will be included in a separately published appendix to the Senate Select Committee's report. This sec- tion of the report will discuss the rationale for the programs, their monitoring and control, and what the Committee's investigation has revealed about the relationships among the intelligence agencies and about their relations with other government agencies and private in- stitutions and individuals.2 Fears that countries hostile to the United States would use chemi- cal and biological agents against Americans or America's allies led to the development of a defensive program designed to discover tech- niques for American intelligence agencies to detect and counteract chemical and biological agents. The defensive orientation soon became secondary as the possible use of these agents to obtain information from, or gain control over, enemy agents became apparent. Research and development programs to find materials which could be used to alter human behavior were initiated in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These experimental programs originally included testing of drugs involving witting human subjects, and culminated in tests using unwitting, nonvolunteer human subjects. These tests were de- signed to determine the potential effects of chemical or biological agents when used operationally against individuals unaware that they had received a drug. The testing programs were considered highly sensitive by the in- telligence agencies administering them. Few people, even within the agencies, knew of the programs and there is no evidence that either the executive branch or Congress were ever informed of them. The highly compartmented nature of these programs may be explained in part by an observation made by the CIA Inspector General that, \"the knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activi- 1 Senate Resolution 21 directs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities to investigate a number of issues: \"(a) Whether agencies within the intelligence community conducted illegal domestic activities (Section 2(1) and (2)); \"(b) The extent to which agencies within the intelligence community cooper- ate (Section 2(4) and (8)); \"(c) The adequacy of executive branch and congressional oversight of intel- ligence activities (Section 2(7) and (11)); \"(d) The adequacy of existing laws to safeguard the rights of American citi- zens (Section 2(13)).\" 'The details of these programs may never be known. The programs were highly compartmented. Few records were kept. What little documentation existed for the CIA's principal program was destroyed early in 1973. (385) (65) 386 The research and development program, and particularly the co- vert testing programs, resulted in massive abridgments of the rights of American citizens, sometimes with tra'gic consequences. The deaths of two Americans 3a can be attributed to these programs; other partici- pants in the testing programs may still suffer from the residual ef- fects. While some controlled testing of these substances might be de- fended, the nature of the tests, their scale, and the fact that they were continued for years after the danger of surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting individuals was known, demonstrate a funda- mental disregard for the value of human life. The Select Committee's investigation of the testing and use of chem- ical and biological agents also raise serious questions about the ade- quacy of command and control procedures within the Central Intelli- gence Agency and military intelligence, and about the relationships among the intelligence agencies, other governmental agencies, and private institutions and individuals. The CIA's normal administrative controls were waived for programs involving chemical and biological agents to protect. their security. According to the head of the Audit Branch O-f the CIA. these waivers produced \"gross administrative failures.\" They prevgnted the CIA's internal review mechanisms (the Office of General Counsel, the Inspector General, and the Audit Staff) from adequately supervising the programs. In general, the waivers had the paradoxical effect of providing less restrictive administrative con- trols and less effective internal review for controversial and highly sensitive projects than those governing normal Agency activities. The security of the programs was protected not only by waivers of normal administrative controls, but also by a high degree of com- partmentation within the CIA. This compartmentation excluded the CIA's Medical Staff from the principal research and testing program employing chemical and biological agents. It also may have led to agency policymakers receiving differing and inconsistent responses when they posed questions to the CIA component involved.",

    "text": "Project BLUEBIRD, approved in 1950, was one of the CIA's earliest major programs involving chemical and biological agents. Its objectives included conditioning personnel against unauthorized information extraction, investigating mind control through special interrogation techniques, memory enhancement, and establishing defensive measures against hostile control of Agency personnel. Following overseas interrogations, another goal was added: evaluating offensive uses of unconventional interrogation techniques, including hypnosis and drugs. In August 1951, the project was renamed ARTICHOKE.  ARTICHOKE encompassed in-house experiments on interrogation techniques conducted under medical and security controls to ensure the safety of volunteer subjects. It also involved overseas interrogations using sodium pentothal and hypnosis after physical and psychiatric evaluations. Initially led by the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), responsibility for ARTICHOKE shifted to the Inspection and Security Office (I&SO) in 1952, reflecting a change in emphasis from studying hostile powers' actions to using special interrogation techniques for both offensive and defensive purposes. Representatives from involved Agency units met regularly to discuss progress, including planning overseas interrogations and further U.S. experimentation. Information after 1953 is scarce, though the CIA claims the project ended in 1956. Evidence suggests the Office of Security and Office of Medical Services continued using \"special interrogation\" techniques for several years thereafter.",

Summarized in 1967, its purposes were: (a) providing a covert support base for clandestine operational requirements; (b) stockpiling incapacitating and lethal materials for the Technical Services Division (TSD); (c) maintaining readiness of special items for disseminating biological and chemical materials; and (d) providing surveillance, testing, upgrading, and evaluation of materials to ensure reliability and predictability. Under a 1952 agreement with the Army, the Special Operations Division (SOD) at Fort Detrick assisted the CIA in developing, testing, and maintaining biological agents and delivery systems. This partnership granted the CIA access to the Army's expertise and facilities for creating biological weapons. SOD developed darts coated with biological agents, pills containing various biological agents with long-term potency, and a special gun for firing darts coated with a chemical to incapacitate guard dogs.  While SOD couldn't develop a similar incapacitant for humans, they transferred biological agents in bulk and delivery devices to CIA personnel.  Beyond human targets, the CIA also tasked SOD with studying biological agents against crops and animals.  A 1967 CIA memorandum mentioned developing and field-testing three methods for covert crop attacks, though the planned operation was later scrubbed. MKNAOMI was terminated in 1970 following President Nixon's renunciation of biological weapons.",

    "text": "American soldiers volunteered for chemical warfare experiments. In Material Testing Program EA 1729, 95 volunteers received LSD in clinical experiments to evaluate potential intelligence uses. In Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT, 16 unwitting nonvolunteers were interrogated after receiving LSD in operational field tests.\n\nThe late 1940s and early 1950s saw concern over the Soviet Union, China, and the Communist bloc. The US feared their use of chemical and biological agents.  The belief that these powers used such agents in interrogations, brainwashing, and attacks created pressure for a \"defensive\" program to understand these substances and counter their effects. LSD was a particular concern. The CIA had reports of Soviet efforts to produce LSD and attempts to buy the world's supply. One CIA officer described the fear: \"[It] is hard to reproduce how frightening this was… we were literally terrified, because this was the one material… that really had fantastic possibilities if used wrongly.\"  But the defensive focus shifted. Chemical and biological agents were studied to \"perfect techniques… for the abstraction of information from individuals whether willing or not\" and to \"develop means for the control… of individuals whether willing or not.\" One official noted drugs could \"gain control of bodies whether willing or not\" for personnel removal from Europe in a Soviet attack. The CIA began developing, producing, and stockpiling materials for harassment, disablement, or killing. Reports of Soviet, Chinese, and Communist bloc research and development fueled the shift from defensive to offensive. The CIA's Medical Staff Chief wrote in 1952: \"There is ample evidence… that the Communists were utilizing drugs, physical duress, electric shock… against their enemies… We are forced… to assume a more aggressive role… but must be cautious… because of the havoc… wrought by such techniques in unscrupulous hands.\" To meet the perceived threat, programs for testing and using chemical and biological agents—including surreptitious LSD administration to unwitting subjects \"at all social levels\"—were implemented, violating individual rights in the US.  Although the CIA recognized LSD's effects on unwitting individuals, the project continued. Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Helms, wrote: \"While I share your uneasiness… I believe it is necessary that the Agency… maintain an offensive capability.\" There were no attempts to get approval for the most controversial aspects from the executive branch or Congress.  These programs were secret; even DCI McCone wasn't fully briefed on the surreptitious LSD program until 1963. Concealment was imperative. The CIA's Inspector General wrote in 1957: \"Precautions must be taken… to conceal these activities from the American public… The knowledge that the Agency is engaging in unethical and illicit activities would have serious repercussions…\"",

    "section": "The Death of Dr. Frank Olson",
    "text": "The most tragic result of the CIA's LSD testing was Dr. Frank Olson's death on November 27, 1953, after participating in an LSD experiment. He unwittingly received about 70 micrograms of LSD in Cointreau on November 19, 1953, placed there by CIA officer Dr. Robert Lashbrook. Olson showed signs of paranoia and schizophrenia and sought psychiatric help from Dr. Harold Abramson in New York City, whose LSD research the CIA indirectly funded. Olson fell to his death from a hotel window.\n\nOlson, an aerobiology expert at the Special Operations Division (SOD) at Camp Detrick, assessed American installations' vulnerability to biological attack, developed offensive biological weapons techniques, and conducted biological research for the CIA. He was respected professionally.  Col. Vincent Ruwet, Olson's superior, said: \"As a professional man… his ability… was outstanding\" and \"prior to the experiment… I noticed nothing… of unsound mind.\" Dr. Lashbrook stated that before the LSD, Olson was \"perfectly normal.\" This contradicts later CIA memoranda on Olson's emotional stability. \n\nOn November 18, 1953, ten CIA and Camp Detrick scientists met. Three were from the CIA's Technical Services Staff. The Detrick representatives were from SOD. One CIA official said SOD participants \"agreed that an unwitting experiment would be desirable,\" contradicting Ruwet's recollection. In May 1953, Richard Helms told the TSS Chief that LSD was \"dynamite\" and he should be advised of its intended use. DDP Frank Wisner also required personal approval for LSD use. Dr. Gottlieb proceeded with the experiment, with his supervisor's approval, but not from the TSS Chief or DDP.  Gottlieb said a \"very small dose\" of LSD was placed in the Cointreau after dinner on November 19 by Lashbrook. All but two SOD participants (one didn't drink, the other had a heart condition) received LSD. Gottlieb informed them about 20 minutes later. He said before the experiment, Olson's behavior was normal, but the drug made the group \"boisterous and laughing,\" unable to continue the meeting.  They retired around 1:00 a.m., with Olson complaining of \"wakefulness.\" Gottlieb observed nothing unusual Friday morning besides fatigue. Ruwet recalled Olson seemed \"agitated\" at breakfast but not abnormally so. The following Monday, Olson waited for Ruwet at work. For two days, friends and family tried to help him out of his apparent depression.",

    "text": "A second reason to doubt Professor Rothland came when I raised the question as to any accidents which had arisen from the use of LSD-25. He said in a very positive way, 'none.' As it turned out this answer could be called overly positive, for later on in the evening I was discussing the matter with Dr. W. A. Stohl, Jr., a psychiatrist in Bleulera's Clinic in Zurich where I had gone at Rothland's insistence. Stohl, when asked the same question, replied, 'yes,' and added spontaneously, 'there is a case Professor Rothland knows about. In Geneva a woman physician who had been subject to depression to some extent took LSD-25 in an experiment and became severely and suddenly depressed and committed suicide three weeks later. While the connection is not definite, common knowledge of this could hardly have allowed the positive statement Rothland permitted himself. This case is a warning to us to avoid engaging subjects who are depressed, or who have been subject to depression.' Dr. Gottlieb testified that he had no recollection of either the report or that particular section of it.  Ruwet then called Lashbrook and informed him that \"Dr. Olson was in serious trouble and needed immediate professional attention.\" Lashbrook agreed to make appropriate arrangements and told Ruwet to bring Olson to Washington, D.C. Ruwet and Olson proceeded to Washington to meet with Lashbrook, and the three left for New York at about 2:30 p.m. to meet with Dr. Harold Abramson. At that time Dr. Abramson was an allergist and immunologist practicing medicine in New York City. He held no degree in psychiatry, but was associated with research projects supported indirectly by the CIA. Gottlieb and Dr. Lashbrook both followed his work closely in the early 1950s. Since Olson needed medical help, they turned to Dr. Abramson as the doctor closest to Washington who was experienced with LSD and cleared by the CIA. Ruwet, Lashbrook, and Olson remained in New York for two days of consultations with Abramson. On Thursday, November 26, 1953, the three flew back to Washington so that Olson could spend Thanksgiving with his family. En route from the airport Olson told Ruwet that he was afraid to face his family. After a lengthy discussion, it was decided that Olson and Lashbrook would return to New York, and that Ruwet would go to Frederick to explain these events to Mrs. Olson. Lashbrook and Olson flew back to New York the same day, again for consultations with Abramson. They spent Thursday night in a Long Island hotel and the next morning returned to the city with Abramson. In further discussions with Abramson, it was agreed that Olson should be placed under regular psychiatric care at an institution closer to his home. Because they could not obtain air transportation for a return trip on Friday night, Lashbrook and Olson made reservations for Saturday morning and checked into the Statler Hotel. Between the time they checked in and 10:00 p.m.; they watched television, visited the cocktail lounge, where each had two martinis, and dinner. According to Lashbrook, Olson \"was cheerful and appeared to enjoy the entertainment.\" He \"appeared no longer particulary depressed, and almost the Dr. Olson I knew prior to the experiment.\" After dinner Lashbrook and Olson watched television for about an hour, and at 11:00, Olson suggested that they go to bed, saying that \"he felt more relaxed and contented than he had since [they] came to New York.\" Olson then left a call with the hotel operator to wake them in the morning. At approximately 2:30 a.m. Saturday, November 28, Lashbrook was awakened by a loud \"crash of glass.\" In his report on the incident, he stated only that Olson \"had crashed through the closed window blind and the closed window and he fell to his death from the window of our room on the 10th floor.",

    "text": "Immediately after finding that Olson had leapt to his death, Lashbrook telephoned Gottlieb at his home and informed him of the incident. Gottlieb called Ruwet and informed him of Olson's death. Lashbrook then called the hotel desk and reported the incident to the operator there. Lashbrook called Abramson and informed him of the occurrence. Abramson told Lashbrook he \"wanted to be kept out of the thing completely,\" but later changed his mind and agreed to assist Lashbrook. Shortly thereafter, uniformed police officers and some hotel employees came to Lashbrook's room. Lashbrook told the police he didn't know why Olson had committed suicide, but he did know that Olson \"suffered from ulcers.\" Following Dr. Olson's death, the CIA made a substantial effort to ensure that his family received death benefits, but did not notify the Olsons of the circumstances surrounding his demise. The Agency also made considerable efforts to prevent the death being connected with the CIA, and supplied complete cover for Lashbrook so that his association with the CIA would remain a secret. After Dr. Olson's death the CIA conducted an internal investigation of the incident.  The death of Dr. Olson could be viewed, as some argued at the time, as a tragic accident, one of the risks inherent in the testing of new substances. It might be argued that LSD was thought to be benign. After the death of Dr. Olson the dangers of the surreptitious administration of LSD were clear, yet the CIA continued or initiated a project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to non-volunteer human subjects. This program exposed numerous individuals in the United States to the risk of death or serious injury without their informed consent, without medical supervision, and without necessary follow-up to determine any long-term effects. Prior to the Olson experiment, the Director of Central Intelligence had approved MKULTRA, a research program designed to develop a \"capability in the covert use of biological and chemical agent materials.\" In the project, the individual conducting the test might make initial contact with a prospective subject selected at random in a bar. He would then invite the person to a \"safehouse\" where the test drug was administered to the subject through drink or in food. CIA personnel might debrief the individual conducting the test, or observe the test by using a one-way mirror and tape recorder in an adjoining room. Prior consent was obviously not obtained from any of the subjects. There was also, obviously, no medical prescreening. In addition, the tests were conducted by individuals who were not qualified scientific observers. There were no medical personnel on hand either to administer the drugs or to observe their effects, and no follow-up was conducted on the test subjects. Paradoxically, greater care seems to have been taken for the safety of foreign nationals against whom LSD was used abroad. In several cases medical examinations were performed prior to the use of LSD.",

According to the IG's survey in 1963, physicians associated with MKULTRA could be made available in an emergency. \" The Technical Services Division which was responsible for the operational use of LSD abroad took the position that \"no physical examination of the subject is required prior to administration of [LSD] by TSS trained personnel. Moreover, the administration abroad was marked by constant observation made possible because the material was being used against prisoners of foreign intelligence or security organizations. Finally, during certain of the LSD interrogations abroad, local physicians were on call, though these physicians had had no experience with LSD and would not be told that hallucinogens had been administered. The CIA's project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting human subjects in the United States was finally halted in 1963, as a result of its discovery during the course of an Inspector General survey of the Technical Services Division. When the Inspector General learned of the project, he spoke to the Deputy Director for Plans, who agreed that the Director should be briefed. The DDP made it clear that the DCI and his Deputy were generally familiar with MKULTRA. He indicated, however, that he was not sure it was necessary to brief the DDCI at that point. On May 24, 1963, the DDP advised the Inspector General that he had briefed the Director on the MKULTRA program and in particular had covered the question of the surreptitious administration of LSD to unwitting human subjects. According to the Inspector General, the DDP said that \"the Director indicated no disagreement and therefore the 'testing' will continue.\" One copy of an \"Eyes Only\" draft report on MKULTRA was prepared by the Inspector General who recommended the termination of the surreptitious administration project. The project was suspended following the Inspector General's report. On December 17, 1963, Deputy Director for Plans Helms wrote a memo to the DDCI, who with the Inspector General and the Executive Director-Comptroller had opposed the covert testing. He noted two aspects of the problem: (1) \"for over a decade the Clandestine Services has had the mission of maintaining a capability for influencing human behavior;\" and (2) \"testing arrangements in furtherance of this mission should be as operationally realistic and yet as controllable as possible.\" Helms argued that the individuals must be \"unwitting\" as this was \"the only realistic method of maintaining the capability, considering the intended operational use of materials to influence human behavior as the operational targets will certainly be unwitting. Should the subjects of the testing not be unwitting, the program would only be \"pro forma\" resulting in a \"false sense of accomplishment and readiness.\"",

    "section": "Internal Debate and Justification for Unwitting Testing",
    "text": "If one grants the validity of the mission of maintaining this unusual capability and the necessity for unwitting testing, there is only then the question of how best to do it. Obviously, the testing should be conducted in such a manner as to permit the opportunity to observe the results of the administration on the target. It also goes without saying that whatever testing arrangement we adopt must afford maximum safeguards for the protection of the Agency's role in this activity, as well as minimizing the possibility of physical or emotional damage to the individual tested. In another memo to the Director of Central Intelligence in June, 1964, Helms again raised the issue of unwitting testing. At that time General Carter, then acting DCI, approved several changes in the MKTULTRA program proposed by Mr. Helms as a result of negotiations between the Inspector General and the DDP. In a handwritten note, however, Director Carter added that \"unwitting testing will be subject to a separate decision.\" No specific decision was made then or soon after. The testing had been halted and, according to Walter Elder, Executive Assistant to DCI McCone, the DCI was not inclined to take the positive step of authorizing a resumption of the testing. At least through the summer, the DDP did not press the issue. On November 9, 1964, the DDP raised the issue again in a memo to the DCI, calling the Director's attention to what he described as \"several other indications during the past year of an apparent Soviet aggressiveness in the field of covertly administered chemicals which are, to say the least, inexplicable and disturbing.\" Helms noted that because of the suspension of covert testing, the Agency's \"positive operational capability to use drugs is diminishing, owing to a lack of realistic testing. With increasing knowledge of the state of the art, we are less capable of staying up with Soviet advances in this field. This in turn results in a waning capability on our part to restrain others in the intelligence community (such as the Department of Defense) from pursuing operations in this area.\" Helms attributed the cessation of the unwitting testing to the high risk of embarrassment to the Agency as well as the \"moral problem.\" He noted that no better covert situation had been devised than that which had been used, and that \"we have no answer to the moral issue.\" Helms asked for either resumption of the testing project or its definitive cancellation. He argued that the status quo of a research and development program without a realistic testing program was causing the Agency to live \"with the illusion of a capability which is becoming minimal and furthermore is expensive.\"",

Though it was known that the testing was dangerous, the lives of subjects were placed in jeopardy and their rights were ignored during the ten years of testing which followed Dr. Olson's death. Although it was clear that the laws of the United States were being violated, the testing continued. While the individuals involved in the Olson experiment were admonished by the Director, at the same time they were also told that they were not being reprimanded and that their \"bad judgment\" would not be made part of their personnel records. When the covert testing project was terminated in 1963, none of the individuals involved were subject to any disciplinary action.",

    "text": "The Select Committee found numerous failures in the monitoring and control of the testing and use of chemical and biological agents within the CIA. An analysis of the failures can be divided into four sections: (a) the waiver of normal regulations or requirements; (b) the problems in authorization procedures; (c) the failure of internal review mechanisms such as the Office of General Counsel, the Inspector General, and the Audit Staff; and (d) the effect of compartmentation and competition within the CIA. a. The Waiver of Administrative Control.-The internal controls within any agency rest on: (1) clear and coherent regulations; (2) clear lines of authority; and (3) clear rewards for those who conduct themselves in accord with agency regulations and understandable and immediate sanctions against those who do not. In the case of the testing and use of chemical and biological agents, normal CIA administrative controls were waived. The destruction of the documents on the largest CIA program in this area constituted a prominent example of the waiver of normal Agency procedures by the Director. These documents were destroyed in early 1973 at the order of then DCI Richard Helms. According to Helms, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, then Director of TSD: ... came to me and said that he was retiring and that I was retiring and he thought it would be a good idea if these files were destroyed. And I also believe part of the reason for our thinking this was advisable was there had been relationships with outsiders in government agencies and other organizations and that these would be sensitive in this kind of a thing but that since the program was over and finished and done with, we thought we would just get rid of the files as well, so that anybody who assisted us in the past would not be subject to follow-up or questions, embarrassment, if you will.\" The destruction was based on a waiver of an internal CIA regulation, CSI 70-10, which regulated the \"retirement of inactive records.\" As Thomas Karamessines, then Deputy Director of Plans, wrote in regulation CSI-70-10: \"Retirement is not a matter of convenience or of storage but of conscious judgment in the application of the rules modified by knowledge of individual component needs. The heart of this judgment is to ensure that the complete story can be reconstructed in later years and by people who may be unfamiliar with the events.\"",

The MKULTRA program was criticized for unclear administrative lines, overly permissive controls, and irresponsible supervision. Audits and inspections revealed that MKULTRA frequently served as a means to bypass normal administrative controls for research that wasn't particularly sensitive, allowed practices resulting in gross administrative failures, permitted unacceptable relationships with unreliable organizations, and led to cavalier treatment of legitimate contracting organizations. While acknowledging the potential need for special handling of sensitive projects, the Audit Branch Chief emphasized the importance of pre-defined terms of reference and ground rules for such projects to maintain control. Special procedures for security should not waive regulations for less sensitive operations, and only regulations posing security risks should be waived.  Otherwise, sensitive projects would operate under looser controls. MKNAOMI, the CIA's Fort Detrick project for chemical and biological agent research and development, exemplifies how security concerns overshadowed administrative controls.  No written records were kept of agent transfers (e.g., anthrax, shellfish toxin) due to the sensitivity of the area and a desire to keep any potential use recordless. Consequently, the Agency couldn't determine material inventory or track the issuance of delivery systems like dart guns or substances like cobra venom.",

This issue extends beyond document destruction; even during MKULTRA's peak, no records were kept of planning and approval for test programs like surreptitious LSD administration. While Allen Dulles authorized MKULTRA, specific project authorization remains unclear, including the unwitting LSD administration. There's no evidence that John McCone, Dulles's successor, was briefed on this project's details or its continuation. Even in 1963 discussions, briefing the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence on unwitting testing was questioned due to the desire to minimize knowledge of the project.  DDP Helms claimed authorization based on briefing the Director and receiving no disagreement, implying tacit approval. This approach, while undesirable even for non-controversial matters, is especially problematic for sensitive activities like surreptitious drug administration. Testimony suggests this practice was common for sensitive projects to minimize written records.  The unauthorized retention of shellfish toxin, violating a Presidential Directive, may stem from the Director's failure to issue written instructions. Senior officials didn't authorize the retention, and while the Director ordered relinquishing control of chemical/biological agents to the Army, Dr. Gordon, who retained the toxin, claimed lack of written instructions as a defense.  Written instructions didn't always prevent unauthorized actions.  TSD officers, despite oral and written instructions requiring notification of LSD use, proceeded with the Dr. Olson experiment without informing relevant superiors. Lack of clear punishment undermined internal instructions and regulations.",

The Inspector who discovered it in the 1963 survey did so inadvertently. Both the General Counsel and Inspector General, key internal control mechanisms, were excluded from regular project reviews. The Executive Director-Comptroller opposed the project upon discovery, potentially leading to its termination in 1957 had he known about it earlier. The Audit Staff also faced difficulties with MKULTRA, initially being excluded entirely.  Waiving normal contractual procedures increased irregularity risks and hindered detection. The Audit Branch head criticized MKULTRA procedures for allowing gross administrative failures, including lack of accountability controls in outside contractors and hindering the CIA's ability to verify their accountings.

    "text": "Substantial jurisdictional conflict existed within the CIA between the Technical Services Division (TSD), the Office of Medical Services (OMS), and the Office of Security. This compartmentation likely led to duplicated efforts and deprived policymakers of crucial information. Committees like BLUEBIRD and ARTICHOKE, meant to bridge this gap, became inactive.  Information wasn't shared, for instance, between TSD and other components about ARTICHOKE operations. TSD supported Clandestine Services with chemical and biological agents but didn't communicate with OMS or Security.  Even an Inspector General's discovery of this issue didn't lead to a full investigation due to an ongoing transfer.  QKHILLTOP, another coordinating group, was ineffective due to infrequent meetings and limited information exchange. Security concerns played a role in this lack of communication, but a TSD officer stated OMS simply wasn't interested. Conversely, OMS's desire for medical personnel involvement in chemical and biological agent use suggests TSD intentionally withheld information. The Office of Security wanted TSD's psychochemical operations under ARTICHOKE's purview, while OMS wanted their physicians involved in drug operations. The 1957 Inspector General's report highlighted the conflict over the Chief, Medical Staff's authority regarding TSD activities in the medical field, conducted without prior approval or notification. The IG recommended against Medical Staff supervision due to TSD's operational needs under the Deputy Director of Plans (DDP), citing the unorthodox, unethical, and sometimes illegal nature of TSD activities. The DDP was deemed better positioned to evaluate the justification. The IG advised full disclosure to the Director of Security due to the risks involved and potential political and diplomatic repercussions of the CIA's unethical activities. Despite the IG's report, compartmentation and conflict persisted, potentially hindering policymaking. A 1958 memo from the Deputy Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff noted that conflicting views within TSD, Security, and OMS on chemical/biological agent use could lead to incomplete information for decision-makers. Even a DDP committee formed in 1958 to streamline policy lacked access to testing and usage records due to compartmentation and conflict.",

Joint experiments by the U.S. Army Intelligence Board and Chemical Warfare Laboratories aimed to evaluate LSD's intelligence uses. Projects THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT involved unwitting subjects in Europe and the Far East, mirroring CIA research and risks, neglecting informed consent and follow-up examinations for secrecy. Command and control issues, similar to the CIA's, were evident in the Army's lack of clear authorization and supervision.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1958, the Army Chemical Corps researched LSD's potential as an incapacitating agent. Over 1,000 American volunteers were tested at Edgewood, Maryland (and Fort Bragg) to assess LSD's effects on soldierly function.  In 1958, new tests at Edgewood evaluated LSD's intelligence potential as part of EA 1729, involving 95 volunteers. Three structured experiments included surreptitious administration at a simulated social gathering, polygraph tests after LSD administration, and confinement in isolation chambers after LSD administration. These aimed to test the effectiveness of security training against drug-enhanced interrogation.  After the lab phase in 1960, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorized operational field testing. Project THIRD CHANCE (Europe, 1961) involved eleven interrogations of ten unwitting subjects, mostly alleged foreign agents, with one U.S. soldier implicated in document theft.  Project DERBY HAT (Far East, 1962) interrogated seven foreign nationals suspected of narcotics or intelligence activity. This aimed to gather data on LSD's utility and its effects on 'Orientals.'",

The interrogation of an American soldier as part of the THIRD CHANCE 1961 tests is an example of this disregard. The \"trip report\" for Project THIRD CHANCE, dated September 6, 1961, recounts the circumstances surrounding and the results of the tests… This strong reaction to the drug and the accompanying discomfort this individual suffered were exploited by the use of traditional interrogation techniques. While there is no evidence that physical violence or torture were employed in connection with this interrogation, physical and psychological techniques were used in the THIRD CHANCE experiments to exploit the subjects' altered mental state, and to maximize the stress situation… Another gross violation of an individual's fundamental rights occurred in September 1962 as part of the Army's DERBY HAT tests in the Far East… For the next three hours the subject remained in about the same condition. Continued attempts at interrogation yielded no relevant answers. Six hours after receiving the drug, the subject began giving relevant answers to questions. Eight and one-half hours after the initial dosage, the subject was polygraphed. The interrogation continued for seventeen and one-half hours after the drug was administered. There was some psychological and medical screening of the individuals tested within the United States, in Europe, and in Asia… In the October 15, 1959, USAINTC staff study, moral and legal ramifications of covert administration of LSD in field conditions were considered… On the basis of this evaluation, the study concluded that in view of \"the stakes involved and the interests of national security,\" the proposed plan for field testing should be approved. The surreptitious administration of drugs to unwitting subjects by the Army raises serious constitutional and legal issues. The consideration given these issues by the Army was wholly insufficient. The character of the Army's volunteer testing program and the possibility that drugs were simply substituted for other forms of violence or duress in field interrogations raises serious doubts as to whether national security imperatives were properly interpreted. The \"consent\" forms which each American volunteer signed prior to the administration of LSD are a case in point… In summary, a \"volunteer\" program in which subjects are not fully informed of potential hazards to their persons is \"volunteer\" in name only. This problem was compounded by the security statements signed by each volunteer before he participated in the testing… Under these provisions, a volunteer experiencing aftereffects of the test might have been unable to seek immediate medical assistance. This disregard for the well-being of subjects drug testing is inexcusable. Further, the absence of any comprehensive long-term medical assistance for the subjects of these experiments is not only unscientific; it is also unprofessional.",

Both SPT's concluded that more field testing was required before LSD could be utilized as an integral aid to counterintelligence interrogations. During the presentation of the DERBY HAT results, General Leonard (Deputy ACSI) directed that no further field testing be undertaken. After this meeting the ACSI sent a letter to the Commanding General of the Army Combat Developments Command (CDC) requesting that he review THIRD CHANCE and DERBY HAT and \"make a net evaluation concerning the adoption of EA 1729 for future use as an effective and profitable aid in counterintelligence interrogations.\" On the same day the ACSI requested that the CDC Commander revise regulation FM 30-17 to read in part: ... in no instance will drugs be used as an aid to interrogations in counterintelligence or security operations without prior permission of the Department of the Army. Requests to use drugs as an investigative aid will be forwarded through intelligence channels to the OACSI, DA, for approval.... Medical research has established that information obtained through the use of these drugs is unreliable and invalid.... It is considered that DA [Army] approval must be a prerequisite for use of such drugs because of the moral, legal, medical and political problems inherent in their use for intelligence purposes. The subsequent adoption of this regulation marked the effective termination of field testing of LSD by the Army. The official termination date of these testing programs is rather unclear, but a later ACSI memo indicates that it may have occurred in September of 1963. On the 19th of that month a meeting was held between Dr. Van Sims (Edgewood Arsenal), Major Clovis (Chemical Research Laboratory), and ACSI representatives (General Deholm and Colonel Schmidt). \"As a result of this conference a determination was made to suspend the program and any further activity pending a more profitable and suitable use.\"",

    "text": "Relationships among intelligence community agencies in this area varied considerably over time, ranging from full cooperation to intense and wasteful competition. The early period was marked by a high degree of cooperation among the agencies of the intelligence community. Although the military dominated research involving chemical and biological agents, the information developed was shared with the FBI and the CIA. But the spirit of cooperation did not continue. The failure by the military to share information apparently breached the spirit, if not the letter, of commands from above. As noted above, the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence was briefed on the proposed operational testing of LSD under Project THIRD CHANCE, and expressed concern that the project had not been coordinated with FBI and CIA. Despite this request, no coordination was achieved between the Army and either of these agencies. Had such cooperation been forthcoming, this project may have been evaluated in a different light.\n\nThe competition between the agencies in this area reached bizarre levels. A military officer told a CIA representative in confidence about the military's field testing of LSD in Europe under Project THIRD CHANCE, and the CIA promptly attempted to learn surreptitiously the nature and extent of the program. At roughly the same time Mr. Helms argued to the DDCI that the unwitting testing program should be continued, as it contributed to the CIA's capability in the area and thus allowed the CIA \"to restrain others in the intelligence community (such as the Department of Defense) from pursuing operations.\" The MKNAOMI program was also marked by a failure to share information. The Army Special Forces (the principal customer of the Special Operations Division at Fort Dietrick) and the CIA rather than attempting to coordinate their efforts promulgated different requirements which varied only slightly. This apparently resulted in some duplication of effort. In order to insure the security of CIA operations, the Agency would request materials from SO) for operational use without fully or accurately describing the operational requirements. This resulted in limitations on SOD's ability to assist the CIA.",

    "text": "The subjects of the CIA's operational testing of chemical and biological agents abroad were generally being held for interrogation by foreign intelligence or security organizations. Although information about the use of drugs was generally withheld from these organizations, cooperation with them necessarily jeopardized the security of CIA interest in these materials. Cooperation also placed the American Government in a position of complicity in actions which violated the rights of the subjects, and which may have violated the laws of the country in which the experiments took place. Cooperation between the intelligence agencies and organizations in foreign countries was not limited to relationships with the intelligence or internal security organizations. Some MKULTRA research was conducted abroad. While this is, in itself, not a questionable practice, it is important that such research abroad not be undertaken to evade American laws. That this was a possibility is suggested by an ARTICHOKE memorandum in which it is noted that working with the scientists of a foreign country \"might be very advantageous\" since that government \"permitted certain activities which were not permitted by the United States government (i.e., experiments on anthrax, etc.).\"\n\nCertain U.S. government agencies actively assisted the efforts of intelligence agencies in this area. One form of assistance was to provide \"cover\" for research contracts let by intelligence agencies, in order to disguise intelligence community interest in chemical and biological agents. Other forms of assistance raise more serious questions. Although the CIA's project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD was conducted by Bureau of Narcotics personnel, there was no open connection between the Bureau personnel and the Agency. The Bureau was serving as a \"cut-out\" in order to make it difficult to trace Agency participation. The cut-out arrangement, however, reduced the CIA's ability to control the program. The Agency could not control the process by which subjects were selected and cultivated, and could not regulate follow-up after the testing. Moreover, as the CIA's Inspector General noted: \"the handling of test subjects in the last analysis rests with the [Bureau of Narcotics] agent working alone. Suppression of knowledge of critical results from the top CIA management is an inherent risk in these operations.\" The arrangement also made it impossible for the Agency to be certain that the decision to end the surreptitious administration of LSD would be honored by the Bureau personnel. The arrangement with the Bureau of Narcotics was described as \"informal.\" The informality of the arrangement compounded the problem is aggravated by the fact that the 40 Committee has had apparent unwillingness on the part of the Bureau's leadership to ask for details, and the CIA's hesitation in volunteering information. These problems raise serious questions of command and control within the Bureau.",

    "text": "The Inspector General's 1963 Survey of MKULTRA noted that \"the research and development\" phase was conducted through standing arrangements with \"specialists in universities, pharmaceutical houses, hospitals, state and federal institutions, and private research organizations\" in a manner which concealed \"from the institution the interests of the CIA.\" Only a few \"key individuals\" in each institution were \"made witting of Agency sponsorship.\" The research and development phase was succeeded by a phase involving \"physicians, toxicologists, and other specialists in mental, narcotics, and general hospitals and prisons, who are provided the products and findings of the basic research projects and proceed with intensive testing on human subjects.\" According to the Inspector General, the MKULTRA testing programs were \"conducted under accepted scientific procedures . . . where health permits, test subjects are voluntary participants in the programs.\" This was clearly not true in the project involving the surreptitious administration of LSD, which was marked by a complete lack of screening, medical supervision, opportunity to observe, or medical or psychological follow-up. The intelligence agencies allowed individual researchers to design their project. Experiments sponsored by these researchers (which included one where narcotics addicts were sent to Lexington, Kentucky, who were rewarded with the drug of their addiction in return for participation in experiments with LSD) call into question the decision by the agencies not to fix guidelines for the experiments. The MKUTLTRA research and development program raises other questions, as well. It is not clear whether individuals in prisons, mental, narcotics and general hospitals can provide \"informed consent\" to participation in experiments such as these. There is doubt as to whether institutions should be unwitting of the ultimate sponsor of research being done in their facilities. The nature of the arrangements also made it impossible for the individuals who were not aware of the sponsor of the research to exercise any choice about their participation based on the sponsoring organization. Although greater precautions are now being taken in research conducted on behalf of the intelligence community agencies, the dilemma of classification remains. These agencies obviously wished to conceal their interest in certain forms of research in order to avoid stimulating interest in the same areas by hostile governments. In some cases today contractors or researchers wish to conceal their connection with these agencies. Yet the fact of classification prevents open discussion and debate upon which scholarly work depends.",

This memorandum is to advise you that additional MKULTRA documents have been discovered and to obtain your approval for follow-on actions required. Paragraph 7 contains a recommended course of action.\n2. As a result of John Harks FOXA request (F-76-374), all of the MKULTRA material in OTS possession was reviewed for possible release to him. Following that review, the OTS material in the Retired Records Center was searched. It was during that latter search that the subproject files were located among the retired records of the OTS Budget and Fiscal Section. These files were not discovered earlier as the earlier searches were limited to the examination of the active and retired records of those branches considered most likely to have generated or have had access to MKULTRA documents. Those branches included: Chemistry, Biological, Behavioral Activities, and Contracts Management. Because Dr. Gottlieb retrieved and destroyed all the MKULTRA documents he was able to locate, it is not surprising that the earlier search for MKULTRA documents, directed at areas where they were most likely to be found, was unsuccessful. The purpose of establishing the MKULTRA mechanism was to limit knowledge of the sensitive work being performed to those with an absolute need to know. If those precepts had been followed, the recently found B&F files should have contained only financial and administrative documents. (In retrospect, I realize that a serious error was made in not having B&F files and other seemingly innocuous files searched earlier). Most of the individual subproject folders contain project proposals and memoranda for the record, which in varying degrees, give a reasonably complete picture of the type of research funded through MKULTRA.",

Inouye, Chairman\nSelect Committee on Intelligence\nUnited States Senate\nWashington, D.C. 20510\n\nDear Mr. Chairman:\n\nDuring the course of 1975 when the Senate Committee, chaired by Senator Church, was investigating intelligence activities, the CIA was asked to produce documentation on a program of experimentation with the effect of drugs. Under this project conducted from 1953 to 1964 and known as \"MK-ULTRA,\" tests were conducted on American citizens in some.cates without their knowledge. The CIA, after searching for such documentation, reported that most of the documents on this matter have been destroyed.\n\nI find it my duty to report to you now that our continuing search for drug related, as well as other documents, has uncovered certain papers which bear on this matter. Let me hasten to add that I am persuaded that there was no previous attempt to conceal this material in the original 1975 exploration-r The material recently discovered was in the retired archives filed under financial accounts and only uncovered by using extraordinary and extensive search efforts. In this connection, incidentally, I have personally commended the employee whose diligence produced this find.\n\nBecause the new material now on hand is primarily of a financial nature, it does not present a complete picture of the field of drug experimentation activity but it does provide more detail than was previously available to us. For example, the following types of activities were undertaken:\n\na. Possible additional cases of drugs being tested on American citizens, without their knowledge.\nb. Research was undertaken on surreptitious methods of administering drugs.\nc. Some of. the persons chosen for experimentation were drug addicts or alcoholics.\nd. Research into the development of a knockout or \"K\" drug was performed in conjunction with being done to develop pain killers for advanced cancer patients, and tests on such patients were carried out.\n\ne. There is a possibility of an improper payment to a private institution.\n\nThe drug related activities described in this newly located material began almost 25 years ago. I assure you they were discontinued over 10 years ago and do not take place today. In keeping with the President's commitment to disclose any errors of the Intelligence Community which are uncovered, I-would like to volunteer to testify before your Committee on the full details of this unfortunate series of events. I-am in the process of reading the fairly voluminous material involved and do want to be certain that I have a complete picture when I talk with the Committee. I will be in touch with you next week to discuss when hearings might be scheduled at the earliest opportunity.\n\nI regret having to bring this issue to your attention, but I know that it is essential to your oversight procedures that you be kept fully informed in a timely manner.\n\nYour STANSFIELD TURNER",

    "text": "SUBJECT: Project MKULTRA, Subproject 35\n1. While the Director's statutory authority to expend funds for confidential purposes is not limited by law, we believe that a gift of Government funds as such would exceed the intent of the Congress in granting that power. However, where a gift is made for the express purpose of producing something of value to this Agency which cannot otherwise be obtained and there is a reasonable expectation that the value may be received, the gift may in effect be an expenditure for proper official purposes.\n2. In Subproject 35, it is stated that the donation in question would achieve certain ends desired by TSS. There seems to be no question that those ends would be advantageous, so the main questions appear to be whether they could not be attained by more direct, normal methods, and, if not, whether the return is necessary and reasonable in relation to the donation.\n3. We are in no position to review the requirements of TSS or to appraise the advantages that would result from this project. We do not comment, therefore, on the value received if the project results in the benefits foreseen. We feel we should comment on factors affecting the probability of achieving those ends. In a legal sense, there is little or no control. Once the funds are donated, the individual, his foundation, or the hospital could conceivably refuse to work for us or allow us the use of the facilities.\n4. Practically, the control seems to be established as well as circumstances permit. Certainly, as long as the individual is alive and in his present position, we have every reason to expect his complete cooperation in the future as in the past, unless through some act or fault of our own he is alienated. Even in the event of his death or incapacity, there appears to be a reasonable [redacted] of continuing the project. If these probabilities appear sufficient to obtain an adequate return for the expenditure, there can be no legal objection to this aspect of the project.\n5. It should be noted that there are two circumstances which require consideration in a final determination. As stated in Section V, our contribution, by appearing to be from a private source, would increase the matching Government contribution by a similar amount which would not be the case if it were known that this was in fact a Government contribution also. Secondly, it is the stated policy of the hospital to charge the Government and commercial organizations 80 percent overhead on research contracts, whereas nonprofit foundations pay only direct costs but no overhead. Because of the ostensible source, our projects will not be charged overhead. This could be construed as morally wrongful to the hospital, as normally we would pay the 80 percent overhead charge for projects performed directly for us, but I believe this can be offset, at least to the amount of our donation, and perhaps by the further amount by which the other Government contributions are increased by our donation. In any case, if the project is a proper one and must be performed in this manner, security dictates these circumstances and they, therefore, do not present a legal obstacle as such.\n6. We raised the question whether funds for the hospital construction could not be obtained from other normal charitable sources. It appeared that there was a strong possibility that the individual concerned could raise adequate funds from private resources, but it was the position of TSS that if this were the case we would not obtain the commitment from the individual and the degree of control which this project is designed to achieve.",

With the exception of funding arrangements, no changes in :irogram have since been made. .Funds to cover previously approved sum o $125,000 are available wt -in the TSS budget for FY 55 and have b en set aside. The TSS ,ud ct, however, lacks funds with which to co r the supplemental sum of $250,000, and it is requested that the TSS udget be increased by this amount.

    "text": "AMENDMENT TO SUBPROJECT 35, PROJECT MKULTRA For the Purpose of Establishing a Cover Organization for Highly Sensitive Projects in the Field of Biological, Chemical and Radiological Warfare I. Background of Subproject 35. In January 1955 approval was given by the DCI to Subproject 35 of Project MAKULTRA. The documents which lead to this approval (including comments of the OGC) are attached herewith as Tabs 2, A and 3. Project MKULTRA is the framework of procedures and controls under which research projects in certain highly sensitive fields are carried out by TSS. A description of the background of Project MKULTRA may be found on page 1 of Tab A. Subproject 35 establishes cover 'under which the Chemical Division of DD/P/TSS would conduct certain sensitive projects in the fields of biological and chemical warfare and consists of a proposed arrangement whereby the Agency covertly contributes funds to assist th in the construction of a new research wing. Contribution of these funds is to be made through the - B 4 s cut-out so that the would remain - unwitting of Agency participation in the building program. Projects would later be carried out by the Chemical Division using the facilities of the new research wing, and Agency employees would be able to participate in the work without the University or the Hospital authorities being aware of Agency interest. Subproject 35 contemplated the contribution of Agency funds to assist in the construction of facilities. Future research work would be carried out through the. as cut-out and would be - separately funded under existing procedures and controls. and the background of - B h are described on page 2 of Tab A. On the same page there will be found a further description of the - 1 II. Building Fund. The University will require $3,000,000 for the six-story addition to the hospital exclusive of the cost of land, heating and power supply which are being provided by the University. Under Public Law 221, Subappropriation 01.'riys: 177 663, dated 26 August 1954, funds are available to match funds raised for this purpose by the University. When Subproject 35 was first prepared, it was hoped and expected that the funds required would be provided as follows: The University has allocated $1,000,000 to this project and will assume upkeep and staffing obligations. agreed that if the Agency would provide S - B with a grant of $125,000, the Fund would match this amount and make a total donation of $250,000 to the University Building Fund. At that time, discussions with Ago 0- indicated that would contribute $500,000 to the building project on the basis that radi ogical research would be conducted in the new wing and that the constr ion of the new facilities was of interest to that Agency. In summary, th financial situation was to have been as follows: $1,000,000 - 250,000 - Donation from (of which - 3 $125,000 was supplied by CIA) 1,250,000 - Matched Funds under Public Law 221 500,000 - - Q $3,000,000 - TOTAL It was recogpized that the Federal contribution 1,250,000 under Public Law 221 would be seemingly inflated by reas of the inclusion of the CIA contribution in that of It was felt that the value to the Agency was such that this inflation of the Federal contribution was more than justified by the importance of the over-all project and that furthermore, the inclusion of the CIA contribution in that of _____ was the best means of maintaining security.",

It is now suggested that the $3, 000, 000 required for the hospital wing be provided as follows: $1,000,000 - 500, 000 -Dnonfro l'including - $375, 000 supplied by CIA) 1,500,000 - Matched Funds from Public Law 221 $3, 000, 000 - TOTAL The donation from ould thus consist of the original $125, 000 to be. supplied by CIA plus the sum of $125, 000 to be provided by the Fund and a supplemental CIA contribution of $250, 000. Originally Subproject 35 requested permission to make a contribution of $125, 000 to the building fund and approval was given. This approval is enclosed herewith as Tab 2. The purpose of this amendment to Subproject 35 is to request permission to contribute an additional $250, 000 to the building construction fund through it should be noted that - 3 the total Government contribution to the hospital fund still remains unchanged at $1, 875, 000. The increase in the size of the contribution by the Fund is not out of keeping with other operations of 6 and will - 13 not arouse undue comment because of its magnitude. The originally approved contribution has not as yet been transmitted to and neither the -4 original contribution nor the supplement would be paid to 'd until -- funds adequate to complete the project are made available. This condition was specified by the DCI in approving the original contribution. V. Source of CIA Funds. Funds to cover the initially approved sum of $125, 000 are available and have been segregated for this purpose within the TSS FY 1955 Budget for Research and Development. Insufficient funds remain in the TSS budget to cover the supplementary sum of $230, 000, and it is therefore requested that the TSS . budget be increased by this amount and that the increase be made available to Subproject 35 of Project MKULTRA. Copy # 1 of 1 copy -3- 131. VI. Comments by the Office of General Counsel. Tab 3 is a memorandum from the General Counsel to the DCI dated 21 December 1954, commenting on Subproject 35, and stating in part that there are no fundamental legal objections if the probable benefits are con- sidered a fair return for this expenditure. The amendment to the Subproject contemplates only an increase in funds and in no way changes any other aspect of the project. The project has been referred back to the OGC even though no change in its structure is contemplated, and Tab 4 contains his comments. VII. Justification. The advantages and benefits accruing to the Agency outlined in Tab A are felt by TSS to provide adequata and complete justification for the expenditure of the additional sum herein requested which brings the total CIA contribu- tion to $375, 000. The most important of these advantages and benefits may be summarized as follows: (Fuller explanations may be found in Tab A). a. One-sixth of the total space in the new hospital wing will be available to the Chemical Division of TSS, thereby providing labora- tory and office space, technical assistants; equipment and experi- mental animals. b. Agency sponsorship of sensitive research projects will be completely deniable. c. Full professional cover will be.provided for up to three bio- chemical employees of the Chemical Division. d. Human patients and volunteers for experimental use will be available under controlled clinical conditions within the full supervision of - .

It was originally thought that at least 18 months would elapse after the building funds had been raised before the facilities would be finished and could be occupied by TSS. This lengthy delay has now been overcome. IMVJW has raised the $500,000 which his Fund will ostensibly contribute, he will then be allowed to use existing space in the present hospital in order that he may build up the organization which will later occupy the new wing. This means that TSS will be able to begin to take advantage of this cover situation within a matter of months instead of waiting for a year and a half.\n\nSecurity matters and details are being co-ordinated with the TSS Liaison and Security Officer. Security of transmittal of the funds and cover arrangements are described in Tab A and remain unchanged. The agreement with [redacted] is described in Tab A, and the extent of his co-operation and the control over his actions remain unchanged.\n\nThe total contribution of $375,000 by CIA will result in an additional $375,000 in matching funds provided under Public Law 221. It is felt that the expenditure of these total funds is justified by the importance of the programs which will be pursued at the new facility. Even though the CIA contribution is increased under this amended project, the total of Federal funds remains unchanged. The use of this facility will allow work to proceed under conditions of cover and security which would be impossible to obtain elsewhere without an expenditure of equivalent or greater funds. In addition, by funding individual projects for this facility through [redacted], no charge will be incurred for overhead expense. If research projects are openly sponsored by the U.S. Government, it is customary to pay an overhead rate equivalent to 80% of salaries. However, if a non-profit fund, such as [redacted], sponsors research, the funds granted for the work are customarily used only to pay for salaries, equipment and supplies, but not overhead. The Agency thus buys considerably more research through [redacted] than would be the case if no cut-out were used.\n\nSubproject 35, with [redacted] over the [redacted] aspects. While there is no legal control [redacted] certain incidental considerations, there is no [redacted] object [redacted]. Probable benefits are considered a [redacted] for this expenditure.\n\nSUBPROJECT 35 - PROJECT MKULTRA: For the purpose of establishing a cover organization for highly sensitive projects in the field of covert Biological, Chemical and Radiological Warfare.\n\nIn 1953 the DCI approved Project MKULTRA which established procedures and controls under which research projects in certain highly sensitive fields could be carried out by TSS without the necessity of signing the usual contracts. The approved procedures apply [redacted] Research and Development budget, and no additional funds are required. Controls established in the Project Review Committee approval of the Research and Development program (other than the signing of a contract) remain unchanged, and special provisions for audit are included. All files are retained by TSS. These procedures and controls were approved since it is highly undesirable from a policy and security point of view that contracts be signed indicating Agency or Government interest in this field of endeavor. In a great many instances the work must be conducted by individuals who are not and should not be aware of Agency interest. In other cases the individuals involved are unwilling to have their names on a contract which remains out of their control in our files. Experience has shown that qualified, competent individuals in the field of physiological, psychiatric and other biological sciences are very reluctant to enter into signed agreements of any sort which would connect them with this activity since such connection might seriously jeopardize their professional reputations. When Project MKULTRA was approved, it was not contemplated that it would be used for the establishment of cover. Over forty individual research and development projects have been established under this framework and have been carried out extremely successfully, both from technical and administrative points of view. The experience gained in handling these projects has emphasized that establishment of better cover both for the projects and for associated Agency scientists is of utmost importance. Subproject 35 would establish such cover.",

It has solicited funds from various individuals to finance a program of basic research in the chemotherapy of cancer, asthma, hypertension, psychosomatic disorders and other chronic diseases. Since 1951 [redacted] has co-operated with the Chemical Division of TSS and acted smoothly and efficiently, both as a cut-out for dealing with contractors in the fields of covert chemical and biological warfare, and as a prime contractor for certain areas of biological research. Projects presently being handled for the Agency by the Fund are administered under the controls and procedures previously approved for MKULTRA.\n\n[Redacted] is internationally known as a [redacted] in the field of [redacted] research and is [redacted].

Since then [redacted] has maintained a consulting relationship to the Navy medical research program. [Redacted] is TOP SECRET cleared and witting of Agency sponsorship of the programs carried out by the Fund as are two other members of the Fund's Board of Directors.\n\nThe [redacted] Fund is actively engaged in a campaign to raise funds for the purpose of erecting a new clinical research wing on the existing [redacted]. The research wing will consist of a [redacted] building six stories high, 320 feet long and 50 feet wide. Two-thirds of the space will be research laboratories and offices while 100 research beds will occupy the remainder. Participation in the fund-raising campaign outlined below will result in [redacted] having control of one-sixth of the total space in addition to the [redacted] and general out-patient facilities. In this effort, [redacted] has secured the enthusiastic support of the medical faculty and the officers of the University who have carried the preliminary arrangements forward to the maximum extent of their resources.\n\nThe University will require about $3,000,000 for the [redacted] story addition. This sum is exclusive of the cost of land and the heating and power supply which are already available at the site. At the present time under Public Law 221, funds are available to match funds raised by the University. The University has allocated $1,000,000 to this project and will assume upkeep and staffing obligations. [Redacted] has agreed that if CIA will provide a grant of $125,000, [redacted] will match this amount and make a total donation of $250,000 to the University Building Fund. This Agency's contribution will be made under the condition that it will be refunded if construction does not take place. TSS has discussed this situation with [redacted] and has encouraged [redacted] to donate $500,000 to the building project on the basis that [redacted] will be conducted in the new wing, though aware of our interest in the building, is unwitting of our specific fields of research and individual projects.\n\nIt has been generally recognized for some time that the external research activities of the Chemical Division of TSS in the field of covert biological, chemical and radiological warfare are sorely in need of proper cover. Although Project MKULTRA provides excellent administrative and financial cover for projects, it does not afford cover for scientific or technical personnel. MKULTRA has been used for dealing through [redacted] as a cut-out and for working directly with individuals or private companies. The use of [redacted] in the future will be increasingly limited due to:\n(a) The increasing number of people who, albeit properly cleared, are aware of the Agency connection with [redacted];\n(b) The feeling by [redacted] that the Agency employees contacting him (Drs. Gottlieb, etc.) have no cover of any sort and consequently expose him to unnecessary and highly undesirable personal risk; and\n(c) The widespread intra-Agency awareness of the nature of the relationship between the Fund and the Agency.\n\nAnother serious problem faced by TSS/CD as a result of lack of suitable cover is the difficulty in planning careers for technical and scientific personnel in the biological field. A long-range career concept of activities in this field inevitably includes proper cover for the individual concerned. The availability of research facilities at [redacted] will offer an excellent opportunity to solve many of the above problems, and [redacted] is willing and able to make any reasonable arrangements to suit our needs. Up to three Chemical Division employees can be integrated into [redacted] program for work in the new hospital wing on the Agency's research projects. Although career planning was not a consideration when planning the procedures and controls established by Project MKULTRA, nevertheless this particular subproject, in addition to its primary objective, will be of very great secondary help in simplifying and eliminating many of the very awkward and dangerous conditions facing certain Chemical Division employees.",

However, if a non-profit foundation such as [Foundation Name] sponsors research at a non-profit institution, the funds granted for the work are customarily used to pay for salaries, equipment and supplies but not for overhead.

[Individual] had been given ample previous notice that such was likely to be the intent of the visit, and he prepared himself accordingly. It was explained to [Individual] that it would not be possible to carry over funds beyond the end of the current fiscal year. Therefore all work would have to be completed and all payments made prior to 30 June. This deadline appeared acceptable to him, and it was agreed that I would make my final visit there to receive reports and attend to final details on 16 June. [Individual] did not have a current financial report, but he estimated that funds currently on hand would be about sufficient for remaining expenditures. He agreed to send the Society within the next 10 days a more exact statement of current balance and estimated remaining expenditures. I tried to impress on him strongly that transfer of additional funds and/or return of unexpended funds must be completed well before the end of the fiscal year. Of the 30 cases called for in the original design 13 have been completed (but only 4 have been transcribed from the tapes). In addition there are 8 cases in progress (of which two are already in interview and 6 are worked up to the point of having the lists of questions prepared). It was agreed that to meet the deadline we would have to limit the design to these 26 cases. It is apparent that [Individual] is so involved in the administrative problems of the project that he is not paying any attention to the results. Since to date only 4 cases have been transcribed there is no way of telling what is coming out of it. I assume there were no dramatic reactions, because the interviewers would have let him know about them had they emerged. It is possible, however, that our own analysis of the data may dredge up something of value, although I am dubious on this point.",

In the past year a number of covert and realistic field ,trials have been successfully carried out. The seults of these experiments have provided factual data essential to establishing protocols for a number of contemplated operations. A continuation of covert and realistic field trials are necessitated by the production of new materials in TSD programs, particularly in areas requiring detailed knowledge of the effectiveness pnd efficiency of deliverjI systems. Additional trials are also necessitated by the need for better controlled \"field-type\" experiments. 3. The estimated cost of the ,project is $5,000.00 for a period of six months.

During the coming year it is planned to concentrate more directly on the more practical aspects of the \"knockout\" problem. Enough new potent substances have become available lately to make such a change in emphasis worthwhile. In connection with this change it should be noted that certain findings made in a NAMEN project at U which cannot be further exploited at that facility will be pursued at in the future.

Considerable data has now been obtained supporting the resonance-cavitation theory of brain concussion. c. Preliminary acceleration threshold data has been obtained for a fluid-filled glass simulated skull. d. Data has been obtained on the nature and the magnitude of pressure fluctuations within a glass simulated skull subject to either impact or sound waves propagated in air. e. Initial studies have been made on the simulated glass skull attempting to establish the cavitation patterns for various types of impact.\n\n7. The proposed method and program plan remain the same as stated in the original proposal, except for the temporary deletion of the immersion blast study.\n\n8. The current level of activity on this project can be indicated by the most recent billing to the for the month of November, which amounted to $4,034.61.\n\n9. In the interest of efficiency and economy it is requested that at least this level of activity be maintained for the coming year.",

W. defines brain concussion as, 'an essentially transient state due to head injury which is of instantaneous onset, manifests widespread symptoms of purely paralytic kind, does not as such comprise any evidence of structural cerebral injury, and is always followed by amnesia for the actual moment of the accident.'\n\n10.2 The implication of the underlined portion of the above statement is that if a technique were devised to induce brain concussion without giving either advance warning or causing external physical trauma, the person upon recovery would be unable to recall what had happened to him. Under these conditions the same technique of producing the concussion could be re-used many times without disclosure of its nature.\n\n10.3 First, considering the possibilities of direct impact to the head or body, it should be possible from the findings of this research program to determine the following:\n\na. Optimum design of impacting devices.\n\nb. Optimum points of impact on skull or body for the specific effects desired.\n\nc. Intensity of the blow for the effect desired.\n\n10.4 In regard to the potential impacting devices, there are certain design requisites that are apparent at this time:\n\na. The impact should be delivered without advance warning.\n\nb. The area of impact and force distribution should be such that surface trauma does not occur.\n\nc. The intensity of the impacting force and its duration should be such as to obtain the desired effect.\n\nd. The device should be as small and as silent as possible.\n\n10.5 The specific impacting devices might take the form of any of the following:\n\na. A pancake type black-jack giving a high peak impact force with a low unit surface pressure.\n\nb. Concealed or camouflaged spring-loaded impacting devices that trigger upon contact with the head.\n\nc. A projectile type impactor such as an ear buzzer using a small shot filled blank for a projectile.\n\nd. An explosive pad detonated in contact with the head or the body.",

    "text": "10.6 Let us now consider the possibilities of exciting the resonance cavitation directly without impact. There is considerable evidence that resonance cavitation can be induced directly in the following ways:\n\na. A blast wave propagated in air. (Blast Concussion)\n\nb. Physical excitation with a mechanical driver or horn, tuned to the resonant frequency of the head.\n\n10.7 A single blast pressure wave propagated in air must have considerable intensity in order to produce brain concussion, however, there is considerable evidence (Carver & Dinsley) that modification of the pressure wave can produce profound effects.\n\n10.8 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by using a tuned driver at this time appears to be well within the realm of possibility. The neurotic-like manifestations normally associated with blast concussion could possibly be induced by this method. Use of this method, however, would require actual physical contact with the drivers.\n\n10.9 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by tuned sound waves also appears to be a reasonable possibility. Concentration of the sound field at some remote point could be effected with acoustical lenses and reflectors. The blast duration would be in the order of a tenth of a second. Masking of a noise of this duration should not be too difficult.\n\n11.0 It would possibly be advantageous to establish the effectiveness of both of the above methods as a tool in brain-wash therapy. A full knowledge of the method and the resulting sequela should be of aid to any person forced to submit to such treatment.\n\n12.0 Possibly the most significant potential aspect of this study would be in the development of practical means of giving a person immunity, even though temporary, to brain concussion. One technique that appears to have potentialities involves the introduction of a small quantity of gas, approximately 1 cc, into the spinal cord. This gas bubble would then normally migrate to the ventricles located at the centrum of the brain. The ability of this bubble to expand under dynamic loading would be most effective in preventing resonance cavitation from occurring.",

    "text": "MKSEARCH\n\nMKSEARCH was the name given to the continuation of the MKULTRA program. Funding commenced in FY 1966, and ended in FY 1972. Its purpose was to develop, test, and evaluate capabilities in the covert use of biological, chemical, and radioactive material systems and techniques for producing predictable human behavioral and/or physiological changes in support of highly sensitive operational requirements.\n\nOFTEN/CHICKWIT\n\nIn 1967 the Office of Research and Development (ORD) and the Edgewood Arsenal Research Laboratories undertook a program for doing research on the identification and characterization of drugs that could influence human behavior. Edgewood had the facilities for the full range of laboratory and clinical testing. A phased program was envisioned that would consist of acquisition of drugs and chemical compounds believed to have effects on the behavior of humans, and testing and evaluating these materials through laboratory procedures and toxicological studies. Compounds believed promising as a result of tests on animals were then to be evaluated clinically with human subjects at Edgewood. Substances of potential use would then be analyzed structurally as a basis for identifying and synthesizing possible new derivatives of greater utility. The program was divided into two projects. Project OFTEN was to deal with testing the toxicological, transmisivity and behavioral effects of drugs in animals and, ultimately, humans. Project CHICKWIT was concerned with acquiring information on new drug developments in Europe and the Orient, and with acquiring samples. There is a discrepancy between the testimony of DOD and CIA regarding the testing at Edgewood Arsenal in June 1973. While there is agreement that human testing occurred at that place and time, there is disagreement as to who was responsible for financing and sponsorship. (See hearings before the Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research of the Senate Human Resources Committee, September 21, 1977.)\n\nQKHILLTOP\n\nQKHILLTOP was a cryptonym assigned in 1954 to a project to study Chinese Communist brainwashing techniques and to develop interrogation techniques. Most of the early studies are believed to have been conducted by the Cornell University Medical School Human Ecology Study Programs. The effort was absorbed into the MKULTRA program and the QKHILLTOP cryptonym became obsolete. The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, later the Human Ecology Fund, was an outgrowth of the QKHILLTOP.",

The book's publication marked a turning point in public discourse about the Agency and US foreign policy, specifically concerning covert operations. Prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, discussion of such activities was largely absent from American media. Popular culture portrayed spies as invariably foreign, reinforcing the idea that the US did not engage in such practices.  Journalists, even when aware of covert actions, often withheld information, citing national security concerns. Hollywood similarly avoided the topic, even altering existing narratives to erase or downplay American involvement. While some criticism of the CIA existed, it focused on intelligence failures and accountability, not covert operations. *The Invisible Government* broke this silence, becoming a pivotal text in the evolving narrative of government secrecy and contributing to the modern \"deep state\" narrative.",

The book documented the CIA's attempts to censor its publication, foreshadowing later efforts to suppress critical accounts from insiders like Victor Marchetti, Philip Agee, and Frank Snepp.  The CIA's primary argument against publication was that it would provide propaganda material for the Soviet Union, a concern that proved valid.

For example, they portrayed the CIA's intervention in Guatemala as a response to Soviet weapon supply to a 'Red-dominated' regime and the intervention in Iran as rescuing the nation from Moscow's 'clutching claw'.  Despite exposing CIA involvement in these events, the American media largely continued to ignore covert action.  A Times journalist who was in contact with CIA officers in Tehran during the coup described the Harkness articles as an 'exception' that didn't influence subsequent accounts.  The prevailing narrative in American culture, fueled by 'spy-mania' and red scare politics, focused on Soviet espionage and US counter-espionage, portraying American actions as purely defensive.  Works like Graham Greene's *The Quiet American*, which challenged this narrative, were met with resistance, with the film adaptation even altering the story to conform to the prevailing view. It wasn't until the Bay of Pigs disaster, an operation too large to conceal, that American media began seriously examining US covert action. The Bay of Pigs invasion marked a turning point.  The planned operation was publicized even before it happened, with details appearing in the *New York Times* and Guatemalan newspapers months prior.  The public failure forced Kennedy to acknowledge US involvement, sparking public debate and scrutiny of the CIA's role.  Kennedy's attempts to shift blame and his famous quote about victory and defeat further fueled speculation.  The incident led to a public relations battle between the Kennedy administration and the CIA, marking the first time a covert operation faced such widespread public scrutiny.  This scrutiny also raised questions about the CIA's role in foreign policy.",

The Bay of Pigs became a central focus, highlighting the disastrous consequences of unwieldy covert operations.  Andrew Tully's *CIA: The Inside Story* (1962) offered earlier, milder criticisms, focusing on the Agency's composition, support for right-wing regimes, and occasional overreach in policy decisions. Ironically, Tully received some assistance from the CIA for his book, which he acknowledged in the foreword.  This angered Allen Dulles, who publicly condemned the book and sought to influence negative reviews. Dulles' efforts, including interviews and letters to publishers and journalists, highlighted the tension between the CIA and critical media coverage.  Tully responded by defending his work and criticizing the reliance on dismissing information simply because it aligned with communist narratives.  Dulles' claim that Tully reproduced Soviet propaganda had some basis, as Tully had quoted from a KGB-authored biography of Dulles.  Within the CIA, there was debate on how to respond to Tully's book. While some advocated for public refutation, others, including John McCone, believed it would only draw more attention.  Sherman Kent prepared a detailed rebuttal, but it was ultimately kept within the CIA. McCone's decision not to respond publicly reflected the CIA's concern about amplifying criticism, especially given the book's declining popularity.",

This represented a decisive break from the previous era when official support or endorsement was almost a pre-requisite for non-fiction accounts of the secret state to be taken seriously.38 Instead of interviewing CIA leadership, or other officials in Washington, Johnson told his story from the perspective of the Cuban exiles who fought in the invasion, and who were recently freed by Castro from Cuban prisons in exchange for a ransom of $53 million in food and medical supplies.39 As an internal CIA memo pointed out, the book was potentially damaging in several respects. First, and perhaps most problematic for the Agency, the book claimed that CIA planners had told the exile forces to ‘go ahead and land even if Washington canceled (sic) the operations’.40 As one reviewer later put it, perhaps Johnson’s most serious charge in the book is that ‘the CIA operated as an imperium in imperio’, or in other words, an ‘invisible government’ willing to ignore and override orders from Washington. But despite Johnson’s criticism of the CIA’s involvement in the Bay of Pigs, his criticism of the Agency was not unwavering, and in his conclusion he reiterated the essential role the CIA played in maintaining the security of the United States. The CIA’s attempts to censor “the Invisible Government” Unlike Johnson’s book, the other pre-publication manuscript that the CIA had obtained in the spring of 1964 pulled no punches in its criticism of the Agency. David Wise and Thomas Ross’ The Invisible Government is one of the two or three most important books ever written about the CIA. It had a profound impact, demonstrably altering attitudes towards the CIA at a pivotal moment in the history of US foreign policy, and the American people’s attitudes towards that policy. A few months after the book’s publication, an incident in the Gulf of Tonkin provided President Johnson with a pretext to commit conventional US military forces to open warfare in Vietnam. It was that war, more than anything else, that altered the American people’s attitudes towards the US foreign policy establishment, including the CIA. And it was The Invisible Government, more than any other book about the Agency in this period, that became a key text for student protestors and the anti-war movement. In clipped prose The Invisible Government outlined the history of CIA covert operations.",

Nor did it argue that the CIA set its own policy. This latter claim, according to Wise and Ross, was ‘oversimplified’. What they did argue, however, was that within the broad parameters laid down by the President and his advisors, the CIA had considerable room to ‘shape events in the field’, and to ‘influence policy and chart their own course within the flexible framework laid down by Washington’.41 It was not as radical of a book as its critics later perceived, but that was not how the CIA saw it, and the nuances of its argument would get lost in the furor that accompanied the book’s release. Sometime in late April 1964 the CIA surreptitiously obtained a pre-publication copy of The Invisible Government. Immediately, DCI John McCone ordered the formation of a CIA task force on the book to determine its implications for the Agency. Over a single frantic weekend the task force reviewed the manuscript. The Office of Security were drafted in to assess the damage, but INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 287 they could not ‘identify any specific security violation breached’ and therefore concluded that the ‘chances of prosecution, particularly of a successful one, were not very high’. Despite their inability to identify any specific threats to national security posed by the book’s publication, the task force nevertheless recommended that ‘an approach at the highest level to the book publisher be considered, either to stop the book from being printed or to have deletions of at least some of the material’ on the grounds that it was ‘most harmful’. This appeal, they concluded, should be ‘made in the name of national interest’. They cautioned, however, that the CIA would need to play dumb in their initial approach to the publisher, and request a copy of the manuscript, ‘since the present one was gotten through irregular channels’. If this approach failed, they concluded, ‘CIA may have to secure unfavorable book reviews’ from ‘such assets as CIA may have’ in order to ‘lessen the book’s impact and to cast doubt on the validity of its claims’.42 The Agency’s campaign to discredit The Invisible Government in the American press was, however, a consequence of their failure to prevent its publication.",

    "text": "Throwing caution to the wind, Director John McCone invited the authors to a meeting a few months prior to the book’s publication. He told them that the book would certainly damage US national security, and would provide ‘a vast stockpile of material for critical speeches and editorials’ in nations unfriendly to the United States.43 According to Wise, McCone then produced a list of 10 national security breaches that the CIA wanted removed from the book. Noting that the list was stamped ‘Top Secret’, Wise refused to look at it, and said that he could not possibly leave the Agency’s headquarters building with it in his possession. Lyman Kirkpatrick then appeared with a pair of scissors and snipped off the classification markings.44 The authors refused to cooperate with the CIA’s request. Undeterred, McCone approached Mike Cowles, a co-founder and editor of Look Magazine that was due to serialise the book, and asked him to stop publication, or to remove sections that were potentially damaging. ‘I think you are unduly agitated about [Wise and Ross’] story’, was Cowles’ sharp reply, ‘my observation of the material is there is little told that is new’.45 The next stop was the book’s publisher, Random House. McCone approached one of their editors, Robert Loomis, and pleaded with him to remove damaging sections in the book, even threatening him with the Espionage Act. In fairness, the CIA did offer to compensate the publisher for revenues lost by buying up all 2000 pre-publication copies of the book.46 Loomis and Random House chose instead to persevere with publication.47 Failing these personal overtures to the authors and their publishers, the CIA’s lawyers went to the Department of Justice, and asked the Assistant Attorney General to put out a temporary restraining order. It would have been a remarkable move, pre-empting Nixon’s famous showdown with the American press over the publication of the Pentagon Papers more than seven years later. The Assistant Attorney General’s office advised the CIA that such an injunction might be possible, but eventually the CIA’s leadership balked, fearing that a prolonged legal battle would simply provide additional publicity for the book.48 In a last ditch attempt to head off the book before its release, McCone approached the President of the United States, Lyndon Baines Johnson, and asked him to hold a news conference at which he would publicly condemn the book. Johnson, ‘ever attuned to his personal image’, demurred.49 Realising they had failed to prevent The Invisible Government’s publication, the CIA went into damage limitation mode, and instigated its previously stated ‘plan B’, by mobilizing friendly CIA assets in the media to discredit the book. According to veteran CIA clandestine operative Joseph Burkholder Smith, ‘[a]ll stations were deluged with dispatches giving instructions how to handle the matter’. The CIA’s propaganda section wrote fake book reviews, and sort to get them published in the foreign press.50 Another CIA asset prepared a review and sent it to Life Magazine. They rejected it, so they then submitted it to Reader’s Digest.51 The CIA also leaked information to friendly journalists, including Marquis Childs who reported that ‘high government officials’ had revealed that the book contained 112 breaches of security, some of them serious’.52 Numerous other press reports citing ‘intelligence sources’ or ‘government officials’ reported similar security breaches.53 This contradicted 288 S. WILLMETTS the CIA’s own internal review by the Office of Security which concluded that no security breaches could be found in the book. The CIA’s campaign against the book, both before and after its publication, failed. It was profoundly influential, a bestseller in the United States, and with the help of Soviet propagandists and prominent leaders of the decolonization movement, it also achieved worldwide influence.",

    "text": "What made its impact so long-lasting, however, was its timeliness. Upon its release, in 1964, John Le Carré’s sinister vision of Western espionage in the Cold War in his landmark novel The Spy Who Came in From the Cold topped the fiction bestseller list. For a while, The Invisible Government hovered around the top of the non-fiction bestseller list, whilst Le Carré’s equally damning vision of Western intelligence sat stop the fiction list. Attitudes were beginning to change. The tide was about to turn. In the years that followed the book’s release the United States’ deepening involvement in the Vietnam War, accompanied by frequent revelations of sinister secret state activity in the United States confirmed the ‘invisible government’ thesis in many Americans’ minds. It became a clarion call for the anti-war movement and helped budding conspiracy theorists hone and lend weight to their claims that a hidden government hand was behind President Kennedy’s assassination. The ‘deep state’ narrative was starting to take hold, and despite their best efforts, the CIA had failed in their attempts to block the publications of one of its foundational texts. A lasting legacy: the widespread influence of the Invisible Government The Invisible Government had an immediate impact upon public discussions about intelligence and covert operations. It shot to the top of the non-fiction bestseller lists in many newspapers, although much to the authors chagrin, remained in the number two spot on the New York Times’ bestseller list for 22 weeks, second only to Ernest Hemingway’s Movable Feast. ‘We were a bit disappointed’, recalled Wise, ‘but . . . if we had to be second to someone, Hemingway was it’.54 The book’s critical reception was polarized, revealing a nascent faultine in American society between those critical of American foreign policy and its institutions, and those who sought to defend it.",

    "text": "Ben Badikian’s review in the New York Times, for example, highlighted the book’s central significance in disabusing the American population of the naïve belief that the United States were not involved in aggressive covert operations. Until very recently, Badikian noted, it was perfectly reasonable for members of Congress and the general public to be entirely naïve of CIA covert operations, and assume they were not engaged in them. ‘Today this . . . would be so naïve as to border on the stupid’, Bedikian remarked. ‘In 1964 every serious newspaper reader knows that American agencies are engaged in “operational activities” – secret manipulations and subversion of foreign societies – all over the world, not only keeping others from doing unto us but also doing unto others’.55 William Buckley Jr., the renowned conservative commentator and former CIA officer, was less sympathetic: ‘the thesis that the CIA is an invisible government is so palpably absurd that one must conclude that the purpose of the book, notwithstanding its sanctimonious pretentions, is simply to make a little scandal, and make a little money’. Buckley repeated the claim made by Marquis Childs that the book contained serious security breaches, including ‘naming 26 persons who are CIA agents in deep cover’. Though it appears that the CIA leaked this claim to Childs and other friendly journalists, their own Office of Security could find no security breaches, and Random House strenuously denied the allegation.56 John Chamberlain, a veteran reporter and one of Buckley’s close friends, also penned an article for his syndicated column defending the CIA. He described Wise and Ross’ anti-CIA attacks as a ‘contagion’ that was spreading dangerously across American society, which risked undermining one of the nation’s strongest bulwarks against the Soviet Union.57 ‘Contagion’ was of course a loaded term; it was a common Cold War metaphor to describe the spread of communism.58 But the book was certainly influential, including among Soviet propagan­ dists and domestic protest movements in the United States that the U.S. intelligence community and many of its defenders in the press deemed suspicious. In 1966, for example, a wave of anti-CIA protests on university campuses were directly inspired by Wise and Ross’ account. One of the first INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY 289 took place in February 1966 at Grinnell College, Iowa. A group of students picketed a presentation by a CIA recruiter, holding signs reading ‘Where there is an invisible government there is no democracy’.59 The students also lifted their central point of contention with the CIA from the pages of Wise and Ross’ book: ‘Our main concern is that, rather than relaying the information gathered through its intelligence operations to responsible government officials, the agency fre­ quently takes action on its own . . . ’60 Later that year students at Boston University staged a similar protest. They produced an information pamphlet on the history of CIA covert action, and cited Wise and Ross at length, again echoing the argument that the CIA had acted outside the authority of elected officials: ‘Time after time the C.I.A. has created American policy’, they wrote, and listed examples lifted directly from The Invisible Government where Wise and Ross argued that the Agency had acted without informing relevant policymakers.61 The ‘Contagion’ begun by Wise and Ross soon spread to numerous other college campuses. Almost invariably, the pamphlets the students pro­ duced to rationalize their anti-CIA protests cited The Invisible Government, with some borrowing the same title.62 Students at Emory University, for example, having already quoted liberally from Wise and Ross, charged that the ‘CIA is guilty of putting its own institutional interests above that of the American people. It is guilty of sabotage of our foreign policy when such policy does not agree with its own’.63 Other student protestors, although still greatly indebted to The Invisible Government, took a slightly different position. For example, in February 1968, amidst the Tet offensive that would dramatically undermine public support for the war in Vietnam, the Wisconsin chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) produced a pamphlet titled ‘The CIA: Or Who Was that Dictator I Seen Ya With?’ The pamphlet repeated many of the",

However, instead of regarding the CIA as a rogue organization that corrupted US foreign policy, they instead saw the former as the apotheosis of the latter: The CIA is not an aberration in an otherwise democratic society. The point is not that the CIA has been an ‘invisible government’, nor that it has dictated American foreign policy, but that its activities constitute a particularly outrageous aspect of that policy. It is an internal part of a political and economic system which oppressed and misleads its own people just as it does the people of other lands for the benefit of those whose profits come from racism and exploitation. It is because the SDS opposes this system of exploitation and racism that it opposes the CIA.64 The SDS’ more systemic critique of the CIA that was nevertheless still indebted to The Invisible Government was shared by other influential critics of U.S. foreign policy in this era. Influential world leaders and several major voices for the decolonization movement often invoked The Invisible Government to support their claims that the United States were engaged in a form of neo- colonialism. CIA covert operations, which often targeted former European colonies in the developing world, were regarded as imperial interventions, replacing the cruder and more overt forms of European colonialism from the previous age of empires. Kwame Nkrumah, for example, the President of Ghana and a leading pan-Africanist, published an influential book in 1965 titled Neo Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism, which cited The Invisible Government at length in support of its thesis that Western powers, and particularly the United States, continued to dominate and dictate life in ostensibly post-colonial nations.65 The ‘extended tentacles of the Wall Street octopus’, he wrote, with ‘its suction cups and muscular strength are provided by a phenomenon dubbed “The Invisible Government” . . . ’66 Admittedly, the CIA were frequently attacked in the Ghanaian media even prior to the publication of The Invisible Government. In February and March 1963, a series of articles in the Ghanaian press accused the CIA of assassinating Premier Qassim in Iraq. One article in the Ghana Evening News was headlined ‘Neo-Colonialist Terror in Iraq Menacing Threat Against Africa’. The weekly Ghanaian newspaper Spark also carried a front page story titled ‘The Secret War of CIA: The Killer at Your Door’, which noted that ‘[t]he murderous game, which goes by the innocent- sounding name of intelligence, has its Western-world nerve-centre in America’s Central Intelligence Agency . . . ”’67 The Invisible Government, it seemed, gave credence and a powerful narrative framework to an idea that was already taking root in Ghanaian society.",

    "text": "This History Staff Monograph offers a comprehensive and authoritative history of the CIA's manned overhead reconnaissance program, which from 1954 to 1974 developed and operated two extraordinary aircraft, the U-2 and the A-12 OXCART. It describes not only the program's technological and bureaucratic aspects, but also its political and international context. The manned reconnaissance program, along with other overhead systems that emerged from it, changed the CIA's work and structure in ways that were both revolutionary and permanent. The formation of the Directorate of Science and Technology in the 1960s, principally to develop and direct reconnaissance programs, is the most obvious legacy of the events recounted in this study. The authors tell an engrossing story. The struggle between the CIA and the US Air Force to control the U-2 and A-12 OXCART projects reveals how the manned reconnaissance program confronted problems that still beset successor programs today. The U-2 was an enormous technological success: its first flight over the USSR in July 1956 made it immediately the most important source of intelligence on the Soviet Union. Using it against the Soviet target it was designed for nevertheless produced a persistent tension between its program managers and the President. The program managers, eager for coverage, repeatedly urged the President to authorize frequent missions over the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower, from the outset doubtful of the prudence and propriety of invading Soviet airspace, only reluctantly allowed any overflights at all. After the Soviets shot down Francis Gary Powers' U-2 on 1 May 1960, President Eisenhower forbade any further U-2 flights over the USSR. Since the Agency must always assess a covert operation's potential payoff against the diplomatic or military cost if it fails, this account of the U-2's employment over the Soviet Union offers insights that go beyond overhead reconnaissance programs. Indeed, this study should be useful for a variety of purposes. It is the only history of this program based upon both full access to CIA records and extensive classified interviews of its participants. The authors have found records that were nearly irretrievably lost and have interviewed participants whose personal recollections gave information available nowhere else. Although the story of the manned reconnaissance program offers no tidy model for imitation, it does reveal how resourceful managers coped with unprecedented technological challenges and their implications for intelligence and national policy. For this reason, the program's history provides profitable reading for intelligence professionals and policymakers today. Many people made important contributions to the production of this volume.

    "text": "When the Central Intelligence Agency came into existence in 1947, no one foresaw that, in less than a decade, it would undertake a major program of overhead reconnaissance, whose principal purpose would be to fly over the Soviet Union. Traditionally, the military services had been responsible for overhead reconnaissance, and flights deep into unfriendly territory only took place during wartime. By the early 1950s, however, the United States had an urgent and growing need for strategic intelligence on the Soviet Union and its satellite states. At great risk, US Air Force and Navy aircraft had been conducting peripheral reconnaissance and shallow-penetration overflights, but these missions were paying a high price in lives lost and increased international tension. Furthermore, many important areas of the Soviet Union lay beyond the range of existing reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force had therefore begun to develop a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft that would be able to conduct deep-penetration reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and his civilian scientific advisers feared that the loss of such an aircraft deep in Soviet territory could lead to war and therefore authorized the development of new non-military aircraft, first the U-2 and later the A-12 OXCART, to be manned by civilians and operated only under cover and in the greatest secrecy. Primary responsibility for this new reconnaissance program was assigned to the Central Intelligence Agency, but the Air Force provided vital support.\n\nThe Agency's manned overhead reconnaissance program lasted 20 years. It began with President Eisenhower's authorization of the U-2 project in late 1954 and ended with the transfer of the remaining Agency U-2s to the Air Force in 1974. During this period the CIA developed a successor to the U-2, the A-12 OXCART, but this advanced aircraft saw little operational use and the program was canceled in 1968 after the Air Force deployed a fleet of similar aircraft, a military variant of the A-12 called the SR-71.\n\nBy 1949 the Soviet Union and the states of Eastern Europe had been effectively curtained off from the outside world, and the Soviet military carried out its planning, production, and deployment activities with the utmost secrecy. All Soviet strategic capabilities—bomber forces, ballistic missiles, submarine forces, and nuclear weapons plants—were concealed from outside observation. The Soviet air defense system, a prime consideration in determining US retaliatory policies, was also largely an unknown factor.\n\nTight security along the Soviet Bloc borders severely curtailed the movement of human intelligence sources. In addition, the Soviet Union made its conventional means of communication—telephone, telegraph, and radio-telephone—more secure, thereby greatly reducing the intelligence available from these sources. The stringent security measures imposed by the Communist Bloc nations effectively blunted traditional methods for gathering intelligence: secret agents using covert means to communicate intelligence, travelers to and from target areas who could be asked to keep their eyes open and report their observations later, wiretaps and other eavesdropping methods, and postal intercepts. Indeed, the entire panoply of intelligence tradecraft seemed ineffective against the Soviet Bloc, and no other methods were available.",

    "text": "For centuries, soldiers in wartime have sought the highest ground or structure in order to get a better view of the enemy. By the time of the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71, observers were using hot-air balloons to get up in the sky for a better view of the “other side of the hill.” With the advent of dry film, it became possible to carry cameras into the sky to record the disposition of enemy troops and emplacements. Photoreconnaissance proved so valuable during World War I that in 1938 Gen. Werner von Fritsch, Commander in Chief of the German Army, predicted: “The nation with the best aerial reconnaissance facilities will win the next war.”\n\nBy World War II, lenses, films, and cameras had undergone many improvements, as had the airplane, which could fly higher and faster than the primitive craft of World War I. Now it was possible to use photoreconnaissance to obtain information about potential targets before a bombing raid and to assess the effectiveness of the bombing afterward. Peacetime applications of high-altitude photography at first included only photomapping and surveying for transcontinental highways and mineral and oil exploration. There was little thought given to using photography for peacetime espionage until after World War II, when the Iron Curtain rang down and cut off most forms of communication between the Soviet Bloc of nations and the rest of the world.\n\nAlthough at the end of World War II the United States had captured large quantities of German photos and documents on the Soviet Union, this material was rapidly becoming outdated. The main source of current intelligence on the Soviet Union’s military installations was interrogation of prisoners of war returning from Soviet captivity. To obtain information about Soviet scientific progress, the intelligence community established several programs to debrief German scientists who had been taken to the Soviet Union after the end of the war but were now being allowed to leave.",

As a result, in the late 1940s, the US Air Force and Navy began trying to obtain aerial photography of the Soviet Union. The main Air Force effort involved Boeing RB-47 aircraft (the reconnaissance version of the B-47 jet-propelled medium bomber) equipped with cameras and electronic \"ferret\" equipment that enabled aircrews to detect tracking by Soviet radars. At that time the Soviet Union had not yet completely ringed its borders with radars; and much of the interior also lacked radar coverage. Thus, when the RB-47s found a gap in the air-warning network, they would dart inland to take photographs of any accessible targets. These \"penetration photography\" flights (called SENSTNT-sensitive intelligence-missions) occurred along the northern and Pacific coasts of Russia. One RB-47 aircraft even managed to fly 450 miles inland and photograph the city of Igarka in Siberia. Such intrusions brought protests from Moscow but no Soviet military response. In 1950 there was a major change in Soviet policy. Air defense units became very aggressive in defending their airspace, attacking all aircraft that came near the borders of the Soviet Union. On 8 April 1950, Soviet fighters shot down a US Navy Privateer patrol aircraft over the Baltic Sea. Following the outbreak of the Korean war in June 1950, the Soviet Union extended its \"severe air defense policy\" to the Far East. In the autumn of 1951, Soviet aircraft downed a twin-engine US Navy Neptune bomber near Vladivostok. An RB-29 lost in the Sea of Japan on 13 June 1952 was probably also a victim of Soviet fighters. The United States was not the only country affected by the new aggressive Soviet air defense policy; Britain and Turkey also reported attacks on their planes.",

    "text": "The Soviet Union's air defense policy became even more aggressive in August 1952, when its reconnaissance aircraft began violating Japanese airspace over Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese home island. Two months later, on 7 October 1952, Soviet fighter aircraft stalked and shot down a US RB-29 flying over Hokkaido. Aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union and surrounding areas had become a very dangerous business. Despite the growing risks associated with aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Bloc, senior US officials strongly believed that such missions were necessary. The lack of information about the Soviet Union, coupled with the perception that it was an aggressive nation determined to expand its borders—a perception that had been greatly strengthened by the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950—increased US determination to obtain information about Soviet intentions and capabilities and thus reduce the danger of being surprised by a Soviet attack.\n\nNew Approaches to Photoreconnaissance\n\nWhile existing Navy and Air Force aircraft were flying their risky reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union, the United States began planning for a more systematic and less dangerous approach using new technology. One of the leading advocates of the need for new, high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was Richard S. Leghorn, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and employee of Eastman Kodak who had commanded the Army Air Forces' 67th Reconnaissance Group in Europe during World War II. After the war he returned to Kodak but maintained his interest in photoreconnaissance. Leghorn strongly believed in the need for what he called pre-D-day reconnaissance, that is, reconnaissance of a potential enemy before the outbreak of actual hostilities, in contrast to combat reconnaissance in wartime. In papers presented in 1946 and 1948, Leghorn argued that the United States needed to develop such a capability, which would require high-altitude aircraft and high-resolution cameras. The outbreak of the Korean war gave Leghorn an opportunity to put his ideas into effect. Recalled to active duty by the Air Force, Lieutenant Colonel Leghorn became the head of the Reconnaissance Systems Branch of the Wright Air Development Command at Dayton, Ohio, in April 1951.",

    "text": "In Leghorn's view, altitude was the key to success for overhead reconnaissance. Since the best Soviet interceptor at that time, the MIG-17, had to struggle to reach 45,000 feet, Leghorn reasoned that an aircraft that could exceed 60,000 feet would be safe from Soviet fighters. Recognizing that the fastest way to produce a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft was to modify an existing aircraft, he began looking for the highest flying aircraft available in the Free World. This search soon led him to a British twin-engine medium bomber—the Canberra—built by the English Electric Company. The Canberra had made its first flight in May 1949. Its speed of 469 knots (870 kilometers per hour) and its service ceiling of 48,000 feet made the Canberra a natural choice for high-altitude reconnaissance work. The Royal Air Force quickly developed a reconnaissance version of the Canberra, the PR3 (the PR stood for photoreconnaissance), which began flying in March 1950. At Leghorn's insistence, the Wright Air Development Command invited English Electric representatives to Dayton in the summer of 1951 to help find ways to make the Canberra fly even higher. By this time the Air Force had already adopted the bomber version of the Canberra, which the Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Company was to produce under license as the B-57 medium bomber. Leghorn and his English Electric colleagues designed a new Canberra configuration with very long high-lift wings, new Rolls-Royce Avon-109 engines, a solitary pilot, and an airframe that was stressed to less than the standard military specifications. Leghorn calculated that a Canberra so equipped might reach 63,000 feet early in a long mission and as high as 67,000 feet as the declining fuel supply lightened the aircraft. He believed that such a modified Canberra could penetrate the Soviet Union and China for a radius of 800 miles from bases around their periphery and photograph up to 85 percent of the intelligence targets in those countries. Leghorn persuaded his superiors to submit his suggestion to the Pentagon for funding. He had not, however, cleared his idea with the Air Research and Development Command, whose reconnaissance division in Baltimore, headed by Lt. Col. Joseph J. Pellegrini, had to approve all new reconnaissance aircraft designs. Pellegrini's unit reviewed Leghorn's design and ordered extensive modifications. According to Leghorn, Pellegrini was not interested in a special-purpose aircraft that was only suitable for covert peacetime reconnaissance missions, for he believed that all Air Force reconnaissance aircraft should be capable of operating under wartime conditions. Pellegrini therefore insisted that Leghorn's design meet the specifications for combat aircraft, which required heavily stressed airframes, armor plate, and other apparatus that made an aircraft too heavy to reach the higher altitudes necessary for safe overflights of the Soviet Bloc. The final result of Leghorn's concept after its alteration by Pellegrini's staff was the RB-57D in 1955, whose maximum altitude was only 64,000 feet. Meanwhile Leghorn, frustrated by the rejection of his original concept, had transferred to the Pentagon in early 1952 to work for Col. Bernard A. Schriever, Assistant for Development Planning to the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Development.",

    "text": "In his new position Leghorn became responsible for planning the Air Force's reconnaissance needs for the next decade. He worked closely with Charles F. (Bud) Wienberg—a colleague who had followed him from Wright Field—and Eugene P Kiefer, a Notre Dame-educated aeronautical engineer who had designed reconnaissance aircraft at the Wright Air Development Center during World War II. All three of these reconnaissance experts believed that the Air Force should emphasize high-altitude photoreconnaissance. Underlying their advocacy of high-altitude photoreconnaissance was the belief that Soviet radars would not be able to track aircraft flying above 65,000 feet. This assumption was based on the fact that the Soviet Union used American-built radar sets that had been supplied under Lend-Lease during World War II. Although the SCR-584 (Signal Corps Radio) target-tracking radar could track targets up to 90,000 feet, its high power consumption burned out a key component quickly, so this radar was normally not turned on until an early warning radar had detected a target. The SCR-270 early warning radar could be left on for much longer periods and had a greater horizontal range (approximately 120 miles) but was limited by the curvature of the earth to a maximum altitude of 40,000 feet. As a result, Leghorn, Kiefer, and Wienberg believed that an aircraft that could ascend to 65,000 feet before entering an area being swept by the early warning radar would go undetected, because the target-tracking radars would not be activated. The problem with this assumption was that the Soviet Union, unlike Britain and the United States, had continued to improve radar technology after the end of World War II.",

    "text": "After evidence of improved Soviet radar capabilities became available, many advocates of high-altitude overflight continued to believe that aircraft flying above 65,000 feet were safe from detection by Soviet radars. With interest in high-altitude reconnaissance growing, several Air Force agencies began to develop an aircraft to conduct such missions. In September 1952, the Air Research and Development Command gave the Martin Aircraft Company a contract to examine the high-altitude potential of the B-57 by modifying a single aircraft to give it long, high-lift wings and the American version of the new Rolls-Royce Avon-109 engine. These were the modifications that Richard Leghorn had suggested during the previous year. At about the same time, another Air Force office, the Wright Air Development Command (WADC) in Dayton, Ohio, was also examining ways to achieve sustained flight at high altitudes. Working with two German aeronautical experts—Woldemar Voigt and Richard Vogt—who had come to the United States after World War II, Air Force Maj. John Seaberg advocated the development of a new aircraft that would combine the high-altitude performance of the latest turbojet engines with high-efficiency wings in order to reach ultrahigh altitudes. Seaberg, an aeronautical engineer for the Chance Vought Corporation until his recall to active duty during the Korean war, was serving as assistant chief of the New Developments Office of WADC’s Bombardment Branch. By March 1953, Seaberg had expanded his ideas for a high-altitude aircraft into a complete request for proposal for “an aircraft weapon system having an operational radius of 1,500 nm [nautical miles] and capable of conducting pre- and post-strike reconnaissance missions during daylight, good visibility conditions.” The requirement stated that such an aircraft must have an optimum subsonic cruise speed at altitudes of 70,000 feet or higher over the target, carry a payload of 100 to 100 pounds of reconnaissance equipment, and have a crew of one. The Wright Air Development Command decided not to seek proposals from major airframe manufacturers on the grounds that a smaller company would give the new project a higher priority and produce a better aircraft more quickly. In July 1953, the Bell Aircraft Corporation of Buffalo, New York, and the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation of Hagerstown, Maryland, received study contracts to develop an entirely new high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore was asked to examine the possibility of improving the already exceptional high-altitude performance of the B-57 Canberra. By January 1954 all three firms had submitted their proposals. Fairchild’s entry was a single-engine plane known as M-195, which had a maximum altitude potential of 67,200 feet; Bell’s was a twin-engine craft called the Model 67 (later the X-16), which had a maximum altitude of 69,500 feet; and Martin’s design was a big-wing version of the B-57 called the Model 294, which was to cruise at 64,000 feet. In March 1954, Seaberg and other engineers at Wright Field, having evaluated the three contending designs, recommended the adoption of both the Martin and Bell proposals. They considered Martin’s version of the B-57 an interim project that could be completed and deployed rapidly while the more advanced concept from Bell was still being developed. Air Force headquarters soon approved Martin’s proposal to modify the B-57 and was very much interested in the Bell design.",

    "text": "But word of the competition for a new reconnaissance airplane had reached another aircraft manufacturer, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, which submitted an unsolicited design. Lockheed had first become aware of the reconnaissance aircraft competition in the fall of 1953. John H. (Jack) Carter, who had recently retired from the Air Force to become the assistant director of Lockheed’s Advanced Development Program, was in the Pentagon on business and dropped in to see Eugene P. Kiefer, an old friend and colleague from the Air Force’s Office of Development Planning (more commonly known as AFDAP from its Air Force office symbol). Kiefer told Carter about the competition for a high-flying aircraft and expressed the opinion that the Air Force was going about the search in the wrong way by requiring the new aircraft to be suitable for both strategic and tactical reconnaissance. Immediately after returning to California, Carter proposed to Lockheed Vice President L. Eugene Root (previously the top civilian official in the Air Force’s Office of Development Planning) that Lockheed also submit a design. Carter noted that the proposed aircraft would have to reach altitudes of between 65,000 and 70,000 feet and correctly forecast, “If extreme altitude performance can be realized in a practical aircraft at speeds in the vicinity of Mach 0.8, it should be capable of avoiding virtually all Russian defenses until about 1960.” Carter added, “To achieve these characteristics in an aircraft which will have a reasonably useful operational life during the period before 1960 will, of course, require very strenuous efforts and extraordinary procedures, as well as nonstandard design philosophy.” Some of the “nonstandard” design characteristics suggested by Carter were the elimination of landing gear, the disregard of military specifications, and the use of very low load factors. Carter’s memorandum closed with a warning that time was of the essence: “In order that this special aircraft can have a reasonably long and useful life, it is obvious that its development must be greatly accelerated beyond that considered normal.” Lockheed’s senior officials approved Carter’s proposal, and early in 1954 the corporation’s best aircraft designer—Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson—began working on the project, then known as the CL-282 but later to become famous under its Air Force designator—the U-2. Already one of the world’s leading aeronautical engineers, Kelly Johnson had many successful military and civilian designs to his credit, including the P-38, P-80, F-104, and Constellation. Johnson quickly came up with a radical design based upon the fuselage of the F-104 jet fighter but incorporating a high-aspect-ratio sailplane wing. To save weight and thereby increase the aircraft’s altitude, Johnson decided to stress the airframe to only 2.5 units of gravity (g’s) instead of the military specification strength of 5.33 g’s. For the power plant he selected the General Electric J73/GE-3 nonafterburning turbojet engine with 9,300 pounds of thrust (this was the same engine he had chosen for the F-104, which had been the basis for the U-2 design). Many of the CL-282’s design features were adapted from gliders. Thus, the wings and tail were detachable. Instead of a conventional landing gear, Johnson proposed using two skis and a reinforced belly rib for landing—a common sailplane technique—and a jettisonable wheeled dolly for takeoff. Other features included an unpressurized cockpit and a 15-cubic-foot payload area that could accommodate 600 pounds of sensors. The CL-282’s maximum altitude would be just over 70,000 feet with a 2,000-mile range. Essentially, Kelly Johnson had designed a jet-propelled glider.",

    "text": "Early in March 1954, Kelly Johnson submitted the CL-282 design to Brig. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever’s Office of Development Planning. Eugene Kiefer and Bud Wienberg studied the design and recommended it to General Schriever, who then asked Lockheed to submit a specific proposal. In early April, Kelly Johnson presented a full description of the CL-282 and a proposal for the construction and maintenance of 30 aircraft to a group of senior Pentagon officials that included Schriever’s superior, Lt. Gen. Donald L. Putt, Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, and Trevor N. Gardner, Special Assistant for Research and Development to the Secretary of the Air Force. Afterward Kelly Johnson noted that the civilian officials were very much interested in his design but the generals were not. The CL-282 design was also presented to the commander of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, in early April by Eugene Kiefer, Bud Wienberg, and Burton Klein from the Office of Development Planning. According to Wienberg, General LeMay stood up halfway through the briefing, took his cigar out of his mouth, and told the briefers that, if he wanted high-altitude photographs, he would put cameras in his B-36 bombers and added that he was not interested in a plane that had no wheels or guns. The general then left the room, remarking that the whole business was a waste of his time. Meanwhile, the CL-282 design proceeded through the Air Force development channels and reached Major Seaberg at the Wright Air Development Command in mid-May. Seaberg and his colleagues carefully evaluated the Lockheed submission and finally rejected it in early June. One of their main reasons for doing so was Kelly Johnson’s choice of the unproven General Electric J73 engine. The engineers at Wright Field considered the Pratt & Whitney J57 to be the most powerful engine available, and the designs from Fairchild, Martin, and Bell all incorporated this engine. The absence of conventional landing gear was also a perceived shortcoming of the Lockheed design. Another factor in the rejection of Kelly Johnson’s submission was the Air Force preference for multiengine aircraft. Air Force reconnaissance experts had gained their practical experience during World War II in multiengine bombers. In addition, aerial photography experts in the late 1940s and early 1950s emphasized focal length as the primary factor in reconnaissance photography and, therefore, preferred large aircraft capable of accommodating long focal-length cameras. This preference reached an extreme in the early",

    "text": "In the 1950s, the development of the cumbersome 240-inch Boston camera necessitated modifications to the YC-97 Boeing Stratocruiser that carried it.  Many Air Force officers favored two-engine aircraft for reliability, despite aviation records showing single-engine aircraft as more dependable. On June 7, 1954, the Air Force rejected the single-engine CL-282 proposal due to its unusual design and commitment to the Martin B-57 modification and Bell X-16. Despite this rejection, Lockheed continued development and sought new support for the CL-282.\n\nWhile the Air Force favored the Bell and Martin aircraft, some high-level civilian officials, including Trevor Gardner, Special Assistant for Research and Development to Air Force Secretary Harold E. Talbott, supported the Lockheed design. Gardner, with connections in west coast aeronautical circles, believed the CL-282 held promise for reconnaissance over the Soviet Union. His special assistant, Frederick Ayer, Jr., and Garrison Norton, an advisor to Secretary Talbott, shared this belief. Gardner attempted to interest SAC commander LeMay, but LeMay was uninterested in an unarmed aircraft.  Gardner, Ayer, and Norton then sought CIA support.  At the time, CIA involvement in overhead reconnaissance was limited to advising the Air Force on balloon reconnaissance. Philip G. Strong, Chief of the Operations Staff in the Office of Scientific Intelligence, served on Air Force advisory boards and stayed informed on reconnaissance aircraft developments.\n\nOn May 12, 1954, Gardner, Norton, and Ayer met with Strong, presenting the CL-282 proposal. Strong's subsequent summary overestimated Air Force support for the Lockheed design, which was being overlooked in favor of the modified Martin B-57 and Bell X-16. The group emphasized the CL-282's higher altitude capabilities and smaller radar cross-section, potentially making it invisible to Soviet radars. They inquired about CIA interest, and Strong agreed to discuss it with Richard M. Bissell, Jr., the DCI's Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination.",

    "text": "In 1951, the Air Force sought further scientific assistance due to the Strategic Air Command's (SAC) inability to fulfill requests for information on targets behind the Iron Curtain.  To explore new reconnaissance methods against the Soviet Bloc, Major General Gordon P. Saville, the Air Force's Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, added 15 reconnaissance experts to Project LINCOLN, an existing air defense project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). By the end of the year, these experts, headquartered over a secretarial school on Beacon Hill (which became the project's codename), formed the BEACON HILL Study Group.\n\nThe group, chaired by Kodak physicist Carl F. P. Overhage, included experts from academia, media, and industry, such as James G. Baker and Edward M. Purcell (Harvard), Saville Davis (Christian Science Monitor), Allen F. Donovan (Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory), Peter C. Goldmark (Columbia Broadcasting System Laboratories), Edwin H. Land (Polaroid Corporation), Stewart E. Miller (Bell Laboratories), Richard S. Perkin (Perkin-Elmer Company), and Louis N. Ridenour (Ridenour Associates, Inc.).  Lieutenant Colonel Richard Leghorn served as liaison officer from the Wright Air Development Command.\n\nThroughout January and February 1952, the group visited airbases, laboratories, and companies to receive briefings on the latest technology and projects, focusing on new aerial reconnaissance approaches, including high-altitude photography and camera-carrying balloons.  One unusual proposal involved an “invisible” dirigible – a large, flat airship with a blue-tinted, nonreflective coating designed to cruise at 90,000 feet along the Soviet border, slowly photographing targets.\n\nAfter the briefings, the group spent three months at MIT compiling a classified report detailing recommendations for improving intelligence gathering on the Soviet Bloc.  Published on 15 June 1952, the BEACON HILL Report advocated radical new approaches.  Its 14 chapters covered radar, radio, and photographic surveillance; explored passive infrared and microwave reconnaissance; and discussed the development of advanced reconnaissance vehicles.  Crucially, the report recommended developing high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft to address the critical need for better intelligence on a potentially hostile nation.",

    "text": "The Air Force's implementation of the BEACON HILL Report's recommendations began in the summer of 1953, fueled by President Eisenhower's concerns about the quality of intelligence estimates on Soviet capabilities and the lack of reconnaissance over the Soviet Bloc. The Soviet Union was perceived as a growing threat, particularly with its advances in nuclear weapons. Their detonation of an atomic bomb years ahead of US predictions, followed by a hydrogen bomb test in August 1953 using more advanced technology than the US, alarmed Western leaders.  Combined with the Soviet suppression of the East Berlin uprising and their divisive tactics at the United Nations, these developments painted a picture of an aggressive and dangerous opponent.  Concerns escalated further with a RAND study highlighting the vulnerability of SAC bases to a surprise attack by Soviet long-range bombers.  The sighting of a new Soviet intercontinental jet bomber, the Myasishchev-4 (NATO designation: Bison), amplified these fears.  This bomber, a native Soviet design unlike previous derivative models, surprised US intelligence and, along with the existing Soviet bomber fleet, appeared to pose a significant threat to the US.\n\nPrior to the Bison's public appearance, the Air Force, anticipating the need for improved reconnaissance capabilities, established the Intelligence Systems Panel (ISP) in July 1953. This panel included BEACON HILL Study Group experts like Overhage, Donovan, and Miller. The CIA also participated, represented by Edward L. Allen (Office of Research and Reports) and Philip Strong (Office of Scientific Intelligence). The panel was chaired by Dr. James G. Baker, a research associate at the Harvard College Observatory with extensive experience in aerial reconnaissance and lens design. Baker had been involved in advising the Army Air Corps on optical improvements and had established the Harvard University Optical Research Laboratory, which later moved to Boston University as the Boston University Optical Research Laboratory (BUORL). Baker continued his lens design work for photoreconnaissance even after the lab's move. The ISP's first meeting, held at Boston University on 3 August 1953, began with Philip Strong's briefing on the limited US intelligence on the Soviet Union, setting the stage for the panel's work.",

    "text": "The interior was photographed by the German Luftwaffe during World War II. Since the German photography covered only the Soviet Union west of the Urals, primarily west of the Volga River, many vital regions were not included. The ISP would, therefore, have to look for ways to provide up-to-date photography of all of the Soviet Union. Several Air Force agencies then briefed the panel members on the latest developments and proposed future projects in aerial reconnaissance, including new cameras, reconnaissance balloons, and even satellites. Among the Air Force reconnaissance projects discussed were multiple sensors for use in existing aircraft such as the RB-47, RB-52, and RB-58; Project FICON—an acronym for “fighter conversion”—for adapting a giant, 10-engine B-36 bomber to enable it to launch and retrieve a Republic RF-84F Thunderflash reconnaissance aircraft; reconnaissance versions of the Navajo and Snark missiles; the high-altitude balloon program, which would be ready to go into operation by the summer of 1955; and the search for a new high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nThe wide variety of programs discussed at the conference were all products of the Air Force’s all-out effort to find a way to collect intelligence on the Communist Bloc. Some of the schemes went beyond the existing level of technology; others, like the camera-carrying balloons, were technically feasible but involved dangerous political consequences.\n\nThe British were also working on high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. In 1952 the Royal Air Force (RAF) began Project ROBIN, which was designed to modify the Canberra bomber for high-altitude reconnaissance.  The RAF equipped the new Canberra PR7 with Rolls-Royce Avon-109 engines and gave it long, fuel-filled wings. The range of this variant of the Canberra was now 4,300 miles, and, on 29 August 1955, it achieved an altitude of 65,880 feet. Sometime during the first half of 1953, the RAF employed a high-altitude Canberra on a daring overflight of the Soviet Union to photograph the missile test range at Kapustin Yar. Because of advanced warning, the overflight did not catch the Soviet Union by surprise. Soviet fighters damaged and nearly shot down the Canberra. Rumors about this flight reached Washington during the summer of 1953, but official confirmation by the United Kingdom did not come until February 1954.\n\nBaker also chaired the next meeting of the Air Force’s Intelligence Systems Panel in late April 1954 but could not tell its members about the British overflight of Kapustin Yar because they were not cleared for this information. The panel did, however, discuss the modifications for high-altitude flight being made to the US Canberra, the B-57.\n\nThe next Intelligence Systems Panel meeting took place on 24 and 25 May at Boston University and the Polaroid Corporation. Panel member Allen F. Donovan from the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory evaluated the changes being made to the B-57 by the Martin Aircraft Company. Even without Martin’s specifications or drawings, Donovan had been able to estimate what could be done to the B-57 by lengthening the wings and lightening the fuselage. He had determined that alterations to the B-57 airframe would not solve the reconnaissance needs expressed in the BEACON HILL Report.  To be safe, Donovan explained, penetrating aircraft would need to fly above 70,000 feet for the entire mission. Development of such an aircraft was already under way, Donovan continued, for Philip Strong of the CIA had told him that the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation had designed a lightweight, high-flying aircraft.",

    "text": "ISP chairman Baker then urged Donovan to travel to southern California to evaluate the Lockheed design and gather ideas on high-altitude aircraft from other aircraft manufacturers. When he was finally able to make this trip in late summer, Donovan found the plane that he and the other ISP members had been seeking. On the afternoon of 2 August 1954, Donovan met with L. Eugene Root, a Lockheed vice-president, and learned about the Air Force’s competition for a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. Kelly Johnson then showed Donovan the plans for Lockheed’s unsuccessful entry: the CL-282 design. Donovan immediately recognized that the CL-282 design was essentially a jet-propelled glider capable of attaining the altitudes that he felt were necessary to carry out reconnaissance of the Soviet Union successfully.\n\nUpon his return east on 8 August, Donovan got in touch with James Baker and suggested an urgent meeting of the Intelligence Systems Panel. Because of other commitments by the members, however, the panel did not meet to hear Donovan’s report until 24 September 1954 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. Several members, including Land and Strong, were absent. Those who did attend were upset to learn that the Air Force had funded a closed competition for a tactical reconnaissance plane without informing them. But once Donovan began describing Kelly Johnson’s projected design for a jet-powered glider, they quickly forgot their annoyance and listened intently. Donovan began by stressing that high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft had to fly above 70,000 feet to be safe from interception. Next, he set out what he considered to be the three essential requirements for a high-altitude spyplane: a single engine, a sailplane wing, and low structural load factors. Donovan strongly favored single-engine aircraft because they are both lighter and more reliable than multiengine aircraft. The second of Donovan’s essential factors, a sailplane wing (in technical terms a high-aspect-ratio, low-induced-drag wing), was needed to take maximum advantage of the reduced thrust of a jet engine operating in the rarefied atmosphere of extreme altitude. Finally, low structural load factors, like those used by transport aircraft, were necessary to reduce weight and thereby achieve maximum altitude.  The only plane meeting these requirements, Donovan insisted, was Kelly Johnson’s CL-282 because it was essentially a sailplane. In Donovan’s view, the CL-282 did not have to meet the specifications of a combat aircraft because it could fly safely above Soviet fighters.",

Stressing the high priority he gave to reducing the risk of military surprise, the President asked the committee to advise him on this problem.\" The President's request led Chairman DuBridge to ask one of the most prominent members, MIT President James R. Killian, Jr., to meet with other Science Advisory Committee members in the Boston area to discuss the feasibility of a comprehensive scientific assessment of the nation's defenses. At their meeting at MIT on 15 April 1954, the group called for the recruitment of such a task force if the President endorsed the concept. On 26 July 1954, President Eisenhower authorized Killian to recruit and lead a panel of experts to study \"the country's technological capabilities to meet some of its current problems.\" Killian quickly set up shop in offices located in the Old Executive Office Building and organized 42 of the nation's leading scientists into three special project groups investigating US offensive, defensive, and intelligence capabilities, with an additional communications working group (see chart, page 28). The Technological Capabilities Panel (TCP) groups began meeting on 13 September 1954. For the next 20 weeks, the members of the various panels met on 307 separate occasions for briefings, field trips, conferences, and meetings with every major unit of the US defense and intelligence establishments. After receiving the most up-to-date information available on the nation's defense and intelligence programs, the panel members began drafting their report to the National Security Council.\"\n\nProject Three Support for the Lockheed CL-282\n\nEven before the final Technological Capabilities Panel report was ready, one of the three working groups took actions that would have a major impact on the US reconnaissance program. Project Three had the task of investigating the nation's intelligence capabilities. Its chairman was Edwin H. (Din) Land, the inventor of the polarizing filter and the instant camera. When James Killian asked Land to head Project Three, Land had to make a major decision about his career. At the time, the 45-year-old millionaire was on a leave of absence from Polaroid and was living in Hollywood, advising Alfred Hitchcock on the technological aspects of making three-dimensional movies. Land decided to give up his interest in cinema's third dimension and return east to Polaroid and the panel appointment.",

The Project Three committee consisted of Land; James Baker and Edward Purcell of Harvard; chemist Joseph W. Kennedy of Washington University, St. Louis; mathematician John W. Tukey of Princeton University and Bell Telephone Laboratories; and Allen Latham, Jr., of Arthur D. Little, Inc., an engineer and former treasurer of the Polaroid Corporation.\"\n\nIn mid-August 1954, Land and Baker went to Washington to arrange for the various intelligence organizations to brief the Project Three study group. As the briefings progressed, the panel members became more and more distressed at the poor state of the nation's intelligence resources. Land later noted, \"We would go in and interview generals and admirals in charge of intelligence and come away worried. Here we were, five or six young men, asking questions that these high-ranking officers couldn't answer.\" Land added that the Project Three members were also not overly impressed with the Central Intelligence Agency.\"\n\nLand learned the details of Lockheed's proposed CL-282 aircraft soon after he arrived in Washington. Philip Strong showed him Kelly Johnson's conceptual drawing of the plane and told him that the Air Force had rejected it. Although Land had heard Allen Donovan briefly mention a Lockheed design for a high-flying aircraft at the 24-25 May meeting of Baker's Intelligence Systems Panel, he did not realize that that plan, and the one in Strong's drawing were the same. As soon as Land saw Strong's copy of the CL-282 drawing, however, he telephoned Baker to say, \"Jim, I think I have the plane you are after.\"",

    "text": "A few days later, when Land showed Kelly Johnson's conceptual drawing to Baker and the other Project Three members, they all became enthusiastic about the aircraft's possibilities. Although Baker had heard Allen Donovan's brief mention of the Lockheed design in May, he had not yet seen a drawing of the aircraft because Donovan did not report to the ISP on his early-August trip to Lockheed until 24 September. After seeing the CL-282 drawing, Baker began designing a camera and lens system that would fit in the Lockheed craft.\"\n\nAt the end of August, Land discussed the CL-282 with Allen Dulles's Special Assistant for Planning and Coordination, Richard Bissell, who came away from the meeting without any definite ideas as to what Land wanted to do with the aircraft. Overhead reconnaissance was not uppermost in Bissell's mind at the time, and it was unclear to him why he had even been contacted.\" Bissell's outstanding academic credentials, his acquaintanceship with James Killian through his previous teaching experience at MIT, and his direct access to DC! Dulles may have led the Technological Capabilities Panel members to consider him the best CIA point of contact. Although surprised that he had become involved in the CL-282 project, Bissell's interest was piqued, and he set out to learn what he could about reconnaissance systems. In early September 1954, Bissell had Douglas E. Ashford, a young Air Force officer on his staff, put together a general status report on air reconnaissance programs. Bissell forwarded the 16-page study to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI), LL. Gen. Charles PeruTe Cabell, USAF, on 24 September. In a covering memorandum, Bissell called Cabell's attention to a section of the report about a \"stripped or specialized aircraft\" called the Lockheed CL-282.\"\n\nBy September 1954, Land's Project Three study group had become very much interested in the Lockheed CL-282 design. Their interest grew even stronger when James Baker told them of Allen Donovan's strong case for the CL-282 at the 24-25 September meeting of the ISP. It is not possible to determine exactly when the Land committee decided to back the CL-282; in fact, there may never have been a formal decision as such. In view of Land's impulsive nature, he probably seized upon the CL-282 design as being a workable concept and immediately began developing it into a complete reconnaissance system. During September and October the Project Three study group met frequently to discuss the Lockheed design and the reconnaissance equipment it would carry. Meetings were small, generally with fewer than 10 participants; Garrison Norton was often the only government official in attendance. At times outside experts joined in the proceedings. When the discussion turned to cameras and film, Land invited Dr. Henry Yutzy, Eastman Kodak's film expert, and Richard S. Perkin, President of the Perkin-Elmer Company, to participate. For discussions on the 157 engine, the panel members asked Perry W. Pratt, Pratt and Whitney's chief engineer, to attend. Kelly Johnson also met with the panel to review plans for the CL-282 system.\"\n\nBy the end of October, the Project Three meetings had covered every aspect of the Lockheed design. The CL-282 was to be more than an airplane with a camera, it was to be an integrated intelligence-collection system that the Project Three members were confident could find and photograph the Soviet Union's Bison bomber fleet and, thus, resolve the growing \"bomber gap\" controversy. It was not just the Lockheed aircraft that had captured the Land group's fancy; the plane was seen as the platform for a whole new generation of aerial cameras that several committee members had been discussing since the BEACON HILL and Intelligence Systems Panel meetings.

Bissell subsequently secured funding from the CIA's Contingency Reserve Fund after obtaining approval from the President and the Director of the Budget. The project, codenamed AQUATONE, began with a small staff under Bissell's Office of the Special Assistant to the DCI, later expanding to include administrative, financial, logistic, communications, and security personnel.

In December 1954, Eisenhower authorized $35 million for the U-2 (Project GARFISH).  Lockheed proposed performance specifications instead of rigid Air Force technical specifications.  Initial proposals were adjusted down to $22.5 million for airframes, with the remaining funds allocated for cameras and life support.

    "text": "Developed at Lockheed's Skunk Works, the U-2 (nicknamed \"Angel\") benefited from a streamlined development process.  Engineers and draftsmen worked in close proximity to the assembly line, facilitating rapid problem-solving and design modifications.  Johnson's early report outlined key specifications: 2.5g load factor, Mach 0.8 speed, 70,600-73,100 feet altitude, and specific takeoff, landing, and glide capabilities.  Equipment combinations were carefully managed to stay within the 450-pound weight limit.  Two major design challenges were fuel capacity for intercontinental range and minimizing weight for high-altitude flight.  The U-2's unique construction included a sailplane-inspired tail assembly attached with tension bolts and similarly attached wing panels. This allowed for optimal camera placement and center of gravity.  The long, narrow, thin wings, acting as integral fuel tanks, were a unique feature.  A gust control mechanism, adapted from sailplanes, protected the fragile wings and tail at lower altitudes.  The bicycle-type landing gear, weighing only 208 pounds, was another innovative element.  Detachable pogos aided takeoff and were recovered for reuse.  Landing involved the main gear and a gradual tilt onto wingtip skids.",

Existing cameras lacked the resolution and size requirements for high-altitude reconnaissance.  World War II-era cameras like the K-19, K-21, and trimetrogon K-17 system, while adequate for lower altitudes and tasks like bomb damage assessment and mapping, offered insufficient resolution (20-25 feet) for intelligence gathering at the U-2's operational altitude.  A resolution of less than 10 feet was required for detailed target identification, demanding a camera four times more powerful than those available.  This necessitated the development of a new camera system capable of capturing high-resolution images from extreme altitudes.",

    "text": "strip by a salt flat known as Groom Lake, near the northeast corner of the Atomic Energy Commission's '(AEC) Nevada Proving Ground. After debating about landing on the old airstrip, Le Vier set the plane down on the lakebed, and all four walked over to examine the strip. The facility had been used during World War II as an aerial gunnery range for Army Air Corps pilots. From the air the strip appeared to be paved, but on closer inspection it turned out to have originally been fashioned from compacted earth that had turned into ankle-deep dust after more than a decade of disuse. If LeVier had attempted to land on the airstrip, the plane would probably have nosed over when the wheels sank into the loose soil, killing or injuring all of the key figures in the U-2 project.\nBissell and his colleagues all agreed that Groom Lake would make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and training its pilots. Upon returning to Washington, Bissell discovered that Groom Lake was not part of the AEC proving ground. After consulting with Dulles, Bissell and Miller asked the Atomic Energy Commission to add the Groom Lake area to its real estate holdings in Nevada. AEC Chairman Adm. Lewis Strauss readily agreed, and President Eisenhower also approved the addition of this strip of wasteland, known by its map designation as Area 51, to the Nevada Test Site. The outlines of Area 51 are shown on current unclassified maps as a small rectangular area adjoining the northeast corner of the much larger Nevada Test Site. To make the new facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers, Kelly Johnson called it the Paradise Ranch, which was soon shortened to the Ranch. Although the dry lakebed could have served as a landing strip, project managers decided that a paved runway was needed so that testing could also take place during the times when rainwater runoff from nearby mountains filled the lake (at such times the base acquired yet another unofficial name, Watertown Strip). By July 1955 the base was ready, and Agency, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began moving in.",

    "text": "On 29 April 1955, Richard Bissell signed an agreement with the Air Force and the Navy (which at that time was also interested in the U-2) in which the services agreed that the CIA \"assumed primary responsibility for all security\" for the overhead reconnaissance project (AQUATONE). From this time on, the CIA has been responsible for the security of overhead programs. This responsibility has placed a heavy burden on the Office of Security for establishing procedures to keep large numbers of contracts untraceable to the Central Intelligence Agency. The Office of Security has also had to determine which contractor employees require security clearances and has had to devise physical security measures for the various manufacturing facilities. Keeping the U-2 and subsequent overhead systems secret has been a time-consuming and costly undertaking. The most important aspect of the security program for the U-2 project was the creation of an entire new compartmented system for the product of U-2 missions. Access to the photographs taken by the U-2 would be strictly controlled, which often limited the ability of CIA analysts to use the products of U-2 missions. The terminology used to describe U-2 aircraft and pilots also played a part in maintaining the security of the overhead reconnaissance program. To reduce the chances of a security breach, the Agency always referred to its high-altitude aircraft as “articles,” with each aircraft having its own “article number.” Similarly, the pilots were always called “drivers.” In cable traffic the aircraft were known as KWEXTRA-00 (the two-digit number identified the precise aircraft; these numbers were not related to the three-digit article numbers assigned by the factory). The pilots were referred to as KWGLITTER-00 (the two-digit number identified the precise pilot). Thus, even if a message or document about overflight activities fell into unfriendly hands, the contents would simply refer to codewords or at worst to “articles” and “drivers,” giving no indication of the nature of the program. Even the aircraft’s onboard equipment required the involvement of CIA security planners. Thus, when Kelly Johnson ordered altimeters from the Kollman Instrument Company, he specified that the devices had to be calibrated to 80,000 feet. This immediately raised eyebrows at Kollman because its instruments only went to 45,000 feet. Agency security personnel quickly briefed several Kollman officials and produced a cover story that the altimeters were to be used on experimental rocket planes.",

    "text": "At the initial interagency meetings to establish the U-2 program in December 1954, the participants did not work out a clear delineation of responsibilities between the CIA and the Air Force. They agreed only that the Air Force would supply the engines and the Agency would pay for the airframes and cameras. With a myriad of details still unsettled, CIA and Air Force representatives began to work on an interagency agreement that would assign specific responsibilities for the program. These negotiations proved difficult. Discussions on this subject between DCI Allen Dulles and Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining began in March 1955. Twining wanted SAC, headed by Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, to run the project once the planes and pilots were ready to fly, but Dulles opposed such an arrangement. The CIA-USAF talks dragged on for several months, with Twining determined that SAC should have full control once the aircraft was deployed. Eventually President Eisenhower settled the dispute. \"I want this whole thing to be a civilian operation,\" the President wrote. \"If uniformed personnel of the armed services of the United States fly over Russia, it is an act of war—legally—and I don't want any part of it.\" With the issue of control over the program settled, the two agencies soon worked out the remaining details. On 3 August 1955, Dulles and Twining met at SAC headquarters in Omaha to sign the basic agreement, titled \"Organization and Delineation of Responsibilities—Project OILSTONE\" (OILSTONE was the Air Force codename for the project). This pact gave the Air Force responsibility for pilot selection and training, weather information, mission plotting, and operational support. The Agency was responsible for cameras, security, contracting, film processing, and arrangements for foreign bases, and it also had a voice in the selection of pilots. All aeronautical aspects of the project—the construction and testing of the aircraft—remained the exclusive province of Lockheed. As a result of this agreement, CIA remained in control of the program, but the Air Force played a very important role as well. As Richard Bissell later remarked about the U-2 project, \"The Air Force wasn't just in on this as a supporting element, and to a major degree it wasn't in on it just supplying about half the government personnel; but the Air Force held, if you want to be precise, 49 percent of the common stock.\" One of the first Air Force officers assigned to Project OILSTONE was Col. Osmund I. Ritland. He began coordinating Air Force activities in the U-2 program with Richard Bissell in December 1954. On 27 June 1955, Ritland became Bissell's deputy, although Air Force Chief of Staff Twining did not officially approve this assignment until 4 August, the day after the signing of the CIA-Air Force agreement. In March 1956, Colonel Ritland returned to the Air Force and was followed as deputy project director by Col. Jack A. Gibbs. Another Air Force officer, Lt. Col. Leo P. Geary, joined the program in June 1955 and remained with it until August 1966, longer than any of the other project managers. Using the Air Force Inspector General's office as cover with the title of Project Officer, AFCIG-5, Geary served as the focal point for all Defense Department support to the U-2 and OXCART programs. His 11 years with the overhead reconnaissance projects provided a high degree of Air Force continuity.",

Among these problems was the need for a fuel that would not boil off and evaporate at the very high altitudes for which the aircraft was designed. Gen. James H. Doolittle (USAF, Ret.), a vice president of the Shell Oil Company who had long been involved in overhead reconnaissance (most recently as a member of the Technological Capabilities Panel), arranged for Shell to develop a special low-volatility, low-vapor-pressure kerosene fuel for the craft. The result was a dense mixture, known as LF-1A, JP-TS (thermally stable), or JP-7, with a boiling point of 300°F at sea level. Manufacturing this special fuel required petroleum byproducts that Shell normally used to make its \"Flit\" fly and bug spray. In order to produce several hundred thousand gallons of LF-1A for the U-2 program, Shell had to reduce its output of insecticide.",

    "text": "Even more important than the problem of boiling fuel was the problem of boiling blood, namely the pilot's. At altitudes above 65,000 feet, fluids in the human body will vaporize unless the body can be kept under pressure. Furthermore, the reduced atmospheric pressure placed considerable stress on the pilot's cardiovascular system and did not provide adequate oxygenation of the blood. Keeping the pilot alive at the extreme altitudes required for overflights therefore called for a totally different approach to environmental equipment; it required a system that could maintain pressure over much of the pilot's body. The technology that enabled U-2 pilots to operate for extended periods in reduced atmospheric pressure would later play a major role in the manned space program.\n\nAdvising the Agency on high-altitude survival were two highly experienced Air Force doctors, Col. Donald D. Flickinger and Col. W. Randolph Lovelace, II. Dr. Lovelace had begun his research on high-altitude flight before World War II and was a coinventor of the standard Air Force oxygen mask. In the early 1950s, he and Flickinger made daring parachute jumps from B-47 bombers to test pilot-survival gear under extreme conditions. Flickinger served as the medical adviser to Project AQUATONE for almost a decade.\nFlickinger and Lovelace suggested that the Agency ask the David Clark Company of Worcester, Massachusetts, manufacturer of environmental suits for Air Force pilots, to submit designs for more advanced gear for the U-2 pilots. David Clark expert Joseph Ruseckas then developed a complex life-support system, which was the first partially pressurized \"spacesuit\" for keeping humans alive for lengthy periods at ultrahigh altitudes. The effort to provide a safe environment for pilots at high altitudes also involved the Firewel Company of Buffalo, New York, which pressurized the U-2 cockpit to create an interior environment equivalent to the air pressure at an altitude of 28,000 feet. The system was designed so that, if the interior cockpit pressure fell below the 28,000-feet level, the pilot's suit would automatically inflate. In either case, he could obtain oxygen only through his helmet.",

To prevent loss of pressure, the heavy coverall had to fit tightly at the wrists and ankles (in the early models of these suits, the feet were not included in the pressurization scheme). The pilot had to wear gloves and a heavy helmet that tended to chafe his neck and shoulders and was prone to fogging. Problems with the pilot life-support system were believed to have been the cause of several early crashes of the U-2.\n\nHaving gotten a pilot into this bulky suit and shoehorned him into his seat in the cockpit, the next problem was how to get him out in an emergency. The U-2 cockpit was very small, and the early models did not have an ejection seat. Even after an ejection seat was installed, pilots were reluctant to use it because they were afraid they would lose their legs below the knees when they were blown out of the cockpit. To save weight, the first pilot's seat was extremely simple with no height adjustment mechanism. Designed for pilots of above-average height, the seat could be adjusted for shorter pilots by inserting wooden blocks beneath the seat to raise it. In later versions of the aircraft, Kelly Johnson added a fully adjustable seat.",

    "text": "The Air Force undertook bailout experiments at high altitudes from balloons in the autumn of 1955 to determine if the suit designed for the U-2 pilot would also protect him during his parachute descent once he was separated from the life-support mechanisms inside the aircraft. To avoid getting the \"bends\" during such descents or during the long flights, pilots had to don their pressure suits and begin breathing oxygen at least 90 minutes before takeoff so that their bodies would have time to dissipate nitrogen. This procedure was known as prebreathing. Once the pilots were in their suits, eating and drinking became a major problem, as did urination. The first model of the pressure suit, used by Lockheed test pilots, made no provision for urination. A subsequent model required the pilot to be catheterized before donning his flying suit. This method of permitting urination during flight proved very uncomfortable and, by the autumn of 1955, was replaced with an external bladder arrangement that made the catheter unnecessary. To reduce elimination, pilots ate a low-bulk, high-protein diet on the day before and the morning of each mission. To prevent pilots from becoming dessicated during the long missions—a condition aggravated by their having to breathe pure oxygen—provision was made for them to drink sweetened water. This was accomplished by providing a small self-sealing hole in the face mask through which the pilot could push a strawlike tube attached to the water supply. Project personnel also pioneered in the development of ready-to-eat foods in squeezable containers. These were primarily bacon- or cheese-flavored mixtures that the pilot could squeeze into his mouth using the self-sealing hole in the face mask. Despite all these precautions, U-2 pilots normally lost 3 to 6 pounds of body weight during an eight-hour mission.",

During the early 1950s, tales of Soviet secret police torture of captured foreign agents led Bissell and Cunningham to approach Dr. Alex Batlin of Technical Services Division in the Directorate of Plans for ideas to help \"captured\" U-2 pilots avoid such suffering. Batlin suggested the method used by Nazi war criminal Hermann Goering, a thin glass ampule containing liquid potassium cyanide. He said a pilot had only to put the ampule in his mouth and bite down on the glass; death would follow in 10 to 15 seconds. Project AQUATONE ordered six of the poison ampules, called L-pills, and offered one to each pilot just before a mission. It was up to each pilot to decide if he wanted to take an L-pill with him. Some did; most did not.\n\nOn 25 July, less than eight months after the go-ahead call from Trevor Gardner, Kelly Johnson was ready to deliver the first aircraft, known as Article 341, to the \"Paradise Ranch\" site. With its long, slender wings and tail assembly removed, the aircraft was wrapped in tarpaulins, loaded aboard a C-124, and flown to Groom Lake, where Lockheed mechanics spent the next six days readying the craft for its maiden flight. Before \"Kelly's Angel\" could actually take to the air, however, it needed an Air Force designator. Col. Allman T. Culbertson from the Air Force's Office of the Director of Research and Development pointed this out to Lieutenant Colonel Geary in July 1955, and the two officers then looked through the aircraft designator handbook to see what the options were. They decided that they could not call the project aircraft a bomber, fighter, or transport plane, and they did not want anyone to know that the new plane was for reconnaissance, so Geary and Culbertson decided that it should come under the utility aircraft category. At the time, there were only two utility aircraft on the books, a U-1 and a U-3. Geary told Culbertson that the Lockheed CL-282 was going to be known officially as the U-2.",

When the U-2 first took to the air, however, these engines were not available because the entire production was needed to power specially configured Canberra RB-57Ds for the Air Force. The first U-2s therefore used P&W J57/P-37 engines, which were 276 pounds heavier and delivered only 10,200 pounds of thrust at sealevel; the resulting power-to-weight ratio of 2.7:1 was almost 20 percent less efficient than the preferred P-31 version.\n\nTo conduct lengthy missions over hostile territory, the U-2 needed to carry a large amount of fuel. Kelly Johnson used a \"wet-wing\" design for the U-2, which meant that fuel was not stored in separate fuel tanks but rather in the wing itself. Each wing was divided into two leak-proof compartments, and fuel was pumped into all the cavities within these areas; only the outer 6 feet of the wings were not used for fuel storage. The U-2 also had a 100-gallon reserve tank in its nose. Later, in 1957, Johnson increased the fuel capacity of the U-2 by adding 100-gallon \"slipper\" tanks under each wing, projecting slightly ahead of the leading edge. One of the most important considerations in the U-2's fuel system was the need to maintain aircraft trim as the fuel was consumed. The aircraft therefore contained a complex system of feed lines and valves draining to a central sump, which made it impossible to provide the pilot with an empty/full type of fuel gauge. None of the first 50 U-2s had normal fuel gauges. Instead there were mechanical fuel totalizer/counters. Before the start of a mission, the ground crew set the counters to indicate the total amount of fuel in the wings, and then a flow meter subtracted the gallons of fuel actually consumed during the flight. The pilot kept a log of the fuel consumption",

    "text": "Preliminary taxi trials began on 27 July 1955, when the first run down the newly completed runway took the plane to 50 knots. Lockheed's chief test pilot, Tony LeVier, was at the controls. A second taxi trial followed on 1 August. LeVier accelerated to 70 knots and began to try the ailerons. \"It was at this point that I became aware of being airborne,\" LeVier noted afterward, \"which left me with utter amazement, as I had no intentions whatsoever of flying. I immediately started back toward the ground, but had difficulty determining my height because the lakebed had no markings to judge distance or height. I made contact with the ground in a left bank of approximately 10 degrees.\" The U-2 bounced back into the air, but LeVier was able to bring it back down for a second landing. He then applied the brakes with little effect, and the aircraft rolled for a long distance before coming to a stop.\n\nBissell, Cunningham, and Johnson saw the aircraft fall and bounce. Leaping into a jeep, they roared off toward the plane. They signaled to LeVier to climb out and then used fire extinguishers to put out a fire in the brakes. At a debriefing session that followed, LeVier complained about the poor performance of the brakes and the absence of markings on the runway. Damage to the prototype U-2 was very minor: blown tires, a leaking oleostrut on the undercarriage, and damaged brakes. This unplanned flight was but a foretaste of the airworthiness of the U-2. New pilots all had difficulty in getting the U-2's wheels on the ground because at low speeds it would remain in ground effect and glide effortlessly above the runway for great distances.\n\nTaxi trials continued for one more day and were followed by the first planned flight on 4 August 1955. LeVier was again at the controls and had been instructed by Kelly Johnson to land the U-2 by making initial contact with the main or forward landing gear and letting the plane settle back on the rear wheel. LeVier had disagreed with this approach, believing that the U-2 would bounce if he tried to touch down on the forward gear first. After flying the aircraft up to 8,000 feet, LeVier leveled off and began cycling the landing gear up and down; then he tested the flaps and the plane's stability and control systems. Finally, LeVier made his first landing approach. As the U-2 settled down, the forward landing gear touched the runway and the plane skipped and bounced into the air. LeVier made a second attempt to land front wheels first, and again the plane bounded into the air.\n\nWith Kelly Johnson watching from a chase plane and giving a constant stream of instructions, LeVier made three more unsuccessful landing attempts. With the light fading and a thunderstorm fast approaching from the mountains to the west, LeVier made one last approach using the method he had advocated: letting the aircraft touch on its rear wheel first. This time the U-2 made a near-perfect landing, which came just in the nick of time. Ten minutes later, the thunderstorm began dumping an unheard-of 2 inches of rain, flooding the dry lakebed and making the airstrip unusable.",

    "text": "High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect—a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs). In the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and military aircraft like the B-47s and B-57s operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet. Consequently, once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet, air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports. Such reports were most prevalent in the early evening hours from pilots of airliners flying from east to west. When the sun dropped below the horizon of an airliner flying at 20,000 feet, the plane was in darkness. But, if a U-2 was airborne in the vicinity of the airliner at the same time, its horizon from an altitude of 60,000 feet was considerably more distant, and, being so high in the sky, its silver wings would catch and reflect the rays of the sun and appear to the airliner pilot, 40,000 feet below, to be fiery objects. Even during daylight hours, the silver bodies of the high-flying U-2s could catch the sun and cause reflections or glints that could be seen at lower altitudes and even on the ground. At this time, no one believed manned flight was possible above 60,000 feet, so no one expected to see an object so high in the sky.\n\nNot only did the airline pilots report their sightings to air-traffic controllers, but they and ground-based observers also wrote letters to the Air Force unit at Wright Air Development Command in Dayton charged with investigating such phenomena. This, in turn, led to the Air Force's Operation BLUE BOOK. Based at Wright-Patterson, the operation collected all reports of UFO sightings. Air Force investigators then attempted to explain such sightings by linking them to natural phenomena. BLUE BOOK investigators regularly called on the Agency's Project Staff in Washington to check reported UFO sightings against U-2 flight logs. This enabled the investigators to eliminate the majority of the UFO reports, although they could not reveal to the letter writers the true cause of the UFO sightings. U-2 and later OXCART flights accounted for more than one-half of all UFO reports during the late 1950s and most of the 1960s.",

    "text": "When it came to a halt. As the pilot climbed from the cockpit in his \"space\" suit, one air policeman remarked that the pilot looked like a man from Mars. The pilot, Jacob Kratt, later reported to Cunningham that, from the beginning of the first flameout until the landing at Albuquerque, the U-2 had covered over 900 miles, including more than 300 by gliding.\" Aside from this extraordinary gliding ability, however, the U-2 was a very difficult aircraft to fly. Its very light weight, which enabled it to achieve extreme altitude, also made it very fragile. The aircraft was also very sleek, and it sliced through the air with little drag. This feature was dangerous, however, because the U-2 was not built to withstand the G-forces of high speed. Pilots had to be extremely careful to keep the craft in a slightly nose-up attitude when flying at operational altitude. If the nose dropped only a degree or two into the nose-down position, the plane would gain speed at a dramatic rate, exceeding the placarded speed limit in less than a minute, at which point the aircraft would begin to come apart. Pilots, therefore, had to pay close attention to the aircraft's speed indicator because at 65,000 feet there was no physical sensation of speed, without objects close at hand for the eye to use as a reference.\n\nTHREE FATAL CRASHES IN 1956\nThe first fatality directly connected with flying the U-2 occurred on 15 May 1956, when test pilot Wilburn S. Rose, flying article 345A, had trouble dropping his pogos, the outrigger wheels that keep the wings parallel to the ground during takeoff. Once airborne, Rose made a low-level pass over the airstrip and shook loose the lefthand pogo. When he attempted to make a righthand turn to come back over the runway to shake loose the remaining pogo, Rose stalled the U-2 and it plunged to earth, disintegrating over a wide area. Three months later, on 31 August 1956, a second fatal crash occurred during a night-flying exercise. Frank G. Grace stalled article 354 at an altitude of about 50 feet when he tried to climb too steeply at takeoff. The craft fell, cartwheeled on its left wing, and struck a power pole near the runway. More experienced U-2 pilots always cut back abruptly on the throttle as soon as the pogo sticks fell away in order to avoid such stalls. Before the year was out, two more U-2s were destroyed in crashes, one of them fatal. On 17 September 1956, article 346 lost part of its right wing while on its takeoff ascent from Lindsey Air Force Base in Wiesbaden, Germany. The aircraft disintegrated in midair, killing pilot Howard Carey. The loss of article 357 on 19 December 1956 resulted from pilot hypoxia. A small leak prematurely depleted the oxygen supply and impaired Robert J. Ericson's judgment as he flew over Arizona. Because of his inability to act quickly and keep track of his aircraft's speed, the U-2 exceeded the placarded speed of 190 knots and literally disintegrated when it reached 270 knots. Ericson managed to jettison the canopy and was sucked out of the aircraft at 28,000 feet. His chute opened automatically at 15,000 feet, and he landed without injury. The aircraft was a total loss.",

    "text": "COORDINATION OF COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS\nFrom the very beginning of the U-2 program, it was apparent that some sort of an interagency task force or office would be needed to develop and coordinate collection requirements for the covert overhead reconnaissance effort. In a three-page memorandum to DCI Dulles on 5 November 1954 setting forth the ideas of the Technological Capabilities Panel's Project 3 on this subject, Edwin Land wrote:\n\"It is recommended that...a permanent task force, including Air Force supporting elements, be set up under suitable cover to provide guidance on procurement, to consolidate requirements and plan missions in view of priority and feasibility, to maintain the operation on a continuing basis, and to carry out the dissemination of the resulting information in a manner consistent with its special security requirements.\"\nWhen the U-2's development and testing approached completion, Land's recommendation was put into effect. Following a meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Quarles and Trevor Gardner (who had been promoted from his special assistant post to become Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development), Richard Bissell established an Ad Hoc Requirements Committee (ARC) on 1 December 1955. He then named James Q. Reber to be Intelligence Requirements Officer for the U-2 project and chairman of the ARC. Reber was already experienced in coordination with other intelligence agencies, for he had headed the Directorate of Intelligence DI Office of Intelligence Coordination for four years. The first full-scale ARC meeting took place on 1 February 1956 with representatives from the Army, Navy, and Air Force present. Attending for the CIA were representatives from the Office of Research and Reports (ORR) and the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI). The CIA membership later expanded to include the Office of Current Intelligence (OCI) and a representative from the Directorate of Plans. In 1957 the National Security Agency (NSA) also began sending a representative. The State Department followed suit in 1960, although it had been receiving reports from the committee all along.\nARC's main task was to draw up lists of collection requirements, primarily for the U-2, but also for other means of collection. These lists prioritized targets according to their ability to meet the three major national intelligence objectives concerning the Soviet Union in the mid-1950s: long-range bombers, guided missiles, and nuclear energy. The committee issued its list of targets for the use of the entire intelligence community using all available means of collection, not just for the CIA with the U-2.",

Although the requirements committee was not responsible for developing flight plans, it assisted the planners with detailed target information as required. When a flight plan was ready for submission to the President for approval, the committee drew up a detailed justification for the selection of the targets. This paper accompanied the flight plan.\nIn developing and prioritizing lists of targets, the committee members had to take into account the varying needs and interests of their parent organizations. Thus, the CIA representatives generally emphasized strategic intelligence: aircraft and munitions factories, power-generating complexes, nuclear establishments, roads, bridges, inland waterways. In contrast, the military services usually placed a heavier emphasis on order-of-battle data. The Air Force, in particular, had a strong interest in gathering intelligence on the location of Soviet and East European airfields and radars. Although the committee members kept the interests of their services or agencies in mind, their awareness of the vital nature of their mission kept the level of cooperation high. The group always attempted to reach a consensus before issuing its recommendations, although occasionally this was not possible and one or more agencies would add a dissent to the recommendation of the committee as a whole.",

Lundahl, the chief of CIA's Photo Intelligence Division (PID), on Project AQUATONE. At DCI Dulles's direction, Lundahl immediately set in motion within his division a compartmented effort, known as Project EQUINE, to plan for the exploitation of overhead photography from the U-2 project. With only 13 members, the PID staff was too small to handle the expected flood of photographs that the U-2 would bring back, so in May 1955 the Directorate of Support (DS) authorized expanding PID to 44 persons. Soon afterward the division moved from its room in M Building to larger quarters in Que Building. The Photo Intelligence Division continued to expand in anticipation of large quantities of U-2 photography. Its authorized strength doubled in January 1956 when a new project known as HTAUTOMAT came into existence to exploit U-2 photography. All of the products from this project would be placed in the new control system. By the summer of 1956, the PID had moved to larger quarters in the Steuart Building at 5th Street and New York Avenue, NW. PID photointerpreters had already begun to work with U-2 photography following a series of missions in April 1956, when U-2s photographed a number of US installations that were considered analogous to high-priority Soviet installations. As a result of these preparations, PID was ready for the mass of photography that began coming in when U-2 operations commenced in the summer of 1956.",

Because the main targets for the U-2 lay behind the Iron Curtain, Bissell and his staff began looking for operational bases in Europe. The United Kingdom, America's closest ally, seemed the logical choice for U-2 bases, and, on 10 January 1956, Bissell flew to London to discuss the matter with Royal Air Force (RAF) and MI-6 officials. Their initial response was favorable, but they told Bissell that the proposal needed approval at a much higher level. Bissell reported his findings to DCI Dulles, who promptly arranged to meet with Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd in London to explore the possibility of winning the British Government's approval for the project. Dulles presented his case to Lloyd on 2 February, and, by early March, Prime Minister Anthony Eden approved the basing of U-2s in the United Kingdom.

U-2 detachment, consisting of four aircraft and pilots, was known publicly as the I st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1). The \"provisional\" designation · gave the U-2 detachments greater security because provisional Air Force units did not have to report to higher headquarters. WRSP-1, known within the Agency as Detachment A, began deploying to the United Kingdom on 29 April 1956. By 4 May, all of the detachment's personnel and equipment, including four aircraft, had arrived\" at Lakenheath.' Shortly after deployment, on 7 May, the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) released an unclassified U-2 cover story stating that a _Lockheed-developed aircraft would be flown by the USAF Air Weather Service to study such high-altitude phenomena as the jet stream, convective clouds, temperature and wind structures at jet-stream levels, and cosmic-ray effects up to 55,000 feet' Before overflights could begin from Lakenheath, however, several incidents occurred that dampened Prime Minister Eden's interest in having the U-2s on British territory. In mid-April 1956, a Soviet naval squadron brought Soviet leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on an official visit to the United Kingdom. Although the ships were docked in Portsmouth Harbor, a British counterintelligence operative and underwater expert, retired Royal Navy Commander Lionel Crabb, apparently undertook a mission to examine the hulls of these vessels but vanished in the process. His headless body was later found washed up on a beach. This so-called Frogman Incident caused an uproar in Parliament and a protest from Moscow that soured relations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. To avoid further deterioration of Anglo-Soviet relations, the Prime Minister wrote to President Eisenhower on 16 May asking that overflights be postponed. Only two days later, a U-2 on a training flight from Lakenheath inadvertently penetrated the British radar network, causing RAF fighters to scramble. Afterward the Air Ministry made a public announcement that a special NACA aircraft was conducting high-altitude research in _the United Kingdom.

    "text": "THE MOVE TO WIESBADEN To avoid arousing further reaction in the United Kingdom and to begin the program of U-2 overflights beyond the Iron Curtain without further delay, Bissell moved Detachment A on 11 June 1956 to Wiesbaden, one of the busiest airfields in West Germany, without notifying West German authorities. The detachment commander, Col. Frederick McCoy, was disappointed in his hope that the redeployment of the U-2s could be accomplished without drawing undue attention. The strange-looking planes,_ with bicycle-type wheels and wings so long they touched the ground after landing, aroused considerable interest. Wiesbaden was to be only a temporary home for Detachment A as the Air Force began preparing Giebelstadt near the East German border for use by the U-2s. Gi'ebe!stadt was an old World War II airbase that had been one of the launching sites for the GENETRIX balloons.' Soon after the four U-2s arrived in Wiesbaden, they were refitted with the more powerful J57/P-31 engines. The new engines were better suited for operations behind the Iron Curtain because they were less likely to suffer flameouts than the earlier model. Once the new engines were installed, the aircraft received the designation U-2B. 6 Bissell was anxious to get the overflights _started by late June because SAC weather experts had predicted that the best weather for photographing. the Soviet Union would be between 20 June and 10 July. Bissell, however, had not yet received final authorization from President Eisenhower to begin overflights of the Soviet Union. On 28 May 1956, when DCI Allen Dulles met with the President to discuss the U-2 *s readiness for operations, Eisenhower still made no decision on overnights. Three days later Dulles and Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining prepared a paper. for the· President outlining \"AQUATONE Operational Plans.\" In the meantime, President Eisenhower had entered Walter Reed Hospital for tests for an abdominal ailment that turned out to be Heitis, requiring an operation. During his recovery from surgery, Eisenhower would make his final decision on the overflight program. 7 PRESIDENT EISENHOWER'S ATTITUDE TOWARD OVERFLIGHTS The President had mixed feelings about overflights of the Soviet Union. Aware that they could provide extremely valuable intelligence about Soviet capabilities, he, nevertheless, remained deeply concerned that such flights brought with them the risk of starting a war. From the very beginning of the U-2 program, President Eisenhower had worked to minimize the possibility that overflights could lead to hostilities. He had always insisted that overflights by military aircraft were too provocative, and in 1954 he had therefore supported the J_,and committee's proposal for an unarmed civilian aircraft instead of the military reconnaissance planes favored by the Air Force. For the same reason, Eisenhower had resisted attempts by the Air Force to take the U-2 program away from the CIA in 1955. In fact, the President's desire to avoid secret reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union, with all their risks, led him to make his famous \"Open Skies\" proposal in the summer of 1955, when the U-2 was still under development but making good progress. At the Geneva summit conference on 21 July 1955, President Eisenhower offered to provide airfields and other facilities in the United States for the Soviet Union to conduct aerial photography of all US military installations if the Soviet Union would provide the United States with similar facilities in Russia. Not surprisingly, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev almost immediately rejected Eisenhower's offer: Although the President had hoped that the Soviet Union would accept his proposal, he was prepared for rejection. While Open Skies was still being considered, Eisenhower had stated, 'I'll give it one shot. Then if they don't accept. it, we'll try the U-2.'\" ' ll1id., pp. 23~25 and annex 13, \"AQUATONE Operational Plans,\" 31 Mny 1?56 ¢ Cotleword). \" Quoled in Hc:schloss, Mayday, p. 105.",

    "text": "Even though President Eisenhower had approved every stage of the U-2's development, knowing full well that the aircraft was being built to fly over the Soviet Union, the actual decision to authorize such flights was very difficult for him. He remained concerned that overflights could poison relations with the Soviet Union and might even lead to hostilities. One argument that helped overcome the President's reluctance was the CIA's longstanding contention that U-2 flights might actually go undetected because Soviet radars would not be able to track aircraft at such high altitudes. This belief was based on a 1952 study of Soviet World War II-vintage radars and on 1955 tests using US radars, which—unknown to US officials—were not as effective as Soviet radars against high-altitude targets. Shortly before U-2 operations began, however, the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI) conducted a vulnerability study of the U-2 that was published on 28 May 1956. The study's conclusion was that \"Maximum Soviet radar detection ranges against the Project aircraft at elevations in excess of 55,000 feet would vary from 20 to 150 miles.... In our opinion, detection can therefore be assumed.\" The OSI study added, however, \"[It] is doubtful that the Soviets can achieve consistent tracking of the Project vehicle.\" Completed just three weeks before the initiation of overflights, this study seems to have had little impact on the thinking of the top project officials. They continued to believe that the Soviets would not be able to track the U-2 and might even fail to detect it, except for possible vague indications. Soviet radars were not President Eisenhower's only concern. Also fearing that a malfunction might cause a U-2 to crash inside the Soviet Union, he asked Allen Dulles what the consequences would be. The President's staff secretary, Col. Andrew J. Goodpaster, who was present at virtually all White House meetings on the U-2 project and served as the President's intermediary to the CIA on this issue, later recalled: Allen's approach was that we were unlikely to lose one. If we did lose one, the pilot would not survive. . . . We were told—and it was part of our understanding of the situation—that it was almost certain that the plane would disintegrate and that we could take it for a certainty that no pilot would survive . . . and that although they would know where the plane came from, it would be difficult to prove it in any convincing way.\" CIA assurances that the U-2 would probably not be detected, and that a crashed U-2 could not be traced back to the United States, helped overcome the President's worries about overflights. The most important reason why President Eisenhower decided to send reconnaissance aircraft over the Soviet Union, however, was the urgent need for accurate intelligence to confirm or disprove claims of Soviet advances in long-range bombers and missiles.

    "section": "FIRST U-2 FLIGHTS OVER THE SOVIET UNION",
    "text": "The question of how well the Soviets could track U-2 flights had not yet been settled when the first overflights of the Soviet Union took place. On Wednesday, 4 July 1956, the U-2 known as Article 347 began the first flight over the Soviet Union. Final authorization for mission 2013 had come shortly before takeoff. Late on the evening of 3 July, Bissell went to project headquarters in the Matomic Building to give the “Go” or “No go” decision. Although the President had approved the overflight, the final decision to start a mission depended on a number of factors, especially the weather over the target area and at the takeoff and landing sites. Bissell made the decision just before midnight Washington time, which was six o’clock in the morning in Wiesbaden. This pattern of last-minute approvals continued for the duration of the U-2 overflight program.\nWhen Wiesbaden received the “Go” signal, a U-2 equipped with an A-2 camera and flown by pilot Hervey Stockman took off on a course that took it over Poznan, Poland, where riots had occurred on 28–30 June. After Poznan, Stockman headed for Belorussia, where he turned north to Leningrad. The last leg of the mission took the U-2 over the Soviet Baltic states before returning to Wiesbaden. The main target of this mission was the naval shipyards in Leningrad, center of the Soviet Union’s submarine construction program. Mission 2013’s route also overflew a number of major military airfields to make an inventory of the new Bison jet-engine heavy bomber.\nThe second overflight, on the following day, continued the search for Bison bombers. Pilot Carmine Vito’s route was similar but somewhat to the south of Stockman’s and also flew farther east, more than 200 kilometers past Moscow. Although the Soviet capital was almost completely hidden by clouds, the A-2 camera with haze filters took some usable photographs of the city. These turned out to be the only U-2 photographs of Moscow because no other mission was sent over the Soviet capital. Among the key targets photographed during mission 2014 were the Fili airframe plant, where the Bison was being built; the bomber arsenal at Ramenskoye, where the Bisons were tested; the Kaliningrad missile plant; and the Khimki rocket-engine plant.\nWhen Allen Dulles returned to work on Thursday, 5 July 1956, he asked Bissell if any overflights had taken place during the Independence Day holiday. One had been made on the fourth and another just that morning, Bissell replied. (Because of the six-hour time difference, the 5 July flight was safely back in Wiesbaden by the time Dulles spoke to Bissell.) When Dulles asked the routes of these missions, Bissell told him that they had overflown both Moscow and Leningrad. “Oh my Lord,” Dulles exclaimed, “do you think that was wise the first time?” “Allen,” Bissell replied, “the first is the safest.”\nPresident Eisenhower also wanted to know the results of the 4 and 5 July flights, but his principal concern was whether there had been any indication that either flight had been discovered or tracked by radar. Eisenhower told Colonel Goodpaster “to advise Mr. Allen Dulles that if we obtain any information or warning that any of the flights has been discovered or tracked, the operation should be suspended.” Goodpaster called both Dulles and Bissell and was told that reports on tracking or attempted interception of the U-2s would not be available for another 36 hours. Later that day the two CIA officials met with Goodpaster to ask if flights could continue in the meantime. Goodpaster replied that his understanding of the President’s directive was that the operation should continue “at the maximum rate until the first evidence of tracking was received.”",

    "section": "Soviet Tracking and US Response",
    "text": "Although President Eisenhower had originally spoken of suspending the overflights if they were “discovered or tracked,” his main concern was to learn if the Soviets could track U-2 missions, meaning that they could follow the flight on their radar screens for most or all of the missions and thus have numerous opportunities to attempt interception. Certainly the President hoped that U-2 flights could not even be detected, but reports received on the 20 June overflight of Eastern Europe had already indicated that this goal was unrealistic. The President’s emphasis therefore shifted to tracking. If the Soviets could successfully track U-2 missions, he wanted the overflights halted.\nReports on Soviet radar coverage of the first two overflights of the Soviet Union became available on 6 July. These reports showed that, although the Soviets did detect the aircraft and made several very unsuccessful attempts at interception, they could not track U-2s consistently. Interestingly, the Soviet radar coverage was weakest around the most important targets, Moscow and Leningrad, and the Soviets did not realize that U-2s had overflown these two cities.\nDetachment A carried out three more overflights of the Soviet Union during the 10-day period authorized by the President. Two of the missions (2020 and 2021) took place on a single day, 9 July 1956. They covered much of Eastern Europe, and the Ukraine and Belorussia in the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, a broken camera shutter ruined much of the photography of one of the flights. The third mission (2023), on the following day, included the Crimean Peninsula.\nThe film from the first overflight (4 July) was flown to the United States immediately after the U-2 landed at Wiesbaden. Several members of the Photo Intelligence Division were on hand when the film was developed to check on the results. Also present was James Baker, who had accepted an offer by project officials to get a firsthand look at how the new A-2 lenses were working.\nThe photos from July overflights were generally good, despite occasional problems caused by cloud cover. The huge amount of film taken by these missions provided more information about the Soviet Union’s ability to track and intercept U-2s. Photointerpreters examining the films eventually discovered the tiny images of MiG-15s and MiG-17s beneath the U-2s in various pursuit and attack attitudes: climbing, flipping over, and falling toward Earth. It was even possible to determine their approximate altitudes. These photographs showed that the Soviet air defense system was able to track U-2s well enough to attempt interception, but they also provided proof that the fighter aircraft available to the Soviet Union in 1956 could not bring down a U-2 at operational altitude.\nOne problem with early U-2 photography became apparent only after the first films were developed. If there was surface water on the runway at Wiesbaden when the U-2 took off, the camera windows became begrimed. Although the water dried during the flight, the oily scum it left behind degraded the photographic image. To combat this problem, AQUATONE ground crews took brooms and spent several hours before takeoff sweeping puddles of water from the runway to be used by the U-2. Kelly Johnson eventually designed a jettisonable cover for the camera windows, which was released at the same time as the pogos so that it could be recovered and reused.",

Poland and Czechoslovakia also issued protests regarding overflights in late July.  The flightpath details in the Soviet and Polish protests, combined with photographic evidence of Soviet interception attempts, confirmed that U-2s were not flying undetected and could be tracked.

    "text": "The Suez Crisis was a major turning point in the use of the U-2 airplane. Before this crisis, the U-2 had been seen solely as a collector of strategic intelligence, with high-quality results considered more important than speed. U-2 film had, therefore, been returned to the manufacturer for optimum development and then interpreted in Washington using the most up-to-date devices. Now, because of the Middle East crisis, Project AQUATONE was expected to perform like a tactical reconnaissance unit, developing film immediately after landing for instant interpretation or \"readout.\" Photo-Intelligence Division personnel assigned to Project HTAUTOMAT (U-2 film exploitation), therefore, had to arrange for forward processing of the U-2 film to avoid unacceptable delays in providing intelligence on tactical developments around Suez. PID acted quickly to carry out its new assignment. Lundahl and Reber flew from the United Kingdom to US Air Force Europe headquarters in Wiesbaden on 12 September to make arrangements for processing and interpreting U-2 film in West Germany. They had been preceded by chief of PID's Special Projects Branch. Following detailed discussions with Air Force photo­intelligence personnel, the CIA representatives arranged to use a portion of a nearby Air Force photo laboratory for developing U-2 film. With the assistance of the chief of the HTAUTOMAT photo laboratory, and Air Force personnel, the lab was ready for processing on the following day, when the next U-2 mission returned from the Middle East. After quickly developing the film, Lundahl and his joint staff of CIA and armed forces personnel studied it for indications of British and French preparations for hostilities and sent their first report to Washington on 15 September.\nAlthough the Air Force provided considerable assistance in establishing the photo laboratory, Air Force officials did not like the idea of CIA personnel controlling overseas photo processing and interpretation centers, which were normally under Air Force control. Further negotiations led to a CIA-Air Force agreement at the end of October, under which the Air Force would name the commanding officer for such installations and the CIA would designate the deputy, who was responsible for technical and intelligence matters. PID soon added two photo interpreters and a lab technician to the West German operation, which continued to develop and interpret U-2 photography of the Middle East throughout September and October 1956. This unit's timely and accurate information enabled the PARAMOUNT Committee to predict the joint Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it took place.",

    "text": "On 11 September, Detachment A pilot Jacob Kratt overflew the French Mediterranean naval base at Toulon. He brought back imagery revealing that France was loading troopships at Toulon. During the rest of the month, Detachment A pilots flew another eight missions over the Middle East. By this time, the new Detachment B in Turkey was ready for operations, and it was better positioned to provide coverage of the Middle East. Detachment B began flying missions in September and soon became the primary detachment for Middle East overflights, conducting nine out of the ten such missions flown in October. Detachment B's first U-2 flight, on 11 September 1956, made passes over Turkey, Cyprus, and Rhodes. The next flight, more than two weeks later, covered much the same ground but flew as far west as Malta, Sicily, and Crete. Both were \"special\" missions aimed at maintaining surveillance of the British and French fleets and forces as they prepared for the attack on Egypt. Meanwhile, Detachment A pilots flew four missions in the Western Mediterranean. During this period, the PARAMOUNT Committee's photo interpreters developed the new science of \"tent-ology\"...counting the tents of British forces on the islands of Cyprus and Malta to determine the number of troops deployed. The photo interpreters used changes in the number of tents to determine that the British forces were beginning to move toward the beaches, where they were eventually lightered to offshore troopships. Noting the U-2 activity in the Middle East, President Eisenhower wrote in his diary on 15 October 1956: \"Our high-flying reconnaissance planes have shown that Israel has obtained some 60 of the French Mystere pursuit planes, when there had been reported the transfer of only 24.\" Other U-2 photographs revealed the presence of British Canberra bombers at Akrotiri, Cyprus. The Anglo-French military buildup greatly irritated President Eisenhower, who considered these activities a violation of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration, in which the United States, the United Kingdom, and France had agreed to maintain the status quo in armaments and borders in the Middle East. To Arthur Lundahl he remarked, \"It's a hell of a note when you have to G-2 your friends.\"",

    "text": "U-2 photography continued to keep the President and other key officials well informed about the progress of the crisis. Flights over Israel and Rhodes on 21 October and Cyprus on 25 October revealed heavy military concentrations and an increase in the number of troop transports and air forces. On the basis of this information, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told the President on 28 October that he believed an Israeli attack on Jordan was imminent, adding that he thought the British and French would take advantage of such an attack to occupy the Suez Canal. The Middle East war began on the afternoon of 29 October 1956 with Israeli paratroop drops in the Sinai Peninsula, followed by mobile columns striking deep into Egyptian territory. The next day, 30 October, Francis Gary Powers conducted mission 1314. He overflew Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and finally the Sinai, where he photographed black puffs of smoke from the fighting between Israel and Egypt. Adana-based U-2s were in the air for the next two days filming the Suez Canal area and neighboring countries. The United Kingdom and France entered the fray on the evening of 31 October with bombing raids against major Egyptian airfields. The Anglo-French bombing campaign continued for the next 48 hours. Early on the morning of 1 November, an Adana-based U-2, piloted by William Hall, took off to gather intelligence on the Anglo-French military activity. After photographing Cyprus, Hall flew south to the Sinai Desert, where he made several passes to obtain complete coverage of the Israeli-Egyptian fighting there. He then headed west to Cairo, passing directly over the main Egyptian airbase at Almaza, where he filmed neatly arranged rows of Egyptian military aircraft. Continuing past Cairo to film another airfield, Hall turned southeast and then north to fly along the Nile, again crossing directly over Almaza. The photography from this leg of the mission revealed the burning wreckage of the Egyptian aircraft. During the short period of time that had passed between Hall's two passes, a combined Anglo-French air armada had attacked the airbase. When shown the before and after photos of Almaza, President Eisenhower told Arthur Lundahl: \"Ten-minute reconnaissance, now that's a goal to shoot for!\" Eisenhower was pleased with the aerial photography but angered by what it depicted: an Anglo-French attack on Egypt. He quickly called for a cease-fire and denied the United Kingdom any further U-2 photographs of the Middle East.",

President Eisenhower was informed of this impending invasion on Sunday, 4 November. On the following day, British and French paratroopers dropped near Port Said at the north end of the Suez Canal. This action prompted Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin to send messages to France, Britain, and Israel warning that the Soviet Union was ready to \"use force to crush the aggressors.\" Early on the morning of election day, 6 November, the Anglo-French invasion armada arrived at Port Said and began landing troops. Back in Washington President Eisenhower met with Allen Dulles to discuss the deepening international crisis. Worried that the Soviet Union might be poised to intervene in the war, the President ordered Dulles to have the Adana-based U-2s fly over Syria to see whether the Soviets were moving planes to Syrian airbases in preparation for a strike against the forces attacking Egypt. The answer to Eisenhower's question came much sooner than expected because on the previous day a U-2 had already overflown Syria before making a run across northern Egypt. The film from this flight had reached Wiesbaden for processing and readout during the night. The results were in the hands of the PARAMOUNT Committee by midmorning on 6 November, while the President was motoring to Gettysburg to cast his ballot. By the time the President returned to the White House by helicopter at noon, Colonel Goodpaster was waiting for him with an answer: there were no Soviet aircraft in Syria. Because of the President's concern about possible Soviet moves, Syria was the target of 14 additional U-2 flights between 7 November and 18 December 1956. The increasing reliance on Adana-based U-2s for coverage of the Middle East during the Suez Crisis made it difficult for the photo interpreters to supply timely information.

    "text": "base at Adana, there were no film-processing facilities available, and the film had to be flown to Wiesbaden, adding a 10- to 15-hour delay. During the gradual buildup of the crisis, this delay had been tolerated, but, once actual hostilities broke out, US decisionmakers needed a more rapid response. On 29 October, Richard Bissell ordered Lundahl to establish a film-processing facility at Adana. Two PID employees went to Adana on 13 November to set up the facility, and two photointerpreters moved from Wiesbaden to Adana to help in the effort. Forward processing was, however, hampered by the location of the Adana facility on a flat, arid plain in southern Turkey, 3.5 miles from the Mediterranean at the very end of a long supply line.\nThe PID obtained and outfitted a trailer for film processing, but many problems had to be overcome. The first major problem was obtaining enough clean water. Detachment B personnel, therefore, purchased large amounts of borax locally for use in purifying water. In fact, they bought so much borax on the local market that one of them was arrested by the Turkish police, who believed he was using the chemical to make drugs. It was also difficult to obtain a constant source of developers and fixers for processing the U-2 film, since the large Air Force supply facility at Wheelus AFB in Libya refused to provide the needed photographic chemicals. When PID personnel accompanied processed film from Turkey to the United States, they returned to Turkey sitting atop cartons of chemicals for the next day's processing. At first, film was developed in improvised tanks using flimsy wooden spools and hand-turned cranks to move the film through the solutions. Later, the Adana facility moved from its trailer to a building and received more up-to-date processing equipment. As was the case with the photo lab in Germany, the Adana lab's personnel came from the Agency and the armed forces.\nThe need to produce very timely intelligence diminished after the British and French agreed to a cease-fire on 7 November 1956. By the end of the month, foreign troops began evacuating Egyptian territory, and the pressure on the Adana photointerpretation unit eased. The facility remained in existence, however, and was used twice in December 1956 and 11 times in the first half of 1957. It was then placed in caretaker status, for emergency use only.",

    "text": "RENEWED OVERFLIGHTS OF THE SOVIET UNION\nThroughout the fall of 1956, U-2s provided valuable coverage of the Middle East crisis, but they were not conducting their original mission of strategic reconnaissance of the Soviet Union. President Eisenhower had halted all such overflights by his order of 30 July, and, in the months that followed, he remained unconvinced by CIA arguments in favor of a resumption of overflights. On 17 September 1956, DDCI Cabell and Richard Bissell went to the White House to ask President Eisenhower to authorize more flights over the Soviet Union. Adm. Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also attended the meeting. Bissell and Defense Department representatives reviewed the valuable intelligence from the July U-2 flights, and Bissell then informed Eisenhower that many important intelligence requirements remained unfilled. To fill these requirements, Bissell noted, would require photography of approximately 15 separate areas of the Soviet Union. Pleading for the authority to resume overflights, Bissell stressed that conditions for photography were becoming less favorable as the days grew shorter. While the U-2 was then still safe from interception, he added, it might not be in the future.\nPresident Eisenhower acknowledged the value of the U-2 but emphasized that the international political aspects of overflights remained his overriding concern. He said he would talk further with John Foster Dulles about the matter, noting that the Secretary of State had at first seemed to belittle the political risk but had later found it increasingly worrisome. A little more than two weeks later, on 3 October, when the President again met with Bissell, Cabell, and Radford, John Foster Dulles was also present. In opening the meeting, Eisenhower said he had become discouraged regarding Project AQUATONE. Although he had been assured that there would be a good chance of not being discovered on most, if not all, operations, just the opposite had proved true. The President observed that arguments in favor of resuming U-2 operations did not take world opinion into consideration. He added that great efforts had been made for many years “to create an opinion in the world that we are not truculent and do not want war,” and, if knowledge of the U-2 overflights got out, world opinion would view them as “provocative and unjustified.”\nSecretary of State Dulles said that, although he essentially agreed with the President's comments, he thought that “really important results” might be obtained by a seven- to 10-day operation. He, nevertheless, questioned the long-term value of the results. DDCI Cabell replied that U-2 photographs would be useful much longer than the Secretary of State had implied because they would establish a reference bank of geographic and manmade features. Siding with Cabell, Admiral Radford pointed out the need for more intelligence to make estimates better. President Eisenhower was not convinced by these arguments. Although willing to consider extensions of the radar-seeking ferret flights he had authorized along the Soviet borders, he remained opposed to penetration flights over the Soviet Union.",

    "text": "Events in Eastern Europe in the fall of 1956 helped to change the President’s mind. In October the Soviet Union backed away from a confrontation with nationalist Communist leaders in Poland only to find itself facing a similar situation in Hungary, where mass demonstrations led to the formation of a new government under Imre Nagy on 23 October 1956. Soviet troops and tanks temporarily withdrew from Budapest while awaiting reinforcements. By early November, however, the Kremlin leadership decided that events in Hungary were getting out of hand—particularly when Premier Nagy announced his nation’s withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact—and ordered Soviet troops to suppress the Hungarian uprising. Although President Eisenhower deplored the Soviet intervention, he turned down CIA requests for permission to airdrop arms and supplies to the Hungarian rebels. In fact, the President forbade all overflights of that nation, including those by U-2 aircraft, and none was made.\nAlthough President Eisenhower had not been willing to allow overflights during the Hungarian crisis, the Soviet Union’s actions in Hungary convinced him to authorize renewed overflights of the Soviet Bloc, a decision that was made easier by his reelection by a large margin in early November. Initially, however, the President only authorized overflights of Eastern Europe and Soviet border regions, not the deep penetration overflights that had been requested by CIA. At a 15 November 1956 meeting with Acting Secretary of State Herbert Hoover, Jr. (John Foster Dulles was recovering from cancer surgery), JCS Chairman Adm. Arthur Radford, DCI Allen Dulles, and Richard Bissell, Eisenhower explained why he refused to allow overflights of the Soviet Union: “Everyone in the world says that, in the last six weeks, the United States has gained a place it hasn’t held since World War II. To make trips now would cost more than we would gain in form of solid information.” Hoover agreed and noted, “If we lost a plane at this stage, it would be almost catastrophic.” Torn between his desire to maintain a “correct and moral” position and his wish to know what the Soviet Union was up to, the President finally authorized several overflights of Eastern Europe and the Soviet border, “but not the deep one,” adding that the aircraft should “stay as close to the border as possible.”\nThe first of these flights, mission 4016 on 20 November 1956, was the first overflight of Soviet territory since 10 July. This mission left Adana and flew east over Iran, then reversed and flew west along the Soviet-Iranian border to Soviet Armenia, where it crossed into the Soviet Union and photographed Yerevan. An electrical malfunction then forced the pilot, Francis Gary Powers, to return to Adana. Soviet interceptor aircraft made several unsuccessful attempts to reach this U-2, and the Soviet Government sent a secret protest note to Washington. On 30 December, Bulgaria was the target of two U-2 missions, one (4018) from Detachment B at Adana and another (2029) from Detachment A at Giebelstadt. Bulgarian fighter aircraft made 10 different attempts to intercept the first mission, but the flight proceeded without difficulty. The second flight came close to crashing but not through the efforts of interceptors. The pilot of mission 2029 was Carmine Vito, who had flown the first U-2 mission over Moscow on 5 July. He was known to his colleagues as the Lemon-Drop Kid because he always carried these hard candies in the knee pocket of his flight suit.",

On the morning of 10 December, while Vito was undergoing prebreathing, the Air Force enlisted man who oversaw his preflight regimen placed an L-pill in the right-hand knee pocket of Vito's flight suit, unaware that this pocket also contained Vito's supply of lemon drops. After he took off, Vito began indulging in his habit of sucking lemon drops. About midway into the mission, he opened his faceplate and popped into his mouth what he thought was another lemon drop. After closing the faceplate, he began sucking on the object and thought it strange that it had no flavor and was much smoother than the previous lemon drops. Although tempted to bite down, Vito decided instead to reopen his faceplate and see what it was he had in his mouth. Spitting the object into his hand, he saw that he had been sucking on the L-pill with its lethal contents of potassium cyanide. Just a thin layer of glass had stood between him and death. The loss of his aircraft over Bulgaria would have exposed the U-2 program to worldwide publicity and would probably have resulted in an early end to overflights. Detachment A's security officer overheard Vito relating the L-pill story to a fellow pilot several days later and promptly reported the conversation to headquarters. When details of Vito's close call reached Washington, James Cunningham immediately ordered L-pills placed in boxes so that there would be no chance of mistaking them for anything else. The L-pill continued to be available for another three years. Then in January 1960, the commander of Detachment B, Col. William Shelton, raised an important question that had never been considered: what would happen if an L-pill with its volatile contents accidentally broke inside the cockpit of a U-2? Realizing that such an accident would result in the death of the pilot, James Cunningham ordered the destruction of all L-pills and then turned to the Technical Services Division (TSD) for a better idea. By this time the state of the art in lethal devices was a needle poisoned with algal, an extremely deadly shellfish toxin. The needle was hidden in a tiny hole in a silver dollar supplied by Cunningham. Only one poison-needle coin was made because Cunningham decided that, if any pilot had to use it because of capture, there would probably not be any more overflights.",

President Eisenhower had approved the mission after being told by the Air Force that the high-speed RB-57Ds would probably not be detected. Reacting strongly to the Soviet protest, the President told Secretary of State Dulles on 18 December that he was going to \"order complete stoppage of this entire business.\" As for a reply to the Soviet protest, Dulles said, \"I think we will have to admit this was done and say we are sorry. We cannot deny it.\" Dulles noted that \"our relations with Russia are pretty tense at the moment.\" Eisenhower agreed, noting that this was no time to be provocative. He then instructed Colonel Goodpaster to call Secretary of Defense Wilson, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Radford, and DCIA Dulles to order: \"Effective immediately, there are to be no flights by US reconnaissance aircraft over Iron Curtain countries.\" Flights along the borders of Iron Curtain countries continued, however, and, on 22 December 1956, Detachment B flew the first mission (4019) by a U-2 equipped for electronic intercept. The electronic-detection equipment known as the System-V unit (see appendix C) was installed in the bay normally used by the main camera, and the plane flew along the Soviet border from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea and on to Afghanistan. The System-V unit worked well.",

Because of heavy cloud cover, the pilot, James W. Cherbonneaux, did not realize he was over the Soviet Union until he saw Soviet fighters attempting to intercept him. These attempts at interception once again demonstrated the Soviets' ability to track the U-2 and their inability to harm him. At this point in early 1957, the U-2 program was in limbo. Although the President would not allow U-2s to fly their primary mission of reconnaissance of the Soviet Union, he did not cancel the program and continued to authorize flights along Soviet borders. The CIA's overhead reconnaissance program also faced a renewed bid by the Air Force, which now had its own growing U-2 fleet, to gain control of the overflight program in the spring of 1957. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the project made planning and budgeting extremely difficult. In April 1957, Richard Bissell asked the DCI and DDCI to push for a decision on whether the U-2 program was to continue in civilian hands and what its scope was to be. In briefing papers prepared for the DCI, Bissell argued for maintaining a nonmilitary overflight capability, which could \"maintain greater security, employ deeper cover, use civilian pilots, keep the aircraft outside military control, and, therefore, make possible more plausible denial of US military responsibility in the face of any Soviet charges.\" In urging the resumption of overflights, Bissell stated that four U-2 missions over border regions of the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe had been detected by the Soviets without causing any diplomatic protest. He also noted that the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities had unanimously recommended the resumption of overflights.",

The President expressed concern about the impact of overflights on US-Soviet relations and about possible Soviet responses such as closing off access to Berlin. Although remaining opposed to flights over most of the Soviet Union, Eisenhower finally agreed to permit some flights over peripheral areas such as Kamchatka Peninsula and Lake Baikal, as well as the Soviet Union's atomic testing area at Semipalatinsk. Such overflights could be staged from Pakistan if the Pakistani Government consented. The President rejected the Air Force's request to take over the U-2 program, stating that he preferred to have the aircraft manned by civilians \"during operations of this kind.\" The President had once again agreed to allow overflights of the Soviet Union, although only over certain areas, because the need to learn more about the capabilities and intentions of the Soviet Union was too compelling: in particular, the President and top administration officials wanted to gather more data on the Soviet Union's missile program, a subject for which considerable Soviet boasting—but no hard data—was available. Even after he had authorized the resumption of overflights, President Eisenhower maintained tight control over the program. He personally authorized each overflight, which meant that Richard Bissell would bring maps to the White House with the proposed routes marked on them for the President to examine.",

    "text": "More than once, according to Bissell, Eisenhower spread the map out on his Oval Office desk for detailed study, usually with his son John (an Army officer serving as a White House aide) and Colonel Goodpaster looking over his shoulder; On occasion, the President would pick up a pencil and eliminate a flight leg or make some other correction to the flight plan. RADAR-DECEPTIVE 'DIRTY BIRDS' One additional reason why President Eisenhower had again authorized overflights of the Soviet Union was renewed CIA promises that Soviet detection or tracking of the U-2 was unlikely. At the 6 May 1957 meeting with the President, Richard Bissell reported on the progress that had been made in developing radar camouflage and absorption devices for the U-2. Once these devices were installed on the operational U-2s, he explained, the 'majority of incidents would be undetected.' Work on methods of reducing the U-2's vulnerability to radar detection had begun in the fall of 1956 as the result of President Eisenhower's disenchantment with the overflight program following Soviet detection and tracking of the first series of U-2 missions. The CIA proprietary firm Scientific Engineering Institute was conducting this research under a project codenamed RAINBOW. SEI Chief Engineer Dr. Franklin A. Rodgers, formerly of MIT, converted the theories of Harvard physicist Edward Purcell into systems that could be used on aircraft. SEI's radar-deception system consisted of a series of attachments to the U-2. First bamboo poles and later fiberglass rods were attached to the wings, where they would not interfere with the control surfaces. At the ends of these poles, completely circling the aircraft, was a small-gauge wire with precisely spaced ferrite beads. The wire and beads were supposed to capture incoming 70-MHz radar pulses and either trap them in the loop or weaken them so much that they would not register as a valid radar return. This configuration was called the trapeze and was not very successful. A second approach, tested in early 1958, involved the use of plastic material containing a printed circuit designed to absorb radar pulses in the 65- to 85-MHz range. Nicknamed 'Wallpaper,' this material was glued to parts of the U-2's fuselage, nose, and tail. Although the 'trapeze' and 'wallpaper' systems provided protection against some Soviet radars, the systems proved ineffective against radars operating below 65-MHz or above 85-MHz. Furthermore, both of these additions degraded the U-2's performance. The weight and drag of 'trapeze' reduced the aircraft's operating ceiling by 1,500 feet, and 'wallpaper' sometimes caused engines to overheat.",

    "text": "The most important series of overflights in the summer of 1957 were those that Detachment B staged to gather intelligence on the Soviet Union's guided missile and nuclear programs. President Eisenhower had approved these overflights at the meeting on 6 May 1957 provided that Pakistan allowed the U-2s to operate from its territory (the desired targets were too far away from the U-2 base in Turkey). Richard Bissell's personal assistant met with President Iskander Mirza, Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and Army Commander Gen. Ayub Khan between 3 and 7 June 1957 and received permission to operate from Lahore. The airfield at Peshawar, a more desirable location, was not available because of repair work.\n\nDetachment B at Ankara ferried four of its U-2s, two of which were \"dirty birds,\" to Lahore. A C-124 brought in eight pilots and ground crews to prepare for missions over the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China (PRC) beginning on 4 August (Operation SOFT TOUCH). During a 23-day period, these aircraft made nine flights: seven over the USSR and two over the PRC. Although one of the seven flights over the USSR was a failure because the camera malfunctioned after taking only 125 exposures, the remaining missions over Central Asia were a complete success, producing a bonanza of information that kept scores of photo interpreters busy for more than a year.\n\nThe 5 August flight, a dirty bird piloted by Bister Edens, was the first to photograph the major Soviet space launch facility east of the Aral Sea in Kazakhstan. None of the mission planners was certain just where the range was located, so the U-2 pilot followed the rail lines in the area. As a result, the plane did not pass directly over the rangehead and obtained only oblique photography. Although known in the West today as Tyuratam, this missile installation had no name when it was first photographed in August 1957. In preparation for a briefing to President Eisenhower on the SOFT TOUCH photography, Dino Brugioni, an assistant to PID chief Arthur Lundahl, examined all the existing maps of the area to see if he could find a place name for the missile base. Only one map, made by the Germans during World War II, showed a community in the vicinity of the missile facility. The settlement's name was Tyuralam, which means \"narrow burial ground\" in the Kazakh language, and this was the name Brugioni gave the missile base. Official Soviet releases concerning this base have always referred to it as Baykonyr, but the community of Baykonyr is actually more than 200 miles north of Tyuratam.",

    "text": "While PID was still analyzing the SOFT TOUCH photography, the Soviet Union announced the successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) from Baykonyr (Tyuratam). On 26 August 1957, the Soviet news agency TASS stated that a \"super-long-range multi-stage intercontinental ballistic rocket\" had been successfully tested, adding \"it is now possible to send missiles to any part of the world.\" The Soviet announcement made the intelligence community want even more information on Tyuratam, and a second U-2 piloted by Edwin K. Jones flew over the area on 28 August 1957, just one week after the Soviet ICBM launch. This mission obtained excellent vertical photographs of the main launch complex, and photo interpreters soon determined that the Soviets had only one launchpad at Tyuratam. The base was not photographed again until 9 July 1959, at which time it still had only one launch pad, although two more were under construction.\n\nOn 20 and 21 August 1957, U-2s conducted the first overflights of the Soviet nuclear testing grounds at Semipalatinsk, north-northwest of Lake Balkhash. The first mission, piloted by Sammy V.C. Snider, passed over part of the proving grounds, flew on to Novokuznetsk, and then proceeded to Tomsk, where it began its return leg that included coverage of a very large uranium-processing facility at the new city of Berezovskiy. In the second mission, James Cherbonneau flew directly over the Semipalatinsk proving grounds only four hours before a half-megation device was detonated. In fact, the U-2 unknowingly photographed the aircraft that was to drop the nuclear device. These photographs also revealed evidence of a recent, low-yield, above-ground nuclear test. [2SX1, E.O.13526]\n\nOn its way to Semipalatinsk, the 21 August mission flew a search pattern over the western end of Lake Balkhash looking for another Soviet missile-related installation and made the first photographs of what was later determined to be the new missile test center at Saryshagan. This facility was used to test radars against incoming missiles fired from Kapustin Yar, 1,400 miles to the west. Saryshagan later became the center for the development of the Soviet Union's advanced antiballistic missile (ABM) weapon system. On 23 August 1957, DDCI Cabell, Richard Bissell, and Air Force Chief of Staff Twining met with President Eisenhower to report on the results of Operation SOFT TOUCH. They showed the President some of the photographic results of the earlier missions and reported on the effects of the antiradar measures.",

    "section": "THE DECLINE OF DETACHMENT A",
    "text": "During the summer of 1957, all overflights of the Soviet Union were conducted by either Detachment B or Detachment C. Detachment A in Germany was a less desirable starting point for overflights of the Soviet Union because such missions had to cross Eastern Europe first, increasing the likelihood of detection and diplomatic protests. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's air defense and radar networks were stronger along its western borders, so Detachment B missions over the southern portion of the Soviet Union and Detachment C missions in the Far East were less risky than those conducted by Detachment A. Finally, the main target of U-2 photography after the bomber issue receded was Soviet missile and nuclear progress. The testing areas for these weapons were located in the vast open spaces of the south-central and eastern portions of the Soviet Union, which lay beyond the range of Detachment A's aircraft.\nThe decline in importance of Detachment A had begun with the President's standdown order of 10 July 1956. During the next three months, the detachment conducted only 11 missions, all over the Mediterranean region rather than the original target of the Soviet Union, and the slow pace of activity and change in mission adversely affected pilot morale. One of the detachment's aircraft was lost in a crash on 17 September, killing pilot Howard Carey and garnering unwanted publicity. Conditions improved when the detachment moved to the newly renovated facility at Giebelstadt in early October 1956, but security now became a problem there. Detachment A personnel discovered that a long, black Soviet-Bloc limousine was parked at the end of the Giebelstadt runway whenever the U-2s took off.\nDuring the next year, Detachment A mounted only four overflights. The first two were over Eastern Europe: one over Bulgaria on 10 December 1956 and the other over Albania on 25 April 1957. Then a long period of inactivity followed, ending with a third mission on 11 October 1957, which conducted electronic surveillance of Soviet naval maneuvers in the Barents Sea. The final overflight of Detachment A, mission 2040 on 13 October 1957, flew north over Norway to the Bering Sea, turned southeast to overfly Murmansk, and then exited to the north, returning to Germany via Norway. Although the final missions of Detachment A achieved excellent results, project headquarters had already decided that Western Europe was not a satisfactory location for overflights of the Soviet Union and had notified Detachment A on 20 September 1957 that its operations would cease in November. By 15 November 1957, all of the detachment's personnel and aircraft had returned to the United States. During Detachment A's 17-month period of operations, seven pilots had flown a total of 23 missions: six over the Soviet Union, five over Eastern Europe, and most of the remaining 12 missions over the Mediterranean area.",

Norwegian radars tracked the overflights of the Barents Sea and Murmansk in October 1957, and Col. Villielm Evang, Chief of the Norwegian Intelligence Service, contacted the CIA. In March 1958, Colonel Evang came to Washington and received a briefing from Arthur Lundahl together with sanitized photos that did not reveal the altitude of the aircraft or the focal length of the camera. The Agency provided additional photos to Norway during a visit by a PID staff member in July. Later that year, Norway agreed to provide an airfield for the United States to conduct U-2 flights that did not violate Soviet airspace. On 15 September 1958, a Detachment B U-2 and its support party arrived at Bodø Air Force Base. This was followed by an ELINT collection flight over international waters (the Kara Sea) on 25 October. On 6 November, the U-2 returned to Adana by conducting a lengthy ELINT collection flight along the borders of the Soviet Union and East Germany. During the initial portion of the mission, when the U-2 flew along the Soviet-Finnish border and then turned east over the Gulf of Finland to come within 60 miles of Leningrad (while remaining over international waters), the aircraft was the target of 23 unsuccessful Soviet intercept attempts.",

    "text": "Operation SOFT TOUCH (4-27 August 1957) proved to be the high-water mark of U-2 operations against the Soviet Union. Detachment B staged one more overflight on 30 September 1957, when a U-2 piloted by William Hall flew from Adana to photograph the Kapustin Yar Missile Test Range for the first time since the USAF's overflight in 1953, obtaining photographs of a large medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) on the launchpad. Six days later Detachment C conducted its successful overflight of the ICBM impact site at Klyuchi, and October saw the final two overflights of Detachment A. After these missions, deep penetration overflights became a rarity. There would be only six more during the next 32 months: one in 1958; two in 1959; and three in 1960 (one of which was unsuccessful). During this period, President Eisenhower did authorize several flights along Soviet border areas that occasionally penetrated short distances inside the border, but the Chief Executive had become extremely wary of authorizing “deep penetration” overflights, which invariably brought protests from Moscow. The border flights took place under tight controls. Beginning in the fall of 1957, all messages from Washington to Adana giving coordinates for flights along the Soviet border contained the statement: “This is not a penetration overflight” and warned about flying too close to Soviet borders. The Soviets even attempted to shoot down U-2s flying well within international airspace above the Black Sea, as was the case on 27 October 1957, when electronic intelligence equipment on a U-2 flight over the Black Sea that never violated Soviet airspace revealed 12 attempts at interception by Soviet fighters.\nThe sole U-2 overflight of 1958 was conducted by a dirty bird from Detachment C. On 1 March 1958, mission 6011 overflew the Soviet Far East and photographed the Trans-Siberian Railroad, Sovetskaya Gavan', the Tatar Strait, and a strange installation at Malaya Sazanka, which was eventually determined to be a structure for mating nuclear devices with their detonators. This was the first and only U-2 overflight of the Soviet Union staged from Japan. On 5 March 1958, the Soviet Union delivered a vigorous protest concerning this mission, prompting President Eisenhower to tell Colonel Goodpaster on 7 March to inform the CIA that U-2 flights were to be “discontinued, effective at once.” This standdown was to last more than 16 months, until July 1959. The Soviets had not been fooled by the antiradar devices carried by mission 6011, as was demonstrated by the detailed information about the mission contained in a Soviet aide-mémoire delivered on 21 April 1958. It was clear that dirty bird aircraft were not effective and that Soviet radar operators had little difficulty in tracking them. At this point, the Agency abandoned the use of the antiradar devices on the U-2. As a substitute, Lockheed began working to develop a paint with radar-suppressant qualities, but this project also proved unsuccessful.",

At the beginning of February 1959, Khrushchev opened the Soviet Communist Party Congress in Moscow by claiming that \"serial production of intercontinental ballistic rockets has been organized.\" Several months later Soviet Defense Minister Rodion Malinovsky stated that these missiles were capable of hitting \"precisely any point\" and added, \"Our army is equipped with a whole series of intercontinental, continental, and other rockets of long, medium, and short range.\" When asked at a press conference to comment on Malinovsky's statement, President Eisenhower replied, \"They also said that they invented the flying machine and the automobile and the telephone and other things.... Why should you be so respectful of this statement this morning, if you are not so respectful of the other three?\" Nevertheless, the Soviet statements were taken at face value by most Americans, including many members of the intelligence community.\n\nAs concern about Soviet missile progress increased, even the interruption in Soviet ICBM testing was seen as evidence of a Soviet advantage. Although the CIA correctly reasoned that the Soviets were experiencing difficulties in developing an operational ICBM, the Air Force assumed that the Soviets had halted testing because the missile was ready for deployment. The controversy intensified early in February 1959, when Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy testified before the Senate Preparedness Investigating Committee on Soviet missile capabilities for the next few years. McElroy told the Senators that in the early 1960s the Soviet Union might have a 3 to 1 advantage over the United States in operational ICBMs. McElroy stressed that the gap would be temporary and that at its end the United States would enjoy a technological advantage because it was concentrating on developing the more advanced solid-fueled missiles rather than increasing the number of obsolescent liquid-fueled missiles, but it was his mention of a 3 to 1 missile gap that made the headlines. Administration critics such as Senator Stuart Symington quickly charged that the actual gap would eventually be even larger. Faced with rising public and Congressional concern about the missile gap, Defense Department officials pressed President Eisenhower to authorize renewed overflights to gather up-to-date information about the status of the Soviet missile program.",

    "text": "Following a National Security Council meeting on 12 February, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Twining, Secretary of Defense McElroy, and Deputy Secretary of Defense Quarles stayed behind to talk to the President about overflights. They hoped that the need to refute criticism of the missile gap from Symington and other Democratic Senators would persuade the President to loosen his policy on the use of the U-2. McElroy pointed out that no matter how often Allen Dulles briefed these critics, they would not believe his reassurances about the absence of a missile gap without positive proof such as photographs. More overflights would be needed to obtain the kinds of photographs required. The President was not swayed by these arguments. Noting that the reconnaissance satellite project was \"coming along nicely,\" he stated that U-2 flights should be \"held to a minimum pending the availability of this new equipment.\" Quarles objected that the satellites would not be ready for up to two years, but the President replied that this did not matter because the Soviets would not be able to build a first-strike force of ICBMs in the near future. President Eisenhower finally conceded that \"one or two flights might possibly be permissible,\" but he ruled out \"an extensive program.\" In light of the \"crisis which is impending over Berlin\" he did not want to be provocative.\n\nAs the missile-gap controversy raged, President Eisenhower stuck to his refusal to permit overflights of the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union's resumption of ICBM testing almost persuaded him to change his mind. On 10 April 1959, the President tentatively approved several overflights, but, on the following day, he called in McElroy and Bissell to inform them that he was withdrawing his authorization, explaining that \"there seems no hope for the future unless we can make some progress in negotiation.\" Eisenhower remained worried by \"the terrible propaganda impact that would be occasioned if a reconnaissance plane were to fail.\" Although he agreed that new information was necessary, especially in light of the \"distortions several senators are making of our military position relative to the Soviets,\" Eisenhower believed that such information would not be worth \"the political costs.\"\n\nThe President remained willing to consider flights that did not overfly Soviet territory, and in June he authorized two electronic intelligence collection missions along the Soviet-Iranian border. The two missions of Operation HOT SHOP took place on 9 and 18 June 1959. The first of these missions was noteworthy because it involved both an Agency U-2 and an Air Force RB-57D Canberra. The two aircraft cruised along the Soviet border and made the first telemetry intercept ever from a Soviet ICBM during first-stage flight, 80 seconds after launch. Efforts to persuade the President to authorize penetration missions continued.",

    "text": "On 7 July 1959, Allen Dulles and Richard Bissell met with Eisenhower to discuss the possibility of a penetration flight to gather intelligence on the Soviet missile program. Discussions continued the following day with the addition of Secretary of State Herter, who stated in support of the CIA proposal that \"the intelligence objective outweighs the danger of getting trapped.\" The strong backing of the proposed overflight by both CIA and the State Department finally convinced President Eisenhower to approve the mission. On 9 July 1959, more than 16 months after the previous overflight of the Soviet Union, a U-2 equipped with a B camera left Peshawar, Pakistan, flew over the Urals, and then crossed the missile test range at Tyuratam. This mission, known as Operation TOUCHDOWN, produced excellent results. Its photography revealed that the Soviets were expanding the launch facilities at Tyuratam. While this overflight was underway, another U-2 flew a diversionary mission along the Soviet-Iranian border.\n\nDespite its success, this overflight remained an isolated incident. President Eisenhower was unwilling to authorize additional overflights of the Soviet Union, in part because he did not wish to increase tension before Premier Khrushchev's visit to the United States scheduled for 15-27 September 1959. Nevertheless, the President still wanted as much intelligence on the Soviet missile program as possible. Because the Soviets were conducting an extensive program of missile tests in mid-1959, Eisenhower authorized a steady stream of the less provocative electronic intelligence (ELINT)-gathering missions (14 in all) along the Soviet border during the remainder of the year.

    "text": "The Soviet missile program continued to grow. On 12 September 1959, the Soviets scored another space success when their Luna 2 rocket reached the moon, and Khrushchev stressed this success when he arrived in the United States three days later. He also boasted of Soviet missile progress in private conversations with President Eisenhower, while making no mention of overflights by the United States. After the trip was over, Khrushchev and other leading Soviet officials continued to make exaggerated claims about the extent of their missile force, adding to the confusion and concern within the US intelligence community. Thus, in November 1959, Soviet Premier Khrushchev told a conference of journalists, \"Now we have such a stock of rockets, such an amount of atomic and hydrogen weapons, that if they attack us, we could wipe our potential enemies off the face of the earth.\" He then added that \"in one year, 250 rockets with hydrogen warheads came off the assembly line in the factory we visited.\" Because the Soviet Union had been launching at least one missile per week since early fall, US policymakers placed great weight on his remarks. Despite the intelligence community's intense interest in the Soviet Union's nuclear and missile programs, President Eisenhower did not authorize any more overflights of the Soviet Union during the remainder of the year. On the other hand, he raised no objections to (and probably welcomed) the first British overflight of the Soviet Union in December 1959. For almost a year, the RAF pilots of Detachment D had been ready to fly over the Soviet Union, but Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had not previously authorized any such missions because of his own visit to the Soviet Union, several international meetings, and other state visits. As a result, British U-2 missions had been confined to the Middle East. Now that the Prime Minister's approval had been obtained, Detachment B conducted Operation HIGH WIRE with an RAF pilot. Squadron leader Robert Robinson left Peshawar on 6 December and overflew Kuybyshev, Saratov Engels Airfield, and the Kapustin Yar Missile Test Range before landing at Adana. The mission photography was excellent, but it did not provide intelligence on Soviet ICBMs, which were tested at Tyuratam, not Kapustin Yar. Because there had been so few overflights in 1958 and 1959, many questions about the Soviet missile program remained unanswered. Within the intelligence community, there was still considerable disagreement over the size of the Soviet missile force. Thus, during testimony before the US Senate in January 1960, DCI Allen Dulles, Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, and Air Force Chief of Staff Nathan Twining each gave different figures for the number of deployed Soviet missiles. Although the CIA figures were based on evidence gained from overflights, Dulles could not reveal this fact to the Senate and, therefore, faced very sharp questioning. As a result of these Senate hearings, Dulles was determined to obtain permission for more overflights to settle the missile-gap question once and for all and end the debate within the intelligence community. To accomplish this, Dulles proposed photographing the most likely areas for the deployment of Soviet missiles.",

    "text": "At this time, there was still no evidence of SS-6 ICBM deployment outside the Tyuratam missile test range. Because the SS-6 was extremely large and liquid-fueled, analysts believed these missiles could only be deployed near railroads. Existing U-2 photography showed railroad tracks going right to the launching pad at the test site. Dulles, therefore, argued that SS-6 installations could easily be located by flying along railroad lines. Dulles was supported by members of the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities. At a meeting of the board on 2 February 1960, Gen. James Doolittle urged President Eisenhower to use overflights over the Soviet Union to the maximum degree possible. The President's response, as summarized in General Goodpaster's notes of the meeting, showed that the upcoming summit meeting was already an important factor in his attitude toward U-2 flights: \"The President said that he has one tremendous asset in a summit meeting, as regards effect in the free world. That is his reputation for honesty. If one of these aircraft were lost when we are engaged in apparently sincere deliberations, it could be put on display in Moscow and ruin the President's effectiveness.\" A few days later, another U-2 took to the sky on a mission over the Soviet Union. As in December, the pilot was British, and the mission had been ordered by Prime Minister Macmillan. On 5 February 1960, a Detachment B U-2C with squadron leader John MacArthur at the controls left Peshawar, Pakistan, to conduct Operation KNIFE EDGE. The plane overflew the Tyuratam Missile Test Range, headed northwest to Kazan', and then turned south, photographing long stretches of the Soviet rail network. The excellent photography from this mission did not reveal a single missile site, but analysts did discover a new Soviet bomber, dubbed the BACKFIN, at Kazan'. Despite the outcome of this mission, the missile-gap debate continued. The Air Force still insisted that the Soviets had deployed as many as 100 missiles. The Army, Navy, and CIA, however, doubted that any had been deployed because none could be found. Additional U-2 photography was needed to settle the debate. In mid-February, President Eisenhower reviewed plans for four additional U-2 missions. The success of the two British missions, along with the absence of Soviet protests, made the President more willing to consider a resumption of US overflights, and he agreed to allow one mission to be flown during the month of March. The President's continued restrictions upon the use of the U-2 disturbed DCI Dulles, who sent a memorandum to the National Security Council on 1 March 1960 asserting that the cardinal objective of obtaining information on Soviet missile deployment could be better achieved if the U-2 were given freer rein. In authorizing another overflight of the Soviet Union, President Eisenhower directed that it be conducted before 30 March. Because of complications in getting permission from Pakistan to use the airfield at Peshawar, however, the mission could not be staged in March, and the President agreed to extend his deadline until 10 April 1960.",

As had been the case during the previous two overflights, a second U-2 flew a diversionary mission along the Soviet-Iranian border. After leaving Peshawar, mission 4155 headed first for Saryshagan, where it obtained the first pictures of two new Soviet radars, the HEN HOUSE and HEN ROOST installations. The U-2 then flew to the nuclear testing site at Semipalatinsk. Returning to the Saryshagan area, it crisscrossed the railroad network there and then proceeded to Tyuratam, where it photographed a new two-pad, road-served launch area that suggested a new Soviet missile was in the offing. In his memoirs, Nikita Khrushchev remarked that this U-2 should have been shot down: \"but our antiaircraft batteries were caught napping and didn't open fire soon enough.\" Khrushchev explained that Soviet missile designers had developed a high-altitude antiaircraft missile and batteries of this missile had been deployed near known targets of the U-2. The CIA already had strong indications of improvements in the Soviet air defense system, and early in 1960 the Development Projects Division had asked Air Force experts at the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) for a frank assessment of Soviet capabilities against the U-2. On 14 March 1960, Col. William Burke, acting chief of the DPD, relayed the ATIC assessment to Richard Bissell: The greatest threat to the U-2 is the Soviet SAM. Although the ATIC analysis concedes a remote possibility that the SAM may be less effective than estimated, their present evaluation is that the SAM (Guideline) has a high probability of successful intercept at 70,000 feet providing that detection is made in sufficient time to alert the site.",

    "text": "One of the reasons why Operation SQUARE DEAL had been selected for the 9 April flight was that mission planners believed that penetration from the Pakistan/Afghanistan area offered the greatest chance of escaping detection by the Soviet air defense system. Colonel Burke's 14 March letter recommending SQUARE DEAL as the preferred route for the next overflight had stated, \"There is a reasonable chance of completing this operation without detection.\" Escaping detection had become important because, if the Soviet SAMS received sufficient advance warning, they posed a major threat to the U-2. CIA hopes that flights from Pakistan or Afghanistan might go undetected proved false. On the 9 April overflight, the U-2's ELINT collection unit (System VI) indicated Soviet tracking at a very early stage of the mission. Although the Soviets failed to intercept the U-2, their success at tracking it should have served as a warning against future overflights from Pakistan (or anywhere else, for that matter). On 26 April 1960, Colonel Burke informed Richard Bissell that \"experience gained as a result of Operation SQUARE DEAL indicates that penetration without detection from the Pakistan/Afghanistan area may not be as easy in the future as heretofore.\" Unfortunately, neither Colonel Burke nor Richard Bissell took the logical step of recommending the cessation of overflights now that the risks had increased substantially. The lure of the prospective intelligence gain from each mission was too strong, and the Soviets' lack of success at interception to date had probably made the project staff overconfident. Furthermore, both DCI Allen D. Dulles and the President's Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities were pressing for more photos of the Soviet Union in order to settle the missile-gap debate raging in the intelligence community and Congress.",

His willingness to allow yet another overflight was strengthened when the Soviet Union did not protest the 9 April mission. As Presidential science adviser George Kistiakowsky later remarked about the lack of protest, \"This was virtually inviting us to repeat the sortie.\" Although President Eisenhower had authorized another overflight for April, he left the designation of its targets up to the experts at the CIA. Of the three missions that remained under consideration, one—Operation SUN SPOT—would overfly southern targets, Tyuratam and Vladimirovka, while the other two would cover railroad networks in the north-central portion of the Soviet Union. The intelligence community had been interested in this area ever since late 1959, when there were indications that the Soviets were building an SS-6 launch facility there. This was the first indication that SS-6s might be located anywhere other than Tyuratam testing facility, where the missiles were launched from a general purpose launching pad. The intelligence community was anxious to obtain photography of a deployed SS-6 site because it could provide exemplars for photointerpreters to use in searching subsequent overhead photography for similar installations.",

    "text": "The two proposed overflights that would cover the northern railroad lines received the strongest consideration. Both plans contained new features. Operation TIME STEP called for a U-2 to take off from the USAF base at Thule, Greenland, which would be the first overflight staged from this base. The aircraft would then fly over Novaya Zemlya on its way to cover the railroad lines from the Polyarnyy Ural Mountains to Kotlas. The return flight would be over Murmansk with the landing to take place at either Bodø or Andøya on Norway's northeast coast. The other proposed overflight, Operation GRAND SLAM, was the first U-2 mission planned to transit the Soviet Union; all previous missions had penetrated no more than halfway and then left in the general direction from which they came. GRAND SLAM proposed to fly across the Soviet Union from south to north, departing from Peshawar, Pakistan, and landing at Bodø, Norway. The mission would overfly Tyuratam, Sverdlovsk, Kirov, Kotlas, Severodvinsk, and Murmansk. The two preferred missions both required the use of the airfield at Bodø, which had been authorized by senior Norwegian intelligence and military officers. Because the Bodø airfield was involved in NATO maneuvers taking place in the Barents Sea area, Bissell informed the White House that neither mission could be flown before 19 April. Once the maneuvers ended, bad weather over the Soviet Union kept the mission from taking place. When it was originally scheduled. Richard Bissell, therefore, asked President Eisenhower for more time, and, on 25 April, General Goodpaster relayed the President's instructions to Bissell that \"one additional operation may be undertaken, provided it is carried out prior to May 1. No operation is to be carried out after May 1.\" The President did not want to fly missions any later than that because the Paris Summit was scheduled to begin on 16 May 1960. By this time, CIA planners were concentrating on Operation GRAND SLAM as the most likely route for the proposed mission because it offered the best chance of photographing suspected locations of Soviet ICBM sites. The other proposed overflight, Operation TIME STEP out of Greenland, was more likely to run into bad weather (which would affect both navigation and photography) because the flight path would remain above 60° north latitude during the entire mission. Furthermore, mission planners opposed this route because of its greater risk.",

    "text": "If the Soviets could track the U-2 early in the mission, they would have plenty of time to prepare to intercept the aircraft. The pilot selected for Operation GRAND SLAM was Francis Gary Powers, the most experienced U-2 pilot in the program. Powers had joined the project in May 1956 and had flown 27 operational missions in the U-2, including one each over the Soviet Union and China as well as six along the Soviet border. To prevent the U-2 from being seen at Peshawar, project managers decided to ferry the aircraft from Adana to Pakistan the night before the scheduled flight. Once the plane was refueled and its camera was loaded, it would take off at daybreak, with little if any exposure to local residents because of darkness and its short stay—less than six hours on the ground. Originally scheduled for Thursday, 28 April, GRAND SLAM was canceled because of bad weather over the northern Soviet Union. This had been the case for the past several weeks. When this flight was canceled, the U-2 returned to Adana before sunrise. That evening the U-2 flew back to Peshawar for another attempt to stage the mission early on the 29th, but bad weather again forced cancellation of the mission, and the U-2 returned to Adana. Because of continued bad weather over the target areas, no mission was planned for Saturday, 30 April. Meanwhile, the plane ferried to Peshawar on 27 and 28 April had accumulated so many hours of flight time that it had to be removed from service for periodic maintenance. A different aircraft was, therefore, ferried to Peshawar on Saturday night, 30 April. This aircraft, Article 360, had made a crash landing in Japan during the previous September (see chapter 5). Although it had been refurbished by Lockheed and now had the more powerful J75 engine that would give it greater altitude, Dulles did not completely trust this aircraft and considered it a \"hangar queen.\" As Powers noted in his memoirs, \"Its current idiosyncrasy was one of the fuel tanks, which wouldn’t feed all its fuel.\" The aircraft was equipped with a B-camera, a System-XI electronic intelligence unit, and a System-IX-R device, which generated false-angle information in response to the radar pulses used by some Soviet airborne-missile fire-control systems. Operation GRAND SLAM, mission 4154 and the 24th deep-penetration overflight of the Soviet Union, began almost 30 minutes late on Sunday, 1 May 1960, a delay due to difficulty in getting takeoff approval from Washington.",

    "text": "This delay was caused by communications problems that are typical at sunrise and sunset during spring and autumn, when the ionosphere will not support reliable communications. In attempting to relay the authorization message, the radio operator in Adana was unable to reach the base in Peshawar, whose codename was HBJARGON. Realizing that neither the prearranged nighttime nor daytime frequencies were working, the operator began sending a message in the clear, using one of the guard frequencies in the transition area between the daytime and nighttime frequencies. The radio operators at Peshawar kept hearing the Morse code letters IGOHB, IGOHB as they tuned from one prearranged frequency to the other. Then one of the Peshawar operators decided to tune in the guard frequency where the Morse transmission was strongest. He was able to discern a break in the letters, making the message read \"HBJGO HBJGO.\" The Peshawar operators realized this stood for \"HBJARGON Go.\" The detachment chief, Col. William Shelton, who had been waiting anxiously inside the radio van for a \"Go\" or \"No Go\" message, leaped from the van and ran across the field to give the signal for takeoff to Powers, who was sitting in the U-2C at the end of the runway. Powers started his takeoff roll at 0759Z on 1 May 1960. Once airborne, Powers guided his aircraft toward Afghanistan. Following standard operating procedure, Powers clicked his radio switch when he reached penetration altitude of 66,000 feet, which signaled the operations unit at Peshawar that everything aboard the aircraft was working and the mission would proceed as planned. Aside from this simple signal, Powers and all U-2 pilots maintained strict radio silence during penetration missions. Powers' first target was the Tyuratam Missile Test Range after which he headed for Chelyabinsk, just south of Sverdlovsk. The planned route would take him over Kyshtym, Sverdlovsk, northwest to Kirov, north over Yur'ya and Plesetsk, then to Severodvinsk, northwest to Kandalaksha, north to Murmansk, and, finally, west to Bodø, Norway. May Day turned out to be a bad time to overfly the Soviet Union. On this major holiday, there was much less Soviet military air traffic than usual, so Soviet radars could easily identify and track Powers' U-2. In addition, the Soviets responded to the intrusion by ordering a ban on civilian air traffic in a large portion of the Soviet Union. Soviet radar began tracking the U-2 when it was still 15 miles south of the Soviet-Afghan border and continued to do so as the aircraft flew across the Central Asian republics. When Powers reached the Tashkent area, as many as 13 Soviet interceptor aircraft scrambled in an unsuccessful attempt to intercept his plane. Powers never made it past Sverdlovsk.",

    "text": "Four and a half hours into the mission, an SA-2 surface-to-air missile detonated close to and just behind his aircraft and disabled it 70,500 feet above the Sverdlovsk area. The plane began spiraling down toward the ground and Powers looked for a way out. Unable to use the ejection seat because centrifugal force had thrown him against the canopy, he released the canopy and prepared to bail out, waiting to arm the destruction device at the last minute, so that it would not go off while he was still in the plane. When he released his seatbelt, however, he was immediately sucked out of the aircraft and found himself dangling by his oxygen hose, unable to reach the destruction switches. Finally, the hose broke and he flew away from the falling aircraft. After he fell several thousand feet, his parachute opened automatically, and he drifted to earth where he was quickly surrounded by farmers and then by Soviet officials. His aircraft had not been destroyed by the crash, and the Soviets were able to identify much of its equipment when they put it on display 10 days later. Even if Powers had been able to activate the destruction device, however, it would not have destroyed the aircraft. The small explosive charge was only designed to wreck the camera. How had the Soviets succeeded in downing the U-2? Although some CIA project officials initially wondered if Powers had been flying too low through an error or mechanical malfunction, he maintained that he had been flying at his assigned altitude and had been brought down by a near miss of a Soviet surface-to-air missile. This turned out to be the case, for in March 1963, the US air attaché in Moscow learned that the Sverdlovsk SA-2 battery had fired a three-missile salvo that, in addition to disabling Powers' plane, also scored a direct hit on a Soviet fighter aircraft sent aloft to intercept the U-2. Mission planners had not known about this SAM site before the mission because they always laid out flight plans to avoid known SAM sites. THE AFTERMATH OF THE U-2 DOWNING The first indication that something was wrong with Powers' mission came even before he was overdue at Bodø, Norway. The CIA Operation Center learned on 1 May at 0330 hours Washington time that the Soviets had discontinued radar tracking of the flight's progress two hours earlier (0529Z), southwest of Sverdlovsk. Although there was no word from the Soviet Union concerning the missing U-2, key project personnel assembled in the Agency control center that morning (with the exception of Bissell, who was out of town and did not arrive until 1530) to analyze",

    "text": "The latest information triggered discussions of action courses. Operation MUDLARK, a new project, was established to gather and evaluate all available information about the downed U-2. Bissell and other project officials were uncertain about Powers' fate, the plane's condition, and the camera's survival. They believed survival from a crash above 70,000 feet was impossible. Thus, they adhered to the standard cover story for U-2 flights: weather flights by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This cover story, approved by the President in 1956, was modified to fit the available information on Powers' flight, highlighting Adana as the aircraft's base to conceal Pakistan's role. This revised cover story, along with a consistent mission flight plan, was sent to the field commander at Adana and Air Force Europe headquarters. The Adana base commander announced the new cover story on May 2nd, with its print appearance the following day. On May 3rd, NASA released a statement about a missing high-altitude weather plane within Turkey. The statement explained the wreckage inside the Soviet Union by noting the pilot's reported oxygen difficulties. This allowed NASA to claim the pilot lost consciousness, leading the aircraft to drift into Soviet territory before crashing.  This statement was prepared for a \"best-case scenario,\" where neither pilot, plane, nor film survived. However, pilots had survived bailouts from extreme altitudes, and evidence from previous U-2 crashes suggested much of the aircraft could be salvaged. The small destructive charge aboard wasn't enough to destroy much beyond the camera. The tightly rolled film, revealing the mission's purpose even if the pilot and aircraft perished, was difficult to destroy. Kelly Johnson's experiment showed usable imagery could be retrieved from a completely burned-out aircraft. After almost four years of successful U-2 missions, Richard Bissell and the Development Projects Division became overconfident and unprepared for the \"worst-case\" scenario that unfolded in May 1960. This played into Khrushchev's hands, who strategically released information about the downed U-2 gradually, encouraging the US to cling to its cover story. Khrushchev aimed to confuse the US government, hoping they'd believe the plane had strayed off course. Khrushchev announced the downing of a US \"spyplane\" near Sverdlovsk on May 5th to the Supreme Soviet, omitting the pilot's fate. This sparked US media interest, prompting the State Department and NASA to reiterate the \"weather plane\" narrative, claiming the pilot got lost near the Caucasus Mountains.  The US Ambassador to Moscow then reported the pilot might be alive. Khrushchev confirmed this on May 7th, revealing the pilot's admission of spying.  This shattered the US cover story, triggering debates on the appropriate course of action. Dulles offered resignation, but Eisenhower refused, wanting to project control. On May 11th, Eisenhower claimed responsibility for the U-2 mission but remained ambiguous about future overflights, despite advising against provocative intelligence operations against the Soviet Union.",

    "text": "This revelation demolished the US cover story, and senior administration officials debated the appropriate course of action. Allen Dulles offered to resign, but President Eisenhower refused, wanting to maintain an image of control. On May 11th, Eisenhower publicly accepted responsibility for the U-2 mission but remained noncommittal about future overflights, even though he had previously endorsed ending provocative intelligence operations against the Soviet Union. The U-2 incident significantly impacted the Paris Summit, which commenced on May 16th. Khrushchev opened with a lengthy protest against the overflight, demanding an apology from Eisenhower. Eisenhower confirmed the suspension of overflights but refused to apologize formally, ending the summit and hopes of his visit to the Soviet Union. The loss of Powers' U-2 led to the termination of Detachment B in Turkey. Upon learning of Powers' capture, the Development Projects Division evacuated British pilots from Adana to protect their involvement's secrecy. Although project officials hoped for resumed flights from Adana, Eisenhower's order made this improbable. A coup against the Turkish government on May 27th, 1960, further complicated matters, and Project Headquarters halted all U-2 flights from Adana. Consequently, the remaining U-2s were disassembled and transported back to the US, except for one kept at Incirlik airbase for potential reactivation. During Detachment B's 44-month operation, 21 pilots, including four RAF pilots, flew its aircraft. While fourteen were later reassigned to other detachments, Detachment B's closure marked the end of Britain's direct involvement in U-2 operational overflights. A small RAF U-2 pilot unit remained at Detachment G until the CIA's U-2 program ended in 1974, but they never again conducted overflights for the Agency. The U-2 incident's consequences extended beyond the Paris Summit's failure and the end of Turkish operations. On July 8th, 1960, the Japanese government requested the removal of U-2s due to anti-American sentiment and media criticism. The CIA promptly closed Detachment C, returning its U-2s to the US. Amidst this, on July 1st, 1960, Soviet fighters downed an Air Force RB-47 on an intelligence mission near the Kola Peninsula, capturing two survivors. The ensuing dispute over the aircraft's location further strained international relations.  Another blow to the U-2 program came that summer when NASA, concerned about reputational damage, distanced itself from the program.",

These developments resulted in a complete halt to all U-2 operations from overseas bases for more than six months. Pilots and aircraft from Detachments B and C were consolidated into Detachment G at Edwards Air Force Base, California, the unit formed after the CIA had vacated the Nevada testing site in 1957 as a result of AEC nuclear testing. Detachment G now comprised eight pilots from Detachment B and three pilots from Detachment C. Because Powers' capture had compromised Project CHALICE, the Agency assigned a new cryptonym to the U-2 effort; henceforth, it was called Project IDEALIST.\nOSA History, chap. 12, pp. 47-49; chap. 16, p. 10 of \"Codeword\").\n\nDowned U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers underwent extensive interrogation at the hands of the Soviets. His instructions from the CIA on what to do in the event of capture were meager, and he had been told that he might as well tell the Soviets whatever they wanted to know because they could get the information from his aircraft anyway. Nevertheless, Powers tried to conceal as much classified information as possible while giving the appearance of cooperating with his captors. To extract the maximum propaganda value from the U-2 Affair, the Soviets prepared an elaborate show trial for Powers, which began on 17 August 1960. Powers continued to conceal as much information as possible, but on the advice of his Soviet defense counsel, he stated that he was sorry for his actions. The Soviet court sentenced him to 10 years' \"deprivation of liberty,\" with the first three to be spent in prison. During the next 18 months, confidential negotiations to obtain the release of Powers took place as the United States explored the possibility of trading convicted Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel for Powers. These negotiations were conducted by Abel's court-appointed defense counsel, former OSS lawyer James Donovan, in correspondence with Abel's \"wife\" (probably his Soviet control) in East Germany. In November 1961, Acting DCI Pearre Cabell wrote to Secretary of State Dean Rusk supporting such a trade, and on 10 February 1962 the actual exchange took place in the middle of the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Berlin. As part of the deal, American graduate student Frederick Pryor, who had been jailed in East Germany for espionage, was released at another location.\n\nAfter Powers returned to the United States, he underwent extensive debriefing, for many questions about his mission remained unanswered. To conduct the debriefing, the Agency immediately reconvened the Damage Assessment Team that had met for two months in the summer of 1960 to estimate what Powers knew about the overflight program and could have told Soviet interrogators. Given Powers' long involvement with the U-2 program, the team had concluded in 1960 that his knowledge was extensive and he had probably revealed most of it to the Soviets. After two weeks of debriefing Powers in February 1962, however, the team found that the damage was much less than had been estimated, and they were quite satisfied with Powers' behavior.",

    "text": "After reading the debriefing reports, Allen Dulles expressed support of Powers' actions and told Powers, \"We are proud of what you have done,\" but Dulles had already resigned as DCI in November 1961. The new DCI, John A. McCone, demanded a closer look at Powers' actions and set up a Board of Inquiry headed by retired Federal Judge E. Barrett Prettyman. After eight days of hearings and deliberation, the board reported on 27 February that Powers had acted in accordance with his instructions and had \"complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period.\" The board, therefore, recommended that he receive his back pay.\n\nThe Prettyman Board's finding was based on a large body of evidence indicating that Powers was telling the truth about the events of 1 May 1960: the testimony of the experts who had debriefed Powers after his return; a thorough investigation of Powers' background with testimony by doctors, psychiatrists, former Air Force colleagues, and his commander at Adana; Powers' own testimony before the board; the results of a polygraph examination that he had volunteered to undergo; and the evidence provided by photographs of the wreckage of his aircraft, which Kelly Johnson had analyzed and found consistent with Powers' story. Nevertheless, DCI McCone remained skeptical. He asked the Air Force to convene its own panel of experts to check Johnson's assessment of the photographs of the U-2. The Air Force quickly complied, and the panel supported Johnson's findings. McCone then seized upon the one piece of evidence that contradicted Powers' testimony—a report by the National Security Agency (NSA) that suggested that Powers may have descended to a lower altitude and turned back in a broad curve toward Sverdlovsk before being downed—and ordered the Prettyman Board to reconvene on 1 March for another look at this evidence. The board remained unconvinced by NSA's thin evidence and stuck to its original findings. A few days later, on 6 March 1962, Powers appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which commended his actions. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also held brief hearings on the U-2 Affair, with DCI McCone representing the CIA. Although all of these inquiries found Powers to have acted properly, they did not release many of their favorable findings to the public, which had received a very negative image of Powers' behavior from sensational press reports and statements by public figures who were not aware of (or chose to ignore) the truth about Powers' actions while in captivity. One member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator John J. Williams, expressed concern about the impact of this silence on Powers' reputation in a question to DCI McCone on 6 March 1962: \"Don't you think he is being left with just a little bit of a cloud hanging over him? If he did everything he is supposed to do, why leave it hanging?\" Doubts about Powers did remain in the public mind because he received no public recognition for his efforts to withhold information from the Soviets. He was also snubbed by President Kennedy, who one year earlier had warmly welcomed two Air Force RB-47 fliers released by the Soviet Union. McCone remained hostile to Powers.",

Powers' return raised the question of his future employment. John N. McMahon (DPD executive officer) and Col. Leo P. Geary (Air Force project officer) had discussed this a year earlier, noting a dilemma: the US government had portrayed the U-2 program as civilian, yet a document guaranteed Powers' reinstatement into the USAF if desired. McMahon (21 March 1961) wrote that reinstating Powers would subject the US to Soviet propaganda, portraying it as a lie. He questioned what to do with Powers if he couldn't return to the USAF. Despite this, the Air Force agreed (4 April 1962) to reinstate Powers (effective 1 July), approved by the Agency, State Department, and White House. Powers' divorce proceedings then began, and the Air Force, concerned about publicity, postponed reinstatement. Powers began working for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot. In March 1963, he met with Colonel Geary, deciding to stay with Lockheed until U-2 testing ceased (September 1969). Earlier, Powers published *Operation Overflight* about his U-2 experiences. He later worked as a traffic reporter (airplane) and then a helicopter pilot for a TV station, dying in a helicopter crash (1 August 1977).",

    "section": "Changes in Overflight Approval Procedures",
    "text": "A key change after Powers' loss was formalizing U-2 mission approvals. During the first four years, few Eisenhower administration members were involved. The President authorized all Soviet overflights, consulting with Richard Bissell, the DCI, or the DDCI. Discussions included the Secretary of State or his Under Secretary, the Joint Chiefs Chairman, the Secretary of Defense or his deputy, and the President's secretary (Col./Gen. Goodpaster). The process was unstructured, with the President consulting selected officials before deciding. In 1959, British Prime Minister Macmillan became an approving authority for RAF pilots (Detachment B). Powers' loss changed this. Macmillan ceased approvals as the remaining RAF pilots flew no more operational missions (though their use was considered). In the US, the National Security Council (NSC) Special Group formalized approvals, consisting of the DCI, Deputy Secretary of Defense, Under Secretary of State, and the President's Military Adviser. When Gen. Maxwell Taylor (Military Adviser) became Joint Chiefs Chairman (1962), McGeorge Bundy (President's Special Assistant for National Security Affairs) replaced him. Pre-mission, the CIA submitted a detailed justification with target maps, flight times, and emergency landing sites (called \"black books\"). The Special Group's decision was usually final, though controversial issues sometimes went to the President. This process wasn't immediate post-May 1960 due to a pause in U-2 operations. It began with a late October 1960 Cuban overflight.",

    "text": "Designed to obtain intelligence on Cuban air and ground order of battle and to provide geographic data for choosing an invasion site. To allay fears that mechanical problems could lead to the loss of a U-2 over Cuba, the submission to the Special Group for overflights emphasized that, if a U-2 had a flameout anywhere over Cuba, it could still glide back and make a safe landing in Florida. The Special Group approved Operation KICK OFF but stipulated that only two overflights could be made. Detachment G staged the Cuban missions from Laughlin AFB near Del Rio, Texas, a base used by SAC U-2 aircraft. Agency photo interpreters went to Del Rio to read out the photography after these missions. The two flights, on 26 and 27 October 1960, were very long missions, covering 3,500 miles and lasting over nine hours. Because of cloud cover over Cuba, the results of both missions were poor. The Agency, therefore, asked the Special Group to approve additional missions. After receiving authorization, Detachment G conducted three missions (Operation GREEN EYES) on 27 November and 5 and 11 December 1960 with good results.\n\nOverflights of Cuba continued under the new administration of President Kennedy. Under the codename Operation LONG GREEN, two overflights on 19 and 21 March 1961, photographed Cuba extensively to aid the final preparations for the invasion. Two weeks later Detachment G again deployed from Edwards AFB, California, to Laughlin AFB, Texas. Beginning on 6 April, Detachment G U-2s made 15 flights over Cuba to provide photographic coverage of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion and its aftermath. These flights were known as Operation FLIP TOP.",

    "text": "Long missions conducted over Cuba in late 1960 and over Southeast Asia in early 1961 pointed out the need to increase the range of the U-2. In May 1961, Lockheed began modifying Agency U-2s so that they could be refueled in flight to extend their operating range. The six Agency aircraft that were modified to achieve this capability received the designation U-2F. All Agency U-2 pilots then underwent training in the techniques of in-flight refueling.\n\nRefueling a U-2 in flight was a very delicate task. When fully loaded with fuel, KC-135 tankers found it difficult to reduce airspeed to 200 knots, the safest speed for refueling a U-2. As for the U-2s, they were in a very vulnerable position when approaching a tanker at 200 knots because their frail wings could not stand much stress. As a result, U-2 pilots had to approach the KC-135 tankers very carefully in order to avoid the vortexes from the wingtips of the tanker and the turbulence caused by the four large jet engines. During the first few years of refueling operations, two U-2s crashed after their wings broke off as they crossed into the turbulent area behind the tankers; one of the pilots was killed.\n\nThe in-flight refueling capability was a useful modification to the U-2, but it would not dramatically extend mission length. The main limiting factor remained pilot fatigue, which prevented missions from lasting longer than approximately 10 hours.",

    "text": "Cuba remained a high-priority target even after the Bay of Pigs invasion failed in April 1961. Soon afterward, Detachment G U-2s began flying monthly missions over Cuba in a program known as Project NIMBUS. Most of the flights were staged from Laughlin AFB, Texas, but three were flown from Edwards AFB, California, using in-flight refueling to extend the range of the aircraft. By the spring of 1962, having received reports of increased Soviet activity in Cuba, the CIA requested permission for additional photographic coverage of the island. The Special Group authorized increasing the number of Cuban overflights to at least two per month, beginning in May 1962. At the same time, the National Photographic Interpretation Center began publishing a Photographic Evaluation of Information on Cuba series.\n\nBy early August 1962, CIA analysts had noted a substantial increase in Soviet arms deliveries to Cuba during the preceding weeks. The first U-2 overflight in August, mission 3086 on the 5th, flew too soon to detect the Soviet construction program just getting underway at various sites in Cuba. A second mission (3088) was originally set for 8 August, but bad weather forced repeated postponements until 29 August. This mission's photography provided the first hard evidence of the nature of the Soviet buildup in Cuba. Two days after the mission, the CIA reported in the President's Intelligence Checklist that there were at least eight surface-to-air missile (SA-2) sites in the western half of Cuba. (The map on page 202 shows the routes taken by the two August overflights.)\n\nOn 5 September the next U-2 overflight (mission 3089) provided more evidence of the Soviet buildup. The mission's photography showed three more SAM sites and also revealed a MiG-21, one of the newest Soviet fighter aircraft, at the Santa Clara airfield. The discovery of SAMs in Cuba had a twofold effect on the US reconnaissance effort over Cuba. First, it added substance to DCI McCone's fears that Cuba might become a base for Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (he argued that SAM sites would only be set up to protect high-priority facilities such as missile bases). At this time, however, McCone's suspicions were not shared by other officials in the Agency or the administration. The second and most significant effect of the discovery of SAMs in Cuba was to make the administration far more cautious in its use of U-2s for reconnaissance of the island. As the loss of Francis Gary Powers' U-2 in May 1960 had demonstrated, the U-2 was very vulnerable to the SA-2 missile.",

He argued that the loss of an aircraft on a mission that combined both types of flights would make it difficult for the United States to stand on its rights to fly over international waters. Bundy and Carter therefore agreed to split the proposed reconnaissance program into four missions: two overflights and two peripheral flights, all planned for maximum safety. The overflights were thus designed to be quick \"in-and-out\" operations across the narrow width of the island instead of flights along the entire length of Cuba, as had been the case previously. (As the map on page 202 illustrates, the 5 September mission was the last one to fly along the length of the island.) As an additional precaution, flight paths would be laid out to avoid known SAM sites. Although these changes greatly reduced the danger to the U-2, they slowed the gathering of information on the Soviet buildup by reducing each mission's coverage. To ensure that the photographs taken by these missions were of the highest quality, the CIA decided to conduct flights only when the weather along the flight routes was less than 25 percent overcast. Weather proved to be a major problem during the month of September. Unfavorable forecasts (along with a brief stand-down of U-2 overflights after the loss of the Nationalist Chinese U-2) prevented the launching of any missions from 6 through 16 September. Moreover, when mission 3091 finally flew on 17 September, the favorable weather forecast proved inaccurate and heavy clouds prevented the mission from obtaining usable photography. Bad weather continued to rule out missions until 26 September, when mission 3093 covered eastern Cuba and found three additional \"SAM sites.\" Three days later mission 3095 flew over the Isle of Pines and Bay of Pigs area, finding one more SAM site and a coastal-defense cruise missile site.",

    "text": "The cautious series of U-2 flights in September had turned up many more SAM sites but no concrete evidence of the presence of surface-to-surface missiles. Growing impatient with the restrictions that had been placed on U-2 overflights of Cuba, DCI McCone told the Special Group on 4 October 1962 that their policy of avoiding SAM sites had restricted the Agency to using the U-2 only in Cuba's southeastern quadrant. He questioned whether this was a reasonable restriction at this time, particularly since the SAMs were almost certainly not operational. The Special Group then requested the preparation of an overall program for reconnaissance of Cuba in time for its next meeting on 9 October. In the meantime, CIA U-2s continued the reconnaissance program that the Special Group had approved in September. In early October two peripheral missions—3098 along the southeastern coast on 5 October and 3100 along the northern coast on 7 October (see map on page 203)—discovered an additional five SAM sites. This brought the total to 19, but there was still no evidence of surface-to-surface missiles. Evidence was mounting that the portion of Cuba that the September and early October missions had avoided was the most likely location for Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs). On 6 October 1962, the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance recommended frequent and regular coverage of Cuba, pointing in particular to the need for renewed coverage of western Cuba: The absence of coverage of the western end since August 29, coupled with the rate of construction we have observed, means that there may well be many more sites now being built of which we are unaware. Ground observers have in several recent instances reported sightings of what they believe to be the SS-4 (SHYSTER) MRBM in Cuba. These reports must be confirmed or denied by photo coverage.",

On 9 October the Special Group met to discuss COMOR's recommendations, the most important of which was a U-2 flight over the \"suspect MRBM site as soon as weather permits.\" This mission was also designed to pass over one of the SA-2 sites that was thought to be most nearly operational in order to determine the status of SA-2 defenses of Cuba. If this overflight did not provoke an SA-2 reaction, the study recommended \"maximum coverage of the western end of the island by multiple U-2s simultaneously.\" Because the danger posed by the SA-2 sites was one of the major topics at the Special Group meeting, DCI McCone brought along Col. Jack C. Ledford (USAF), head of the Office of Special Activities, who presented a vulnerability analysis that estimated the odds of losing a U-2 over Cuba at 1 in 6. The Special Group approved the recommended flight over San Cristobal. As the Special Group meeting was breaking up, Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric and the Air Force representative questioned the adequacy of the Agency's cover story, which was that its pilots were Lockheed employees on a ferry flight to Puerto Rico. The Air Force and DOD representatives argued that it would be better to use Air Force pilots and state in the event of a mishap that the overflight was a routine Air Force peripheral surveillance mission that had gone off course. McCone then asked Colonel Ledford's opinion of the proposed change. Ledford agreed that the DOD cover story was better but pointed out that the SAC U-2s were much more vulnerable than those of the Agency, which had superior electronic countermeasures and a higher maximum altitude. Ledford then suggested that Air Force pilots use Agency aircraft after receiving familiarization training. After leaving the Special Group meeting, McCone and Gilpatric met with President Kennedy, who approved the San Cristobal mission and the use of Air Force pilots. Two days later (11 October), Air Force and CIA representatives met to discuss the change in cover stories. Herbert Scoville, CIA Deputy Director for Research, agreed that in the long run the Air Force cover story was best but emphasized that an Air Force pilot should not be used until he had received adequate training. The conversation then turned to the issue of who would run the next mission, the CIA or the Air Force. Strongly favoring Air Force control of the U-2 missions over Cuba, the DOD representatives called DCI McCone and obtained his consent. Shortly thereafter, McCone left",

    "text": "Memorandum for DCI McCone from Deputy Director (Research), \"The Chronology of Events Leading to the Transfer of Cuban Overflight Responsibility,\" 23 February 1963, DCI Records...\n\nPhoto of Marshall S. Carter\n\nMarshall S. Carter emphasized... Air Force control of the Cuban overflights became official on 12 October, when President Kennedy transferred \"responsibility, to include command and control and operational decisions, with regard to U-2 reconnaissance overflights of Cuba\" from the CIA to the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Air Force then asked to borrow two of CIA's U-2Cs. The Acting DCI, Lt. Gen. Marshall S. Carter, US Army, reacted strongly to the Air Force takeover of a major CIA operation. At one point he remarked, \"I think it's a hell of a way to run a railroad. It's perfectly obviously a geared operation to get SAC in the act.\" In a series of conversations with high-ranking Air Force and administration officials, Carter argued against changing command and control of the flights at such a crucial time. The Agency operation, Carter pointed out, was already in place and working well, whereas the Air Force lacked experience in controlling U-2 overflights, particularly with the U-2C, which was not in the Air Force inventory. Carter also noted that Air Force pilots lacked experience with the more powerful J75 engines in the U-2C. He told Roswell Gilpatric, \"To put in a brand new green pilot just because he happens to have on a blue suit and to completely disrupt the command and control and communication and ground support system on 72 hours' notice to me doesn't make a God damn bit of sense, Mr. Secretary.\" DDCI Carter admitted that the Air Force's cover story was probably better than the CIA's but suggested at one point, \"Let's take one of my boys and put him in a blue suit.\" Realizing, however, that the pilot would probably have to come from the Air Force, Carter concentrated his efforts on trying to convince DOD and administration officials to conduct an orderly transition by allowing the CIA to continue its operation for a few weeks using an Air Force pilot, and the Air Force gradually taking over command and control. Carter's efforts were in vain. The Air Force insisted on immediate control of the operation, and administration officials were unwilling to become involved in what they perceived as a jurisdictional dispute. Presidential Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy told DDCI Carter that \"the whole thing looks to me like two quarreling children.\" Furthermore, no one wanted to speak out against a decision that the President had already made.",

    "text": "Once the decision was clearly irrevocable, the Agency gave its complete support to the Air Force in preparing for the upcoming overflight. A SAC U-2 pilot had already arrived unannounced at the CIA's U-2 Detachment at Edwards Air Force Base on 11 October, and the CIA U-2 detachment put him through a hasty training program to familiarize him with the U-2C. By Sunday, 14 October 1962, the weather over Cuba had cleared, and the first SAC overflight of the island took place. When the U-2 returned, its film was rushed to the National Photographic Interpretation Center. By late evening of 15 October, photointerpreters had found evidence of the presence of MRBMs in the San Cristobal area. NPIC Director Arthur Lundahl immediately notified DDI Ray Cline, who in turn notified DDCI Carter (DCI McCone had again left town). As the readout progressed and the evidence became firmer, the DDI notified National Security Adviser Bundy and Roger Hilsman of the Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, who informed Secretary of State Dean Rusk. On the following morning, 16 October, DDCI Carter briefed the President on the results of the 14 October mission.\n\nNow that the presence of Soviet medium-range surface-to-surface missiles in Cuba had been confirmed, the rules for U-2 mission approval changed. The Strategic Air Command received blanket approval to fly as many missions as needed to cover Cuba completely, without again consulting the Special Group. During the week that followed the discovery of the missiles, SAC U-2s conducted multiple missions each day (see map on page 203). U-2 photography was supplemented by low-level photography taken by high-performance Navy and Air Force aircraft. Throughout the remainder of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Agency's U-2 pilots remained idle, but the photointerpreters at NPIC did yeoman service in studying the thousands of feet of film returned by Air Force and Navy reconnaissance aircraft. President Kennedy used NPIC photographs to illustrate his address to the nation on 22 October 1962, when he revealed the Soviet missile buildup in Cuba and declared his \"naval quarantine\" to prevent the shipment of offensive weapons to Cuba. On 27 October, at the height of the crisis, one of the U-2Cs lent by the Agency to the Air Force was shot down over Cuba, killing the pilot, Maj. Rudolph Anderson. This loss again illustrated the U-2's vulnerability to the SA-2 missile. Nevertheless, SAC U-2 overflights continued, both during and after the crisis. Responsibility for photographic coverage of Cuba remained with the Air Force; Agency pilots never flew another mission over the island.",

    "text": "Although SAC carried out most of the U-2 activity during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Agency's U-2 missions had made vital contributions during the initial stages of the crisis. In all, Project IDEALIST pilots had spent 459 hours overflying Cuba during 1961 and 1962. They had provided concrete evidence of the Soviet buildup on the island, evidence that was simply not available through any other means. Although by late 1962 photographic satellites had become an integral part of the overhead collection program, only U-2s could provide the highly detailed photography that photointerpreters needed to spot the early stages of work on missile sites. Attempts had been made to photograph Cuba with satellites, but to no avail because the satellites' normal orbits placed them over Cuba at the wrong time of day, after clouds had formed.\n\nU-2s Over South America\n\nAgency U-2s again conducted operations in the Western Hemisphere in December 1963. The Directorate of Plans had requested photographic coverage of Venezuela and neighboring British Guiana because of guerrilla activities conducted by a pro-Castro movement inside Venezuela. Supplies for this movement appeared to be coming across the border from British Guiana. On 30 November 1963, the NSC Special Group approved overflights of the British Guiana-Venezuela border to determine the scope and rate of buildup of guerrilla forces. The Special Group stipulated that the entire effort was to be conducted without the knowledge of either the British or the Venezuelans. Within three days, several Detachment G aircraft and pilots deployed to Ramey AFB, Puerto Rico, from which they made six flights over the border areas between 3 and 19 December 1963 in an operation known as SEAF0RM. The results of the effort were inconclusive, and the task force returned to Edwards AFB on 22 December.\n\nU-2 OPERATIONS IN ASIA\n\nDetachment C and the Indonesian Revolt of 1958\n\nU-2 operations in Asia began even before the end of overflights of the Soviet Bloc. By 1958 the Eisenhower administration, although very reluctant to approve U-2 flights over or near Soviet and East European borders, was not averse to using the spyplanes in the Third World, where radar detection was unlikely.

By 25 September 1957, the National Security Council had become concerned with the course of events in Indonesia and on its recommendation President Eisenhower authorized the Agency to \"employ all feasible covert means\" to support the dissidents. Planning for increased aid of all types began immediately, and in January 1958 a US arms shipment for the dissidents arrived in Sumatra. Then on 10 February, the situation came to a head. While Sukarno was out of the country on a state visit to Japan, the dissident army colonels, without consulting CIA, organized a Revolutionary Council in Padang, West Sumatra, and demanded the abolition of President Sukarno's \"guided democracy.\" Five days later, this council proclaimed itself the new \"Revolutionary Government\" of Indonesia. President Sukarno's armed forces responded swiftly to this threat. In late February the Indonesian Air Force began bombing dissident strongholds, and by mid-March government forces were conducting an all-out air-sea-land drive against the rebel-held areas in central Sumatra. Although the Sumatran rebels were falling back, additional unrest broke out over 1,800 miles away in the islands of Celebes (Sulawesi), and CIA quickly began supplying weapons to these dissidents, too.\n\nIncreasingly involved in Indonesia, the Agency urgently needed accurate information on the situation there. As in previous crises, U-2s flew reconnaissance missions. On 24 March 1958, the Development Projects Staff moved the entire complement of Detachment C's pilots and planes from Japan to a base more easily accessible to Indonesia: Cubi Point Naval Air Station in the Philippines. Cubi Point was far from any facility that could develop and interpret the U-2 photographs, so two Photo-Intelligence Division employees went to Clark Airfield, just 30 minutes by air from Cubi Point, to establish a forward processing center. They arrived on 28 March and had the photo lab ready to go on the following day.",

    "text": "The first U-2 mission over Indonesia took place on 28 March 1958. By 12 June, when the operation was phased out, Detachment C U-2s had flown 30 missions over the major islands of Indonesia. Sanitized photos from these missions were used to brief members of the DDP's Covert Action Staff (CAS), who were in charge of a small force of World War II-vintage aircraft such as P-51s and B-26s used to support the rebel troops. The CIA's proprietary, Civil Air Transport, supplied the aircraft, which were based on the Indonesian island of Morotai and flown by mercenary pilots. Desperately short of pilots, the CAS asked if some of the U-2 pilots with experience in World War II aircraft could be detailed to the Morotai effort. Although such a request represented an improper use of the highly trained U-2 pilots and posed a potential threat to the entire U-2 program if one of them were captured, Richard Bissell agreed to send pilots James Cherbonneaux and Carmine Vito to help. Both were experienced with World War II aircraft, although Vito had never flown the rebels' fighter aircraft, the P-51 Mustang. After arriving on Morotai, Cherbonneaux explained to Vito how to fly the fast and powerful Mustang while the two were sitting at a makeshift bar on the edge of the airfield. Several days later, when Cherbonneaux was off the island on another mission, a flight of Indonesian twin-engine bombers of Czechoslovak manufacture was spotted making its way toward the island. Exclaiming, \"I'm not going to sit around and wait to be bombed,\" Vito had a Filipino mechanic start up a P-51 sitting on the tarmac. In his first and only flight in a P-51, Vito managed to get the plane off the ground. Once he was airborne and turned in the direction of the lumbering bombers, they all took flight in as many directions as there were aircraft. After firing a few .50-caliber rounds in the direction of the closest bomber, Vito circled the field and landed the aircraft safely.",

By early May, Central Government forces had taken most of the remaining rebel strongholds, and the Sumatran rebellion was deteriorating into small-scale guerrilla activity.

Pope's capture ended Allen Dulles's enthusiasm for the effort, and President Eisenhower also wanted no more part of it. The US Government rapidly withdrew its support, and the remaining remnants of the rebellion collapsed. Four years later, the Indonesians freed Pope after Attorney General Robert Kennedy personally appealed to President Sukarno. When the revolt ended, the U-2s returned to Atsugi.

On 11 August, People's Liberation Army (PLA) artillery began bombarding the offshore islands of Quemoy and Little Quemoy, where the Nationalists had stationed large numbers of troops to ward off any invasion. On 23 August the Communists increased the shelling. After five days of intense bombardment, which made resupply of the islands from Taiwan impossible, the PLA commander ordered the Nationalist garrisons to surrender, intimating that an invasion was imminent. The Nationalists refused to surrender and received support from the United States in the form of warships from the 7th Fleet, which began escorting Nationalist ships carrying supplies to the beleaguered garrisons. During this period, Detachment C U-2s flew four missions over the mainland, searching for troop movements that would indicate that the PRC was planning to invade the islands. Photos from these missions showed no evidence of a PRC buildup, but the atmosphere in the region remained tense. Detachment C U-2s flew two more missions (9 September and 22 October) to monitor PRC troop movements and again found no indications of preparations for an invasion. The Offshore Islands Crisis receded in late October 1958 after the PRC learned that it would not receive support from the Soviet Union if the crisis escalated into a confrontation with the United States.",

    "text": "One important area of DDP activity during this period was Tibet. In March 1959, the PLA suppressed an uprising against the Chinese occupation of Tibet, and several thousand Tibetans fled the country along with their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. Afterward, Agency operatives from the DDP's Far East Division began training some of these Tibetan refugees for paramilitary operations inside Tibet. Once the Tibetans completed their training, FE Division planned to parachute them back into Tibet. Such missions, however, required detailed maps and aerial photographs of the areas of operation. Richard Bissell, therefore, obtained permission from the President to use Detachment C U-2s to provide the necessary photography.\n\nOperation MILTOWN, as the reconnaissance missions over Tibet were known, consisted of two missions staged from Cubi Point Naval Air Station on 12 and 14 May 1959. The photography revealed that Communist China had built new roads with supply and defense points. Agency photointerpreters also discovered two large new airfields at elevations above 13,000 feet. Later in the year, the Far East Division needed photographs and maps of another area of Tibet. To conceal the target of this new operation, which was codenamed SOUTH GATE, the Development Projects Division planned and flew a total of six missions covering much of Southeast Asia—Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Burma—as well as the desired area in Tibet. Only four of the missions involved the area of operational interest. Five of the flights took place between 29 August and 9 September, and one additional flight (Operation QUICK KICK) followed on 4 November. All of these missions were \"Fast Move\" operations in which necessary supplies and personnel flew to a remote staging area in a C-130, where they rendezvoused with a U-2 that had been ferried in. The staging base in this case was Takhli, Thailand. These flights did not go unnoticed; on 13 September 1959, Hong Kong's China Post published a story headlined \"U-2 of USAF Said Reconnoitering Red China at Unreachable Altitude!.\"",

The first of these U-2Cs arrived at Detachment C in the summer of 1959. During a test flight of this aircraft (article 360) on 24 September 1959, the pilot decided to set a new altitude record. Although the plane was equipped with a camera, it carried no film and did not have a full load of fuel, which made it considerably lighter than an operational U-2C. As a result, the plane reached 76,400 feet—the highest altitude achieved by any of the original U-2 aircraft. In the process, however, the aircraft consumed more fuel than was called for in the test flight plan, causing the engine to flame out during the return to base. The pilot then made an emergency wheels-up landing at a glider-club strip near Fujisawa, south of Atsugi. The crash did not cause any injuries or serious damage to the aircraft, but it did bring unwanted publicity to the U-2 program. Much of the publicity resulted from the actions of Detachment C's security unit, whose conspicuous Hawaiian shirts and large pistols drew the attention of Japanese reporters. One reporter even flew over the area in a helicopter, taking pictures of the U-2. These photographs appeared in many Japanese newspapers and magazines.",

    "text": "Flights by Detachment C U-2s over Tibet and western China continued during the first half of 1960 under Operation TOPPER. The first mission on 30 March was very successful. The second mission on 5 April took good photographs but encountered mechanical problems. At the start of the mission, the landing-gear doors failed to close completely, resulting in increased drag and higher fuel consumption. With no fuel gauge to warn the pilot of the critical fuel situation, the aircraft ran out of fuel far short of Takhli, forcing the pilot to make a crash landing in a rice paddy. The area was inaccessible to large vehicles, and the plane (article 349) had to be cut into pieces in order to remove it. With the help of local villagers, the retrieval team disassembled the aircraft for transport to the base, where the pieces were loaded onto a C-124 under cover of darkness. The crash and subsequent recovery of the U-2 did not attract the attention of the press; there was only one report in a local Thai newspaper, which simply referred to the crash of a jet plane. In appreciation for the assistance provided by the villagers, I gave the headman funds to build a new school.\n\nThe loss of two aircraft in slightly more than six months left Detachment C with just two aircraft. Fortunately, the level of mission activity remained low because Detachment C was no longer conducting overflights of the Soviet Union. One important remaining mission was high-altitude air sampling (HASP), in which specially equipped U-2s gathered upper-altitude air samples to look for evidence of Soviet nuclear testing. The direction of the prevailing winds made Detachment C ideally situated for this activity, which began in the fall of 1958 and continued in 1959. In late April 1960, Detachment C was preparing to stage to the Philippines to conduct additional air-sampling missions when the loss of Powers' U-2 temporarily halted all U-2 activities. The publicity generated by the U-2 incident stirred considerable controversy in Japan, and there were soon demonstrations against the continuing presence of U-2s in Japan. On 6 June 1960, project headquarters decided on a phased-out withdrawal of Detachment C between 15 July and 1 September, but this timetable had to be accelerated when the Japanese Government formally requested the removal of the U-2s on 8 July.",

This detachment was now responsible for providing coverage in Asia, and its first mission came in Laos. After the neutralist Laotian government of Souvanna Phouma collapsed in early December 1960, reports began circulating that leftist antigovernment forces were using Soviet arms. Then, on 30 December, a new Laotian government appealed for UN aid against what it said was an invasion from North Vietnam and possibly Communist China. Alarmed over the possibility of the civil war expanding because of the introduction of foreign troops, the Eisenhower administration ordered Detachment G to gather more information on the events in Southeast Asia.\n\nFive Detachment G pilots and planes were ferried to Cubi Point Naval Air Station in the Philippines to conduct an operation known as POLECAT. During the period 3 to 18 January 1961, these U-2s made seven flights over Laos and North Vietnam. To search for the reported foreign troops, these missions concentrated on the lines of communications leading into Laos from North Vietnam and China. In addition, the U-2s scanned North Vietnamese airfields for Soviet aircraft to determine the magnitude of the airdrop operation allegedly supporting the Pathet Lao troops. NPIC sent photointerpreters to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines to obtain an immediate readout of the results of each mission. The photography did not substantiate the Laotian claims, and on 26 January, the Laotian government retracted its charges of a foreign invasion. Detachment G's U-2s returned to California in early February 1961.",

    "text": "Detachment G U-2s made four more overflights of the Sino-Indian border areas in January 1963, which led to a PRC protest to India. Photography from these missions was used in January and again in March 1963 to brief Prime Minister Nehru, who then informed the Indian Parliament about Communist Chinese troop movements along the border. Although Nehru did not reveal the source of his intelligence, a UPI wire story surmised that the information had been obtained by U-2s. The United States had provided photographic coverage of the border area to India for two reasons. First of all, US policymakers wanted a clear picture of the area under dispute. In addition, the intelligence community wanted to establish a precedent for overflights from India, which could lead to obtaining a permanent staging base in India for electronic reconnaissance missions against the Soviet ABM site at Saryshagan and photographic missions against those portions of western China that were out of range of Detachment H. In April 1963, Ambassador Galbraith and the Chief of Station at New Delhi made the first official request to India for a base. The following month, President Kennedy agreed to DCI McCone's suggestion to raise the question of a U-2 base in India when he met with India's President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan on 3 June. This meeting resulted in an Indian offer of an abandoned World War II base at Charbatia, south of Calcutta. The Charbatia base was in poor condition and needed considerable renovation before it could be used for U-2 operations. Work on the base by the Indians took much longer than expected, so Detachment G continued to use Ta Khli when it staged four sorties over Tibet from 29 September to 10 November 1963. In addition to the coverage of the Sino-Indian border during this series of flights, the U-2s also photographed all of Thailand to produce a photomap of the border regions as a quid pro quo for the Thai Government. During one of these photomapping missions, a U-2 pilot conducted the longest mission ever recorded in this aircraft—11 hours and 45 minutes. At the end of this flight on 10 November 1963, the pilot was in such poor physical condition that project managers prohibited the scheduling of future missions longer than 10 hours.",

In March and April 1963, the USIB met to consider COMOR proposals for aerial reconnaissance of Laos, North Vietnam, North Korea, and the People's Republic of China. All of COMOR's intelligence requirements could best be met by the U-2 because heavy cloud cover made it difficult to obtain satellite photography of the region. At the 28 May 1963 meeting of the Special Group, DCI McCone requested authorization for a series of overflights to meet these requirements and stressed the need for additional intelligence on the atomic energy facilities of the PRC. The Special Group then established a \"bank\" of four authorizations for overflights of the PRC, subject to monthly review by the Group. As a result of the increasing intelligence community interest in the Far East, both Agency U-2 detachments became very active in the region. Detachment G conducted several missions over the border areas of China, North Vietnam, and Laos during April and May of 1963. At the same time, Detachment H became more adventurous, sending U-2s deeper and deeper into the PRC. These missions included renewed overflights of the missile test range near Baotou and the Lan-chou nuclear facilities, as well as targets in northern China, Manchuria, and west-central China (as far as Koko Nor). The increased level of U-2 activity in the Far East during the spring of 1963 exposed a serious weakness in Projects IDEALIST and TACKLE: a shortage of aircraft. The Agency only had seven flyable U-2s when the TACKLE overflights of the PRC began in January 1962, and one of these aircraft had already been lost during an overflight in September 1962. To deal with this shortage, DCI McCone asked Defense Secretary McNamara and the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 10 June 1963 to transfer two U-2s from the Air Force to the CIA. The Defense Department quickly approved this request. Before the two Air Force aircraft were placed in service, however, the Agency had them upgraded with J75/P-13A engines and various electronic devices, a process that took more than four months. As overflights over the PRC increased, so did concern about the growing number of Chinese surface-to-air missile sites. The Office of Special Activities, therefore, got permission from the Defense Department to equip Project TACKLE aircraft with System-XII SAM-warning units. These devices alerted the pilot that his aircraft was being tracked by the FAN SONG acquisition radar, part of the SA-2's electronic targeting system. The System-XII units also recorded each radar-tracking sequence. Analysis of these recordings revealed changes in the FAN SONG radar's characteristics, information that proved useful in designing electronic-countermeasure (ECM) devices for US aircraft operating over Vietnam during the late 1960s.",

    "text": "Despite the addition of System-XII in the spring of 1963, the Nationalist Chinese-piloted U-2s of Project TACKLE had far fewer ECM devices than other Agency U-2s. Project IDEALIST aircraft possessed a complete suite of ECM gear in addition to the previously mentioned System-XII unit. Among this ECM equipment was a device that told the pilot that an SA-2 missile had been launched (nicknamed the \"Oscar-Sierra\" unit, which was the acronym for the expletive U-2 pilots used when they learned that an SA-2 missile was on the way: \"Oh, shit!\") and a System-XIII unit that produced false-angle returns to the homing radar aboard the approaching missile in an effort to steer it away from the aircraft. The Defense Department opposed installing such devices aboard Detachment H's U-2s, for fear they could fall into Communist hands. The danger posed by the growing number of SA-2 sites in the PRC was clearly demonstrated on 1 November 1963, when a second Project TACKLE U-2 was lost near the Kiangsi-Chekiang border on its way back from photographing the PRC's Shuangchengzi missile test range. As was the case after the first operational loss over China in September 1961, President Kennedy ordered a standdown of overflights of mainland China. This standdown lasted almost five months. As a result of this second loss over the PRC, the Office of Special Activities began installing a new 30-channel telemetry system aboard Detachment H U-2s to monitor various aircraft functions. Known as BIRDWATCHER, this unit periodically broadcast a burst of data to the airbase that launched the U-2. This data burst contained a status report on all the major systems aboard the plane, such as airspeed, altitude, exhaust temperature, fuel supply, film supply, and oxygen supply. BIRDWATCHER provided project managers with a benchmark of aircraft performance that could be used to determine if a lost plane had been shot down at altitude or had suffered mechanical failure.",

    "text": "'s first operational use ca111e on 16 March 1964, when overflights resumed with a mission over southern China. The PRC was now a high-priority target for the U-2 because more data were needed to prepare National Intelligence Estimates. Of particular concern was the PRC's nuclear program. Despite the high priority of its missions, Detachment H's resources remained scarce. It was short of both pilots and planes and never had more than three U-2s or six qualified Nationalist Chinese pilots at any one time. By the spring of 1964, crashes during training and the two losses over the mainland had reduced Detachment H to only two qualified pilots, one of whom suffered from ulcers and a nervous disorder.\n\nIndeed, this pilot had every reason to be nervous; he flew three of the next four Detachment H overflights and became the third Nationalist Chinese pilot to be shot down over the mainland. This loss came on 7 July 1964. The Nationalist Chinese pilot's last transmission was that his System-XII unit had alerted him that he was being tracked by the FAN SONG radar. BIRDWATCHER data revealed that the aircraft was at penetration altitude and all systems were normal when the pilot made this report. Project managers presumed that the U-2 was downed by a direct hit or near miss by an SA-2 missile.\n\nPresident Johnson ordered a stand down of overflights of the PRC. This stand down was welcomed by the Nationalist Chinese government, which told the Taiwan Chief of Station that it wanted \"to let some time go by\" before more overflights were scheduled. The Nationalists pointed out that the only remaining qualified U-2 pilot had \"disqualified\" himself because of nervous tension. No new pilots could be qualified for U-2 flights before mid-August. The Nationalists then demanded faster and higher flying aircraft as well as better antimissile equipment for the planes. This request led some CIA personnel to suspect that Nationalist China had learned about Project OXCART, the successor to the U-2 that was still undergoing testing. Despite the Nationalists' request for better ECM equipment, the Defense Department remained reluctant to authorize the use of the System-XIII false-angle radar jammer on Project TACKLE U-2s. The Defense Department feared that the loss of this device with its highly advanced traveling-wave tube (TWT) would enable Communist Bloc technicians to devise countermeasures and also learn how to produce the highly efficient TWT themselves. As an incentive for the Nationalist Chinese to agree to more overflights, the CIA agreed to permit them to process the U-2 film on Taiwan and to use their own photointerpreters to exploit the film along with US photointerpreters.\n\nTo counter the shortage of pilots in Detachment H, DCI McCone suggested to the Special Group on 6 August 1964 that civilian CIA pilots be used to fly missions over mainland China. The group agreed that the matter should be taken up with President Johnson. On the following day, however, Presidential National Security Assistant McGeorge Bundy informed McCone that, because Secretary of State Rusk and Secretary of Defense McNamara opposed the idea, he would not take it up with the President.",

    "text": "Advanced ECM Equipment for Detachment H\n\nDemand for overhead photography of the PRC continued to grow, spurred in part by the results of earlier U-2 missions that revealed the presence of Soviet-made MiG-21s in the PRC. In addition, there were indications that Communist China might be producing its own SAMs. Furthermore, satellite photography revealed that preparations for the first Chinese nuclear test were almost complete at the Lop Nor test site. The need for photographs of the Lop Nor site was considered so urgent that the Defense Department finally relented and permitted the System-XIII false-angle device jammer to be installed in Project TACKLE aircraft, with the proviso that it not be turned on until after the pilot had been alerted by System-XII that he was being tracked by FAN SONG radars. Photographing Lop Nor, however, was not a simple task. Located more than 2,000 miles west-northwest of Taiwan, Lop Nor lay beyond the round trip range of Tao-yuan-based U-2s and in-flight refueling was not possible. Lop Nor was closer to Ta Khli, Thailand, only 1,650 miles northwest of that base, and much closer to Charbatia, India, which lay only 1,200 miles south of the testing site. After refusing DCI McCone's suggestion to stage a Lop Nor overflight from Charbatia using a CIA civilian pilot, President Johnson approved a proposal to send a Project TACKLE unit to Ta Khli for the mission to Lop Nor. A Detachment H U-2 with a Nationalist Chinese pilot deployed to Ta Khli in mid-October to prepare for the overflight. Before mission preparations could be completed, however, the Chinese detonated their first nuclear weapon on 16 October 1964, and the mission was canceled.\n\nThe first overflight of Communist China since the 7 July 1964 loss was a 31 October mission over Lan-chou. By mid-November, three more overflights had taken place, one over North Korea and northern China and two over southern and central China. An overflight of Manchuria on 9 December 1964 brought back photos of a G-class ballistic-missile submarine. By this time, the mass of data being provided by Project TACKLE overflights was overwhelming the analysts of the Office of Research and Reports (ORR). An ORR memorandum from 11 January 1965 reported that analysis of the \"large backlog of unexploited photography on Chinese Communist ground force installations…would require about two man-years work, backed up by a larger expansion of photointerpretation effort.\"",

    "text": "Use of Infrared Scanner Over PRC Nuclear Plants\n\nPhotographic missions were not the only method used by the Agency to gather information on the PRC's progress in developing nuclear weapons. In fact, standard overhead photography was of little value in determining whether or not various nuclear-related facilities were producing weapon-grade materials. Such information could only be obtained from agent reports or infrared imaging of the targets, which would reveal the heat associated with nuclear-refining activity. Early in 1963 the Agency sought special funds from the Pentagon to develop a high-resolution infrared scanner for the U-2 in order to ascertain the operational status of Chinese nuclear reactors. After this request was turned down, the Agency decided to fund the development of such a scanner itself. In the spring of 1963 the Office of Research and Development (ORD) signed a contract with the Texas Instruments Corporation for the production of an infrared scanner that would operate in the 0.5-milliradian range. To conceal the intended purpose of the scanner, the devices were called forest fire detectors and assigned model numbers such as FFD-1. Tests conducted in September 1963 proved that model FFD-2 was capable of revealing activity within US nuclear-processing facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington. Further improvements followed, and on 26 October 1964 ORD declared the infrared unit operational. In reporting the successful results of the infrared testing to DCI McCone, ORD Director Robert Chapman mentioned that there was only one such unit in existence. McCone immediately told Chapman to order more, and the Agency then purchased several for Project TACKLE and a stereo-configured FFD-4 for Project OXCART. DCI McCone reviewed these infrared detection developments with Defense Secretary McNamara and his new deputy, Cyrus Vance, on 30 October, being careful to point out that the new device was a product of Agency-sponsored R&D because the Pentagon had refused to fund it. He suggested that the scanner be flown over Lop Nor, Baotou, Youmen, and Lan-chou in U-2s with Agency pilots staged from Taiwan and Charbatia. As in the past, the administration opposed the use of Agency pilots for overflights of China, so the device was sent to Detachment H on 7 November 1964. The FFD-2 unit was installed in a U-2C in order to gather data from a suspected uranium gaseous-diffusion plant at Lan-chou. It took four tries, however, before this goal was achieved. The first attempt, which was scheduled to be staged from Kunsan, South Korea, on 22 November 1964, had to be abandoned after the pilot became ill. A second mission took off three days later with another pilot. Flying at 69",

When the U-2 was within 10 miles of Lan-chou, a previously unknown SA-2 battery launched several missiles. This unexpected attack so unnerved the pilot that he broke off the mission without overflying the target area. Three weeks later a third mission to Lan-chou was aborted because of bad weather shortly after the U-2 entered PRC airspace. The pilot did not bother to return to Kun-san but flew directly to T'ao-yuan. Finally, on 8 January 1965, a Detachment H U-2 made it all the way to Lan-chou and back to Kun-san with the infrared scanner and obtained good results. When the film was processed and evaluated at NPIC, analysts determined that the gaseous-diffusion plant was indeed operating. Two days after the successful Lan-chou mission, the infrared unit was airborne again, this time bound for Bao-tau and the air-cooled reactor located nearby. This flight ended abruptly when an SA-2 missile downed the U-2 26 miles short of the target. It was the fourth U-2 lost over China. No more U-2 flights over China used the infrared scanner, although a later model IR device was shipped to Tao-yuan and kept in readiness in the event it might be needed. The loss of yet another U-2 and its pilot made Nationalist Chinese officials reluctant to resume overflights of the mainland. They insisted that their U-2 pilots be given permission to turn on the System-XIII false-angle device during the entire time they were over hostile territory, not just after they had been alerted by the System-XII radar-detection device. The Defense Department acceded to these demands in order to keep the TACKLE flights going. In addition, the Project TACKLE U-2s began receiving even more advanced ECM equipment.",

The Special Group, therefore, approved an extensive reconnaissance program directed against the PRC.

The level of activity declined during 1966, with only 10 missions flown over the mainland. Detachment H also suffered the loss of two more aircraft and pilots in crashes during training missions in 1966.

    "text": "The entire U-2 overflight program was temporarily halted in early November 1967 after an Air Force U-2 in Vietnam was discovered to have cracks in its wing. All Air Force and CIA U-2s were ordered back to Lockheed for ultrasonic inspection of the wings and other stress points to check on metal fatigue. Upon completion of this inspection, both the Air Force and the Agency resumed their overflight activity. The End of U-2 Overflights of Mainland China Project TACKLE mounted a mission over northeastern China on 13 December 1967 and an overflight of central China on 5 January 1968. Later that month, the Far East became very tense when North Korea seized the US electronic intelligence ship Pueblo on 23 January. One week later the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese launched their Tet offensive in South Vietnam. The 303 Committee (the new name for the Special Group after 1964) decided on 1 February 1968 to suspend a group of overflights scheduled for February and called for mission-by-mission approval \"during this period of tension.\" The committee approved one additional overflight of southern China, which was flown by Detachment H on 16 March 1968, and two overflights of Cambodia, carried out on 27 March and 3 April 1968 by Detachment G in its first operations since early 1966. These three missions turned out to be the last overflights by U-2s in the Far East. By this time U-2 flights over the PRC had become so dangerous that the State Department opposed further overflights, and on 10 April 1968 the 303 Committee decided not to approve any mission that would fly closer than 20 miles from the coast of China. One reason why Detachment H's overflights were stopped was the steady increase in the PRC's ability to track and engage U-2s, as evidenced by its success in downing five U-2s. By 1968 PRC radars along the coast opposite Taiwan were keeping a close watch on U-2 activity from the T'ao-yuan base and actively tracked U-2s as soon as they became airborne. The U-2s then had to face a growing PRC air defense system that not only consisted of SA-2 missiles but also the fast and high-flying MiG-21. The PRC's MiG-21 pilots had become adept at the power-zoom technique and were threatening almost every U-2 mission. The risks to U-2s now seemed too great.",

    "text": "In March 1973, the TACKLE agreement with the Nationalist Chinese was renegotiated. Although no end date was set, the agreement contained a termination clause that would become effective three months after notification by either party. This clause provided more flexibility to the United States, which could now end the Nationalist Chinese U-2 program whenever US foreign policy considerations made such a step desirable. Operation SCOPE SHIELD Over North Vietnam In addition to the Project TACKLE peripheral missions against the PRC, Detachment H (with Agency rather than Nationalist Chinese pilots) flew a series of missions known as Operation SCOPE SHIELD to gather intelligence on activities in North Vietnam. The Indochina area had become the responsibility of the Air Force in 1964, but, under the terms of the cease-fire agreement negotiated with North Vietnam in January 1973, US military flights in the area were forbidden. The Nixon administration, therefore, tasked the CIA with monitoring North Vietnam's compliance with the cease-fire accords. The Agency dispatched several pilots to Taiwan under the cover of Lockheed employees working on a government contract to check vendor conditions. Their highly sensitive missions had to remain at least 15 nautical miles away from the North Vietnamese coast, and they initially flew at low altitude in a deceptive direction in order to avoid PRC radars. These constraints made the missions difficult because at low altitude the U-2 consumed more fuel and encountered more turbulence and the pilots' pressure suits tended to overheat. The first mission on 30 March 1973 was only marginally successful because of cloud cover and haze, which prevented it from photographing most of its targets. A second mission on the following day had somewhat better luck with the weather, but problems with the film processing reduced the mission's coverage. Afterward, the monsoon season prevented any further missions until 21 July 1973. This mission obtained usable photography of SAM sites and North Vietnamese supply operations, although the resolution was not as high as it should have been because the H camera lens had not been properly focused. The last SCOPE SHIELD mission, on 6 January 1974, finally succeeded in obtaining high-quality photography. The mission provided complete coverage of shipping in Haiphong Harbor, SAM defenses, and North Vietnamese naval order of battle.",

    "text": "IMPROVEMENTS IN U-2 TECHNOLOGY Modification of U-2 for Aircraft Carrier Deployment In mid-1960s, the Office of Special Activities set in motion Project WHALE TALE to examine the possibility of adapting the U-2 aircraft for operations from an aircraft carrier. In the past, protest notes from the Soviet Union to Turkey and Pakistan and from Communist China to India had been responsible for interrupting overflight operations. CIA planners believed that, if U-2s could be modified to operate from aircraft carriers, the United States could avoid the political problems involved in seeking permission to base U-2s in other nations. Kelly Johnson began working on changes to the aircraft, and Office of Special Activities Deputy Director James A. Cunningham, Jr., a former Marine Corps aviator, asked the Navy for assistance. The first test of the U-2's capability for carrier operations took place in August 1963 from the USS Kitty Hawk operating in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California. A U-2C, which had been loaded aboard the carrier at North Island Naval Base, took off from the flight deck with a full load of fuel and was airborne within 321 feet. No assistance from catapults was necessary. Although the takeoff was very successful, the attempted landing was not. The aircraft bounced, hit hard on one wing tip, and then just barely managed to become airborne again before reaching the end of the deck. Kelly Johnson realized that the airframe would have to be altered in order to make carrier landings possible. These alterations involved strengthening the landing gear, installing an arresting hook at the rear of the fuselage, and fitting \"spoilers\" on the wings to cancel the aerodynamic lift once the aircraft was over the flight deck. Aircraft thus modified were designated U-2G. While several aircraft underwent these modifications, Detachment G pilots began undergoing training in landing on aircraft carriers. The first successful carrier landing took place on 2 March 1964.",

    "text": "Use of Carrier-Based U-2 To Film a French Nuclear Test Site Within a few months after the completion of carrier testing, one of the carrier-modified U-2s conducted an operation in the Pacific. Its mission was to gather information on the activities of an ally. In December 1963, France had announced its intention to detonate a hydrogen device over Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago area of French Polynesia but had given no specific date for the event. The Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance had been following French nuclear developments since September 1963, when it had apprised the USIB of the need for overflights of this South Pacific area. At that time the USIB decided against recommending such overflights because of State Department concern about potential political difficulties with France in the event the mission was discovered. Following reports of a buildup of French troops and technical personnel in neighboring Tahiti, the Special Group on 24 April 1964 approved a mission to overfly the atoll to check for activity. This required photography with resolution better than the 3 to 5 feet possible with the standard B-model camera that had been in use since October 1956. Work on a very-high-resolution camera had begun in early 1963, when the Agency contracted with the Itek Corporation to modify for placement in the U-2 a camera that had been developed for the satellite program. Known as the Delta-II, or the Itek 112A, this device could photograph a 28-kilometer swath with 26° convergent stereoscopic lenses, resulting in a 70° lateral coverage and a ground resolution of 10 inches. This camera was installed in a Detachment H U-2 and used on two missions conducted over Indochina in late December 1963. Resolution was not as high as had been expected, and the unit was returned to Itek for modifications. By early 1964, the 112A had been reworked and was now known as the 112B. In tests it had proved capable of providing photography with resolution in the 10- to 12-inch range. Detachment G conducted Operation FISH HAWK in May 1964 by sending two pilots, an NPIC photointerpreter, and a U-2G equipped with the Itek 112B camera to make the first operational U-2 flights from an aircraft carrier. On 19 May the U-2 took off from the USS Ranger and overflew the French atomic test area. As soon as the aircraft returned to the Ranger, the film was developed in the carrier's photo lab, and the NPIC photointerpreter then read the film to see if the photography met the requirements for resolution and quality. A second U-2 flight carried out a similar mission on 22 May. The photography provided all the detail needed to identify the preparations for the nuclear test that occurred later that year.",

Aircraft carriers are enormously expensive to operate and require an entire flotilla of vessels to protect and service them. The movement of large numbers of big ships is difficult to conceal and cannot be hastily accomplished, while the deployment of a solitary U-2 to a remote airfield can take place overnight.\n\nA New Version of the U-2\nBy the summer of 1966, the number of flyable Agency U-2s had dwindled to six--two at Detachment H in Taiwan and four at Detachment G in California--with three more at Lockheed undergoing repair. The Agency had originally ordered 20 U-2s in 1954-55 (the Air Force had purchased another 31 of these planes), and Kelly Johnson's crew at the Skunk Works had managed to assemble four additional aircraft for the Agency from leftover spare parts and usable sections of crashed aircraft. This brought the total number of U-2s acquired by the Agency to 24, for an average cost of $812,500 each. At this point, the DCI and the Secretary of Defense on 1 August 1966 decided to place an order with Lockheed for eight more aircraft to be used in the Agency and Air Force U-2 programs-a completely new version of the aircraft. Kelly Johnson had been working on ways to improve the performance of the U-2 since early 1965 because he was concerned that all the modifications and additions to the aircraft over the years had made it so heavy that it had lost almost half of its range and several thousand feet in cruising altitude.",

    "text": "252\nThe new model, known as the U-2R, had a longer fuselage and a wider wingspan than the original U-2. The U-2R's wings were 103 feet long with 1,000 square feet of lifting surface, in contrast to the U-2C's 80-foot wings with only 600 square feet. The longer fuselage of the U-2R made it possible to provide two pressurized bays with an additional 2.2 cubic meters of equipment space and also achieve a better weight distribution. The net result of all these improvements was a much better performing aircraft. No longer did the U-2 pilot have to worry about keeping the aircraft's speed at altitude within a 6-knot window in the coffin corner of the flight envelope. The envelope was now extended to 20 knots, which greatly improved flyability.\n\nThe U-2R used the upgraded Pratt & Whitney J75/P-13B engine and was able to fly higher—in excess of 74,000 feet—and faster—Mach 0.72 (410 knots), which is 12 knots faster than the U-2C. When flying at the higher altitude, however, the U-2R's range was less than the U-2C's. The restart capability of the P-13B engine was significantly better than the P-13A power plant. As a result, the U-2R could be restarted at 54,000 feet, which was 10,000 feet higher than the U-2C. Francis Gary Powers was one of the Lockheed test pilots who checked out this new aircraft when it first took to the air on 28 August 1967. The last of the U-2Rs was delivered on 11 December 1968. The increased performance of the U-2R did not come cheaply. At $7.1 million per aircraft, the new models cost almost 10 times as much as the original U-2s. Much of the increased cost was due to inflation, but some was the result of technological advances. The initial order for eight of the new version of the U-2 was followed on 23 November 1966 by an order from the DCI and the Secretary of Defense for four more. This brought the total number of U-2Rs purchased by the CIA and the Air Force to 12.",

Agency managers felt that, because the B camera was now 10 years old, the U-2R needed a camera that incorporated the many important advances that had occurred in recent years. The H12B—the modified version of the satellite program's stereo camera that had been used in the U-2G—had not proved totally successful. Despite its stereo capability, this camera's shorter focal length could not provide the scale of imagery needed to obtain the highly technical data desired by analysts. As a result, the Office of Special Activities asked the Hycon Manufacturing Company of Pasadena, California, to adapt its successful high-resolution 48-inch 9- by 9-inch format camera developed for the OXCART aircraft for use in the U-2R. This camera was actually a very advanced version of the original B camera with a new lens designed by James Baker. The new camera was designed to resolve objects smaller than 4 inches. Hycon began work on the HR-333 camera in 1966. Unlike the OXCART camera, the new unit was to use the split 18- by 18-inch format of the B camera, so the lens had to be redesigned. James Baker's contribution to this effort was a 48-inch f/5.6 system that provided remarkably sharp imagery. Hycon completed the camera in time for it to be installed in the first U-2R delivered to the Agency in 1968: it is known as the I camera.",

At a meeting on 13 November, DCI Richard Helms and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara agreed that the Air Force and the Agency would each get six U-2Rs. The six older U-2s remaining from the original 1954-55 production were to be kept in flyable condition and be used as replacements if newer models were lost. Despite the greatly increased capabilities of the new model of the U-2, the era of overflights of hostile territory was over. The U-2R would have six years of useful service with the Agency, but its missions did not include penetration flights over hostile territory.\n\nTHE FINAL YEARS OF THE U-2\nWhen the OXCART's brief operational career with the Agency ended in 1968, the U-2 was once again the center of the Agency's manned reconnaissance program. But by this time, reconnaissance aircraft had declined in importance as collection systems. Overflights were a thing of the past. Although Project TACKLE U-2s with Nationalist Chinese pilots were still flying missions targeted against the People's Republic of China, these missions did not overfly PRC territory. Increasingly, Agency U-2s flew missions that did not involve intelligence collection requirements.",

From 1968 until 1974, Detachment G U-2s photographed areas within the United States that were analogous to portions of the Soviet Union in order to test films and techniques for spotting certain targets. This analogous filming was particularly valuable in connection with agricultural areas and nuclear test sites. Some U-2 missions supported agencies outside the intelligence community. In 1968 and 1969, Detachment G U-2s flew high-altitude photographic missions in conjunction with the Apollo VIII and IX spaceflights in response to a NASA request. These flights provided photography of the western United States for comparison with the photography taken by the Apollo crews. The Department of the Interior also requested U-2 support in early 1969 to help determine the extent of damage caused by a leak in an offshore oil well in California's Santa Barbara Channel. After preliminary assessment of the film at NPIC, the mission photography was given to the US Geological Survey for further study.",

In August 1970, the committee recommended continuing the program through fiscal year 1972. On 12 August 1972, the 40 Committee again favored continuation of the CIA U-2 program, primarily motivated by a desire not to alienate the Nationalist Chinese Government by eliminating Project TACKLE. In June 1973, however, DCI James R. Schlesinger informed the 40 Committee that this project could be terminated without causing major difficulties with the Nationalist Chinese. On 30 August 1973, the 40 Committee approved the CIA's plans to terminate the U-2 program effective 1 August 1974. The Air Force would assume funding responsibility for the four U-2R aircraft assigned to the Agency and would take physical possession of them at that time. On 1 April 1974, Ambassador Walter P. McConaughy informed the Nationalist Chinese Government of the US intention to end the U-2 project, and the two countries then worked out a schedule for phasing out Project TACKLE. The transfer of all Agency U-2s to the Air Force eliminated Detachments G and H. Their parent organization, the Office of Special Activities, began its phaseout immediately thereafter.

Because it would not be made of metal, the wing would require a type of bridge truss on its upper side to give it rigidity. The proposed aircraft would achieve altitudes of 80,000 to 90,000 feet but only at subsonic speeds, just enough to keep it airborne. The slow-flying Northrop design did not solve the problem of radar detection, and in 1957 the emphasis switched to supersonic designs. In August 1957, the Scientific Engineering Institute (SEI), a CIA proprietary firm that had been working on ways to reduce the U-2's vulnerability to radar, began to investigate the possibility of designing an aircraft with a very small radar cross section. SEI soon discovered that supersonic speed greatly reduced the chances of detection by radar. From this point on, the CIA's attention focused increasingly on the possibility of building an aircraft that could fly at both extremely high speeds and high altitudes while incorporating the best ideas in radar-absorbing or radar-deflecting techniques.",

    "text": "Engineering Institute. In pursuing his studies, Rodgers had discovered a phenomenon that he believed could be used to advantage by the new reconnaissance aircraft. Known as the Blip/Scan Ratio but also referred to as the Rodgers' Effect, this phenomenon involved three elements: the strength of a radar return, the altitude of the object being illuminated by the radar, and the persistence of the radar return on the radar screen (Pulse-Position Indicator display). Most tracking radars in the late 1950s swept a band of sky 30° to 45° wide and 360° in circumference. Any object encountered in this area reflected the radar pulse in a manner directly proportional to its size—the larger the object, the stronger the returning radar signal. This return appeared on the Cathode-ray tube of the radar screen as a spot or blip, and the persistence of this blip on the radar screen also depended on the strength of the radar return, with blips from larger objects remaining on the screen longer. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, a human radar operator watched the radar screen and kept track of the blips that indicated aircraft within the radar's field of view.\nRodgers determined that a high-altitude object moving two to three times as fast as a normal aircraft would produce such a small blip with so little persistence that the radar operator would have great difficulty tracking it, if indeed he could even see it. Rodgers estimated that for an aircraft to take advantage of this Blip/Scan Ratio phenomenon it must fly at altitudes approaching 90,000 feet and have a radar cross section of less than 10 square meters, preferably not much over 5 square meters. However, for a Mach 3.0 aircraft to achieve such a small radar cross section, its designers would have to make many concessions in its structural design and aerodynamics. By the summer of 1959, both firms had completed their proposals. In early June, Lockheed submitted a design for a ground-launched aircraft known as the A-11. It would have a speed of Mach 3.2, a range of 1,200 miles, an altitude of 90,000 feet, and a completion date of January 1961. Kelly Johnson had refused to reduce the aerodynamics of his design in order to achieve a greater antiradar capability, and the A-11's radar cross section, although not great, was substantially larger than that of the much smaller parasite aircraft being designed by Convair. The Convair proposal called for a small, unmanned, ramjet-powered, reconnaissance vehicle to be air-launched from one of two specially configured Convair B-58B Super Hustlers. The FISH vehicle, a radical lifting body with a very-small-radar cross section, would fly at Mach 4.2 at 90,000 feet and have a range of 3,900 miles. Two Marquardt ramjets would power its Mach 4.2 dash over the target area. Once the FISH decelerated, two Pratt & Whitney JT-12 turbojets would bring it back to base. The ramjet exit nozzles and wing edges would be constructed of Pyroceram, a ceramic material that could withstand the high temperatures of very high speeds and would absorb radiofrequency energy from radar pulses. Convair stated that the FISH could be ready by January 1961.",

    "text": "Convair's proposal depended on two uncertain factors. First and foremost was the unproven technology of ramjet engines. At the time, no aircraft in existence could carry a large, ramjet-powered craft into the sky and then accelerate to sufficient speed for the ramjet engines to be ignited. Since ramjet engines had only been tested in wind tunnels, there was no available data to prove that these engines would work in the application proposed by Convair. The second uncertain factor was the B-58B bomber that was supposed to achieve Mach 2.2 before launching the FISH above 35,000 feet. This version of the B-58 was still in the design stage. Convair's proposal suffered a major setback in June 1959, when the Air Force canceled the B-58B project. Conversion of the older, slower B-58A into a supersonic launching platform for the FISH was ruled out by the high cost and technical difficulties involved. Moreover, the Air Force was unwilling to part with two aircraft from the small inventory of its most advanced bomber. Even had the B-58B program not been canceled, however, the FISH proposal would probably not have been feasible. Convair engineers had calculated that the added weight of the FISH would prevent the B-58B from achieving the speed required to ignite the parasite aircraft's ramjet engines. The Convair proposal was therefore unusable, but the Lockheed design with its high radar cross section was also unacceptable to the Land committee. On 14 July 1959, the committee rejected both designs and continued the competition. Lockheed continued to work on developing a design that would be less vulnerable to detection, and Convair received a new CIA contract to design an air-breathing twin-engine aircraft that would meet the general specifications being followed by Lockheed. Following recommendations by the Land committee, both Lockheed and Convair incorporated the Pratt & Whitney J58 power plant into their designs. This engine had originally been developed for the Navy's large, jet-powered flying boat, the Glenn L. Martin Company's P6M SeaMaster, and was the most powerful engine available. In 1958 the Navy had canceled the SeaMaster program, which had left Pratt & Whitney without a buyer for the powerful J58 engine. Although the Land committee had not yet found an acceptable design, it informed President Eisenhower on 20 July 1959 that the search was making good progress. Concerned about the U-2's vulnerability to detection and possible interception and aware that the photosatellite project was encountering significant problems, the President gave his final approval to the high-speed reconnaissance aircraft project.",

    "text": "THE SELECTION OF THE LOCKHEED DESIGN\nBy the late summer of 1959, both Convair and Lockheed had completed new designs for a follow-on to the U-2. Convair's entry, known as the KINGFISH, used much of the technology developed for the F-102, F-106, and B-58, including stainless steel honeycomb skin, planiform wing design, and a crew capsule escape system, which eliminated the need for the pilot to wear a pressurized suit. The KINGFISH had two side-by-side J58 engines inside the fuselage, which significantly reduced the radar cross section. Two additional important design features that contributed to a small radar return were fiberglass engine inlets and wings whose leading edges were made of Pyroceram. Lockheed's new entry was much like its first, but with several modifications and a new designator, A-12. It, too, would employ two of the powerful J58 engines. Lockheed's major innovation in reducing radar return was a cesium additive in the fuel, which decreased the radar cross section of the afterburner plume. This improvement had been proposed by Edward Purcell of the Land committee. Desiring to save weight, Kelly Johnson had decided not to construct the A-12 out of steel. Traditional lightweight metals such as aluminum were out of the question because they could not stand the heat that would be generated as the A-12 flew at Mach 3.2, so Johnson chose a titanium alloy. On 20 August 1959, Lockheed and Convair submitted their proposals to a joint Department of Defense, Air Force, and CIA selection panel. As the table shows, the two aircraft were similar in performance",

The new aircraft would thus be more than five times as fast as the U-2 and would go almost 3 miles higher. One major disadvantage of the OXCART's great speed was high temperatures. Flying through the earth's atmosphere at Mach 3.2 heated portions of the aircraft's skin to almost 900°F. An aircraft operating at these high speeds and high temperatures required fuels, lubricants, and hydraulic fluids that had not yet been invented.\n\nThe OXCART's fuel requirement called for a low-vapor-pressure fuel with a low volume at operating temperatures; the fuel would also be used as a heat sink to cool various parts of the aircraft. The J58 engines required lubricants that did not break down at the very high operating temperatures of Mach 3.2 speeds. This requirement led to the invention of synthetic lubricants. Lockheed also had to search long and hard for a hydraulic fluid that would not vaporize at high speed but would still be usable at low altitudes. Finding a suitable hydraulic pump was just as difficult. Kelly Johnson finally modified a pump that was being developed for North American's B-70 bomber project.\n\nSome of the greatest problems related to the high speeds and high temperatures at which the OXCART operated resulted from working with the material chosen for the airframe—titanium. After evaluating many materials, Johnson had chosen an alloy of titanium (B-120) characterized by great strength, relatively light weight, and good resistance to high temperatures, but high in cost. As strong as stainless steel, titanium weighed slightly more than half as much. Obtaining sufficient quantities of titanium of a quality suitable for fabricating aircraft components proved very difficult because methods for maintaining good quality control during the milling of titanium were not fully developed. Up to 80 percent of the early deliveries from Titanium Metals Corporation had to be rejected. It was not until 1961, when company officials were informed of the objectives and high priority of the OXCART program, that problems with the titanium supply ended. Even after sufficient high-quality titanium was received, Lockheed's difficulties with the metal were not over. Titanium was so hard that tools normally used in aircraft fabrication broke; new ones therefore had to be devised. Assembly line production was not possible, and the cost of the program mounted well above original estimates.\n\nThe high temperatures that the OXCART would encounter also necessitated planning for the pilot's safety and comfort because the inside of the aircraft would be like a moderately hot oven. To save weight, Kelly Johnson did not attempt to insulate the interior of the aircraft. The pilot would therefore have to wear a type of space suit with its own cooling, pressure control, oxygen supply, and other necessities for survival.",

    "text": "Designing cameras for the A-12 posed several unique problems. In late 1959, OXCART managers asked Perkin-Elmer, Eastman Kodak, and Hycon to develop three different photographic systems for the new aircraft. These cameras would provide a range of photography from high-ground-resolution stereo to extremely-high-resolution spotting data.\n\nThe Perkin-Elmer (P-E) entry, known as the Type-I camera, was a high-ground-resolution general stereo camera using an f/4.0 18-inch lens and 6.6-inch film. It produced pairs of photographs covering a swath 71 miles wide with an approximately 30-percent stereo overlap. The system had a 5,000-foot film supply and was able to resolve 140 lines per millimeter and provide a ground resolution of 12 inches. To meet severe design constraints in the areas of size, weight, thermal environment, desired photographic resolution, and coverage, Perkin-Elmer's Dr. Roderick M. Scott employed concepts never before used in camera systems. These included the use of a reflecting cube rather than a prism for the scanner, a concentric film supply and take-up system to minimize weight shift, a constant-velocity film transport that provided for the contiguous placement of stereo images on one piece of film, and air bars for the film transport and take-up systems.\n\nEastman Kodak's entry, called the Type-II camera, was a high-convergent stereo device using a 24-inch lens and 9-inch film. It produced pairs of photographs covering a swath 60 miles wide with an approximately 30-percent stereo overlap. It had an 8,400-foot film supply and was able to resolve 105 lines per millimeter and provide a ground resolution of 17 inches.\n\nThe Hycon entry, designed by James Baker and known as the Type-IV camera, was a spotting camera with extremely-high-ground resolution. In fact, it was an advanced version of the highly reliable B camera developed for the original U-2 program. It used a 48-inch Baker-designed f/5.6 lens to focus images onto 9.5-inch film. Like the B camera, it could provide seven frames of photography covering a swath 41 miles wide with stereo overlap on 19 miles of the swath. The Hycon camera carried the largest film supply of the three cameras, 12,000 feet. It was able to resolve 300 lines per millimeter and provide a ground resolution of 8 inches. A version of this 48-inch Hycon camera, known as the H camera, later saw service in U-2R aircraft.\n\nEach of the three camera systems had unique capabilities and advantages, so all three were purchased for the OXCART. Before they could be effectively employed in the aircraft, however, new types of camera windows were needed. The OXCART's camera windows had to be completely free from optical distortion. Achieving this goal was difficult in a window whose exterior would be subjected to temperatures of 550°F while the interior surface would be only 150°F. After three years and the expenditure of $2 million in research and development, the Corning Glass Works, which had joined this effort as a Perkin-Elmer subcontractor, solved the problem of producing a camera window that could withstand tremendous heat differentials. Its quartz glass window was fused to the metal frame by an unprecedented process involving high-frequency sound waves.\n\nLater in the program, the OXCART received yet another camera system. In 1964 the Texas Instruments Corporation developed an infrared camera for Project TACKLE U-2s that were being used to determine whether the People's Republic of China was producing weapons-grade nuclear material. This stereo device, known as the FFD-4, was adapted for use in OXCART. The camera had an effective focal length of 50 inches and a 150-foot supply of 3.5-inch film. The camera's resolution was 1°C thermally, 1 milliradian spatially, and 60 feet on the ground. It could be used for both day and night imagery collection.",

    "text": "When cover considerations had limited the A-12 pilot selection process to individuals with reserve commissions, the Air Force was able to devise personnel and cover procedures that enabled both regular and reserve officers to volunteer to become OXCART pilots. Because of the limited size of the A-12 cockpit, they had to be under six feet tall and weigh less than 175 pounds. Following extensive physical and psychological screening, sixteen potential nominees were selected for intensive security and medical screening by the Agency. By the end of this screening in November 1961, only five individuals had been approved and had accepted the Agency's offer of employment on a highly classified project involving a very advanced aircraft. A second search and screening raised the number of pilots for the OXCART to eleven. The thorough screening process produced an elite group of pilots; all but one of these 11 officers eventually became generals. The new pilots transferred from military to civilian status and received compensation and insurance arrangements somewhat better than those of the U-2 pilots.\n\nFrom the very beginning, it was clear that Lockheed could not test the OXCART aircraft at its Burbank facility, where the runway was too short and too exposed to the public. The ideal testing site would be far removed from metropolitan areas, away from civil and military airways, easily accessible by air, blessed with good weather, capable of accommodating large numbers of personnel, near an Air Force installation, and having a runway at least 8,000 feet long. But no such place was to be found. After considering ten Air Force bases programmed for closing, Richard Bissell decided to upgrade the Area 51 site in Nevada where the U-2 had been tested. Although its personnel accommodations, fuel, storage capacity, and runway length were insufficient for the OXCART program, the site's remote location would greatly ease the task of maintaining the program's security, and a moderate construction program could provide adequate facilities. Construction began in September 1960; a C-47 shuttle service ferried work crews from Burbank to Las Vegas and from Las Vegas to the site. The new 8,500-foot runway was completed by 15 November 1960. Kelly Johnson had been reluctant to have a standard Air Force runway with expansion joints every 25 feet because he feared the joints would set up undesirable vibrations in the speedy aircraft. At his suggestion, a 150-foot wide runway was therefore constructed of six 25-foot-wide longitudinal sections, each 150 feet long but staggered. This layout put most of the expansion joints parallel to the direction of aircraft roll and reduced the frequency of the joints. Additional improvements included the resurfacing of 18 miles of highway leading to the base so that heavy fuel trucks could bring in the necessary fuel.",

    "text": "The need for additional buildings on the base was met by the Navy. Three surplus Navy hangars were dismantled, moved, and reassembled on the north side of the base, and more than 100 surplus Navy housing buildings were also transported to Area 51. All essential facilities were ready in time for the forecast delivery date of the first A-12 on 1 August 1961. Unfortunately, this delivery date began to slip further and further into the future. Delays in obtaining the titanium, and later the J58 engines, caused the postponement of the final assembly of the first plane. Eventually, Kelly Johnson and Agency project officials decided to begin testing without waiting for the J58 engines by using Pratt & Whitney J75/J9W engines, designed for the Convair F-106, to test the A-12 at altitudes up to 50,000 feet and at speeds up to Mach 1.6. Such a change, however, meant that the engine compartment of the first aircraft had to be reconfigured to accommodate the J75 engine. Lockheed hoped that this substitution would permit the delivery of the first A-12 by 22 December 1961 and an initial test flight by 27 February 1962.\n\nLockheed ran into so many technological problems with the OXCART effort that by October 1961 its costs had swollen to $136 million and were still climbing. Something obviously had to be done to reduce expenditures. After much refiguring, project officials decided to decrease the number of deliverable aircraft. Amendment No. 11 to the contract reduced from 12 to 10 the number of A-12s, for a total cost of $161.2 million. The cancellation of these two A-12s was offset by an Air Force order for the development of a supersonic interceptor variant of the A-12 to serve as a replacement for the North American F-108A Rapier interceptor project, which had been canceled in late 1960. With the assistance of the Agency's west coast contracting office, the Air Force entered into an agreement with Lockheed to produce three AF-12 aircraft, based on the A-12 design but modified to carry a second crewman and three air-to-air missiles. This effort was called Project KEDLOCK. The AF-12 (later redesignated the YF-12A) was designed to intercept enemy bombers long before they reached the United States, and initial Air Force plans envisioned a force of up to 100 of these supersonic interceptors. In fact, only three of these planes were built and delivered during the 1963-64 time frame because Secretary of Defense McNamara canceled the program as a cost-cutting measure. The Air Force bore all of the costs of the YF-12A project; CIA was only involved in helping to write \"black\" contracts.",

    "text": "Lockheed was not the only OXCART contractor having trouble containing costs; Pratt & Whitney was fighting an even bigger battle. In mid-1961, Pratt & Whitney overruns threatened to halt the entire OXCART project. At the suggestion of Cdr. William Holcomb in the office of the Chief of Naval Material, Richard Bissell asked the Navy to assist in funding the J58 development. After hearing Bissell and Holcomb's suggestion that the J58 might be used in future Navy aircraft, VAdm. William A. Schoech, Chief of the Navy Materiel Command that had originally financed the J58 engine, authorized the transfer of $18 million in end-of-year funds to the project, thus keeping the OXCART's head above water. As it turned out, the J58 was never used in a Navy aircraft. During this period, Kelly Johnson was very disappointed with Pratt & Whitney's work on the J58, particularly when they shocked him in September 1961 with the news that the engine would be overweight, underpowered, and late.\n\nThe first A-12, known as article 121, was assembled and tested at Burbank during January and February 1962. Since it could not be flown to the Nevada site, the aircraft had to be partially disassembled and put on a specially designed trailer that cost nearly $100,000. The entire fuselage, without the wings, was crated and covered, creating a load 35 feet wide and 105 feet long. To transport this huge load safely over the hundreds of miles to the site, obstructing road signs were removed, trees were trimmed, and some roadbanks had to be leveled. The plane left Burbank on 26 February 1962 and arrived at Area 51 two days later. After the fuselage arrived in Nevada, its wings were attached and the J75 engines were installed, but the aircraft was still not ready to be tested. This new delay was caused by leaking fuel tanks, a problem that would never be solved completely.

The two-seater mothership was designated the M-12, and the drone was called the D-21. This project was known as TAGBOARD. The CIA originally sponsored the development of the drones and mothership, but in June 1963, the project was transferred to the Air Force, which had overall responsibility for unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. Development of the M-12/D-21 combination continued until 1966 when an unsuccessful D-21 launch caused the loss of its mothership and the death of one crew member. Afterward, the Air Force turned to B-52 bombers to carry the drones.\n\nA second new version of the OXCART was another reconnaissance aircraft. In December 1962, the Air Force ordered six \"reconnaissance/strike\" aircraft designed to conduct high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance of enemy territory after a nuclear strike. This new aircraft differed from other A-12 versions in that it was longer, had a full two-seat cockpit, and carried a large variety of photographic and electronic sensors. The additional weight of this equipment gave the Air Force craft a slower maximum speed and a lower operating ceiling than the Agency's A-12. In August 1963, the Air Force added 25 more aircraft to this contract, for a total of 31.",

    "text": "As Air Force spending on OXCART versions increased dramatically, the Defense Department became concerned about providing a public explanation for these expenditures.  Agency and Defense Department officials also recognized the growing danger of a crash or sightings of test flights compromising the program. In late 1962 and early 1963, the Defense Department considered surfacing the Air Force's interceptor version of the A-12 to provide cover for OXCART sightings or crashes and explain the increased Air Force spending.  Journalists had become aware of the aircraft's existence, raising concerns about the secret leaking to the press. Agency officials remained reluctant to reveal any A-12 version, and the issue reached the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). James Killian and Edwin Land strongly opposed disclosing OXCART's existence, and in January 1963, they presented their views to President Kennedy, DCI McCone, and Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. Killian, Land, and McCone persuaded the President and Secretary of Defense to keep OXCART's existence secret for the time being. Later that year, proponents of surfacing the OXCART found a more compelling argument: the need to disseminate the supersonic technology developed for the project. This technology would be invaluable for Air Force projects like the B-70 bomber and the civilian supersonic transport (SST) being discussed in Congress. In the fall of 1963, several Presidential advisors expressed concern to DCI McCone that Lockheed had received a $700 million head start in developing supersonic technology, giving the firm a tremendous advantage over other aerospace companies working on a supersonic transport.  McCone relayed these concerns to President Kennedy on 12 November 1963. The President instructed the CIA and the Defense Department to develop a plan for surfacing OXCART but to await further discussions before taking action.",

    "text": "President Lyndon B. Johnson received a detailed briefing on OXCART from McCone, McNamara, Bundy, and Rusk on 29 November 1963. McNamara strongly advocated surfacing a version of OXCART. McCone was more cautious, suggesting a statement be prepared for when surfacing became necessary but arguing against immediate disclosure. President Johnson agreed with McCone and said the issue should be reviewed again in February 1964. Another argument for surfacing OXCART was the realization that it couldn't fly undetected over the Soviet Union. By 1962, the United States knew about the effectiveness of a new Soviet radar system codenamed TALL KING. This computer-controlled radar undermined a basic premise of the OXCART program: that radar operators couldn't visually track high-flying supersonic targets due to their small, non-persistent radar returns. By connecting a computer to radar, the Soviets could now weigh individual radar returns and identify those from high-flying, fast objects. By February 1964, DCI McCone believed surfacing was necessary. The Soviet TALL KING radar system eliminated his hope that OXCART could fulfill its original purpose—overflights of the USSR. The final decision came at a National Security Council meeting on 29 February 1964, with unanimous support for surfacing. That day, President Johnson announced the successful development of an \"advanced experimental jet aircraft, the A-11, tested in sustained flight at more than 2,000 miles per hour and at altitudes exceeding 70,000 feet.\" President Johnson referred to the A-11, not the Agency's A-12, and the aircraft revealed publicly was the Air Force's YF-12A interceptor, a canceled project.",

The process of surfacing versions of the OXCART continued on 25 July 1964, when President Johnson revealed the existence of a new Air Force reconnaissance aircraft, which he called the SR-71. Actually, the President was supposed to say RS-71 (for \"reconnaissance-strike\"). Deciding that renaming the aircraft was easier than correcting President Johnson, the Air Force invented a new category-\"strategic reconnaissance\"-to explain the SR-71's designation.\n\nADDITIONAL PROBLEMS DURING FINAL TESTING\n\nThe first A-12 crash occurred on 24 May 1963, when a detachment pilot, realizing the airspeed indication was confusing and erroneous, decided to eject. The pilot was unhurt, but the plane was destroyed when it crashed near Wendover, Utah. A cover story for the press described the plane as an F-105. All A-12s were grounded for a week while the accident was investigated. The malfunction was found to be caused by ice that had plugged up a pitot-static tube used to determine airspeed. Two more A-12s were lost in later testing. On 9 July 1964, article 133 crashed while landing when a pitch-control servo device froze, rolling the plane into a wing-down position. Ejecting from an altitude of 120 feet, the pilot was blown sideways out of the craft. Although he was not very high off the ground, his parachute did open and he landed during the parachute's first swing. Fortunately he was unhurt, and no news of the accident filtered out of the base. Eighteen months later, on 28 December 1965, article 126 crashed immediately after takeoff because of an improperly wired stability augmentation system. As in the previous crash, the pilot ejected safely, and there was no publicity connected with the crash. An investigation ordered by DCI McCone determined that the wiring error had resulted from negligence, not sabotage. The A-12 made its first long-range, high-speed flight on 27 January 1965. The flight lasted 100 minutes, 75 minutes of which were flown at speeds greater than Mach 3.1, and the aircraft covered 2,580 miles at altitudes between 75,000 and 80,000 feet. By this time, the OXCART was performing well. The engine inlet, camera, hydraulic, navigation, and flight-control systems all demonstrated acceptable reliability.\n\nNevertheless, as the OXCART began flying longer, faster, and higher, new problems arose. The most serious of these problems involved the aircraft's wiring. Continuing malfunctions of the inlet controls, communications equipment, ECM systems, and cockpit instruments were often attributable to wiring failures. Wiring connectors and components had to withstand temperatures above 800°F, structural flexing, vibration, and shock. Such demands were more than the materials could stand. Not all of the OXCART's problems could be traced to material failures, however, and Agency officials believed that careless maintenance by Lockheed employees also contributed to malfunctions.",

    "text": "Concerned that Lockheed would not be able to meet the OXCART'S schedule for operational readiness, the Office of Special Activities' Director of Technology, John Parangosky, met with Kelly Johnson on 3 August 1965 to discuss the project's problems. Johnson not only assigned more top-level supervisors to the project but also decided to go to Nevada and take charge of the OXCART's development himself. His presence made a big difference, as can be seen in his notes in the project log:\n\nI uncovered many items of a managerial, material and design nature... I had meetings with vendors to improve their operation... Changed supervision and had daily talks with them, going over in detail all problems on the aircraft... Increased the supervision in the electrical group by 500%... We tightened up the inspection procedures a great deal and made inspection stick. It appears that the problems are one-third due to human engineering... The addition of so many systems to the A-12 has greatly complicated the problems, but we did solve the overall problem.\n\nThese improvements in on-site management got the project back on schedule. By 20 November 1965, the final validation flights for OXCART deployment were finished. During these tests, the OXCART achieved a maximum speed of Mach 3.29, an altitude of 90,000 feet, and sustained flight time above Mach 3.2 of 74 minutes. The maximum endurance test lasted six hours and 20 minutes. On 22 November, Kelly Johnson wrote to Brig. Gen. Jack C. Ledford, head of the Office of Special Activities, stating, \"The time has come when the bird should leave its nest.\" Three years and seven months after its first flight in April 1962, the OXCART was ready for operational use. It was now time to find work for the most advanced aircraft ever conceived and built.\n\nDISCUSSIONS ON THE OXCART'S FUTURE EMPLOYMENT\n\nAlthough the OXCART had been designed to replace the U-2 as a strategic reconnaissance aircraft to fly over the Soviet Union, this use had become doubtful long before the OXCART was ready for operational use. The U-2 Affair of 1960 made Presidents very reluctant to consider overflights of the Soviet Union. Indeed, Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy had both stated publicly that the United States would not conduct such overflights. In July 1962, Secretary of Defense McNamara told DCI McCone that he doubted that the OXCART would ever be used and suggested that improvements in satellite reconnaissance would very likely eliminate the need for the expensive OXCART program. Strongly disagreeing, McCone told McNamara that he had every intention of using OXCART aircraft to fly over the Soviet Union. McCone raised this issue with President Kennedy in April 1963, at a time when the nation's photosatellites were experiencing a great number of failures and the intelligence community was clamoring for better photography to confirm or disprove allegations of the existence of an antiballistic missile system at Leningrad. Unconvinced by McCone's arguments for OXCART overflights, President Kennedy expressed the hope that some means might be devised for improving satellite imagery instead.",

Since satellites had not been able to supply the kinds of coverage needed, U-2s had carried out numerous overflights of Cuba. Nevertheless, the U-2 remained vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles (as had once again been demonstrated by the downing of a SAC U-2 during the Missile Crisis), and project headquarters had even briefly considered sending the A-12 over Cuba in October 1962, even though the aircraft still lacked the required J58 engines and would have had to use much less powerful ones. After the Missile Crisis ended, Air Force U-2s continued to photograph Cuba under a tacit superpower understanding that such monitoring of the withdrawal of the missiles would proceed without interference.

    "text": "Concern arose regarding the purpose of new missile installations near Tallinn, Estonia, and their spread across the northwestern quadrant of the Soviet Union. Reconnaissance satellite photography attempts were hindered by cloud cover. Due to this lack of information, opinions within the intelligence community diverged. Views ranged from the CIA's assessment of long-range surface-to-air missiles countering strategic bombers to the Air Force's belief in an antiballistic missile system. Photo interpreters required higher resolution imagery (12-18 inches) to determine missile size, antenna patterns, and radar configurations. Electronic intelligence (ELINT) analysts also needed data on Tallinn radars, but collection sites couldn't monitor the radar tests. The Soviets never operated the radars in tracking or lock-on modes, preventing analysis of frequencies and performance characteristics. To resolve this, the Office of Special Activities proposed Project SCOPE LOGIC (classified as Operation UPWIND), using OXCART’s high-resolution camera and U-2’s ELINT equipment. An A-12 OXCART from Area 51 would rendezvous with a U-2 from an RAF base. The OXCART's flight path involved skirting the Soviet-Finnish border, then turning down the Baltic Sea along the coasts of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and East Germany before returning to Area 51. This 11,000 nautical mile, 8-hour, 38-minute flight required four aerial refuelings. While not violating Soviet airspace, the A-12's trajectory might appear to Soviet radar operators as a potential penetration near Leningrad.  It was hoped this would activate the Tallinn radar system, allowing both photographic and ELINT collection. Agency weapons experts believed the A-12's speed and electronic countermeasures would protect it from standard Soviet SAMs. The U-2, flying further out to sea, would collect ELINT data safely. State Department opposition prevented the proposal from reaching President Johnson.",

Concerns arose about undetected surface-to-surface missiles in North Vietnam. President Johnson requested a proposal, and the CIA suggested OXCART.  DCI Helms secured presidential approval during a \"Tuesday lunch\" on May 16th, and Operation BLACK SHIELD commenced. Deployment to Kadena Air Base began on May 17th. The first A-12 arrived on May 22nd after a non-stop flight from Area 51. A second arrived on May 24th, and a third on May 27th following a precautionary landing at Wake Island due to navigation and communication issues. Key US and Allied officials, including ambassadors, prime ministers, and military chiefs, were briefed and supported the operation. By May 29th, BLACK SHIELD was operational. The first mission on May 31st involved flights over North Vietnam and the DMZ at Mach 3.1 and 80,000 feet, lasting 3 hours and 39 minutes. The A-12 photographed 70 of 190 known SAM sites and nine other targets. No hostile radar signals were detected, suggesting the flight went unnoticed. Over the following six weeks, seven of 15 alerted BLACK SHIELD missions were flown, with only four detecting hostile radar activity. By mid-July, the missions concluded that no surface-to-surface missiles were deployed in North Vietnam.  Project Headquarters in Langley directed all BLACK SHIELD missions. Secure communications were established between Langley and Kadena. Missions typically involved refueling near Okinawa after takeoff, then again over Thailand after the photographic passes.  The A-12's speed limited time over Vietnam to just 12.5 minutes during single-pass runs.",

In May 1967, Vance directed that SR-71s would assume responsibility for Cuban overflights by 1 July 1967 and would add responsibility for overflights of Southeast Asia by 1 December 1967. Until these capabilities were developed, OXCART was to remain able to conduct assignments on a 15-day notice for Southeast Asia and a seven-day notice for Cuba.\nAll these arrangements were made before the OXCART had conducted a single operational mission, which did not occur until 31 May 1967. In the months that followed the initiation of operations in Asia, the OXCART demonstrated its exceptional technical capabilities. Soon some high-level Presidential advisors and Congressional leaders began to question the decision to phase out OXCART, and the issue was reopened. The CIA contended that the A-12 was the better craft because it flew higher, faster, and had superior cameras. The Air Force maintained that its two-seat SR-71 had a better suite of sensors, with three different cameras (area search, spotting, and mapping), infrared detectors, side-looking aerial radar, and ELINT-collection gear. In an effort to resolve this argument, the two aircraft were pitted against each other in a flyoff codenamed NICE GIRL. On 3 November 1967, an A-12 and an SR-71 flew identical flight paths, separated in time by one hour, from north to south roughly above the Mississippi River. The data collected during these missions were evaluated by representatives of the CIA, DIA, and other Defense Department intelligence organizations.\nThe results proved inconclusive. Both photographic systems provided imagery of sufficient quality for analysis. The A-12 Type-I camera's 72-mile swath width and 5,000-foot film supply were superior to the SR-71 Operational Objective camera's 28-mile swath and 3,300-foot film supply. On the other hand, the SR-71's infrared, side-looking aerial radar, and ELINT/COMINT equipment provided some unique intelligence not available from the A-12. Air Force planners admitted, however, that some of this equipment would have to be sacrificed in order to provide the SR-71 with ECM gear.",

    "text": "Although the flyoff had not settled the question of which aircraft was superior, the OXCART did win a temporary reprieve in late November 1967. The Johnson administration decided to keep both fleets for the time being, particularly because the OXCART was actually flying missions over North Vietnam. With expenditures for the Vietnam war rising steadily, the question of reducing the costs of competing reconnaissance programs was bound to surface again. In the spring of 1968, there was yet another study of the OXCART and SR-71 programs. On 16 May 1968, the new Secretary of Defense, Clark Clifford, reaffirmed the original decision to terminate the OXCART program and store the aircraft. President Johnson confirmed this decision on 21 May.\nProject headquarters selected 8 June 1968 as the earliest possible date for phasing out all OXCART aircraft. Those A-12s already at the Nevada site were placed in storage, and the aircraft on Okinawa were scheduled to return by 8 June. Unfortunately, tragedy struck before this redeployment took place. On 4 June 1968 during a test flight from Kadena to check out a new engine, an A-12 disappeared 520 miles east of Manila. Search and rescue missions found no trace of the plane or its pilot, Jack W. Weeks. Several days later the remaining two A-12s left Okinawa to join the other eight OXCART aircraft in storage at Palmdale, California. Because the A-12s were smaller than either of the Air Force's versions, the only parts that could be salvaged for Air Force use were the J58 engines. The OXCART's outstanding Perkin-Elmer cameras cannot be used in the SR-71 because the two-seater Air Force aircraft has a smaller camera compartment than that of the A-12. Constructed from one of the most durable metals known to man but unable to fly for want of engines, the OXCART aircraft are fated to remain inactive at Palmdale for many, many years.",

    "text": "POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO THE OXCART\nThe OXCART was the last high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft produced for the CIA, although the Office of Special Activities did briefly consider several possible successors to the OXCART during the mid-1960s. The first of these, known as Project ISINGLASS, was prepared by General Dynamics to utilize technology developed for its Convair Division's earlier FISH-1 proposal and its new F-111 fighter in order to create an aircraft capable of Mach 4-5 at 100,000 feet. General Dynamics completed its feasibility study in the fall of 1964, and OSA took no further action because the proposed aircraft would still be vulnerable to existing Soviet countermeasures.\nIn 1965 a more ambitious design from McDonnell Aircraft came under consideration as Project RHEINBERRY (although some of the work seems to have come under the ISINGLASS designation as well). This proposal featured a rocket-powered aircraft that would be launched from a B-52 mother ship and ultimately reach speeds as high as Mach 20 and altitudes of up to 200,000 feet. Because building this aircraft would have involved tremendous technical challenges and correspondingly high costs, the Agency was not willing to embark on such a program at a time when the main emphasis in overhead reconnaissance had shifted from aircraft to satellites. As a result, when the OXCART program ended in the summer of 1968, no more advanced successor was waiting in the wings—only the veteran U-2.",

    "text": "SUMMARY OF THE OXCART PROGRAM\nIntended to replace the U-2 as a collector of strategic intelligence, the OXCART was never used for this purpose. Its brief deployment was strictly for obtaining tactical intelligence, and its photographic product contributed very little to the Agency's strategic intelligence mission. By the time OXCART became operational, photosatellite systems had filled the role originally conceived for it. The most advanced aircraft of the 20th century had become an anachronism before it was ever used operationally.\nThe OXCART did not even outlast the U-2, the aircraft it was supposed to replace. The OXCART lacked the quick-response capability of the smaller craft: a U-2 unit could be activated overnight, and within a week it could deploy abroad, fly sorties, and return to home base. The OXCART planes required precise logistic planning for fuel and emergency landing fields, and their inertial guidance systems needed several days for programming and stabilization. Aerial tankers had to be deployed in advance along an OXCART's flight route and be provisioned with the highly specialized fuel used by the J58 engines. All of this required a great deal of time and the effort of several hundred people. A U-2 mission could be planned and flown with a third fewer personnel. Although the OXCART program created a strategic reconnaissance aircraft with unprecedented speed, range, and altitude, the program's most important contributions lay in other areas: aerodynamic design, high-impact plastics, engine performance, cameras",

    "text": "The U-2 program not only provided information on individual Soviet weapons systems, but also helped analysts assess basic Soviet intentions, particularly during crisis situations, as Dulles wrote in May 1960:\n\n\"Whenever the international situation becomes tense because of a problem in some particular area, we are concerned whether the situation might get beyond control – that someone on the other side might suddenly and irrationally unleash big war… Our knowledge of Soviet military preparations, however, resulting from the overflight program, has given us an ability to discount or call the bluff of the Soviets with confidence. We have been able to conclude that Soviet statements were more rhetorical than threatening and that our courses of action could be carried through without serious risk of war and without Soviet interference.\"\n\nDulles closed his report on the U-2's accomplishments by putting the program in perspective as part of the entire national intelligence effort, noting that \"in terms of reliability, of precision, of access to otherwise inaccessible installations, its contribution has been unique. And in the opinion of the military, of the scientists and of the senior officials responsible for our national security it has been, to put it simply, invaluable.\"\n\nThe impact of the U-2 overflights on international relations is harder to measure. On the one hand, the intelligence they gathered was a major factor in keeping the United States from beginning a costly and destabilizing arms race in the late 1950s and early 1960s by showing that the Soviet Union was not engaged in a major buildup of strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. On the other hand, violations of Soviet airspace by U-2s strained relations with Moscow at times and led to the collapse of the 1960 summit meeting. On balance, however, the impact of the U-2 on superpower relations was positive. Without the intelligence gathered by the U-2, the Soviet Union's strategic military capabilities would have remained a mystery, making it very difficult for the President to resist pressure from the military, the Congress, and the public to carry out major increases in strategic weapons, which would have poisoned relations with the Soviet Union far more than the small number of overflights did.",

Bases in Germany, Turkey, Norway, and Pakistan played a major role in overflights of the Soviet Union. Bases in India, Thailand, Japan, and the Philippines greatly assisted operations in Asia. Two Allies – the United Kingdom and Nationalist China – made an even greater contribution to the U-2 program by providing pilots and conducting overflights. British pilots began flying in late 1958 and conducted two important overflights of the Soviet Union in late 1959 and early 1960. After the end of such missions in May 1960, the need for British participation lessened. RAF pilots henceforth flew only training or ferry missions, although their use for operational missions was considered on several occasions.\n\nThe end of overflights of the Soviet Union reduced the importance of British participation but resulted in the addition of a new source of pilots when the focus of interest for the U-2 in its strategic-intelligence-gathering role shifted to the People's Republic of China. The United States and Nationalist China had been conducting joint reconnaissance projects over the Chinese mainland since the mid-1950s, and in 1961, the CIA equipped the Nationalist Chinese with the latest in reconnaissance aircraft, the U-2. For the next 12 years, Agency U-2s with Nationalist Chinese pilots brought back large quantities of information on the development of Communist China's armed forces, nuclear technology, and economy. Such information was extremely important to US policymakers. Nationalist China paid a high price in lives for its participation in the U-2 program: seven pilots died (five in training accidents and two on overflights), and another three were captured.",

With its strategic-intelligence-collection role often on hold, the U-2 became highly useful as a collector of tactical intelligence during crisis situations. Beginning with the Suez Crisis of 1956 and continuing with subsequent Middle Eastern wars, a rebellion in Indonesia, Sino-Indian border fighting, and culminating in support to the growing US involvement in Indochina, U-2 photography provided accurate and up-to-date intelligence to US policymakers and field commanders, assisting them in crisis management and the planning of military operations. Agency U-2s also assisted in monitoring cease-fire agreements in the Middle East, with operations occurring after an undeclared war in 1970 and the 1973 Middle East war.\n\nBy the time the OXCART became fully operational, manned strategic reconnaissance of the Soviet Union was no longer seriously considered. The political risks were too high, especially since the quality of intelligence from reconnaissance satellites was increasing steadily. Thus, the OXCART’s only operational use was for collecting tactical intelligence in the Far East. Like the U-2, the OXCART gathered valuable intelligence during crisis situations. Thus, in January 1968, OXCART photography revealed the location of the USS Pueblo and showed that the North Koreans were not preparing any large-scale military activity in conjunction with the ship’s seizure.",

    "text": "One very important byproduct of the CIA’s manned reconnaissance program was the many advances in technology that it generated. Thanks to simplified covert procurement arrangements and the lack of detailed and restricting specifications, creative designers such as Kelly Johnson produced state-of-the-art aircraft in record time. The U-2, designed to carry out reconnaissance missions for two years at best, proved so successful that, even after its original area of activity became too dangerous for overflights at the end of four years, the aircraft served the CIA well for another 14 years and still is in service with other government agencies. The OXCART is an even better example of the technological advances generated by the CIA’s reconnaissance program. Although the OXCART was designed almost 30 years ago and first flown in 1962, its speed and altitude have never been equaled. The development of the aircraft also led to the use of new materials in aircraft construction. Unfortunately, the technological breakthroughs that made the OXCART possible took longer than expected. By the time the aircraft was ready for operations, the missions originally planned for it were no longer practicable. The tremendous technological achievement represented by the OXCART ultimately led to the aircraft’s demise by inspiring the Air Force to purchase its own version of the aircraft. The government could not afford to maintain two such similar reconnaissance programs. The elimination of the Agency’s OXCART program did not, however, spell the end of the usefulness of the world’s most advanced aircraft; its offspring, the SR-71, is still in service.\n\nIn addition to the aircraft themselves, many other items associated with the reconnaissance program have represented important advances in technology. The flight suits and life-support systems of the U-2 and OXCART pilots were the forerunners of the equipment used in the space program. Camera resolution improved dramatically as the result of cameras and lenses produced for the CIA’s reconnaissance program.",

    "text": "Limited Reconnaissance Projects - AQUILINE\nIn the early 1960s, obtaining coverage of hostile territory presented numerous challenges. The U-2's vulnerability to Soviet surface-to-air missiles, as demonstrated by losses over the Soviet Union, Cuba, and the People's Republic of China, was a significant concern.  The OXCART/A-12 was still in development and its susceptibility to Soviet radars and missiles remained uncertain. While photosatellites offered safe intelligence gathering, their inability to provide on-demand coverage of specific targets posed a limitation.  Several key intelligence targets, like Cuba and the new Soviet radar installation at Tallinn (Estonia), were not located deep within hostile territory, prompting CIA scientists and engineers to explore the potential of small, unmanned aircraft for aerial reconnaissance. They believed that advancements in miniaturization of electronic technology could enable the development of a reconnaissance vehicle with minimal radar cross-section and small visual and acoustic signatures, allowing it to operate undetected.\n\nIn mid-1965, David L. Christ, chief of the Office of Research and Development's (ORD) Applied Physics Division, and Frank Briglia initiated work on the concept of a small, inexpensive aircraft, roughly the size of a large bird, capable of carrying various payloads for photography, nuclear sensing, and ELINT collection. ORD subsequently formed a Special Projects Group to develop the aircraft, with Briglia as project manager.  Only the Douglas Aircraft Company responded favorably to a request for proposals to study the feasibility of a low-altitude reconnaissance system, receiving a study contract on 15 November 1965.  Subsequent Agency contracts followed on 23 November 1966 for developing an operational low-altitude intelligence-gathering system, with further contracts awarded in 1968 and 1969.\n\nThe AQUILINE prototype developed by Douglas Aircraft (which merged with McDonnell to form McDonnell-Douglas in 1969) was essentially a powered glider with an 8.5-foot wingspan, weighing only 105 pounds. Its tail-mounted engine, a small 3.5-horsepower two-cycle engine originally designed by the McCullough Corporation for chainsaws, drove a two-bladed propeller.  AQUILINE's design speed was 60 knots at 1,000 feet with a 15-pound payload, and its exceptional fuel efficiency (480 nautical miles per gallon) allowed for up to 30 hours of flight.\n\n1968 tests at the US Navy's Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California, demonstrated AQUILINE's low visibility.  Even with a bright orange upper surface to aid chase aircraft pilots, maintaining visual contact proved difficult.  The recovery process, involving flying the aircraft into a net close to the ground, frequently damaged wings or propeller, leading to constant repairs and the eventual destruction of two out of five prototypes.\n\nDespite minimal visual and acoustic signatures, AQUILINE's radar cross-section remained problematic. While less than one-tenth of a square meter at low frequencies (smaller than an eagle's radar signature), flares in the VHF region increased detection risk. Studies suggested these issues could be resolved, but navigation presented a greater challenge. Lacking a programmable autopilot, AQUILINE required remote control from the ground, necessitating relaying commands via high-flying aircraft (DC-6 or U-2) once beyond the horizon, limiting its range to 250-350 nautical miles.\n\nBy 1971, ORD had invested six years and $33 million in AQUILINE, but significant challenges persisted. The project was transferred to the Office of Special Activities for operational testing at Area 51, Nevada.  Flight tests demonstrated the aircraft's capabilities, but [Redacted Information]",

    "text": "The initial specifications for Project AQUILINE, set in 1967, envisioned a range of 1,300 miles and the acquisition of very high-resolution photography of a target before successfully returning to the launch site.  However, upgrading AQUILINE to a practical long-range reconnaissance system was estimated to require an additional $3.1 million and two to three years.  On the recommendation of DDS&T Carl Duckett on 1 November 1971, Project AQUILINE was canceled. The project's aircraft and equipment were transferred to the US Army for use in a battlefield management system known as AQUILA, which has yet to be deployed due to ongoing developmental problems.\n\nWhile AQUILINE was in development, its chief aerodynamicist, Charles N. Adkins, left the program believing its escalating costs would prevent it from yielding a deployable aircraft.  He wanted to build a small, inexpensive remote-controlled aircraft to test a low-cost, lightweight autopilot being developed by ORD.  Under a $5,000 time-and-materials contract with Melpar, Incorporated, Adkins hired a local model aircraft builder to assemble and modify a standard Hawk-750 glider kit, powering it with a rear-mounted engine and pusher propeller. Following successful test flights, Adkins installed a small camera and took aerial photographs.  This effort to build a \"Miniature Multi-Purpose Airborne Vehicle\" became known as Project AXILLARY.\n\nMelpar received a second contract for $50,000 to install ORD's autopilot in the aircraft, and project managers then sought a purpose for their vehicle.  The two main possibilities were a short-range reconnaissance vehicle for peace-monitoring or intelligence-gathering, and a short-range warhead delivery system. In 1971, the Office of Special Activities evaluated AXILLARY flight-testing and determined the small model aircraft unsuitable for covert reconnaissance due to its large radar cross section and significant acoustic signature.  However, its radar signature made it potentially useful as a weapons system. ORD suggested equipping AXILLARY with a radar-homing unit and a small warhead, making it an inexpensive means to destroy surface-to-air missile system radars in North Vietnam. The Director of Defense Research and Engineering, John Foster, liked the concept and provided DOD funding for ORD to develop two versions of AXILLARY: one with a radar-homer and one with a television reconnaissance package.  The radar-homing system proved successful, with AXILLARY destroying a radar during testing at China Lake Naval Air Station. However, the end of US involvement in Vietnam in early 1973 led to the cancellation of further DOD funding, and AXILLARY was shelved. Melpar continued working on the radar-homing version and eventually sold AXILLARY-type aircraft to Israel, which used them to destroy Syrian radars in Lebanon in 1982.",

    "text": "While work progressed on low-altitude, short-range reconnaissance systems like AQUILINE and AXILLARY, CIA scientists and engineers also worked on a high-altitude recoverable unmanned reconnaissance vehicle with an extremely low radar cross section for undetected flight over hostile territory. During the 1960s, the Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical Company of San Diego conducted a study on constructing an undetectable drone known as SANDY HOOK. This 44-foot-long drone was designed to operate at 120,000 feet at Mach 0.95 with a range of 5,000 nautical miles and a radar cross section of 0.01 square meters. Project SANDY HOOK never progressed far due to projected high costs and substantial technical risks, leading to its cancellation in December 1969.\n\nSome SANDY HOOK concepts were incorporated into a new project, PINE RIDGE, a proposal for an unmanned reconnaissance vehicle with an even lower radar cross section (0.001 square meters). Research on SANDY HOOK indicated this low radar cross section was achievable and would prevent detection and tracking by existing radar defense systems. The PINE RIDGE proposal called for a delta-shaped vehicle approximately 17 feet long with a 21-foot wingspan. Two vertical stabilizers would give the vehicle an overall height of three to four feet. An existing Teledyne J-100-CA-100 Turbojet engine could power the vehicle at Mach 0.9 at an operating altitude of 65,000 to 75,000 feet, with an estimated range of 1,300 nautical miles. Despite interest within the CIA and Air Force for an undetectable reconnaissance vehicle, PINE RIDGE was never funded. In January 1971, high-level representatives from DOD and CIA rejected a proposal for a feasibility study by Ryan Aircraft. The following year, the Director of the Office of Special Activities, Brigadier General Harold F. Knowles, proposed to the DCI that the CIA develop a clandestine low-radar-cross-section vehicle like PINE RIDGE, but this also failed to gain support. With improvements in satellite reconnaissance over the previous decade, neither the CIA nor the Air Force was willing to invest substantial funding in sending aircraft, manned or unmanned, over the Soviet Union.",

It is easiest to describe what Gateway is by starting with a short description of those associated techniques that share some common aspects with the Gateway Experience but are nevertheless different. In this way, we can develop a frame of reference at the outset, which will provide useful concepts to help understand Gateway by comparison as we proceed.",

    "section": "Hypnosis",
    "text": "According to the theories of psychologist Ronald Stone and the biomedical engineering models of Itshak Bentov, hypnosis is basically a technique that permits acquisition of direct access to the sensory-motor cortex and pleasure centers, and lower cerebral (emotional) portions (and associated pleasure centers) of the right side of the human brain following successful disengagement of the stimulus screening function of the left hemisphere of the brain. The left hemisphere is the self-cognitive, verbal, and linear reasoning component of the mind. It fulfills the function of screening incoming stimuli by categorizing, assessing, and assigning meaning before allowing passage to the right hemisphere of the mind. The right hemisphere, which functions as the noncritical, holistic, nonverbal, and pattern-oriented component of the brain, appears to accept what the left hemisphere passes to it without question. Consequently, if the left hemisphere can be distracted either through boredom or through reduction to a soporific, semi-sleep state, external stimuli, including hypnotic suggestions, are allowed to pass unchallenged into the right hemisphere where they are accepted and acted upon directly. The result may involve an emotional reaction originating in the lower cerebral region, sensory/motor responses requiring involvement of the cortex, and so on. Both the sensory and motor cortices of the right cerebral portion of the brain contain a sequence of points known as the \"homunculus,\" which corresponds to points in the body (see Exhibit 1). Stimulation of the corresponding area on the cortex causes an immediate response in the associated portion of the body. Consequently, the induction of the suggestion that the left leg is numb, if it reaches the right hemisphere unchallenged and is referred to the appropriate area of the sensory cortex, will result in an electrical reaction being generated that will induce the feeling of numbness. Similarly, the suggestion that the person is experiencing a general feeling of happiness and well-being would be referred to the appropriate pleasure centers located in the lower cerebral portion or in the cortex of the right hemisphere, thereby inducing the suggested feeling of euphoria. Finally, suggestions such as one that informs the hypnotic subject that he enjoys enhanced concentration or powers of memory would be responded to in the right hemisphere by accessing unused information storage capacity normally held in reserve as a result of left hemisphere selection and control processes. This aspect will become significant in the context of the Gateway process when attention is given to examining the way that hypnosis may be used to accelerate progress in the early stages of the Gateway Experience.",

    "section": "Transcendental Meditation",
    "text": "On the other hand, transcendental meditation works in a distinctly different fashion. In this technique, intense and protracted single-minded concentration on the process of drawing energy up the spinal cord ultimately results in what appears to be the creation of acoustical standing waves in the cerebral ventricles, which are then conducted to the gray matter in the cerebral cortex on the right side of the brain. As a result, according to Bentov, these waves \"will stimulate and eventually 'polarize' the cortex in such a way that it will tend to conduct a signal along the homunculus, starting from the toes and on up.\" The Bentov bio-medical model, as described in a book by Lee Sannella, M.D., entitled *Kundalini-Psychosis or Transcendence*, states that the standing acoustical waves are the result of the altered rhythm of heart sounds occasioned by prolonged practice of meditation, and which set up sympathetic vibrations in the walls of the fluid-filled cavities that comprise the third and lateral ventricles of the brain. In addition, according to Bentov, \"The states of bliss described by those whose Kundalini symptoms have completed the full cycle up and down the hemispheres may be explained as a self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a 'current' along the sensory cortex.\" Bentov also notes, \"that most of the described symptoms start on the left side of the body means that it is mostly a development occurring in the right hemisphere.\" Although normally a period of meditation involving intense concentration may be required to produce the desired effect, Bentov also notes that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations in the range of 4-7 Hertz (cycles per second) will cause sympathetic vibration in the ventricles, thereby producing standing waves at the desired frequency \"with no effort on the part of the subject.\" This is significant because the dominant frequency produced by the Gateway tapes is in exactly that range.",

    "section": "Consciousness Alteration Methodologies",
    "text": "Several methodologies exist for altering or expanding consciousness, sharing objectives and/or methods with the Gateway Experience. Kundalini, a concept from Hindu yoga, involves intense concentration and practice, sometimes requiring years to 'bring up the Kundalini.'  Bentov suggests that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations between 4-7 Hertz for extended periods may achieve similar results, citing the example of riding in a car with specific suspension and seat characteristics or prolonged exposure to air conditioning duct frequencies. He cautions that cumulative exposure to these vibrations could trigger spontaneous physio-Kundalini sequences in those with sensitive nervous systems. Biofeedback employs left hemisphere self-cognitive powers to access right brain areas like the lower cerebral, motor, and sensory cortices, as well as pleasure centers. Unlike hypnosis (which suppresses the left hemisphere) or transcendental meditation (which bypasses it), biofeedback trains the left hemisphere to visualize desired outcomes and recognize feelings linked to successful right hemisphere access. Self-monitoring devices like digital thermometers inform the left brain of its success, enabling it to repeatedly instruct the right brain to reestablish the pathways, strengthening them for conscious, on-demand access. This technique can be used for purposes like increasing circulation for healing, suppressing tumors, stimulating pleasure centers, and achieving deep meditative states, especially for beginners.",

    "text": "The Gateway Experience is a training system designed to enhance the strength, focus, and coherence of brainwave output between hemispheres, altering consciousness beyond the physical sphere, and even transcending time and space.  It allows access to intuitive knowledge unavailable to ordinary consciousness. Unlike other forms of meditation, Gateway uses the Hemi-Sync technique, defined as a state where EEG patterns in both hemispheres are simultaneously equal in amplitude and frequency. While Hemi-Sync is rare and fleeting in normal consciousness, audio techniques developed by Bob Monroe can induce and sustain it. Studies show that experienced Zen meditators can achieve Hemi-Sync at will for extended durations. Research also indicates that the Monroe tapes focus brain energy into a narrower frequency band, increasing brainwave size (a measure of brain energy/power) as the individual progresses through the tapes.",

The Gateway system posits that once brainwave frequency and amplitude are coherent, both can be accelerated, allowing the mind to resonate at higher vibrational levels and synchronize with rarified universal energies. At these levels, the mind processes information through the same matrix used for physical sensory input, leading to perceived meaning in the form of symbols, holistic intuitions, or scenarios with visual and aural components.",

Using the concept of 'beat' frequencies (the difference between two frequencies played in each ear), Hemi-Sync generates frequencies outside the audible range, delivered subliminally. The aim is to relax the left hemisphere, induce a sleep-like state, and achieve hemispheric coherence, promoting higher brainwave amplitude and frequency.

Prolonged practices like yoga and Zen meditation change the heart's resonant frequency by eliminating the 'bifurcation echo,' allowing the heartbeat's sound to resonate harmoniously throughout the body at approximately seven times per second.  The bifurcation echo occurs when the heart's pressure pulse rebounds from the lower abdomen bifurcation (where the aorta forks) and collides with subsequent pulses, creating interference.  Gateway, like meditation, induces deep relaxation, diminishing the bifurcation echo and creating a rhythmic sine wave resonating throughout the body and up into the head.

This puts the body's energy field into homogeneity with its surrounding environment and promotes movement of the seat of consciousness into the surrounding environment partly in response to the fact that the two electromagnetic medians are now a single energy continuum. Thus, the same process which moves the brain into focused coherence at steadily higher levels of frequency and amplitude so as to entrain analogous frequencies in the universe for data collection also promotes enhancement of bodily energy levels to a point adequate to permit the subject to experience an out-of-body movement. In addition, by resonating with the earth’s electromagnetic sphere the human body creates a surprisingly powerful carrier wave to assist the mind in communication activity with other human minds similarly tuned.",

To do this, we will first consider the fundamental character of the material world. The first point is that the two terms, matter and energy, tend to be misleading if taken to indicate two distinctly different states of existence. Science now knows that both the electrons, which spin in the energy field located around the nucleus of the atom, and the nucleus itself are made up of nothing more than oscillating energy grids. Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist. Rather, atomic structure is composed of oscillating energy surrounded by other oscillating energy which orbits at extraordinarily high speeds. The point to be made is that the entire human being, brain, consciousness and all, is, like the universe which surrounds him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields. The so-called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy, and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite states (motion vs. rest).",

    "text": "Energy creates, stores, and retrieves meaning in the universe by projecting or expanding at certain frequencies in a three-dimensional mode that creates a living pattern called a hologram. Holograms are capable of encoding so much detail that, for example, it is possible to take a holographic projection of a glass of swamp water and view it under magnification to see small organisms not visible to the naked eye. The key to creating any hologram is that energy in motion must interact with energy in a state of rest (non-motion). To activate or, in effect, to “perceive” the meaning of a hologram, energy must be passed through the interference pattern generated by interaction between the moving energy and the energy at rest.  Of further importance is the fact that even if we broke a hologram into a number of pieces, each individual piece would recreate the entire holographic image all by itself. The smaller the piece, the fuzzier and more distorted would be the resulting holographic projection, but the fact remains that a whole projection would nonetheless be made. The universe is composed of interacting energy fields, some at rest and some in motion. It is, in and of itself, one gigantic hologram of unbelievable complexity. According to certain theories, the human mind is also a hologram which attunes itself to the universal hologram by the medium of energy exchange, thereby deducing meaning and achieving the state which we call consciousness.",

Changes in the frequency and amplitude of the electrostatic field which comprises the human mind determine the configuration and hence the character of the holographic energy matrix which the mind projects to intercept meaning directly from the holographic transmissions of the universe. Then, to make sense of what the holographic image is “saying” to it, the mind proceeds to compare the image just received with itself. Specifically, it does this by comparing the image received with that part of its own hologram which constitutes memory. By registering differences in geometric form and in energy frequency, the consciousness perceives. In states of expanded consciousness the right hemisphere of the human brain, in its holistic, nonlinear and nonverbal mode of functioning, acts as the primary matrix or receptor for this holographic input while, by operating in phase or coherence with the right brain, the left hemisphere provides the secondary matrix through its binary, computer-like method of functioning to screen further the data by comparison and reduce it to a discreet, two-dimensional form.",

Humans not only know, but they know that they know. They are able to monitor the process of their own thinking and maintain an awareness of it. Moreover, they can conduct a comparative assessment of their thought processes against various evaluating standards they have adopted. Humans do this because they can project a holographic picture of their own thought processes out in front of them, so to speak, to duplicate aspects of its own hologram, measure or “perceive” that projection through comparison with the memory of its own hologram, and apply its evaluation standards. Up to this point, our discussion of the Gateway process has been relatively simple and easy to follow. Now the fun begins. Gateway involves more than just perception of those aspects of the universal hologram which are accessible in dimensions of time-space as we know it. To explain how human consciousness can be brought to transcend the limitations of time-space, we must first appreciate what time-space is and why it constitutes such a formidable barrier to perception of the greater reality which surrounds us.",

Physicists define time as a measurement of change within the confines of motion. In other words, for energy to be in motion, it must first be limited in some way. Within that confinement, it has the capacity for vibratory motion so that its location is distinguishable from other locations (space). Energy which is not confined is force without limit – infinity – and cannot move because there are no other locations from which it is absent.  Without the limits of form, it is the dimension of time. It is infinity, and is therefore outside of the dimension of energy/form.\nThis concept implies that a specific energy form is nothing beyond its boundaries, and is also beyond space because it is limited to a specific location and is absent from other locations. But in the state of infinity, there are no boundaries, no \"here\" to differentiate from \"there.\"  Energy uniformly extended is in a state of infinite rest and, therefore, cannot perceive. It retains its inherent being. Energy in infinity is said to be completely at rest, the fundamental power of existence, without form. It has no beginning, no end, no location.\nEnergy in infinity is termed by physicists, the Absolute. Between the Absolute (in its absolute state) and the \"material\" universe in which we experience physical existence, are various intervening dimensions which human consciousness may access. Theoretically, human consciousness may continue to expand its perceptual capability until it reaches the dimension of the Absolute, at which perception stops because the Absolute generates no holograms of or about itself. Since the Absolute is conscious energy without boundaries, it occupies every dimension, but we cannot perceive it in the time-space dimension in which we have our physical existence. It overlays everything, as do many of the intervening dimensions through which the energies of the universe enter these intervening dimensions from their home in the state of infinity (the Absolute). To enter these intervening dimensions, human consciousness must focus with such intense coherence that the frequency of its energy (the brainwave output) accelerates to the point where the resulting frequency, if displayed on an oscilloscope, would look virtually like a solid line. Achievement of this altered consciousness sets the stage for perception of non-time-space dimensions.",

    "section": "Planck's Distance and 'Clicking Out'",
    "text": "This is an aspect of quantum mechanics which applies to the fact that any oscillating frequency (such as a brainwave) reaches two points of complete rest which constitute the boundaries of each individual oscillation (i.e., movement up or down). Without these points of rest, an oscillating wave pattern would be impossible since the points of rest are required to permit the energy to change direction and thus continue vibrating between rigid limits. But it is also true that when, for an infinitesimally brief instant, that energy reaches one of its two points of rest, it \"clicks out\" of time-space and joins infinity. That critical step out of time-space occurs when the speed of the oscillation drops below 10^-33 centimeters per second (Planck's Distance).  Quantum mechanics tell us that when distances go below Planck's Distance, we enter, in effect, a new world. The human consciousness wave pattern can reach such a high frequency that the pattern of \"clickouts\" comes so close together that there is virtual continuity in it. Then, a portion of that consciousness is actually postulated to establish and maintain its information collection function in those dimensions located between time-space and the Absolute. Thus, as the almost continuous \"clickout\" pattern establishes itself in continuous phase at speeds below Planck's Distance but before reaching the state of total rest, human consciousness passes through the looking glass of time-space. The Gateway experience, with its associated Hemi-Sync technique, is apparently designed, if used systematically and patiently, to enable human consciousness to establish a coherent pattern of perception in those dimensions where speeds below Planck’s distance apply. This holds true irrespective of whether the individual is exercising his consciousness while in his physical body or whether he is doing so after having separated that consciousness from the physical body (i.e., the so-called out-of-body state).",

    "text": "The behavior of subatomic particles provides an interesting example of the phenomenon of \"clicking out.\" Subatomic particles communicate with each other once their energy fields become entrained as a result of colliding with each other. The communication concerned is postulated to be occurring during the \"click out\" phase in the oscillation of the energy fields comprising the subatomic particles concerned. This accounts for the cross-communication at what, in terms of time-space velocities, would seem to involve speeds in excess of light. In reality, Einstein's Theory of Relativity is not being invalidated but, rather, the communication is taking place outside the dimension of time-space to which the Theory of Relativity is strictly confined. Quantum theory postulates a kind of long-range Siamese twin effect whenever two subatomic particles collide and then go their different ways. Even when the particles are halfway across the universe from each other, they instantaneously respond to each other's actions.  Regarding attempts to quantify what is known about the behavior of energy in dimensions apparently outside of time-space, physicists are working on hypothetical particles, called tachyons, which can move at speeds greater than light. The speed of tachyons starts just above the speed of light and ranges all the way to infinite velocities.",

    "text": "The observed capability of quasars to eject enormously concentrated beams of matter from their interiors in a controlled, non-concentric version of the \"Big-bang\" envisages a similar process occurring in the generation of the universe. Noting that galaxies north of our own are moving away faster than those to the south, and that those to the east and west are demonstrably more distant, this is regarded as evidence that the jet of matter which expanded into our universe has turned back upon itself, forming an ovoid or egg shape.  \"Matter\" in our universe enters the ovoid pattern following ejection from a nucleus composed of extremely compressed energy through a \"white hole.\" At the end of its trip to the far end of the ovoid, it departs via a \"black hole.\" In such a model, time is a measure of the change which occurs as energy evolves into new, more complex forms as it progresses from the white hole side of the nucleus, around the shell of this \"cosmic egg\" until it enters the black hole. In other words, as energy—expelled from infinity and confined within limits by the consciousness of the Absolute—achieves form and motion following ejection from the white hole, time begins as a measure of the cadence of this evolutionary movement as \"reality\" journeys around the shell of the egg to the black hole. The observed distribution of galaxies suggests our universe is located near the point of the egg where matter begins to fall back on itself, explaining why galaxies to the north are moving away more rapidly as they are caught up in the downturn of the stream of matter towards the far end of the cosmic egg. Layered over this cosmic egg is the Absolute which sustains the radiating nucleus. As matter moves around the ovoid towards the black hole where it will be reabsorbed into the radiating nucleus and then the Absolute, it generates the interference pattern within the cosmic egg which constitutes the universal hologram or Torus. Since the Torus is being simultaneously generated by matter in all phases of \"time,\" it reflects the past, present, and future of the universe. By reflecting on this model, it becomes possible to \"see\" how human consciousness, in a sufficiently altered (focused) state, could obtain information concerning the past, present, and future since all exist in the universal hologram simultaneously.  Moreover, it is possible to see how the implosion of energy patterns would cross and recross to create an incredibly complex four-dimensional hologram or Torus, reflecting the multi-dimensional developing pattern of evolution. All movements of the energies leave their mark and tell their story throughout time.",

Consciousness is the organizing and sustaining principle that provides impetus and guidance to keep energy in motion within given parameters so that a specific reality will result.  When consciousness can perceive itself (its own hologram), it reaches self-cognition. Humans and the Absolute possess this, but in the latter, it is a function of energy and its associated consciousness in infinity (omniscience and omnipotence in perceptual unity). When energy returns to total rest within the Absolute, it returns to the continuum of consciousness in limitless, timeless perception. Thus, the more complex an energy system, the more consciousness it possesses. Our consciousness is that differentiated aspect of universal consciousness residing within the Absolute. It organizes the energy patterns of our physical body but is distinctly separate from and superior to it. Since consciousness exists apart from and outside of reality, beyond time-space, it, like the Absolute, has neither beginning nor end. Reality has both a beginning and an end because it is bounded within time-space, but energy and its associated consciousness are eternal.

This return doesn't imply extinction of the separate entity; rather, it suggests a differentiated consciousness merging with and participating in the universal consciousness of the Absolute without losing its separate identity and accumulated self-knowledge. What it loses is the capability for independent thought holograms since that requires energy in motion. It retains the power to perceive but loses the power of will or choice. In exchange, this consciousness participates in the all-knowing infinite continuum of consciousness characteristic of energy in the ever-present.

These techniques are designed to enable the participant to alter his or her brainwave patterns so as to access different dimensions of reality.  The process includes exercises in focusing, visualization, and energy manipulation.\n\nA. Problem Solving:  One of the basic techniques taught in the Gateway program is how to solve problems by visualizing a desired objective and then creating a universal hologram to bring about the desired objective. This technique leverages the idea that consciousness is the source of all reality, and therefore, our thoughts have the power to influence the development of reality. The complexity of the objective and its divergence from current reality dictates the time required for the universal hologram to reorient reality. Trainers caution against forcing this process due to potential drastic consequences from dislocating existing reality.\n\nB. Color Breathing: This technique utilizes the expanded awareness and focused attentiveness associated with the Focus 12 state to vividly imagine various colors. This is a healing technique designed to restore the body and enhance its physical capabilities by balancing, revitalizing, and retuning bodily energy flows. It is based on the principle that the body’s electromagnetic field can alter its resonance patterns to entrain energy from the Earth’s electrostatic field. The imagined colors cue the mind to the desired frequencies and amplitudes for this entrainment. The effectiveness of color in healing is well-established, although the Hemi-Sync application utilizes the mind as the sole agent, rather than external light sources.\n\nC. Energy Bar Tool:  This technique involves visualizing a small, pulsating dot of light, charging it with energy, and extruding it into a vibrating cylinder. This energy cylinder is then used to channel force from the universe to selected body parts for healing and revitalization. It is also used as a portal for initiating remote viewing.",

Living Body Map: This technique amplifies the energy bar tool's healing application.  The participant visualizes their body and its major systems in appropriate colors, then applies the energy bar tool for energizing, balancing, and healing.  Colored energy streams flowing from the tool to the target area visualize the process. This technique operates on the principle that the body, being composed of energy, can be healed by applying additional energy in the appropriate form, represented by different wavelengths of light (colors).\n\nF. Focus 15: Travel into the Past: This technique requires further expansion of consciousness beyond Focus 12, utilizing additional sound levels on the Hemi-Sync tapes to modify brainwave patterns and provide subliminal suggestions. Time is visualized as a wheel with spokes giving access to different parts of the participant's past. Focus 15 is a difficult state to achieve, with only a small percentage of participants reaching it during the training program. However, trainers claim that with practice, it can be achieved, providing access not only to personal past experiences but also to other aspects of the past.\n\nG.

Specific Hemi-Sync tapes employing Beta signals around 2877.3 CPS (cycles per second) facilitate this state.  Techniques for separation involve visualizations like rolling out, lifting out, or sliding out of the body. Achieving this state is associated with a heightened state of brainwave frequency.\n\nI. Role of REM Sleep:  Research suggests a correlation between out-of-body experiences and REM sleep, which is characterized by motor cortex disengagement and left brain hemisphere suppression.  Using Hemi-Sync tapes during REM sleep may facilitate out-of-body experiences, potentially by focusing the brain to carry a residual memory of naturally occurring out-of-body states during REM into the waking state. Some dreams during deep sleep may be related to the same altered consciousness experienced in Focus 12, 15, and 21. The difference lies in the left hemisphere's disengagement during REM sleep, hindering conscious retrieval of these experiences.\n\nThree conditions seem necessary for inducing out-of-body states: (1) achieving a state of profound quiet in the body, fading the bifurcation echo and establishing resonance at approximately 7 Hertz; (2) synchronizing brain hemisphere wave patterns; and (3) stimulating the right hemisphere into heightened alertness, which disrupts synchronization but only after enhancing frequency range sufficiently to aid in achieving the out-of-body state.\n\nJ. Information Collection Potential: The out-of-body state offers potential for information acquisition. However, distortions remain a significant challenge.  Experiments involving remote viewing of computer-generated numbers have yielded mixed results, likely due to interference from past energy patterns, thought forms, and the potential for distorted perception of holographic energy patterns.  Belief systems may also influence these experiences.",

It is a step by procedure which involves repetitive practice of the techniques concerned, using each new insight as a means of penetrating farther during the next practice session . But the rate of progress is S0 much fagter with the Gateway approach than it is with transcendental meditation or other forms of mental self-discipline and its horizons seem to be so much wider that the discipline needed to practice it would seem to be within the means of even the impatient , result oriented, skeptical pragmatist of our society_ Unlike yoga and other forms of eastern mental discipline_ Gateway does not require the infinite patience and total personal subservience to and faith in a system of discipline designed to absorb all the individual' 9 energies over most Of a lifetime Rather , it will begin to produce at least minimal results within a relatively short time such that enough feedback 1s available to motivate and energize the individual to continue working with it Indeed, the speed with which an individual may expect to seems less a function Of the number of hours spent practicing than it is a Quegteos of the speed with which he or she is able to use the insights gained to release anxieties and stresses within both the mind and the body _ These points Of energy blockage seem to provide the principal barriers to achieving the enhanced energy states and focus of mind needed for rapid progression. The more compulsive, the more \"uptight\" the individual may be at the outset the more barriers he or she will initially encounter to achieving a deep or immediate experience, but as the insights begin to come and the blockages begin to dissolve the way ahead becomes increasingly clear and the value of Gateway moves from the status of a matter of intellectual assessment to one of personal experience. 38 _ Conclusion. There is a sound , rational basis in terms of physical science parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential objectives_ Intuitional insights of not personal but of a practical and professional nature would seem to be within bounds of reasonable expectations _ However, a phased approach for entering the Gateway Experience in an accelerated mode woula seem to be required if the time needed to reach advanced states of altered consciousness 1s to be brought within more manageable limits from the standpoint of establishing an organization-wide exploitation of Gateway' s potential_",

Pakistan, bigger and more populous than the others, is literally an artifact of 18th century colonial division, separated into two by 1,000 miles of unfriendly land. These nations are confined within arbitrary frontiers contrived by colonial mapmakers. Psychologically, they are the heirs of Europe's own fierce nationalism, which fueled the race for empire. As Walter Bagehot observed, political man is a highly imitative animal. The subjugated peoples of the empires resented and rejected colonialism, but assimilated and accepted much of its trappings. Lord Caradon recently reported to the United Nations General Assembly that 50 colonial territories still remained to be freed, 31 in the British Empire alone. The weakest and least viable colonies are the last to be turned loose, a staggering prospect. All these young nations will soon apply for membership in the United Nations, where their equal power with nations like the U.S. and Russia has caused a new set of problems.",

For example, Mauritania is practically a movable country, whose Moorish nomads wander after water in passportless circles through neighboring Mali and Algeria. Since every country must have a capital, Mauritania had to build one from scratch: Nouakchott, a clump of pastel cubes on a bleak stretch of sand dunes near the coast. In Laos, there are so few trained government officials, about 100 in all, that Cabinet making is essentially a game of musical chairs. Ethnic vivisection abounds nearly everywhere.

Recent coups have raised concerns about the viability of these small nations, but their existence, however precarious, is deemed necessary.

In California the mountains shake like ferns in a breeze; the mighty Pacific rears back and up into a mountain of water more than two miles high, then starts its race eastward. With the force of a thousand armies the wind attacks, ripping, shredding everything in its supersonic bombardment. The unbelievable mountain of Pacific seawater follows the wind eastward, burying Los Angeles and San Francisco as if they were but grains of sand: Nothing but nothing stops the relentless, overwhelming onslaught of wind and ocean. Across the continent the thousand mile-per-hour wind wreaks its unholy vengeance, everywhere, mercilessly, unceasingly. Every living thing is ripped into shreds while blown across the countryside; and the earthquake leaves no place untouched. In many places the earth's molten sub-layer breaks through and spreads a sea of white-hot liquid fire to add to the holocaust: Within three hours the fantastic wall of water moves across the continent; burying the wind-ravaged land under two miles of seething water coast-to-coast. In a fraction of a day all vestiges of civilization are gone, and the great cities Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, New York are nothing but legends. Barely a stone is left where millions walked just a few hours before. A few lucky ones who manage to find shelter from the screaming wind on the lee side of Pikes Peak watch the sea of molten fire break through the quaking valleys below. The raging waters follow, piling higher and higher, steaming over the molten earth-fire, and rising almost to their feet. Only great mountains such as this one can withstand the cataclysmic onslaught: North America is not alone in her death throes. Central America suffers the same cannonade wind, earth-fire, and inundation. South America finds the Andes not high enough to stop the cataclysmic violence pounded out by nature in her berserk rage: In less than a day Ecuador, Peru, and western Brazil are shaken madly by the devastating earthquake, burned by molten earth-fire, buried under cubic miles of torrential Pacific seas, and then turned into a frozen hell. Everything freezes. Man, beast, plant, and mud are all rock-hard in less than four hours: Europe cannot escape the onslaught: The raging Atlantic piles higher and higher upon itself, following the screeching wind eastward. The Alps, Pyrenees, Urals, and Scandinavian mountains are shaken and heaved even higher before the wall of water strikes: Western Africa and the sands of the Sahara vanish in nature's wrath, under savage attack by wind and ocean. The area bounded by the Congo, South Africa, and Kenya suffers only severe earthquakes and winds – no inundation: Survivors there marvel at the Sun, standing still in the sky for nearly half a day.",

As the polar basin leaves its home, eastern Siberia, Manchuria, China, and Burma are subjected to the same annihilation as South America: wind, earth-fire, inundation, and freezing: Jungle animals are shredded to ribbons by the wind, piled into mountains of flesh and bone, and buried under avalanches of seawater and mud. Then comes the terrible, paralyzing cold. Not man, nor beast, nor plant, nor earth is left unfrozen in the entire eastern Asian continent, most of which remains below sea level. East of the Urals, in western Siberia, a few lucky people survive the fantastic winds and quakes. Antarctica and Greenland, with their ice caps, now rotate around the earth in the Torrid Zone; and the fury of wind and inundation marches on for six days and nights. During the sixth day the oceans start to settle in their new homes, running off the high grounds. On the seventh day the horrendous rampage is over: The Arctic ice age is ended and a new stone age begins. The oceans – the great homogenizers – have laid down another layer of mud over the existing strata in the great plains, exposed in the Grand Canyon, Painted Desert, and Badlands: The Bay of Bengal basin, just east of India, is now at the North Pole. The Pacific Ocean, just west of Peru, is at the South Pole. Greenland and Antarctica, now rotating equatorially in the Torrid Zone, find their ice caps dissolving madly in the tropical heat: Massive walls of water and ice surge toward the oceans, taking everything from mountains to plains in gushing, heaving paths, creating immense seasonal moraines. In less than twenty-five years the ice caps are gone, and the oceans around the world rise over two hundred feet with the new-found water. The Torrid Zone will be shrouded in a deep fog for generations from the enormous amounts of moisture poured into the atmosphere by the melting ice caps: New ice caps begin to form in the new polar areas. Greenland and Antarctica emerge with verdant, tropical foliage. Australia is the new, unexplored continent in the North Temperate Zone, with only a few handfuls of survivors populating its vastness. New York lies at the bottom of the Atlantic, shattered, melted by earth-fire, and covered by unbelievable amounts of mud. Of San Francisco and Los Angeles, not a trace is left: Egypt emerges from its Mediterranean inundation new and higher still – the land of the ages. The commonplace of our time becomes the mysterious Baalbek of the new era. A new era! Yes, the cataclysm has done its work well: The greatest population regulator of all does once more for man what he refuses to do for himself, and drives the pitiful few who survive into a new stone age. Once more the earth has shifted its 60-mile thick shell, with the poles moving almost to the equator in a fraction of a day. Again the atmosphere and oceans, refusing to change direction with the earth's shell, have wiped out almost all life. After this tumble we join Noah, Adam and Eve, Atlantis, Mu, and Olympus – and Jesus joins Osiris, Ta'aroa, Zeus, and Vishnu:",

There are others who walk with us, too: long forgotten men of science – those who first saw that these tumbles, these cataclysmic catastrophes, or “revolutions” of the earth's shell have happened before, countless times: J. Andre DeLuc in 1779 and Georges Cuvier in 1812 were the foremost. Dolomieu, the famous mineralogist, joined the consensus, as did Escher and Forel, the Swiss geologists; also J. Andre DeLuc Jr., and Von Buch: all agreed that the cataclysms were caused by sudden revolutions of the surface of the earth. Cuvier, in his `Theory of the Earth,' first published in 1812, based his conclusions on his unparalleled correlative research in stratigraphy, comparative anatomy, and palaeontology. At that time he wrote: \"Every part of the earth, every hemisphere, every continent, exhibits the same phenomenon. There has, therefore, been a succession of variations in the economy of organic nature – the various catastrophes which have disturbed the strata have given rise to numerous shiftings of this (continental) basin: It is of much importance to mark, that these repeated irruptions and retreats of the sea have neither been slow nor gradual; on the contrary, most of the catastrophes which occasioned them have been sudden; and this is especially easy to be proved, with regard to the last of these catastrophes. I agree, therefore, with MM DeLuc and Dolomieu, in thinking, that if anything in geology be established, it is, that the surface of our globe has undergone a great and sudden revolution, the date of which cannot be much earlier than five or six thousand years ago – (also) one preceding revolution at least had put (the continents) under water – perhaps two or three irruptions of the sea. These alternations now appear to me to form the problem in geology that it is of most importance to solve – in order to solve it satisfactorily, it would be necessary to discover the cause of these events. These ideas have haunted, I may almost say have tormented me, during my researches among fossil bones – researches which embrace but a very small part of those phenomena of the age preceding the last general revolution of the globe, and which are intimately connected with all the others.\" Many attempts have been made to answer the charge made to the geological profession by Cuvier to explain these sudden revolutions. Among others, Velikovsky tried it through his study of myths and legends; Hapgood tried it; Brown attempted, and in the process amassed a tremendous library of geological data: Every time the cataclysmic concept has come to life, the 'beast has been stoned, burned at the stake, beaten to a pulp, and buried with a vengeance; but the corpse simply won't stay dead. Each time, it raises the lid of its coffin and says in sepulchral tones: \"You will die before I.\"",

Hibben, who in his book, The Lost Americans, said: “This was no ordinary extinction of a vague geological period which fizzled to an uncertain end. This death was catastrophic and all inclusive: What caused the death of forty million animals? The 'corpus delicti' in this mystery may be found almost anywhere: Their bones lie bleaching in the sands of Florida and in the gravels of New Jersey. They weather out of the dry terraces of Texas and protrude from the sticky ooze of the tar pits off Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. The bodies of the victims are everywhere: We find literally thousands together – young and old, foal with dam, calf with cow. The muck pits of Alaska are filled with evidence of universal death – a picture of quick extinction. Any argument as to the cause must apply to North America, Siberia, and Europe as well: Mammoth and bison were torn and twisted as though by a cosmic hand in a godly rage. In many places the Alaskan muck blanket is packed with animal bones and debris in trainload lots – mammoth, mastodon, bison, horses, wolves, bears, and lions: A faunal population in the middle of some cataclysmic catastrophe was suddenly frozen in a charade. Fantastic winds, volcanic burning, inundation and burial in muck, preservation by deep-freeze: Any solution to a consuming mystery must answer all of these.”",

    "text": "Facts; challenges. Hibben's challenge wouldn't leave me alone. Like a hunger, it gnawed at my subconscious. I could hear the tones of Cuvier's challenge, 'find the cause of these events,' still reverberating through the sacred halls of science, ghostly, unanswered. I felt Hibben's challenge later on, prodding: 'answer all of the facts.' I decided that this cataclysmic concept, this catastrophic end which seems to visit our planet time after time, needed verification or refutation once and for all. The first step was to gather all of the known, accepted data from as many 'earth' sciences as possible: stratigraphy, archaeology, anthropology, palaeontology, radiology, oceanography, seismology, glaciology, and many other fields. Correlation of the data between the sciences gave the answer: although there is enough data in each science to indicate that these cataclysms happen, there was not enough to prove the concept; but between-science correlation showed indeed that the concept was true. Not only did it verify that the events have happened, but disclosed when the last five cataclysms were, and what positions the Earth's shell has been in for the last 35,000 years. After years of research, beginning in 1949, Cuvier's challenge had an answer: indeed the cataclysms do happen. And the last one, 6,500 years ago, was Noah's Flood! All right, so they happen; what is it that happens each time? The challenge was really two-fold: Find the process – what happens in a cataclysm; and the trigger – what causes a cataclysm to start. What a chase! And what a dramatic story of the earth's history we uncovered: Civilizations of 20,000 years ago more advanced than our wildest imagination; prehistoric legends from Greece, Egypt, India, and South America which became history instead of legend; lost continents in the Atlantic and Pacific which became dated realities, with logical reasons for their sudden disappearance. Yes, Vishnu came alive: a man who lived through a cataclysm 70,000 years before our time – actually ten cataclysms ago! Now he is known as the Hindu god of ten resurrections from the waters. Osiris, too, was re-discovered; he was the Jesus of his time – a man of Egypt, some 15,000 years ago. Noah smiled at us from the pages of the 'Epic of Gilgamesh' – he actually was a Sumerian named Utnapishtim, who lived 6,500 years ago. The ark he built is more than legend.",

    "text": "The process of a cataclysm is known now. Look at the cross-section of the Earth inside the front cover. You'll see two molten layers – the orange ones. The important one is the thin molten layer about 60 miles thick, which is between 60 and 120 miles down, below the surface of the earth. The thick, molten layer, starting 1800 miles down at the bottom of the mantle, and extending 1300 miles deeper, is the outer core. Now both molten layers are liquid; however, the inner magnetic and electrical structure of the Earth makes these layers act as if they were near solid, or plastic. As long as the magnetic and electrical structure maintains its orderliness, this old earth keeps on rotating on its axis in a normal manner. The growing ice caps on Antarctica and Greenland are not centered on the earth's axis; and, because they rotate around the poles, are trying to swing down to the equator. The only way they could do it would be to pull the whole 60-mile thick shell around with them. As long as the shallow molten layer stays plastic, the shell won't shift; but once every few thousand years the magnetic and electrical orderliness inside the Earth is disrupted, and the molten layer is allowed to act like a free liquid, which it was all the time anyway. It then serves as a lubricant for the ice caps to pull the shell of the earth around the inside. In 1/2 to 2/3 of a day they move almost to the equator, and all hell lets loose. The atmosphere and oceans don't shift with the shell – they just keep on rotating West to East – and at the equator that is 1000 miles per hour. It has to be, normally, to make one rotation per day. So, while the shell shifts with the poles going toward the equator, the winds and oceans keep going eastward, blowing across the face of the earth with supersonic speeds, inundating continents with water miles deep.",

    "text": "Now what about the trigger? This turned out to be the most elusive piece of the whole puzzle. We couldn't rely on some supernatural explanation – like sometime happenings in the heavens of a vague character which actually violated the laws of nature; no, it had to be something natural, a part of nature's ordinary structure, which disrupts the Earth's inner electrical and magnetic structure whenever it happens. We once thought that sunspots could be the cause, because they do disrupt the earth's inner electrical and magnetic structure; but we were wrong. We found out that 'nature's power plant' is a motor-generator system existing in many different magnitudes. It's a basic structure of the universe. The energy structure of an atom is identical to a rotating planet; to a blue-white star; to a galaxy; to a supergalaxy; to all levels of supergalaxies including a universe and even more. As a neutron which has escaped from its parent atom's neutral zone will separate into particles, a star gives off neutral matter through a sunspot which explodes as it becomes energized; so a galaxy gives birth to an exploding star when a 'dead' star escapes from its neutral zone in the center; and as a 'dead' galaxy explodes when it escapes from the central neutral zone of its parent supergalaxy. A planet, therefore, must act the same at its energy level. So, apparently once every few thousand years neutral matter escapes from the 860-mile-radius inner core into the 1300-mile thick molten outer core, and there is a literal atomic explosion inside the Earth. The explosion in the high energy layer of the outer core disrupts completely the electrical and magnetic structure in both the molten outer core and the outer 60-mile thick molten layer. Finally the ice caps are allowed to pull the shell of the earth around the interior, with the shallow molten layer lubricating the shift all the way. You can see, then, that ice ages are not a matter of advancing and retreating ice; it's simply that different areas of the Earth are in polar regions at different times, for different durations of time, with the changes between positions taking place in a fraction of a day.",

    "text": "If I made a list of all these things in my life it might take up a whole book: I’d like to talk about just one of these bugaboos. From the first time I heard the story of the creation and Adam and Eve, it “buzzed” me, as my young son would say. Now, to me the answer was not simply one of two usual alternatives: either unquestioning faith in the story as it stands, or complete repudiation as utter nonsense - the answer seemed to lie elsewhere. If the story were taught as the truth so uniformly; in spite of its apparent divergence from scientific truths, then to me the true course would seem to be a search for the foundation of the story, which would then lead to a true reading of it.\n\nThe pursuit happened almost by accident. Years of data correlation in studying the earth tumbling concept has shown the last tumble to have occurred about 6500 years ago; that Noah, or Utnapishtim, or whatever his name, did exist and did survive that particular cataclysm. A friend of mine suggested that Genesis I is almost a perfect description of conditions on our planet immediately following a tumble. On rereading it, I had to agree; Genesis II even mentions that a mist, or flood, went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground. Well, now! This was worth thinking about. If it were so, then it would be the tumble preceding Noah’s (another fascinating story!), about 11,500 years ago. This, then, could be approximately the time of the Adam and Eve story. The pursuit started. If the story did originate with that tumble, in what language was it first written? Certainly not Hebrew or Greek, for as far as we know, they didn’t exist at that time.\n\nIf we look to men such as Don Antonio Batres Juarequi and James Churchward, we may have our answer. Certainly their knowledge of prehistoric languages could be a key, and later we’ll discuss the role of Naga and Ancient Mayan in the story of Adam and Eve; first, however, let’s examine the history of Genesis I, II, and III. There are many schools of thought on this subject, but the most predominant one is that Moses was the originator. This seems not too far-fetched, since Moses was reared in the Egyptian tradition, in a royal household, and probably had access to many religious writings and teachings now lost with the passing of the archives of Egypt, in Alexandria, Heliopolis, and Sais. Certainly the Ten Commandments were a condensation of the forty-two questions of Osiris for entering heaven. If Moses did write part of the Old Testament, he then must have had tablet writings, or Egyptian interpretations of them, handed down to the Egyptians for thousands of years; and the Egyptian priesthood had knowledge of a cataclysm 11,500 years ago. Priests of Egypt are supposed to have told Solon during his ten years in Egypt (about 600 B.C.) that 9,000 years before that time there was a cataclysm which buried Atlantis beneath the ocean. Note that 9,000 + 600 B.C. + 1950 A.D. equals 11,550 years ago.\n\nMoses’ brother, Aaron, became the first chief priest of the Hebrews about 1300 B.C. Somewhere between 15 and 18 generations later, the chief priesthood having been handed down father-son through the generations, Seraiah (or Seraias) was the chief priest (See Ezra, and 1 and 2 Ezdras). In 586 B.C., in the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign, Seraiah was taken and executed, and his son Ezra made a captive in Persia (see 2 Kings). At that time, Jerusalem was sacked, and all Hebrew records including their laws and records of the Old Testament were burned with the temple at Jerusalem, by Nebuzar-adan, Nebuchadnezzar’s captain of the guard.",

    "text": "In 458 B.C, during the seventh year of Artaxerxes I’s reign in Persia, Ezra was commissioned to reestablish the Hebrew religion and law. According to 2 Ezdras, Ezra rewrote the history of the Hebrews from the beginning, and reestablished their laws. Now, from 586 to 458 B.C. is 128 years. The latest that Ezra could have been born was after his father Seraiah’s murder, as well he could be (see Onan’s story, Genesis 38:8-10); therefore, the youngest he could have been in 458 BC was 127. He was working on a long memory. Let’s examine this anomaly. As mentioned before, the lineage from Aaron to Ezra contains from 17 to 20 generations, including Aaron and Ezra. Assuming (1) 1300 B.C. for the start of Aaron’s priesthood (1290 B.C. is adjudged the time of the Exodus); (2) 458 B.C. to be near the end of Ezra’s priesthood; then we find the average priesthood term per generation to be between 42.1 and 49.5 years. In view of this, can we believe that Ezra served his priesthood for approximately 130 years? It would appear much more plausible to assume that it was Ezra’s grandfather, Azariah, rather than his father Seraiah, who was the one taken and executed by Nebuchadnezzar’s men in 586 B.C. Then Seraiah and Ezra would have served as chief priests during the 128 years from 586 to 458 B.C., for an average of 64 years apiece. It is even plausible that Ezra’s great-grandfather Helchiah could have been the victim in 586 B.C.; leaving Azariah, Seraiah, and Ezra to serve the 128 years for an average of 42 years each, which is even closer to the overall average from Aaron to Ezra, over a period of about 845 years.  This means that the Adam and Eve story was last seen in writing by Helchiah or Azariah, therefore handed down verbally possibly by Azariah, and certainly by Seraiah and Ezra, and finally dictated by Ezra to five scribes. It is the five scribes’ writings that we have today as Ezra’s work. And the English is not even a literal translation — for instance, “without form and void” more literally would read “raging inundations and horrendous winds”.\n\nNow, through Ezra’s reconstruction of Genesis, we are told many things:\n1. Because of the usage of “tree,” “fruit,” “serpent,” “cherubim,” and other words which were glyphs in the picture language of prehistory, it is evident that the Creation and Adam and Eve stories were probably originally written in the glyphs of the predominant Eastern Hemisphere language of 11,500 years ago. This language is nearly identical to ancient Mayan, and the progenitor of many languages, including Oriental and Polynesian tongues, Egyptian, Greek, and Yakut.\n2. Moses (and possibly Aaron) may have had access to these tablets, or Egyptian versions of them.\n3. Neither Moses nor Aaron knew how to read the ancient language, therefore read the glyphs literally.\n4. Not being able to read the symbolism of glyphs, in addition to reading them literally, Moses and Aaron (and possibly Ezra) read into the Adam and Eve story the social and religious attitudes of their day. In that time woman was regarded as the root of all sin, a lowly creature, her birth recorded only as an exception, and basically being the cause of man’s every downfall — a daily potential. This attitude persists in some religions even to our time. Is it any wonder that Eve was shouldered with the responsibility for the downfall of all mankind, as a result of interpretations read into the story by Moses? And into Moses’ reading by Ezra? Perhaps also it was read into the story by Egyptian priests before Moses’ time, and passed on to him as history.\n5. The fusing of two stories (P and J versions) into one to make the story of Genesis I, II, and III may confuse “the man” with Adam. It is possible that Adam, being only nine generations ahead of Noah, with the time span of the “Sudan Basin Polar Era” covering 5,000 years, was not the “man” referred to in the creation; but his name and later “experiences” were merged with “the man’s” story. Remember, however, we are informed that Ezra dictated the entire history to five scribes from memory, and this work contains Genesis as we know it today. For him to recall from the archives of his mind what he did — as well as he did — certainly bespeaks of inspiration of a high order; but it also appears evident that he had no knowledge of the fact that 5,000 years transpired between Genesis I and Noah’s flood. It is clear from 2 Ezdras 3:9 that Genesis I and Noah’s flood represented two inundations, however, for while speaking of the two occasions, he says of Noah’s flood: “And in process of time thou broughtest the flood upon those that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.”\n\nNow, we mentioned before that the lineage of the high priests from Aaron to Ezra differs in number of generations (17 or 20) and names as presented in 1 and 2 Ezdras; and both differ in names from the book of Ezra. We also find differences in the lineages from Noah to Jesus (approximately 51 generations) in the Bible. Is it any wonder, therefore, that some generations could have been omitted in the Adam to Noah line? And the Aaron to Ezra line? And in the light of the fact that, in addition to overwhelming scientific evidence, there are countless legends in the Asia-Pacific area, handed down from the inundation of 11,500 years ago, of a creation much like that of Genesis I and II, is it not possible that “the man” of the Genesis story became confused with Adam throughout the thousands of years, and through a succeeding tumble and inundation in Noah’s time 6,500 years ago? The miracle actually is that the whole story of creation, and of Adam and Eve, is as undistorted as it is; being 11,500 years old, it has suffered through many debacles visited upon its guardians in the intervening years. Because of the lack of resolving information, “the man” and Adam are as one in this translation-interpretation.",

The significant glyphs given to us by Ezra through Moses’ direct reading are:\nCherubims\nMan\nFruit\nRib\nSerpent\nAdam’s\nTree\nFlaming Sword\n\nOur knowledge of glyphs tells us that the tree (of life) symbolized a mother continent; a parent civilization thousands of years longer than ours of today. An unadorned serpent represented water, or the ocean; a serpent entwined about the tree signified that the mother continent was surrounded by water. Genesis III:15 actually describes Eve’s heel on the serpent’s head, showing her victory over the oceans. Cherubims — which were not pretty, plump babies, but hybrid man and beast — were the glyphs for corners or foundations, or underpinnings. Instead of being placed in the garden of Eden, one was taken away; and a closer reading of the Egyptian Book of the Dead shows that cherubims of the North, East, South, and West were taken away — meaning that the foundations of the mother continent, in all directions, were removed or destroyed. The flaming sword was the symbol of fire and earthquake. The fire signified what all legends of these cataclysms call earth-fire, which is the molten layer below the earth’s 60-mile thick shell breaking through to the surface during a tumble, a literal hell. It is most probably the origin of man’s concept of hell, as a matter of fact.\n\nNow back to the tree: Fruit growing on that tree symbolized the original mankind which settled the mother continent ages before Adam and Eve.

    "text": "The glyph of the creation is even more revealing: There are three figures represented in this picture; the top figure is the face of a sleeping or dead person (there were no separate symbols for death and in Naga ~both were represented as the same). The middle figure is shown as a male, and the bottom figure a female who is represented as the mother of all mankind. In addition, there are curved lines from the sleeping or dead person and the male middle figure to the bottom female figure. This glyph has been interpreted to mean that the middle figure, a male, was put to sleep (shown by the top figure) and a rib (or ribs) removed from him (the ribs being the curved lines) and fashioned into the bottom figure; the female mother of all mankind. This fits beautifully with the story of Eve's creation, Adam therefore being both the male middle figure and the top figure, a sleeping (or dead) person. There is a slight hitch to this story, however: the top figure, whether sleeping or dead, is depicted as a female! How could it be Adam, asleep, awake, dead, or alive? Moreover, the curved lines denote parentage rather than ribs; so, more reasonably, it appears that the top figure is a dead female, whose offspring by the male middle figure (Adam) was the bottom female figure (Eve), the mother of the Hebrews. In essence, the story as read from the glyphs would be that Adam and Eve, who lived in the Garden of Eden in the mother continent (tree), were descended from the original mankind (fruit) of that land, which incidentally was surrounded entirely by water (serpent around the tree). Eve was Adam's daughter, and he was a widower. They realized that, in order to survive, they had to leave and never try to return; for the motherland was to be destroyed by a cataclysmic inundation. They left; and afterward, the continent (tree) was subjected to a fiery earthquake (flaming sword), during which it lost its foundations (cherubims) and sank beneath the ocean (serpent) which forever afterward walked over the sunken continent (on its belly).",

It takes hours and hours to put it together, doesn't it, with trial, and error, and patience all playing their parts. We're still trying out some of the as yet unfitted pieces in our world-wide puzzle, and we've been at the “table” since 1949. However, even though incomplete, it shows us a graphic representation of the earth's picture 11,500 years ago. Look at a globe of the world. Pick out Longitude 90°W Latitude 60°N. This is in the western part of the Hudson Bay. Now hold the globe so that 90°W 60°N is at the North Pole, on the axis of rotation. This was the configuration of the world between 18,500 years ago and 11,500 years ago. The North Polar ice cap formed the Laurentian Basin in Canada. The continents, however, were not the same. There was a continent in the Atlantic Ocean area, which stretched from Iceland and England across the Atlantic to the Bahamas. The Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea did not exist; they were land at that time. There was another continent in the Pacific covering an area now ringed by the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos, Easter Island, Tahiti, the Solomons, and the Caroline Islands. [...] About 11,500 years ago—in 9,550 BC, as dated by astronomers from Potsdam Observatory from writings in the ruins of Tiahuanaco—the 60-mile thick shell of the earth shifted its position once more in a day to a day and a half, 7,000 years after the previous shift.
