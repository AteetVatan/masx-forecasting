    "text": "Civilian writing about military matters labours under obvious difficulties, and it is necessary to offer an explanation for undertaking a task for which neither my training nor my profession qualifies me. Nearly ten years ago I began a study of the civil institutions of the Marathas with a view to exploring the causes of the expansion of their empire and its speedy and complete collapse. Every phase of the Maratha state forms an organic unit, and even a cursory examination of its character demands an enquiry into the nature of its component parts. This is the only excuse I can offer for trespassing into domains other than my own; but I am fully conscious of my limitations and I have carefully avoided all technical matters as far as possible and confined myself to those broad questions to which even a layman can do some justice. The need for such a survey was pointed out by Sydney Owen more than fifty years ago.\n\nIf the civilian student of military history suffers from some disadvantage due to his lack of technical knowledge, he is further handicapped when he selects the military history of the Marathas as the subject of his enquiry. In England, a large number of useful works on the art and science of war was written and published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the Maratha commanders and strategists have left us nothing of that kind. Their military theories must, therefore, remain a subject of conjecture. Luckily facts and figures, on which such conjectures can safely be based, are not wanting, though they are still buried in unpublished records scattered in different parts of India and Europe. All the information we need cannot be found in Marathi records, but these can be profitably supplemented by contemporary English, Portuguese, French and Dutch records; and for the last phase of the Maratha military organisation we have the valuable accounts left by European military experts like Tone and Smith, who wrote from personal knowledge. On the naval history of the Marathas their own records do not throw much light, and we have to rely almost entirely on foreign sources. It has been my endeavour to piece together these widely scattered scraps of information in the following pages; with what success, it is for my readers to judge.\n\nI have examined, as far as possible, all the manuscript records available in London, Paris, Lisbon, Evora and Goa, and I have not neglected the rare old publications likely to throw light on my subject. But these old records and manuscripts are without any index and in some cases are not in a good state of preservation. It is, therefore, possible that some papers bearing on the subject may have escaped my scrutiny.",

    "text": "The political history of the Marathas is now fairly well known, thanks to the monumental work of Grant Duff. It has been, therefore, possible to avoid a detailed narrative of their campaigns, but, as the average reader is yet unfamiliar with their naval activities, I have deemed it necessary to deal with that subject in greater detail; though a fuller account of the exploits of Kanhoji Angria and his sons has to be postponed for a future occasion from consideration of space. It is necessary to add a few words here about my references to Factory Records and Bombay Public Consultations. The date indicated either in the text or in the footnotes will supply a surer means of locating the extracts than the page or folio number, as each copyist seems to have numbered his own pages according to his own convenience. To avoid confusion, I have sometimes given the number of the particular part of the volume as well, but it should be noted that in the original volumes the different parts have not been separately numbered. It is also necessary to point out that in the following pages the word Maratha has not been (except when otherwise indicated) used in the caste sense.\n\nMy thanks are due to Mr. Otwell, Superintendent of Records, India Office, for permitting me to read the Bombay Public Consultations of 1700 to 1756. I take this opportunity for offering my grateful thanks for similar courtesy to Dr. Jaime de Cortesao of Biblioteca Nacional of Lisbon, Senor Pedro de Azevedo of Archivo Ultramarino of Lisbon, Dr. Lopes da Sylva of Bibliotheca Publica of Evora and M. Paul Roussier of the Colonial Office of Paris. Col. C. E. Luard has placed me under great obligations by lending me several rare publications on Maratha history and I am also indebted to Sir William Foster and Prof. Alfred Martineau for their expert guidance in my search of English and French records. Prof. Nripendra Chandra Banerji and Dr. Hem Chandra Chaudhuri have very kindly gone through my manuscripts and my friend and colleague Sri Sailendra Nath Mitra has read the proofs with his usual kindness and patience. The late Mr. S. M. Edwardes very kindly revised some of the earlier chapters and I am indebted to him for some valuable suggestions. They are not, however, in any way responsible for any shortcoming that may still disfigure this work. The bibliography indicates the fact, and not the extent, of my indebtedness. It has not been possible to print Portuguese words correctly for want of proper types, but it is hoped that this unavoidable defect will cause my readers no serious inconvenience.",

    "text": "This monograph was written in 1926. I long hesitated to publish it, for it was submitted as a thesis and disapproved by the examiners, Sir Verney Lovett and Mr. N. C. Seddon, both retired I.C.S. men. I then sought the advice of the late Professor Dodwell and the book was sent to press under his advice. On publication it met with the approval of many front-rank scholars and reviewers. Being the first attempt to examine the military and naval institutions of the Marathas it was prescribed as a text book by many Indian Universities and soon went out of print. I could not arrange to bring out a revised edition as I was busily engaged elsewhere. Before I left for the United States to teach at the University of Wisconsin I rapidly went through the book and made slight corrections. Mr. Adam of Orient Longmans kindly agreed to publish it; otherwise this edition might not have seen the light for a few years more. During my absence from India my old friend, Dr. A. C. Banerjee, saw the book through the press. Since the publication of the first edition I have not come across any other work on this subject. Nearly half a century ago the late Rao Bahadur Parasnis brought out a small monograph on the Maratha navy, but he depended mainly on published Marathi records although English and Portuguese records throw more light on the subject. Unfortunately I had to depend on my previous scrutiny of these papers made more than thirty years ago.",

    "text": "The Marathas were the last indigenous empire builders of India. They leapt into prominence suddenly and swiftly; in the third decade of the seventeenth century the Maratha name was unknown to the world outside; three decades later it had become a terror to the rulers of the land. In the second decade of the next century the Emperor of Delhi had to recognise their de facto supremacy in the Deccan by granting them chauth and sardeshmukhi of six provinces of the South. But their activities were not confined to the immediate neighbourhood of their home. Balaji Vishwanath entered Delhi in the train of Syed Husain Ali, his son appeared in its environs at the head of his victorious army, his grandsons became arbiters of the fate of the Mughal empire and carried the Maratha banner to the banks of the Indus, while their cavalry scoured the country from Lahore to Murshidabad, from Delhi to Seringapatam. The expansion of their empire was once arrested by the defeat of Panipat, but the Marathas quickly recovered from the shock; and Mahadaji Sindhia founded a new empire in Hindustan. In 1794 they inflicted a crushing defeat on the Nizam at Kharda and compelled him to cede half his territories. Hardly eight years elapsed before the Peshwa became a feudatory of the British Government in India, the armies of Daulat Rao Sindhia and Raghuji Bhonsla were defeated and destroyed by Lake and Wellesley, and the Maratha empire collapsed like a house of cards. If their rise was sudden and swift, the fall of the Marathas was no less sudden and spectacular. The Empire was apparently at the zenith of its power, it had reached its greatest extent, its man-power was almost unlimited, yet it was destroyed by a foreign power with a small army after a brief campaign of fifteen weeks. What led to this rapid and complete collapse? The plea of accidents cannot be seriously considered. In History accident plays no prominent part, and seldom turns the tide of national fortunes.",

    "text": "It is true that Mahadaji Sindhia died while still in the prime of life, and about the same date died a lesser person, Hari Pant Phadke. It is true that the early death of the first Madhav Rao, the murder of Narayan Rao, the unfortunate suicide of the second Madhav Rao were national calamities of no mean order and certainly accelerated the pace of the Maratha fall. It is also true that after Nana Fadnavis there was no one competent to unite the divergent forces that constituted the complex organisation called the Maratha empire. But why did the Maratha race suddenly grow barren of great men? If the Marathas could survive Shivaji's death, why could they not survive Nana Fadnavis? If able leaders came forth to save the nation in 1690, why were they lacking in 1802? The death of Cavour did not arrest the progress of Italian unity, why should the death of Nana Fadnavis or Mahadaji Sindhia cause the downfall of the Maratha empire? Accidents offer no satisfactory explanation. Social reformers have attributed the misfortunes of the Marathas to their caste dissensions. Yet the Maratha empire came into being under the shadow of the caste system, it expanded and flourished while that system was in full operation. Shivaji, a Maratha, recruited his highest officers from the Brahman caste; the two greatest generals employed by the Brahman Peshwa in Northern India were both Marathas; Yamaji Shivdev, a Brahman, once intrigued against the Brahman Peshwa; the pretender Sadoba found an ardent supporter in Trimbak Rao Pethe, a Maratha. Caste played its part in Maratha history, but it was not the decisive factor.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "The caste system has been blamed for many of India's ills, but the true cause of the Maratha downfall lies elsewhere.  Some argue their decline stemmed from neglecting unity, their civil government's flaws, a focus on plunder over trade, industry, agriculture, and commerce.  While their civil institutions had weaknesses, they were no worse than those in contemporary Europe.  Their government did decline in the late eighteenth century, but this was a consequence, not the cause, of the decline already underway.  Nor was their fall due to their aggressive policy.  An imperial power in a region like India must be aggressive until its dominance is established.  Their diplomacy, sometimes criticized, was not unusual for the time.  In the eighteenth century, both in the East and West, abstract morality played little role in diplomacy.  Figures like Clive, Cavour, Bismarck, and Napoleon III wouldn't hesitate to deceive rivals or enemies.  If the Marathas desired their neighbors' lands, their neighbors reciprocated. The Bombay Government even instructed its envoy to Poona to exploit Maratha disunity. Vansitart considered a full-scale invasion of the Maratha empire after the Panipat disaster, despite existing peace.  Had Panipat's outcome differed, Vansitart's protégé in Murshidabad would have faced Maratha might.  However, an aggressive policy requires effective tools. An imperial power needs a strong military.  The Maratha empire thrived as long as its army remained effective; its decline began when the army weakened, making way for a better-equipped rival. Examining the Maratha army's decline may reveal the true causes of the empire's downfall.  The army reflects the state. The Maratha state began as an enlightened autocracy with a national monarchy and a national army.  This evolved into a feudal despotism, and the army became a feudal force, lacking discipline and homogeneity.  Under the Peshwas, there wasn't a unified army but a collection of forces led by feudal chiefs with differing ideals and interests. This hampered the state's military potential and prevented unified command.  Further, the state abandoned its original ideal, and foreign mercenaries replaced national elements within the army. This alone doesn't explain their defeat, as the English army also used mercenaries.  Even disunited, some Maratha chiefs fielded larger forces than the English.  Their defeat stems from inferior discipline, equipment, and command. Early Maratha success stemmed from superior discipline compared to their Muslim rivals.  As their empire grew and wealth flowed in, they adopted the Mughal military's luxurious habits, which weakened discipline. The later Peshwa's army suffered from the same issues that brought down their Muslim predecessors.  Maratha weaponry was diverse, reflecting various stages of civilization, some dating back to the Stone Age.  Bows and arrows were used alongside matchlocks and muskets, even stones were employed as projectiles.  Their tactics were similarly mixed.  They adopted new tactics from their European adversaries without discarding traditional methods. These proved incompatible, leading to disaster.  Maratha chiefs with their cavalry clung to old ways, while new battalions of foreign mercenaries were led by officers of questionable skill and varying nationalities. This army was no match for the English.  The command's inefficiency stemmed from the feudal organization and their inability to modernize military and civil institutions. The Maratha decline resulted from the resurgence of feudalism after Sambhaji's death, which caused disunity; the abandonment of Shivaji's ideal of racial amity for personal gain, which led to the army's denationalization; and the failure to keep up with global scientific progress, learn from others, and improve upon what they learned. Europe progressed from feudalism to monarchy and then democracy; the Peshwas reversed this in Maharashtra, leading to the Maratha empire's decline and fall.",

    "text": "A strong army requires more than just skilled soldiers; a nation of warriors doesn't automatically equate to a powerful military. Military effectiveness requires discipline among the troops and imaginative yet pragmatic leadership. Above all, a military power needs a motivating ideal to defend and fight for. The Marathas had a reputation as soldiers as early as the seventh century A.D., but they didn't rise to prominence among India's major powers until the second half of the seventeenth century. Until then, they were disunited, disorganized, and prone to internal conflict.  We know little about their early military organization.  They likely served under the Chalukya and Rashtrakuta banners.  Their warrior nature is evident, as Hiuen Tsang noted their martial qualities.  However, details about their arms, wartime organization, officer cadre, and tactics remain unknown.  Following the Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas came the Yadava and Silahara dynasties, both of Maratha origin. The Silaharas ruled small Konkan and Karhad principalities, while the Yadavas had a larger kingdom. Yadava inscriptions boast of their elephants and Dandanayakas (military commanders), common features in Indian armies of the time.  However, their kingdom's quick collapse against an external enemy doesn't suggest strong military capability.  Chronicles of the Turkish conquest of the Deccan don't mention the harassing tactics later Marathas used effectively against the Delhi army. Ramchandra Deva, the last independent Yadava king, became a Turkish vassal after his large army was defeated by a smaller Muslim force.  His son-in-law's failed rebellion against Muslim rule led to the Marathas' disappearance from historical records for centuries.  They don't reappear until the Bahmani kingdom's fall. During this absence, they hadn't been inactive.  They lost political independence but not their land entirely.  The terrain provided natural defenses, and their villages, though scattered, were fortified. Deshmukhs (feudal lords) could resist invaders for months in their hilltop strongholds.  Lacking a strong sense of national honor (the concept of nationality was still developing), they pragmatically accepted Muslim sovereignty in exchange for peaceful possession of their lands and rights. The Muslim conquerors recognized the limits of their power and didn't overreach. Thus, Maratha chiefs maintained control over their small, protected territories after the Yadava and Silahara princes were replaced by a stronger power.  However, peace wasn't the norm.  The climate and terrain fostered courage and endurance but also made the Marathas self-centered and parochial.  Their ambition rarely extended beyond their own villages or, for chiefs, their paternal principalities.  But for every Maratha, their watan (homeland) was paramount, akin to the Rajput's bapoti. They would sacrifice anything, even their faith, for it.",

    "text": "religion was not too high a to pay for its retention. As each watan had more than one claimant; it caused continual strife between rival chiefs and rival families. And as the Maratha of those did not readily forget a loss or forgive an injury, these quarrels inevitably led to blood feuds, which could only be ended by the complete extermination of one of the rival families. Such hostilities kept the Maratha so busily engaged that he had hardly time or inclination to notice the movements and progress of the external world. The habit narrowed his vision but made a soldier of him; and thus when the time came, he was ready to take advantage of the new situation and improve his fortunes. After the dissolution of the Bahmani kingdom the Maratha chiefs began to extend their view and sought civil and military situations in the new courts. They were welcomed by all the new houses who had partitioned the old kingdom. The policy of rival houses was uncertain and shifting and their alliances were not of long duration; and they had no hesitation in joining their Hindu neighbour of Vijayanagar against a brother Muhammadan Prince. After the battle of Talikota they employed their energy and resources in the conquest of the weakest members of the confederacy, Berar and Bidar. Yet when this was accomplished the survivors found themselves unable to compose their differences, and while in this position, were suddenly confronted by a new menace from the North. These continual wars offered excellent opportunities to Maratha soldiers and Maratha diplomats, who were as eager to earn new as to retain their old watans. The beginning of the seventeenth century saw many Marathas in high positions in the military and the civil services of the Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Golkonda Governments.\n\nIn 1618 Malik Ambar employed a Brahman diplomat, Kasi Pandit, to negotiate peace between Ahmadnagar and the Portuguese state in India. Four copies of the treaty resulting from this negotiation were made – two in Portuguese and two in the 'Hindu language,' or, more accurately, 'Hindu alphabet.' This clearly testifies to the growing influence of the Hindus in the court of their Muslim rulers. A fresh treaty was concluded two years later and as before two copies of the treaty, apparently for the use of the Indian signatory, were prepared in the Hindu language instead of Persian. In this interesting document the date of the Hindu calendar is given side by side with those of the Persian and Portuguese reckoning. It was, however, in the army that the Marathas particularly distinguished themselves. The art of war was still in its primitive infancy; weapons like sword and spear, bow and arrows, lance and dagger, which demanded little or no technical knowledge were still in general use, so that every able-bodied man was a potential soldier. He could enlist as a 'Bargir' or, if he had means enough to buy a horse and the slender outfit that a soldier needed in those days, he could join as a 'Silhedar' with much better prospects of advancement. A well-to-do Silhedar was really a condottiere leader with his own followers whose services he could utilize as he chose. Naturally he tried to secure the best market for his commodity. This was the time-honoured system in India and it is at least as old as the Sukranitisara. Neither time nor foreign conquest had affected it in the least. Success added to the Silhedar's reputation and following and of course improved his worldly prospects, for his reward generally came in the shape of a jahgir or military fief. It was in this way that some Maratha families rose to prominence.",

    "text": "The most important of them in rank as well as in power were the Mores of Jawli with the twin titles of Raja and Chandra Rao. Next came the Savantas of Wari, the Ghorpades of Mudhol, the Nimbalkars of Phaltan, the Jadhavs of Sindkhed, the Shirkes, only lately dislodged from their paternal principality, the Surves with whom the Shirkes had found an asylum, the Mahadiks, the Mohites and the Ghatges. Of less note were chiefs like the Jedhes, the Manes and the Dafles. These families formed the military aristocracy of the land, but it should not be forgotten that in Maharashtra the profession of arms was not limited to the noble few. The social barrier was neither strong nor insuperable. The Shelars and the Jadhavas, descendants of ruling kings, had declined in the scale, the Pawars, another princely family, had reconciled themselves to their humble lot and no longer hesitated to marry Kunbi girls of lowly origin. They still affected the title of 'Raje' after their first name, but that was the only trace of royalty now left to them. This society was naturally democratic, and the common dangers, common risks, and common adventures of a soldier's life levelled what difference might have survived. A promising young man who had only recently rejected the plebeian plough for the more aristocratic sword, could aspire to the hand of a daughter of the Nimbalkars, and could demand a matrimonial alliance with the princely family of the Jadhavas. Social intercourse was more intimate and less formal than what is possible in a modern barrack, and an able leader of magnetic personality commanded not only the admiration but also the affection of his following. The common soldiers, except the few who formed the King's bodyguard, had nothing to do with the state but looked for pay, promotion and preference to the Jahgirdar under whom they immediately served. A loyal Jahgirdar contributed to the strength of the Government; but in those days it was no discredit to set up as a 'proud palegar' or lawless chief; as once did a Nimbalkar and a Jedhe. Yet the state continued its policy of multiplying the military fiefs and conferring fresh jahgirs on each enterprising Silhedar. Even a wise prince like Muhammad Adilshah laid down that while a disloyal Zemindar should be deprived of his fief, the loyal lord should on no account be discouraged or disturbed. The inevitable result of this policy was that the civil Government of the country was subordinated to military needs and the major portion of Maharashtra was held by a number of military leaders serving under three different masters. When Shivaji rose to power, the principality of Ahmadnagar had already been annexed by the Emperor of Delhi and the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda were awaiting a similar fate. The question may very well be asked why did the Maratha Jahgirdars not make common cause against their Muslim masters and assert their independence? The answer is that everybody acted for himself and would not co-operate with his brother chiefs (in another kingdom) except for personal reasons. The Mughal power was deemed invincible; the weakness of the two surviving offshoots of the Bahmani kingdom was not yet apparent; they were still planning and making fresh conquests in the Karnatak. And people who have anything to lose do not generally favour change.",

    "text": "While the Marathas claimed a common origin, a common language, and professed a common faith in normal circumstances, religious persecution alone could unite them under a common banner. The Muslim rulers of the South normally pursued a policy of religious toleration, and on occasions when a chief of note was compelled to forsake his father's faith, the pangs of conscience were forgotten in the arms of a princess. The Mughal annexation of Ahmadnagar, however, introduced a new element in southern politics, the more orthodox, the more uncompromising and the more bigoted belief of Shahjahan and Aurangzib; and the repeated invasions from which the subjects of Bijapur and Golkonda suffered and the scant consideration with which solemn treaties were treated by ambitious Viceroys like Aurangzib created an atmosphere of distrust and disquiet. Simultaneously a new spirit had been infused into Hinduism in the Deccan by what is popularly known as the Pandharpur movement. This, in short, was the situation when Shivaji appeared in the political arena.\n\nWith the advent of Shivaji a new era opened in the military history of the Marathas. He had a clear conception of military organization, definite plans of military reform and views and opinions based upon past experience. He believed in personal selection but had no faith in hereditary genius. He approved of unity of command, but would not tolerate military interference in the civil administration of the country. He wanted a strong monarchy as the only antidote to the prevailing discord, dissension and anarchy, and could not therefore reconcile himself to feudalism and all that it stood for. He had some advantage over his antagonists; his hands were not tied by precedents; but at the same time, as the founder of a new kingdom and a new house, he could not ignore the tradition of the land, nor could he afford wholly to alienate the vested interests. His first steps were naturally cautious and circumspect. He started operations with a small force attached to his father's jahgir, which probably needed few officers. But as soon as this force was augmented by the addition of Sambhaji Mohite's cavalry a Sarnobat or Commander-in-chief was appointed. With the Sarnobatship of Mankoji Dahatonde the strength of the army was 3,000 and by 1659, if we can believe Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, Shivaji was in a position to put ten thousand cavalry and ten thousand Mawle infantry into the field. In this army the Silhedars did not preponderate although at first Shivaji had to depend mainly on these free-lances. Of the three thousand horsemen under Mankoji Dahatonde, fully two thousand were Silhedars; but by 1659 the strength of the paga or cavalry had risen to seven thousand, while the Silhedars numbered only three thousand.

    "text": "Silhedar cavalry had declined from 66% to 33% of the total cavalry force.  Muslim historians like Khafi Khan noted Shivaji's preference for bargirs (state-provided cavalry) over silhedars (personally maintained cavalry). Bhimsel, who served under a Bundela chief, corroborates this, mentioning that while Shivaji employed silhedars, the better-paid troops were bargirs. Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad confirms the dominance of the paga (regular cavalry) over the silhedars. This emphasis on regular cavalry enhanced discipline within Shivaji's army.  Crucially, Shivaji established a clear officer cadre for both infantry and cavalry to ensure unity of command. The cavalry hierarchy started with the Havaldar (25 horsemen), then Jumledar (5 Havaldars), Hazari (10 Jumledars), Panchhazari (5 Hazaris), culminating in the Sarnobat, who reported directly to Shivaji.  A parallel civil administration supported the army, with Majumdars (accountants), Karbharis, and Jamnis attached to various levels of command.  News writers, independent of military command, reported directly to Shivaji or his Vaknavis (intelligence chief).  The infantry was organized similarly, with Naiks (10 men), Jumledars (5 Naiks), Hazaris, and a Sarnobat of infantry, although the latter held a lower status than the cavalry Sarnobat.  Civil assistants like Sabnis managed accounts and muster rolls.  Cavalry officers received significantly higher salaries than their infantry counterparts. The Jumledar of cavalry earned 500 Hons annually, the Hazari 1,000 Hons, and the Panchhazari 2,000 Hons. The Sarnobat's salary remains unspecified, but records suggest his honors were comparable to the Peshwa and even Shivaji himself.",

    "text": "Unlike the prevalent Mughal and Bijapur systems of granting hereditary jagirs (land grants) for service, Shivaji favored direct payment to his officers and soldiers, partly in cash and partly in kind, which was common practice at the time.  Payments were made from the central treasury or through varats (assignments on provincial revenue).  While district officers facilitated these payments, assignees were strictly prohibited from interfering with revenue collection. Any government land held by an assignee had its rent deducted from their salary, with the balance paid in cash or varat. Shivaji actively worked to dismantle feudalism by curtailing the powers of Deshmukhs and Deshpandes (local hereditary officials) and demolishing their fortified castles.  He avoided creating new fiefs to prevent military tyranny and feudal anarchy.  No military position in his army was hereditary, and all officers were subject to dismissal, transfer, or reprimand based on their performance.  Shivaji appointed five different Sarnobats of cavalry during his reign: Tukoji, Mankoji Dahatonde, Netaji Palkar, Kadtoji Gujar, and Hasaji Mohite.  This demonstrates that appointments were based on merit, not inheritance. Similarly, Tanaji Malusare’s successor was chosen for competence, not kinship. Although rejecting hereditary jagirs, Shivaji rewarded merit through titles and honors, as seen with Kadtoji Gujar and Hasaji Mohite. ",

Acworth and Shaligram, Aitihasik Povade, p. 60. Sen, Siva Chhatrapati, Pp: 35-6.\n\nMILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS\n\n...circular sunshade, and a palki was granted to deserving officers. Presents of gold, silver ornaments and money were made to officers and men for acts of conspicuous bravery. Wounded men received allowances according to the nature of their injuries, and widows of soldiers killed in action were suitably pensioned. A similar pension was granted to the minor children of fallen soldiers, and these were taken into service as soon as they came of age.\n\nThe abolition of the jahgir system was not the only reform at which Shivaji aimed. He wanted to introduce strict discipline in his army. His success in this direction was far from complete, for he had to fight tradition and environment. Nonetheless, he deserves credit for his attempt. His army was employed in mulkgiri or foreign expeditions for eight months in the year. They returned to cantonment when the monsoon broke and the four months of the rainy season had to be spent in barracks in enforced idleness. Shivaji laid down that provision and medicine for men and fodder for their horses should be carefully stored in the cantonments. During the active season, the Maratha army subsisted on the spoils of war, but here it was clearly laid down that the prize belonged to the state and not to the army. Women, Brahmans, and cows were not to be molested on any account. It was a capital offence to bring a female slave or a dancing girl into the camp. It was probably military discipline and not moral reform that he strove to achieve.\n\nKrishnaji Anant Sabhasad tells us that Shivaji inflicted exemplary punishment on some of his soldiers for breach of discipline during the Karnatak expedition. But it was impossible to effect such a moral revolution all at once. From the preamble of a Portuguese treaty, it appears that Shivaji's men had carried away men, women, children, and cattle from Portuguese territories. In 1672, some soldiers had been guilty of disorderly conduct at Chaphal. In 1676, Shivaji had to address a letter of admonition to the regiment encamped at Chiplun; from the text of the letter, it appears that they had taken away from the civil population by force what could be and should have been obtained by peaceful purchase. But when we remember how the Mughal soldiery destroyed the standing crops on their marches, drew out the straw from the thatch to feed their horses, and compelled the unoffending villagers to carry their baggage, we feel inclined to judge Maratha delinquencies more leniently. War does not bring out the best side of human nature.",

    "text": "But in some of his disciplinary reforms Shivaji was notably successful, and his camp was entirely free from the undesirable presence of women of easy virtue, as we are informed by two European travellers. John Fryer, the East India Company's physician, tells us that \"whores and dancing wenches\" were not allowed in Shivaji's camp. Navarette went to Surat and spent a few days there in 1671. “I was told at Surat,” he writes, “that Sabagi [Shivaji] the Mogal was extraordinarily careful that no woman should be in his army; and, if he happened to find one, he immediately turned her out, first cutting her hair and ears. This to prevent the effect of sensuality on the alertness and activity of his troops, for the same reason as the Tartars.” The good Bishop did not know that Shivaji was not a Mughal, but his evidence shows what reputation the Maratha leader enjoyed as a strict disciplinarian.\n\nThere is reason to believe that women were very seldom molested by Shivaji's soldiers; for a brave Mughal governor once deemed it safest to leave his women in a woman's garb at the gates of his city when the Marathas appeared. This was accomplished in an age when a Mughal general had in his camp 400 dancing girls from Kabul and Lahore to enliven his leisure. On their march, the Maratha army of Shivaji was not encumbered with much baggage or equipment. Their arms were of the simplest and most primitive kind. Field-artillery they had none; and the elaborate and comfortable camp equipage of their Mughal adversaries they did not require. The men wore a turban, a simple jacket, and tight trousers; their officers were better protected with a helmet and an armour of chain or, more frequently, with thick coats of padded cotton. In their saddlebag, they carried with ease the scanty provision on which they and their mounts could subsist for days. In his second expedition to Surat, Shivaji had no tent with him, and the Dutch spy found him sitting on the ground. In his longer and more elaborately organised Karnatak expedition, he had only two small tents, one for himself and the other for his minister, as we learn from Martin, the French Governor of Pondichery, and it is no wonder that, thus lightly equipped, the Maratha army was able to cover forty-five to fifty miles in a single march. In fact, this constituted their greatest advantage over their heavily armed and heavily armoured Muhammadan adversaries. Man for man, the Maratha horseman was no match for the Mughal or the Bijapuri, but they were not absolutely sure of victory and would not risk a pitched battle. Superior discipline, hardihood, and greater speed more than compensated for the slighter build and the lighter weight of the Maratha soldiers.",

    "section": "Comparison with Mughal Army",
    "text": "Let us now see how the contrast impressed two European contemporaries, an English Doctor of Medicine and an Italian Doctor of Law. John Fryer gives the following estimate of the merits and demerits of the rival armies:\n\n\"Seva Gi's Men thereby being fitter for any Martial Exploit, having been accustomed to Fare Hard, Journey Fast, and take little Pleasure: But the other will miss of their Booty rather than a Dinner; must mount in State and have their arms carried before them, and their Women not far behind them, with the Master of mirth and jollity; will rather expect than pursue a Foe; but then stand it out better; For Seva Gi's men care not much for a pitched Field, though they are good at Surprizing and Ransacking; yet they agree in this, that they are both of stirring Spirits.\"\n\nA Francis Gemelli Careri visited India in 1695 and the Shivaji he speaks of was Ram Raja or Ram Rao as he calls him. 'This Shivaji,' he writes, 'whom his Subjects call Raja, which signifies petty King, is so Powerful, that he maintains war at once and the same time with the Great Mogul, and the Portuguese: He brings into the Field 50,000 Horse, and as many or more Foot, much better Soldiers than the Moguls, for they Live upon a piece of dry Bread, and the Moguls will March at their Ease carrying their Women, abundance of Provisions, and Tents so that their Army looks like a moving City.'\n\nThe achievements of Shivaji’s army need not detain us; they are well known. The Maratha chroniclers assert with evident pride that he fought with success against four great powers. The numerical strength of his army has been variously stated. Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad puts it well above 100,000. But the causes of his military success are not far to seek: Superior discipline, leadership and the unquestioning confidence of his men account for the brilliant victories which the great Maratha obtained over the Mughals, the Portuguese, the Bijapuris and the Haidrabadis, not to mention the petty poligars who acknowledged his suzerainty. But the main question yet remains to be answered: Why did the self-seeking, watan-loving Marathas submit to Shivaji’s leadership? Their devotion no doubt was due to the personal magnetism of the leader, but what first caught their imagination and made them forget their agelong policy of blood-feud and personal aggrandizement?",

He assumed the title of Go Brahman pratipalak, prioritizing the protection of cows and the priestly caste.  Brahmans fought alongside the untouchables for this cause. Shivaji's conception of a Hindu empire was not synonymous with religious persecution. His army included Pathan deserters, Muslim naval commanders, and he venerated both Hindu and Muslim saints. He granted inam lands to Muslim shrines and maintained mosques through state allowances.  He respected the Quran and protected the women and religious texts of both Hindus and Muslims during raids. This ideal resonated with the Marathas, who saw in Shivaji a deliverer of their ancestral lands.",

After Shivaji conquered these territories, he inherited this right and extended the demand to Basscin.  Negotiations ensued, documented in letters that reveal chauth's pre-Maratha existence. A letter from the Portuguese Viceroy to Shivaji in 1678 acknowledges the prior payment of chauth to a 'Chauthia' and agrees to investigate the terms of the existing agreement before transferring the payments to Shivaji.

The Viceroy, Dom Pedro d'Almeida, replied that he would send for information (on this subject) from the Captain General of the North and from the commandant of the fortress of Daman, and when the said information came he would advise Shivaji Raze to send a person with authority to settle this business with the said captains, after examining the terms under which the said chauth was created; but the said advice had not come and the decision that was expected has been delayed. To this my answer is that the cause of the delay arose from the embarkation of the said Viceroy for Mozambique and on that account the said captains neglected to send the information he asked of them. It was not therefore possible to inform you that this state is not tributary to any neighbouring king. As however I desire to preserve peace and amity with Shivaji, I pretend to be ignorant of the information that the said captains gave me. From that information it is clear that the said chauth had its origin in the covenant that the village-managers (varadores das aldens) of the district of Daman made on their own initiative with the Chauthia, without informing the past Viceroys and Governors, in order to avoid the loss and robbery that his subjects used to commit in those villages. From that covenant a contract has been solemnly drawn up with various conditions which were to be operative between them; and I have no doubt that in conformity with them the said chauth will be paid to Shivaji Raze, as I am told in his letters that Shivaji is in possession of his (Chauthia's) kingdom: To settle this business Pitambar Shenvi may advise Shivaji Raze to send on his behalf a person with proper authority. I write on this subject after consulting the captain of the fortress of Daman and examining the terms under which the agents of the said subjected them to the payment of the said chauth: The consideration of this affair is entrusted to the judges deputed for it, so that after the said villagers have been heard and the common law and the known custom relating to the chauth have been considered, the final decision on this matter may be made with justice.

This payment aimed to protect lives and property from his invading army. Unlike later interpretations, Shivaji didn't claim chauth as a hereditary right or based on imperial decree; it was purely based on his military strength.  If he couldn't enforce the demand, he lacked legal recourse.  He prioritized protecting the population from his soldiers' excesses, especially in annexed territories.\nChauth remained consistent under Sambhaji and Rajaram. For two decades, this payment, while called chauth, differed from its original form. It wasn't until Shahu's reign that the system reverted. Shahu received as a pension what Shivaji demanded as tribute, and provided as an obligation what Shivaji offered as a favor.  For the Mughals, chauth was a purchase of peace and security. Under Aurangzeb, demanding it defied imperial authority, but under Bahadur Shah, it signaled acceptance of the Emperor's sovereignty. The Marathas never relinquished their chauth claims in the Deccan and enforced them whenever possible. They sent messengers demanding payment from governors or zamindars, who often complied to avoid conflict.  This ensured the safety of their lands and people. They sometimes underreported their revenue to reduce the payment, but any agreed-upon sum was secured with guarantees.",

He and his cousin aimed to gain Mughal support by securing an imperial farman for the chauth and sardeshmukhi of six Deccan provinces.  Delhi's ministers exploited Maratha internal conflicts, delaying the farman.  However, regional officials like Daud Khan prioritized maintaining order and protecting the peasantry, the source of state revenue.  He proposed that Mughal officers collect the chauth, preventing Maratha interference in Mughal administration. The Emperor rejected this.  Chinkulich Khan, his successor, also opposed it. Syed Hussain Ali initially tried curbing Maratha activities, but political events forced him to seek a Maratha alliance at any cost.  He negotiated a deal where Maratha officers received a share of land revenue, sair (taxes on government and jagirdar lands), and sardeshmukhi (10% levy on peasants).  This complex system, with multiple collectors, burdened the population, and though beneficial to cultivators by ensuring protection, undermined Mughal sovereignty. This led to Maratha territorial expansion by absorbing chauth-paying districts, prompting Nizam-ul-Mulk to pay them to leave his territory. He paid a fixed sum from his treasury instead of the suba of Hyderabad's chauth and abolished sardeshmukhi, freeing traders and travelers from the rahdari impost.",

While Shahu and his successors rarely honored their obligations, the Emperor struggled to enforce the terms of his farman, leading to mutual recriminations and inconsistent payments. Maratha chiefs often negotiated lower sums, as the financial gains from raids didn't always meet expectations. Khafi Khan noted that Maratha leaders preferred settling chauth amounts to avoid unchecked plunder by their troops, a sentiment echoed by Dutch Admiral Stavorinus, who observed that states found it more economical to pay tribute than to raise armies for defense. Stavorinus also highlighted the Maratha chiefs' self-interest in upholding agreements, as larger-scale invasions would enrich their troops at their own expense.",

Ranade argues that Shivaji offered protection to Bijapur and Golconda against Mughal aggression in exchange for tribute, and this system was later adopted by Wellesley. However, this claim lacks supporting evidence. The treaties between Shivaji and the aforementioned Sultans are unavailable, and Shivaji continued to raid their territories.  Furthermore, the Portuguese accounts suggest negotiations for chauth collection, not sardeshmukhi, and protection was not a condition.  Shivaji's exaction of chauth from Mughal provinces was also non-consensual. This contrasts sharply with Wellesley's subsidiary alliances, which involved the surrender of diplomatic independence by allied states in exchange for protection by the East India Company, leaving internal affairs untouched. Shahu's arrangement differed significantly, as he took responsibility for maintaining order in six Deccan provinces and offered military service, without requiring the Mughal government to relinquish diplomatic independence or follow his dictates.",

'Mamlat' applied to weaker states like the Rajput principalities, who were expected to pay regularly and without resistance. It wasn't used for more powerful entities like the Nizam or Mysore, with whom the Marathas never established subsidiary alliances.  However, weaker states likely anticipated some protection, as suggested by a 1746-7 sanad where the Chief of Bhandawar ceded half his territory to the Peshwa in return for defense. This contrasts with subsidiary alliances where protection wasn't tied to chauth but to territorial concessions. An agreement with Rao Raja Umed of Bundi in 1769-70 required punctual tribute payment and forbade alliances with Maratha enemies, offering protection 'according to the agreement' without specifying its nature. Chauth wasn't exclusive to the Marathas; Raja Chumput also levied it from neighboring officials for peace and protection.  Chhatrasal, when warring against the Emperor, planned to levy chauth until the Emperor agreed to pay it in return for peace. Sikhs in cis-Sutlej regions also extracted 'rakhi' from their neighbors, initially 12.5% of revenue, increasing to 50% with their growing power. Some reports indicate Sikhs also demanding chauth.",

Thanks to his blessings, that stream is still ever increasing and has completely satisfied the rulers of the provinces, the leaders of the army and my sincere friends. The stream has added to thirst only. Raghuji and Fatte Baba had in the past brought a stream from the south but its flow was interrupted at places. For many years in the interval the stream from the south did not flow. By God's grace the stream of wealth is flowing well in this army this year but there are many lands on the way to Poona and it will be entirely absorbed (in transit). On that account: If the northern and the southern streams could in their high flood be united at Poona without any absorption on their way, then I could get rid of my debts and secure rewards of my labour both in this world and the next. The Ganges flows to the sea but saves the whole world; in the like manner do these northern and southern rivers flow in the present age and benefit many people. All rivers and streams flow to the ocean, the Kaveri alone has been brought to the service of men. So do these rivers of wealth render but little service to the main interest, though do immense good to other people. It is proper that people with an insight should take into consideration the rights and the wrongs of this matter and so act that the sterility of Poona may be removed. The Peshwa's meaning is transparent, and the policy adumbrated in the letter was bound, when followed to its logical end, to produce one result only- namely, the wholesale alienation of his father's Hindu allies and the complete denationalisation of the Maratha army. Balaji Baji Rao like his predecessors still professed to be a champion of Hinduism: He wrote respectful letters to Brahmans of known sanctity, granted them pensions and allowances, and sometimes remitted their rent, and in his letters he often expressed an ardent desire to recover from the Muhammadans the holy places of Benares and Muttra. But Brahmans and holy men were not the only Hindus; and while they might shower their blessings on the Peshwa and his family, the Hindu princes alone could assist him in his wars against the Muhammadans. Evidently Balaji Baji Rao cared more for their money than for their armed forces, for it is during his regime that the Maratha arms fell heavily on their Rajput co-religionists.",

So when the Marathas stood in urgent need of men and money in 1760 and 1761 the Rajputs remained sternly aloof; while all the Muhammadan princes and nobles of Northern India, including the Nawab of Oudh whom the Marathas had done their utmost to conciliate and gratify, rallied to the Afghan banner. Nor were these the only evil effects of the selfish policy of plunder and raid. It caused disunion and dissension within the Maratha empire. The Peshwa, in want of money, did not hesitate to sell his assistance to the Nawab of Bengal against Raghuji Bhonsla of Nagpur. Raghuji, indeed, was not well-disposed towards Balaji; but the moral effect of fighting a Maratha Sardar, while employed in a Muhammadan province, was simply disastrous. Baji Rao did not seek foreign aid in his fight against the Senapati; but Balaji extended his protection to Bengal, a Sardar of the Empire; he joined the English in order to bring about the destruction of the Angria; and his son simply emulated his example when he coalesced with Nizam Ali against Janoji Bhonsle. Thus the unhappy Raghoba certainly committed no unprecedented offence when he sought military aid to secure the musnad of Poona. Balaji lamented the differences between Sindhia and Holkar and earnestly urged them to adopt a common policy in Rajputana, but he conveniently forgot that with the example he had set in Bengal the only common policy they could be expected to pursue was one of 'self-aggrandisement'. It is needless to remark that although the bulk of the Maratha army consisted of feudal levies, the Peshwa had an additional force of his own. The composition of this personal force was naturally affected by the change of political ideal and political outlook. Shivaji aimed at the foundation of a Maratha empire, and his army was mainly, if not wholly, composed of Marathas. The Pathan regiment he enlisted, probably consisted of Deccani Musulmans, who were for all practical purposes children of the soil and were by no means favourably inclined towards the Mughal empire. It is noteworthy that on one occasion Shivaji politely rejected the services of a Bundela chief. Baji Rao's proclaimed ambition was the restoration of Hindu supremacy in India and he naturally tried his best to win the moral and material support of Hindus all over the country for military purposes; but we have no documentary evidence that the non-Maratha elements formed by any means a predominating proportion of his army.",

    "text": "Balaji's sole aim was to cause the two rivers of gold from the north and the south to unite and flow into the reservoir of Poona, and this policy connoted constant fighting and a vast army. The Marathas were not very eager to spend the whole year away from their home provinces and Balaji enlisted mercenaries from all parts of India and outside India. Sikhs, Rajputs, Sindhis and Karnatakis on the one hand, and Rohillas, Arabs, Abyssynians and Portuguese of pure or mixed birth and even the so-called Portuguese, or the native converts from Goa were welcomed in his army. They were by no means better soldiers, and were certainly more unscrupulous and less faithful. Yet they obtained from the Peshwa and his feudal chiefs better pay and better treatment than the Marathas proper. Consequently the Maratha army was now gradually, but completely, denationalised. In the Peshwa's personal force the Arabs and other foreigners outnumbered the Marathas; Robert Orme had a very poor opinion of their fighting qualities. In Holkar's army the Pendharis preponderated over the mercenaries; and in Sindhia's forces there were more Purvias than Maratha soldiers. They were bound by no common ideals or common interests and were utterly ruthless in their methods. It was these non-Maratha mercenaries who made the Maratha name dreaded and hated throughout the length and the breadth of the Indian sub-continent. Briefly, then, it may be said that Shivaji had organised a national army; in Rajaram's time the army was feudalised; and it was left to Balaji Baji Rao to denationalise it. This denationalisation with its consequent demoralisation inevitably led to the final overthrow of the Maratha empire. Feudalism in itself was bad, but the employment of foreign mercenaries was, as we shall see, even more disastrous. CHAPTER IV INFANTRY AND CAVALRY KRISHNAJI Anant Sablasad says that Shivaji had 45,000 cavalry and only 10,000 Mawle infantry in his army:8 But the few figures that we have of his expeditionary forces at different dates contradict this estimate. A cavalry trooper was necessarily more expensive. He needed a horse, better equipment and therefore a higher salary. Shivaji's military operations were often confined to hilly regions where horses would be of little or no use. He frequently led his men through unfrequented mountain tracks where the sure-footed Mawle alone could go, and the accuracy of Krishnaji Anant's account is, therefore, more than doubtful.",

    "text": "From the few figures available in the contemporary correspondence of the English factors it appears that in Shivaji's time the infantry preponderated over the cavalry. On 12 November 1668, the Carwar factors informed their countrymen at Surat of a report that Shivaji contemplated an expedition to Goa and had with that intent assembled an army of 2,000 horse and 8,000 or 10,000 foot.1 The army that appeared near Hubli in 1670 consisted, according to a report current at Carwar, of 2,000 horse and 4,000 foot.2 In 1675 Shivaji laid siege to the fortress of Phonda and in the besieging force, as we learn from a Carwar letter, dated 14 April, the cavalry was far outnumbered by infantry; their respective strength 2,000 and 7,020.3 On 19 November 1678, the Rajapore factors wrote to their friends at Bombay that the Bijapur generals dared not attack Shivaji who had 15,000 horse and 20,000 foot at Panhala.4 Even in the small force that had joined Sambhaji in his foolish rebellion the cavalry formed the minority, for, when the prodigal son returned to his father's castle at Panhala, he was accompanied, according to an English report, by 300 horse and 1,000 foot.5 The infantry continued to maintain its majority in the Maratha army even after Shivaji's death, for in 1707 Dhanaji Jadhav, as we are told by the Bundela chronicler, had under his command a strong infantry force of 25,000, while his cavalry numbered 5,000 only.6 In the Peshwa period, however, the position was reversed. The Marathas were no longer compelled to defend their hearth and home. Secure in their native territories, they were now in a position to carry war into enemy country, and in these distant expeditions, designed mainly for plunder, a cavalry force was far more useful than infantry. In a Portuguese report, dated June 1787, therefore, we read that the Peshwa could put in the field 80,000 to 100,000 horse, 10,000 foot and 40 to 50 pieces of artillery:7",

The text describes the military engagements and the strategic use of forts during the reign of Shivaji, noting that almost all old forts in his country were associated with his name. Some forts were acquired through the use of bribes, others by clever strategy, and the rest through well-planned assaults. Shivaji was not content with just possessing old fortresses; he built new ones, utilizing the hills of Maharashtra as excellent sites for these structures. The entire region was secured with a network of forts, each strategically placed to ensure comprehensive territorial defense.",

The natural terrain and simple yet massive walls, defended by resolute men, were often sufficient to repel the strongest besieging forces for months. Hunger and bribery were seen as more effective means to conquer a fort than military assault. Each fort was meticulously chosen for its strategic location and natural defenses. Features such as the thorny opuntia cactus made the hill sides even more inaccessible. Every fort was equipped with essential facilities including barracks, granaries, and ample water supplies, ensuring the garrison could withstand prolonged sieges.

Each fort was manned by a carefully selected garrison, with every soldier undergoing personal scrutiny and required to provide a surety for his fidelity. The command of a fort was divided among three officers of equal status but different responsibilities, creating a system of checks and balances. This arrangement prevented any single person from having enough power to betray the fort. The officers included the Havaldar (head of the garrison), the Sabnis (in charge of accounts and muster-rolls), and the Karkhanais (responsible for commissariat duties). Their duties were interlinked, requiring cooperation and mutual oversight, which effectively safeguarded against internal betrayal and ensured the fort's security against all forms of assault.",

Shivaji mandated that these three officers be of different castes. This minimized collusion and appeased Maharashtra's three main castes by distributing state patronage according to their traditions. Brahmans and Prabhus were not on good terms, and the Marathas generally showed greater loyalty to those of their own caste.

The Bijapur government recognized some officers' hereditary rights (Naikwaris), which often caused problems and delayed new governors' entry into forts. Shivaji countered this by frequently transferring officers between forts, mirroring the rotation of civil governors and ministers.  He recognized no hereditary rights in forts; every officer served at his pleasure, with no claims for relatives upon an officer's death. Despite these precautions, Shivaji couldn't eliminate treason and corruption entirely. During his absence from Raigad, the Sabnis, Keso Narayan, misappropriated funds due to the temporary lack of a Havaldar.  In 1663, a rebellion at Sinhgad fort forced Shivaji to postpone a planned Konkan expedition, highlighting the ongoing challenges of maintaining control and loyalty.",

Reinforcements, provisions, and stores were sent during times of danger, though typical garrison strength likely didn't exceed five hundred. Soldiers wielded swords, spears, bows and arrows, matchlocks, and muskets. Attackers sometimes used rockets, which were more effective at scaring war elephants than inflicting casualties, and bombs, as seen in the defense of Purandar. Shivaji's artillery was weak, relying on European merchants for guns and ammunition, which were not always top quality. When a fort was threatened, he had to redistribute artillery from other locations. Despite this weakness in firearms, his enemies were often no better equipped. Garrisons often repelled assaults by rolling rocks down on attackers climbing steep hillsides.",

Shivaji's forces mined Phonda's ramparts in 1675, while Tanaji recaptured Sinhgad by scaling its walls at night.  An ingenious method involved trained monitor lizards (ghorpads).  These lizards, with ropes tied around them, climbed steep surfaces, finding crevices to cling to.  A man could then climb the rope, facilitating infiltration. Vigilance was key to defense.  Countermining opposed enemy mines, but strong hill forts were difficult to mine effectively.  Surprise attacks were the primary danger. Open assaults were typically met with artillery, bombs, rockets, and stones.  Sallies, like Murar Baji Prabhu's at Purandar during Diler Khan's attack, were sometimes necessary. However, forts generally fell due to lengthy sieges and dwindling provisions.",

Nagoji Bhonsle, appointed Havaldar of Fort Utlur in 1677, received 150 Hons, from which he paid two servants 25 Hons each. Krishnaji Survanshi, Sarnobat of Utlur, earned 100 Hons.  Four Tat Sarnobats, sent to manage Kot Utlur's ramparts, received 12 Hons annually (4 ordinary and 8 Kaveripak Hons). Seven Bargirs received 9 Hons each (3 ordinary and 6 Kaveripak). This likely represented standard private pay. Timaji Narayan, a clerk at Valgudanur Fort, received 3 Hons monthly. Besides regular pay, officers received allowances for palanquin, torchbearers, attendants, sunshades, and pages, based on rank and duty importance. Outposts were guarded by Ramoshis, Bhils, and other tribes familiar with the jungle.  Shivaji was the first to employ Ramoshis as fort watchmen, who served loyally.  Their low living standards meant small salaries and perks sufficed. This practice became hereditary. Shivaji's fort administration system survived until the Peshwa period's close but declined after his death.",

Sons or heirs succeeded them, and even during their lifetime, they could appoint agents to perform their duties.  Pay varied based on fort importance, with additional allowances for residing within.  In 1763-64, Bahulz fort's Havaldar and Sarnobat received Rs. 125 annually, while the Sabnis and Fadnis got Rs. 200, and the Subhedar Rs. 250. Chawand and Ahmadnagar Havaldars received Rs. 360 and 300, respectively.  Besides cash, officers received clothing, and some preferred hereditary inam lands. Sinhgad's Sabnis in 1750-51 received Rs. 600 and Rs. 100 worth of clothing, plus two rent-free villages. These officers lost importance under the new system. Fort expenses were covered by revenues from attached villages.  Provincial governors controlled forts; for example, Visaji Keshav managed eighteen Bassein province forts in 1774-75. Anjanvel, a naval station, was jointly controlled by the Havaldar and governor, each holding keys to different gates. This arrangement led to disputes, such as the one in 1794-95 between Governor Bapuji Shinde and Havaldar Babu Rao Salokhe of Dharwar fort.",

Forced, unpaid labor was used for fort building and repairs, with timber from nearby forests and labor from neighboring villages. Garrison size varied; Satara's was reinforced in 1773-74 due to unrest, and Lohagad's, under Dhondji, ranged from 1,000 to 3,000 men. Private pay improved; under Balaji Baji Rao, it ranged from three to five rupees eight annas monthly, with increments upon transfer. Under Madhav Rao I, it reached seven rupees. Soldiers received ten or eleven months' pay for a year's service, often in arrears. From Shahu's time, payment in rent-free land emerged. By 1774-75, such soldiers served in rotation to manage their lands. Some provided no service and were dismissed. Munro observed a practice in the southern Maratha country: small forts had hereditary garrisons, with commanders and a few followers sent from Poona.  The Peshwas encouraged, sometimes forced, families to live in forts. Shahu had coerced Sheikh Mira's betrayal by arresting his family outside the fort, and the Peshwas feared similar enemy tactics against their officers.",

Fort provisions were annually renewed: old grain was sometimes given to the garrison in lieu of pay and sometimes sold, and new grain was bought from the proceeds.  Sometimes the government even stored ordinary spices and tobacco in the forts. During the Peshwa regime, forts were well supplied with artillery, though the artillerymen, mostly foreigners, were of better quality than the ordinary privates. Rockets and rocketers were still employed, but stone guns had not been discarded. Fort guns were cleaned annually (small guns and muskets monthly), but their effectiveness is questionable, given the ease with which the English captured them in 1818.  The army's denationalization also affected the forts, and by Baji Rao II's reign, many fortresses were primarily garrisoned by Arabs and non-Maratha Indians. This situation also prevailed in forts held by feudal subordinates, though these were less efficiently provisioned, especially when the chief was financially strained. While such chiefs could theoretically expect relief from the Peshwa, reinforcements often caused damage to the baron and, consequently, the Peshwa. Despite the natural strength of the country, it offered weak resistance during the final British conquest.",

He considered the country ideally suited for defensive war, proclaiming it impregnable.  However, Tone's prediction proved false, not because he overstated the land's strength or the forts' value, but because he overlooked the primitive nature of these strongholds – their architecture, management, and weaponry. Since Shivaji's time, there had been no improvements in military architecture, and the revived feudal system had undermined garrison and command efficiency. The artillery, particularly under Baji Rao II, was neglected.  Meanwhile, the English had far surpassed Aurangzib in organization, artillery, and military science.",

Babur's victories and the Portuguese dominance in Southern India demonstrated artillery's importance, making it crucial for Indian rulers to acquire this weapon.  While some Indians learned the science, including a Brahman gunner named Rama who engaged in an artillery duel with a Portuguese in 1571,  Indian princes often relied on European adventurers.  Shivaji established an artillery department (Tophkhana) and a gunpowder magazine (Darukhana), possibly emulating the Portuguese. However, he depended on European trading companies for guns and cannons, lacking his own foundry. This wasn't a failing on his part; as a pioneer, he couldn't achieve everything. He likely allowed the French to build a factory at Rajapore and hoped for similar benefits from the English at another port, expecting access to grenades, mortars, and ammunition.",

He suggested using Portuguese intermediaries to avoid implicating the English. In 1674, he sent an envoy with a letter and gifts, requesting big iron guns and two brass ones. The English lacked spare iron guns, but the brass guns were available. However, they feared provoking the Mughal emperor, who was already suspicious of English supplying Shivaji.

They were compelled to fight their English rivals on their own terms, in their own fashion and with inferior weapons. This was not the only disadvantage: Their army consisted of forces of different character, with different traditions, different equipments and different methods of warfare not yet reconciled to their old tactics. Their confidence in artillery and trained infantry led the Maratha leaders to neglect their cavalry, and the result was disastrous.\nIt was like a combat of the eagle and the lion: So long as the noble bird kept in its own elements it could with safety and effect harass the mighty beast, but compelled to fight the lord of the forest in his chosen ground with wings cleft and talons shorn the eagle had no chance. It had to yield to its enemy and give up the unequal contest.\nThe Army that had become so formidable under Shivaji and the first Baji Rao consisted entirely of light cavalry and fleet footmen, but the army that lost the battles of Assaye, Argaom and Lasswari had in it a new element - infantry regiments armed, disciplined and trained by European officers in the western style. This improvement or innovation has been popularly attributed to Mahadaji Sindhia, the celebrated founder of a new empire in Hindustan, but it has been commonly ignored that although the popularity of trained battalions was largely due to him, the appointment of Benoit de Boigne in 1784 was the inevitable corollary of the employment of Muzaffar Khan and Ibrahim Khan nearly thirty years earlier. Mahadaji was by no means the first Indian ruler to appreciate the superior fighting qualities of European officers. They had been welcomed by Indian princes since their first advent in the country, and Cosme da Guarda tells us that in the seventeenth century every European in India was supposed to be an artillery expert, and even an apostate clergyman did not find the least difficulty in securing a lucrative office in the Mughal army without any previous military training.",

Some of them formerly had 200 Roupies a Month; but now the Moguls having learnt somewhat of the Art they have less'. The same reason that led the Mughal Emperors to offer such excellent terms to foreigners of unknown antecedents with nothing but their European origin to recommend them, had also induced the Maratha princes to employ them in their own army.

    "text": "The Maratha victory at Udgir was attributed to the prowess of their new, European-trained force, enhancing its prestige. However, the incompatibility of these new methods with traditional Maratha tactics became evident at the Battle of Panipat.  Traditional Maratha horsemen prioritized speed and maneuverability, harassing the enemy and devastating the surrounding countryside. The new regiments, reliant on superior artillery and firearms, sought pitched battles. This conflict was highlighted when Malhar Rao Holkar advocated traditional tactics against the heavily armed Afghan army, while Ibrahim Khan Gardi, commander of the trained infantry, insisted on a fixed, entrenched position. Gardi's obstinacy resulted in his death and a disastrous defeat, strengthening conservative elements within the Maratha army and fueling hostility towards foreign-influenced military ideas. The Peshwa and his cousin were unable to effectively reconcile these two conflicting approaches.",

The Peshwa still required a strong, well-equipped infantry to counter similar forces employed by other Indian powers. Mahadaji Sindhia continued the military modernization efforts, and, unlike the Peshwa, he secured the services of a highly competent European officer, De Boigne. De Boigne, trained in Europe and with prior military experience, was tasked with raising and training battalions for Sindhia.  Mahadaji's ambitions extended beyond plunder raids; he aimed to establish control over remnants of the Mughal empire, bringing him into conflict with Rajput princes and Mughal generals. This required the reduction of forts and pitched battles, tasks for which trained infantry were crucial. Witnessing the performance of Ibrahim Khan's troops at Panipat and the effectiveness of the British army in the First Maratha War further convinced Mahadaji of the need for modernization.  Following Sindhia's lead, other Indian rulers, including Holkar and the Poona government, began enlisting European officers to train their armies.",

    "text": "The growth of Sindhia's modernized army was gradual. While Mahadaji was convinced of its superiority, he had to proceed cautiously due to resistance from those who favored traditional methods. In 1784, De Boigne was initially commissioned to raise only two battalions, a small fraction of Sindhia's overall forces. Despite the Maratha army's defeat at Lalsot and Chaksana, De Boigne's battalions performed well, validating Sindhia's trust.  De Boigne briefly left Sindhia's service, likely due to dissatisfaction with his subordinate position, but returned in 1790 to raise a brigade of ten battalions, along with cavalry and artillery.  Successes at Patan and Merta led to the formation of additional brigades. By the time Daulat Rao Sindhia challenged British supremacy, the major Maratha chiefs all possessed sizable modernized armies, led by European adventurers in the cases of Sindhia and Holkar, while Bhonsla's army remained under Indian command. Major Lewis Ferdinand Smith estimated the strength of these armies, highlighting the significant number of battalions, guns, and cavalry employed by each.",

Battalions were commanded by captains, lieutenants, subadars, jemadars, and other ranks, following a hierarchical structure. Artillery units within each battalion included European gunners and native support personnel.  Each battalion also had a complement of support staff, including surgeons, water carriers, and others. Logistical provisions included bullocks, carts, and ample ammunition for both guns and howitzers.  The pay structure for native officers and men is detailed, with higher rates for service in the Dekhan. European officers' salaries are also outlined, from colonel to ensign, with additional allowances for brigade commanders. Brigades included not only the battalion complement of guns but also battering guns, mortars, irregular cavalry, and Rohilla infantry. Battalions were often named after prominent cities or forts.  Discipline was based on English military regulations, and weaponry included both muskets and matchlocks, with variations for cavalry units.

    "text": "The Peshwa's trained battalion was never as numerous as that of Sindhia, and its first commander of whom we know anything was an English deserter from Madras. He was a bold man, as is testified by Lt. Moor who knew him, but he could not be expected to know much of the higher science of war that had rendered the European forces so superior to their Indian opponents. Evans had under him about fifty Europeans of diverse nationalities, but he was succeeded in his command by his wife, a native Christian woman.\n\nBaji Rao II, however, had two battalions under the efficient command of Col. Boyd. The old battalions consisted of 677 sepoys commanded by 2 Captains, 4 Lieutenants, 3 Sergeants, 14 Subhedars, 2 Cumedans (Commandants), 20 Jamadars, 59 Havaldars and 38 Naiks, while the new battalion of 484 Sepoys had 1 Captain, 2 Lieutenants, 1 Sergeant, 4 Subhedars, 5 Jamadars, 32 Havaldars and 7 Naiks. Both the battalions had a complement of artillery but only the new battalions had also a troop of 15 horsemen commanded by a Jamadar. Colonel Boyd, who held the chief command, got a salary of 3,000 Rupees per month, the Captains under him got Rs. 400 each; a Lieutenant was paid Rs 250 per month, while his Sergeant's monthly remuneration was Rs. 90.\n\nThe scale of salary, therefore, was not higher than that in Sindhia's army; for when Sindhia's men were called upon to serve in the Deccan they got an allowance in addition to their usual pay. John Ford, who commanded the Peshwa's battalions in 1812-13, got a lower salary than Colonel Boyd (Rs 2,500), but the two Captains under him got Rs. 1,000 each, while the two Assistant Captains were paid Rs. 800 (each) per month. The European soldiers in the Maratha service enjoyed many high privileges irrespective of their pay and position, as Colonel Tone informs us. 'I calculate,' he writes, 'that there were scattered about, in the interior, in the various services, of all countries, and situations; about three hundred Europeans; of these about seven commanded tolerably large corps, and may be considered as men of fortune. There were perhaps about sixty more, in the rank of officers; the remainder were serjeants and gunners, some of whom have deserted from the settlements; others from ships, but the majority were French. Persons of this description had from thirty to sixty rupees per month; under very little discipline, were generally of extremely irregular conduct and do but small honour to the European character, except by their extraordinary courage and intrepidity when employed on actual service…'",

    "text": "…yet so great is the partiality of the Mahratta chiefs for Europeans in general, that they enjoyed many privileges in this country which the native himself does not partake of. The various European articles necessary for his consumption passed through the Mahratta territories free; in the native durbars, no person in the service can set up a palankeen without permission but with regard to an European, no leave is ever required. In the Mogul Government no person can make use of a howda but the nabob, except Europeans, who labour under no restriction of this kind. In travelling through the interior, your baggage is transported from town to town without expense, and your person and property are perfectly secure, none of the natives, but military men, have any advantage of this nature.'\n\nThese concessions might have been justified if the Marathas had meant to make the fullest use of the military talents of the foreigners whose superiority was thus frankly acknowledged. But though the Hindu and Muhammadan soldiers of the North readily enlisted in the new battalions the Maratha scrupulously kept away. He preferred his time-honoured profession of an irregular Silhedar. The strict discipline that the new method enjoined and the Drill Sergeant, an unfamiliar figure, did not appeal to him, and the average saranjam-holder could not afford to have such an expensive force, while by the terms of his saranjam he was expected to serve the State with inexpensive cavalry regiments only. Of the numerous military leaders who were called upon to account for their rent-free estates before the Inam Commission only one, Rupram Chaudhari, could claim to be the commander of a paltan or trained battalion. The Europeans were employed not to teach and train the Marathas for a period of transition but were expected to occupy a permanent position in the Maratha army; and, as we have seen, all of them did not possess even the minimum qualification. Such a force, though useful in a war against an Indian rival, equally or more inefficient, could not stand against the superior army of the East India Company. It did not in any way strengthen the fleet Maratha horsemen, it only hampered them. Gopal Rao, a conservative officer in Sindhia's service, had once given his master a significant warning: 'Our fathers,' he said, 'the first founders of the Mahratta power, made their houses on the backs of their horses; gradually the house came to be made of cloth; and now you are making it of mud; take care and mark my words take care that in a very short time it don't all turn to mud, and is never re-built.' What was true of the barracks was equally true of the army. The main strength of the Maratha army lay in its speed and in its mobility. It was the interest of its European rival with better artillery to catch it in the open field and to force a pitched battle.",

    "text": "Shivaji relied for his success on the secrecy and speed of execution of his plans. His army was in constant readiness to cover the longest distance at the shortest notice. Speed and personal comfort could not very well be contrived together in those days. Shivaji and his men, therefore, had to accustom themselves to 'Fare Hard and Journey Fast'. They must have slept under the stars on their way to Surat in 1673, for they had no tents with them. During the Karnatak expedition the army carried only two small tents. These afforded shelter and some comfort to Shivaji and his principal officers, but his men must have been left to shift for themselves as best they could. They did not burden themselves with anything above the barest necessities and these were very few. But even the iron physique of the hardy Maratha leader demanded at times some relaxation, and when he was not pressed for time he would change his horse for a palanquin, in which comfortable conveyance his officers also occasionally indulged.\n\nThis is all that we know about his marches. Lightly equipped, without any tent, without any camp equipage, unencumbered by field artillery, he and his men moved from place to place with such incredible rapidity that his bewildered victims credited him with the knowledge of the black art. From the brief account of Sambhaji's and Rajaram's campaigns that has come down to us, it appears that they had not much deviated from their father's ways so far as personal comforts went during a military expedition. Born and bred in the mountains of Maharashtra, they were not accustomed to the pomp and splendour of their Mughal enemies. But Shahu had cultivated different tastes. He was brought up in a Mughal camp, where not only comforts but luxuries were provided, and the grandeur of the Mughal army was reflected, though faintly, in the pomp of the only expedition that Shahu led in person. He was more accustomed to ease and comfort than his father and grandfather, and he could afford to proceed on his journey slowly. He was not in a hurry like them. Shahu's march resembled more a ceremonial procession than a military expedition. He preferred the more stately elephant to the martial steed, and behind him followed the ladies of his seraglio, similarly mounted.",

Immediately behind the King and the banners marched the regiments of the nobles placed in the van, behind them the attendants and the military band, followed by elephants; horses, chariots and camels. Behind these animals were placed the lancers, spearsmen and rocket- eers; and between the King and the artillery were the arms-bearers and mace-bearers, musicians and other personal attendants. The road was carefully sprinkled with water to prevent dust. When so much care was taken to provide for their personal comforts the King and his courtiers could not expect to accomplish a long march, and it was decided that no more than three or four kosses (1 koss = 2 miles) should be attempted in a single day. Malhar Ranrao Chitnis hints that Shahu was deliberately copying the Mughal customs. He was accompanied by the principal officers of the State and a place was assigned to each of them according to his rank and station. The Sena Dhurandhar and the Sena Saheb Subhe were placed in the van. The Pratinidhi, the Peshwa, the Amatya, the Sachiv, and the Mantri were stationed on the right while the Senapati and the cavalry commanders were placed on the left. The Panditrao and the Nyaya- dhish, two civilians whose presence in the camp was probably demanded by the formalities of the court alone, also had their sta- tions with the Sumanta on the left. The Chitnis, the Potnis, and the clerical staff occupied a place near the treasury as their official duties demanded. The Faduis and the officers of the secretariat were placed on the left near the stores. The rear was guarded by the Sar- laskar and the chiefs under his command, and every arrangement was made for the comforts of the good King in advance by the tents department. As Shahu wanted to earn the opinion of his subjects, for it was through his own dominions that he was marching, he laid down that his soldiers should obtain all their necessities by fair purchase and should not cause the least trouble to the peasants. Any breach in this respect was to be punished with the loss of limbs. How far these orders were obeyed by the privates we do not know, but as Shahu was making a peaceful demonstration of his power, the cultivators probably suffered less than usual on this occasion.",

During the Peshwa period the army was divided into three great bodies during the march, as we learn from William Tone. The vanguard (or aghadi), which included the whole infantry, was called sadi fauj (Tone's 'fodge') or light troops and was commanded by the holder of the Jari Patka, the imperial banner, a little swallow-tailed flag worked in cherry and scarlet, and hoisted on a very high staff. The centre division was called the bich laskar and was considered as a body of reserve. It was not encumbered with any unnecessary equipment or artillery. The Peshwa himself commanded the rear, and the artillery called the jinsa, as well as the baggage of the whole army were placed in the rear which was called the grand park according to Tone. It was the Biniwala or Quartermaster-General who circulated the Peshwa's decision about the camping ground. On his arrival at the selected site the Biniwala hoisted a little flag to indicate the place for the Peshwa's tent. In front of this tent met the bazar or the market of the camp. The Banias accompanying the army fixed their little tents or pals, which consisted of a single blanket supported on a few sticks. Each of the Sardars then fixed his tent according to his own convenience and hoisted his flag to indicate his whereabouts to his followers. No order was followed. Each shifted for himself; but the different Sardars had each his own bazar which met in the immediate neighbourhood of his tent. While a private often had nothing better than a shrub or a tree as shelter, the officers were much better provided. The principal chiefs had not only comfortable but spacious and costly camp equipage. James Forbes, who accompanied Raghoba on his marches, writes: 'The magnificence of the Indian tents, pavilions, and summinianas, or canopy, far exceeds anything of the kind in Europe, especially among the Moguls. These accommodations are the more necessary where their women and children accompany them to the field. The Mahrattas seem to prefer their tents to a house, and enjoy more pleasure in a camp than in a city.' In fact a Maratha camp in the later Peshwa days much resembled a city, where commercial transactions of considerable volume were daily contracted. The camp bazars not only supplied the needs of the army but formed a fruitful source of income to the Maratha chiefs. Every shopkeeper paid a fixed tax, and every man who plied his profession there had to pay for his license. The four bazars in Sindhia's camp, as Major Broughton informs us, yielded no less than 14,000 Rupees in palpatti or tent-tax alone.",

Goldsmiths, jewellers, bankers, drapers, druggists; confectioners, carpenters, tailors, tent-makers, corn-grinders, and farriers, found full employment; as did the whole rows of silver, iron, and copper-smiths; but those in the greatest and most constant requisition, seem to be cooks, confectioners and farriers.' Nor was the camp unprovided with places of worship. Raghoba had a tent for his idols, and Forbes tells us that 'in the different divisions was a temporary dewal, or tent, consecrated to religious duties, where Brahmins regularly officiated; and prayer and sacrifices were offered to the deities with the same ceremonies as in the Hindoo temples.' Like Shahu the Peshwas were accompanied in all their expeditions by a staff of civilian officers, and the ordinary works of adminis- tration were punctually attended to in the camp. Civil and criminal justice was daily administered, petitions were regularly heard and audience was granted to the poorest man who might seek it. The camp was provided with all the necessities, with all the conveniences, with all the comforts of life then known in India. The days of Shivaji were forgotten. The Peshwas and their chiefs emulated the splendours of the Muhammadan nobility of the North, and this new taste for comfort and ease led to the slackening of the rigid discipline Shivaji had insisted on. Shivaji did not permit any women to accompany his forces, but the Peshwa's camp was generally full of them. When exactly this innovation first occurred we do not know. Probably when Baji Rao I began to enliven the tedium of his leisure hours in the company of the fair Mastani, his followers also began to seek similar relief and similar relaxation. Gopika Bai sometimes accompanied her lord on his expeditions; and at Panipat the presence of the wives and mothers of his comrades caused Sadashiv Rao no little em- barrassment and anxiety. Parvati Bai, his wife, was safely conducted home, but Nana Fadnavis lost his mother. The experience of Pani- pat, however, proved no deterrent, for Forbes, Broughton and Moor, who wrote from personal knowledge, all testify to the pre- sence of a large number of women and non-combatants in the camps of Raghoba, Daulat Rao Sindhia and Parashram Bhau Patwat- dhan.",

The privates and their officers had with them their wives and concubines, and dancing girls, jugglers and other women of doubtful character frequented the camp as a place most suitable for their profession. Nor did the bazar lack wine stalls and arrack shops, so that the votaries of Comus could spend their evenings in a manner most congenial to them but not conducive to discipline in a camp where it was particularly slack. The private perhaps had some justification in bringing his wife with him, for the camp attendants were few and generally the halt was brief: while he looked after the needs of his horse, his wife could cook his food and administer to his comforts. But what- ever the excuse for bringing them, women and children are encum- brances which an army can hardly afford, at least during a season of active operations. Besides the women and children the army was further encumbered by a large number of animals. 'The number and variety of cattle necessarily attendant on an Asiatic army,' writes Forbes, 'is astonishing; the expense of feeding these animals, as also the difficulty of procuring provender, is very great; and their distress for water in a parched country and sultry climate, often fatal. Exclusive of the Mahratta cavalry trained to war, were many thousand horses belonging to the camp-followers; the bazar alone required twenty thousand bullocks to convey the commodities of the shop- keepers, besides a number of small horses and asses. Some thousand camels were employed to carry the tents and baggage; but the elephants, proud of their distinguished elevation, were appropriated to some honourable service, or, covered with caparisons of em- broidered velvets and scarlet cloth; decorated with gold and silver fringe, were destined to carry the houdahs of Ragobah and his chief officers.' However useful these animals might prove for transport and other services, their feeding was not the only problem with which the army was confronted. There was no separate place for herding and stabling the beasts, and sometimes lack of care and underfeeding told so heavily on their health that the poor animals proved a source of ...",

Medical care was inadequate. The Maratha army lacked a commissariat, relying on foragers and Brinjaras for supplies. Brinjaras, primarily Hindu Jats, were nomadic traders who transported provisions in large, organized groups. They were generally honest but sometimes resorted to force.  Their numbers were considerable; Wellington reported thousands accompanying various armies. Besides Brinjaras, the Marathas utilized Pendharis, marauders who scavenged and sold provisions at low prices.  This lack of regulation sometimes resulted in periods of hardship.  Maratha soldiers and their animals were accustomed to minimal sustenance.  Transport typically involved asses, camels, and bullocks. River crossings in Northern India utilized boats and makeshift bridges, while in Southern India, basket-boats were employed.  These basket-boats, made of bamboo and hides, could transport men and cattle but were susceptible to strong currents. Reliance on local resources for boats and bridges meant that June was a disadvantageous time to wage war against the Marathas, as guarding the river crossings could hinder their movements.",

While Shivaji's financial stability allowed swift departures, the Peshwas and their chiefs faced delays due to financial constraints. Soldiers often demanded pay, sometimes resorting to *dharna*, a form of protest involving sitting outside the debtor's residence until the debt was settled. This practice, bound by strict rules, affected even high-ranking individuals like Sindhia, Holkar, and the Peshwa.  Major Broughton details the custom, noting that even the debtor's food intake was restricted during the protest. Despite the chaos of the Maratha camp, with its accompanying women, traders, children, and cattle, surprise attacks were difficult.  Alert cavalry pickets and efficient scouts, a tradition from Shivaji's era, provided security. Colonel Tone considered surprising a Maratha camp nearly impossible. Scouts, known as Jasuds, also served as messengers, traveling in pairs and utilizing their knowledge of shortcuts and byways. They received support from local officials and had access to designated rest areas.  When scouting, they employed disguises.  The Jasuds, though not a separate department, were attached to each army. The march of a Maratha force caused significant damage, with no distinction between friend and foe.",

It is needless to say that this remission could not always be adequate to the loss caused by the irresponsible soldiery; Holkar's forces probably enjoyed the greatest notoriety for their destructive propensities, for in this army the professional marauders or unpaid Pendharis outnumbered the ordinary Bargir and Silhedar. Lord Valentia says that the depredations of Jaswant Rao Holkar's men caused a famine in the Peshwa's territories,\n\nA popular Maratha ballad of the time presents a most horrible picture of the misdeeds for which these covetous and cruel mercenaries were responsible. It runs as follows:\n\n'They stayed not to weigh or to measure,\nThey stripped off the grain from the sheaves on the soil;\nNot Chandi was safe, nor Gunputti the wise;\nNor Shiwa the ruler of destinies:\nHis Pindi was broken, then who could expect\nThat the pots of the housewife would protect?\nNo order was left; every rank was confused,\nPreceptor and pupil were robbed and abused;\nEvery villain, and traitor, and rebel came forth,\nAnd stirred up revolt from the south to the north;\nFrom the south to the north; from the east to the west,\nFrom the sea to the Ganges they infest;\nThey strip the gold of the rich, the rags of the poor,\nThey bind them in prison, and sentinels stand\nAround them, and tramp on each road in the land.\nNo escape! from the wife of the peasant tear\nThe pearl-studded jewel that fastens her hair;\nFrom the peasant wrest all his hoarded rupees,\nThe grain from his grain-pits, the food off his knees;\nIf any delays or refuses to give,\nHe tastes such a beating that scarce he will live:'\n\nThe picture may or may not have been overdrawn, but it should be remembered that the offenders were the Pendharis and the Purvias, and not Marathas. These mercenaries were responsible for the worst crimes associated with the Maratha name. It was they who plundered and defiled the Sarada temple of Shri Shankaracharya of Shringeri during Parashram Bhau Patwardhan's campaign against Tipu Sultan. It was they who harassed the Brahmans of the South when Sindhia's trained battalions arrived in the Deccan to revive their master's waning influence at Poona. The mercenaries of the North were accustomed to plunder days, even during the Mughal days, and the Maratha leaders alone should not be held responsible for the outrages committed by these myrmidons. War is normally expected to be destructive and it brings forth the worst tendencies of human nature. This is borne out by universal experience and no people and no country offers an exception.",

    "text": "The third battle of Panipat marks a turning point in the history of India. About its ultimate result there is no difference of opinion, but its immediate effects have been variously estimated. The victor, it may be safely asserted, hardly derived any permanent gain; he had to leave Delhi shortly afterwards and he failed to consolidate his authority in the Punjab where the Sikhs were founding a new power. The powerful confederacy of the Muhammadan potentates of Hindustan dissolved even before the departure of the Afghan leader, and they had to settle their accounts with the Marathas as best they could. The vanquished were temporarily stunned but were not annihilated. Their supremacy survived for another forty years, and twenty-five years after the disaster of Panipat, Delhi found a Maratha military dictator using its impotent Emperor as an instrument and symbol of his power. Panipat did not deal the death blow to the Maratha empire, as it is commonly suggested; it only arrested its expansion and granted the future rulers of India the needed respite for consolidating their power in Bengal. But the campaign of Panipat might have proved a blessing in disguise to the Marathas, had they been able to profit by its lessons. It revealed the glaring defects of their military and imperial organisation that ultimately led to their overthrow.\n\nThe contest between the Marathas and the Afghans had been long impending. Ahmad Abdali made his first invasion of India in 1748. His first expedition proved a failure, but henceforth one party in the court of Delhi looked towards him for support, while the other preferred a Maratha alliance. Eventually, the Emperor, Ahmad Shah, came to an understanding with the Hindu power. The negotiation on the Maratha side was conducted by Malhar Rao Holkar and Jayappa Sindhia, and the Emperor granted the chauth of Thatta, Multan, the Punjab, Rajputana and Rohilkhand to the Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao, who in his turn undertook to defend the Emperor against his enemies and disloyal subjects, among whom are specifically mentioned Abdali, the Rohillas, the Rajputs and the Amirs of Sind. The document unfortunately bears no date but probably this agreement had been concluded sometime about 1750. The Peshwa had, therefore, nearly ten years for completing his military and diplomatic arrangements before his cousin met his Afghan rival on the fatal field of Panipat. According to their agreement, the Marathas made an expedition against the Rohilla chiefs, and it was at the instance of the latter that Abdali made his second expedition to India, which resulted in the conquest of the Punjab. The Rohillas were hardly a match for the Marathas. But, while common danger cemented a union among the threatened Muhammadan chiefs, the Marathas failed to pursue a common plan, for they were more anxious to secure their personal ends than to serve the common interests of the empire. Sindhia and Holkar, the two principal chiefs who were expected to look after the Maratha interests in the North, did not always agree; Hingne, the diplomatic agent stationed at Delhi, had no confidence in his military colleague Antaji Mankeshwar; and the military force employed in Hindustan was not always adequate; the Peshwa, above all, urged his officers to turn the channel of the stream from the North to the South.",

    "text": "head of a well appointed army of veterans and literally swept everything before him. The small Maratha army was easily put to flight, Delhi was occupied by the Afghan and Rohilla troops and the recent political arrangements were entirely set aside. The Peshwa sent his brother to meet the new danger, and if he had promptly proceeded to the war-zone, Raghoba might have encountered the Afghan army before it left India. But he allowed himself to be diverted with some money-raising expeditions in Rajputana and lost the opportunity of overtaking a war-worn enemy not a little fatigued by his movements in the unaccustomed heat of an Indian summer. When Abdali had left and there was no formidable opponent to face, Raghoba and Malhar Rao Holkar entered Delhi and inflicted a severe defeat upon the Rohillas. But Raghoba committed the mistake of extending his clemency to the defeated Rohilla leader who was the staunchest supporter of Abdali in India and therefore the most irreconcilable enemy that the Marathas had. Then he went to the Punjab, drove Abdali's agent from that province and planted the ochre-coloured banner of the Maratha empire on the banks of the Indus. Here Raghoba lost an excellent opportunity: While on the banks of the Indus, he obtained an autograph letter from the Shah of Persia proposing an alliance against the common enemy. Raghoba took it lightly: He underestimated the strength of his enemy and talked of the conquest of Kabul and Kandahar, as they had once formed an integral part of the Mughal empire. But if he had been seriously thinking of further conquest and annexation, it is difficult to understand why a strong Maratha force was not permanently posted on the natural frontiers of India. It would be far more easy to prevent Abdali's aggression with the mighty Indus in front and a hostile Persian army at his flank, while his Indian co-religionists would be absolutely incapable of rendering him the least assistance; for a comparatively small force would be sufficient for keeping the Rohillas in check. But in 1758 Raghoba again left for home. His army had long been in arrears and probably nothing would induce a southern force to stay away in a northern province for two successive seasons. When Raghoba left Hindustan, an enormously heavy task was imposed upon Sindhia. He had to look after the extensive region from Lahore to Muttra and he was further expected to lead an expedition to Bengal, not for any political purpose but to relieve the financial difficulties of the Peshwa. It was expected that Holkar would co-operate with him, but as early as 1756 Govind Pant Bundele had informed Sadashiv Rao that the prevailing difference between the two chiefs rendered any concerted action impossible, and the situation demanded the presence of both the Peshwa and Sadashiv Rao at Delhi.\nAs before, no notice seems to have been taken of this warning. In 1759 Ahmad Shah Abdali came to India for the fourth time. As usual he was confronted by a hopelessly inferior force: Dattaji Sindhia had allowed himself to be duped by the friendly professions of Najib Khan, and, when he was at last undeceived, lack of boats prevented him from crossing the Yamuna and punishing the perfidious Rohilla. The appearance of Ahmad Shah at once turned the scales against him. Loath to leave his post, he wrote to Holkar for speedy reinforcements. The joint army of the two chiefs might probably have yet stemmed the tide of Afghan success, but Holkar, as usual, allowed himself to be engaged with a Rajput chief; while the fate of his race was decided on the banks of the Yamuna. Dattaji rashly faced a superior Afghan army and paid for his rashness with his life. His nephew, the legitimate head of his family, was wounded and his army was totally routed. Then Holkar tried the traditional harassing tactics of his race against the formidable Afghan but in vain. The Afghans were mountaincers and, unlike the Mughals of the Deccan, could move swiftly when wanted. Holkar was defeated, the Marathas were expelled from Delhi and the Afghan leader was organising a general confederacy of Muhammadan chiefs against their hated Hindu enemy, when Sadashiv Rao set out on his memorable expedition.",

    "text": "The Maratha army was flushed with recent victory; their leader enjoyed a high reputation for his bravery and statesmanship; he had lately enlisted in his army a well known Musulman officer who had been trained by the celebrated Bussy. If he could attack Abdali before his diplomatic negotiations were concluded, there was yet hope for the Marathas. Lack of boats had prevented Dattaji Sindhia from punishing Najib Khan; lack of boats again impeded the progress of Sadashiv Rao. He had asked Govind Pant Bundele to arrange for boats, but Govind Pant did not, or could not, comply with his order, and when the Maratha army reached the banks of the Yamuna, the river was no longer fordable. The main army of Ahmad Shah Abdali was encamped at Anupshahar, while two weak detachments held Delhi and Kunjapura. Formidable as the Maratha army was, it was faced with one supreme difficulty: It was for all practical purposes in an enemy country. In Northern India the Marathas were known by the common name of *ganim* or enemy. They had once prided themselves on this distinction, but the general feeling of ill-will that the policy of rapacity lately initiated by Balaji Rao had roused now proved their ruin. Sadashiv Rao had before him the difficult task of winning the alliance or, failing that, of securing the neutrality of the northern powers. His negotiations with Shuja-ud-daula proved unsuccessful, but the Jats were won over to the Maratha side. Mr. Keene has described the campaign of Panipat as a contest between the united Hindus of India and a confederacy of Muhammadans. It was nothing of the sort: The Muhammadans, indeed, had rallied to the banner of their Afghan co-religionist, all on account of the clever propaganda of Najib Khan, but the Rajputs held sternly aloof. Sadashiv Rao had no rallying cry to win them over. It was not Hindwpad Padshahi that he was fighting for; he was, according to his own confession, fighting for the Timuride empire.\nIt appears that Sadashiv Rao had at first underrated his enemy's strength. At one time he had expected that the very rumour of his approach would frighten the Afghans away. Much of his tactical and strategical mistake was due to this over-confidence. In July 1760 the Maratha army captured Delhi; the Afghans had encamped on the opposite bank but were forced to witness the fall of the imperial city without being able to help their comrades. From Delhi Sadashiv Rao proceeded to Kunjapura and reduced that place. Hitherto he had not been guilty of any tactical blunder: He was perfectly right in reducing all the Afghan stations on his side of the river and trying to cut off the enemy's retreat; but no general can be pardoned for omitting to provide for his own safety in case of an unforeseen defeat. The greatest blunder that Sadashiv Rao committed at this stage was that he did not adequately guard the fords. On 17 October, the Maratha army reduced the Afghan garrison stationed at Kunjapura, and six days later Abdali crossed the Yamuna at Bagpat without any opposition. Thus the Maratha army was cut off from its base of operation. The exact strength of the two contending forces has been variously estimated by contemporary writers. The total strength of the Marathas amounted, according to Kasiraj Pandit, to 55,000 horse, 15,000 foot; 200 cannons, rockets and Shutarnals without number, besides 15,000 Pendharis. The allied Muhammadan army, according to the same writer, consisted of 41,800 horse, 38,000 foot and 70 to 80 cannons. Muhammad Ja'far Shamlu gives a much higher figure; but on the whole, the rival forces were probably equally strong. The Marathas were superior in cavalry and artillery; their opponents had a superior infantry and the advantage of superior generalship. The army of Sadashiv Rao differed as much from that of Shivaji as the hardy followers of Babar differed from the ease-loving officers who accompanied Aurangzib to the Deccan. Sadashiv Rao and his principal officers had, like the Mughal grandecs of Aurangzib's time, costly tents and expensive camp equipage. They were accompanied by their wives and female attendants. Nana Fadnavis, then a young man in indifferent health, had accompanied the army with the intent to visit the holy places of Northern India; and he had with him his young wife and widowed mother. A number of traders and shopkeepers had followed the Maratha force to supply its daily needs. Sadashiv Rao was encumbered with a crowd of non-combatants, and worse still the presence of so many ladies of noble birth immensely added to his embarrassment. His army was hardly competent to carry on those harassing tactics, the success of which depended entirely on speed. He was, therefore, right in rejecting Holkar's suggestion and his decision was further justified by the failure of such tactics in the late campaign. But it is difficult to understand why he did not try to fall back on Delhi even at the risk of a deep battle and reopen his communication with his base of operation and his far-off native province. Instead of that he entrenched himself strongly at Panipat. In his fortified camp defended by a ditch and a strong mud wall with mounted cannons he could easily beat off any attack of Abdali. And it was his plan to compel his enemies to fight the Maratha army on its own ground. Govind Pant Bundele was expected to devastate the territories of the allied princes with a flying corps of Maratha cavalry, cut off their supplies and drive Abdali to meet his destruction at Panipat. The plan looked well on paper, but its success depended mainly on the operations entrusted to Govind Pant Bundele. This officer, however, had neither the ability nor the means, as G. S. Sardesai points out, to carry out the instructions of his commander. He was by profession and training a civilian. His following consisted of the militia needed for revenue collection, and the cavalry under his command was hardly adequate for the enterprise upon which the fate of Sadashiv Rao's army depended so much. But Sadashiv Rao and his companions were confident of success. Their jubilant confidence found expression in a letter written by Krishna Joshil on 5 November 1760. The Muhammadan army, he informed his correspondent, was suffering from scarcity of provisions, while there was abundance of it in the Maratha camp. He expected the Afghans to fall upon their entrenched camp in a few days and meet certain destruction from their artillery. He ascribed the inactivity of the Afghan general to his fear of Maratha prowess. He jubilantly concludes his letter with the remark that Abdali cannot retreat to his own country as the road is blocked, he dares not fight the Marathas as defeat is certain, he cannot sit idle as he is short of provisions'. The unfortunate writer died two months afterwards, and he hardly realised when he penned these lines how accurately he was describing the difficulties that awaited his own commander. Sadashiv Rao had attempted the combination of two fundamentally opposite methods, and the result was disastrous. We need not mention here the skirmishes that at different times took place between different companies of the two armies. From the middle of November the Marathas had begun to feel the want of food and provender.",

    "text": "but still their commander persisted in his policy of 'starving his enemy, blindly ignoring the fact that his enemy had much better facilities for procuring supplies than he could have; unless and until he succeeded in reopening his communications with Delhi. With the first signs of famine in his camp Sadashiv Rao ought to have attempted to force his way back to Delhi; but, after Govind Pant Bundele's death in the third week of December, he had no excuse for persisting in his original plan. Abdali could no longer be driven into the snare laid for him. It was no longer possible to cut off his supplies, on the other hand, it became increasingly difficult for the Marathas to send out their foraging parties. Still the Brahman general's confidence did not forsake him and even in the face of famine he persisted in the way of certain destruction and ruin. He knew well that peace on honourable terms was no longer possible, and Kasiraj Pandit tells us that Najib Khan was now opposed to peace on any terms. He knew that the Marathas were now completely at the mercy of the allied army; he knew that he had given them repeated offence and he dared not let them escape from their self-contrived annihilation.\nAt last the Marathas could no longer bear the pangs of hunger: Animals began to die in numbers, the privations suffered by men were enormous and could no longer wait in their fortified camp. At this crisis it appears that Sadashiv Rao did not possess the coolness and patience that the situation demanded. He resolved to fight, but even at the last moment it was his duty to direct the battle rather than throw himself desperately among his enemies. It was his duty to think out a fairly good plan of battle, but at the last moment he wavered. It was decided, if we are to rely on a contemporary chronicle, on the night previous that the army should form a hollow square, with the women in the centre, and with the help of the artillery try to cut its way through the hostile ranks. But on the following morning this plan was suddenly abandoned and the whole army was ordered to fall upon the Muslim force. The Marathas advanced with their artillery in front. On their left marched the trained infantry of Ibrahim Khan, on their right rode the cavalry of Sindhia and Holkar, while Sadashv Rao in person led the centre. No reserve was left, no strategy was tried, the artillery played no important part in this momentous battle, the contest was decided by a close hand to hand fight, and superior man-power ultimately triumphed. Ibrahim Khan Gardi was resolved to give a good account of himself and his battalion. He took a banner in his own hands and led a resolute bayonet charge against the Rohilla divisions of Hafiz Rahamat Khan and Dundi Khan. The Rohillas were utterly routed and broken, eight thousand of them were killed and wounded and hardly one thousand were left with each chief.",

    "text": "At the same time the Maratha centre led by Sadashiv Rao and Viswas Rao fell on the Afghan centre where the Grand Vizier commanded a large body of ten thousand horse, seven thousand Persian musketeers and one thousand camels mounted with Zamburaks. Here also the resolute Marathas carried everything before them. Attai Khan, the nephew of the Grand Vizier, was killed, three thousand of his followers were slain or wounded and the demoralised Afghans began to run away. The Grand Vizier reproached them, expostulated and argued with them; but in vain. He urged Kasiraj Pandit to bring Shuja-ud-daula to his rescue. But the Chief of Oudh seems to have been an indifferent spectator; his intention, most probably, was to watch the fight and join the victors. Jankoji Sindhia, however, failed to make much impression on the division of Najib Khan. The Rohilla chief had under him eight thousand infantry and nearly six thousand horse: they advanced slowly under cover of a kind of breast-works of sand, which were thrown up by a great number of Bildars who were with them, and who, having finished one, advanced the distance of half a musket shot in front of that, under cover of their own people, and threw up another; to which the troops then advanced, while a third was thrown up in the same manner. These defensive tactics saved them from the violent charge of the cavalry of the Marathas that had nearly broken the Afghan centre. Damaji Gaikwad, whose division, Kasiraj Pandit tells us, supported Ibrahim Khan, behaved very well and he himself received several wounds. The Marathas fought with the courage of desperation and for a moment the Afghans lost heart. But they were led by a consummate general. Ahmad Shah had been watching the battle and had a strong reserve ready at hand to be used at the right moment. The Marathas had been able to make no impression on the Muhammadan left, and when the fresh reserve charged the Maratha centre and reinforced Abdali's right, the tide of battle at once turned. The Muhammadan won a complete victory and a whole generation of Maratha and Brahman officers was slaughtered on that fatal field. The defeat was due as much to bad generalship as to the inherent defects of the Maratha military system. Had there been a strong standing army to be permanently stationed in Hindustan, had Raghunath Rao held the Indus frontier, had Holkar joined Sindhia's army in time, the battle of Panipat might not have been fought at all. But the feudal organisation of the army and the chronic financial needs of the Peshwa and his Sardars frequently compelled them to divert their energy to minor expeditions, while the real source of danger was ignored. The failure of Govind Pant Bundele was due more to the system than to any remissness on his part. His districts had for several years been disturbed by hostile Rohillas. Yet he was expected to meet not only the financial demands of the army but to raise a sufficiently strong cavalry force to devastate Oudh and Rohilkhand and to drive the allied army upon the artillery of Ibrahim Khan at Panipat. Another lesson of Panipat that was lost upon the Marathas was the impracticability of combining two opposite methods of warfare. The experiment proved disastrous at Panipat, and Colonel Malleson says that the fatal defeat of Assaye was mainly due to its repetition. During the Panipat campaign, Sadashiv Rao had relied almost entirely on his trained infantry for victory; his successors went further; their infatuation for this new method of fighting led them to neglect their once powerful cavalry; and during the forty years that intervened between Panipat and Assaye, Maratha generalship had also hopelessly deteriorated.",

    "text": "Shivaji's followers had inherited from their ancestors a great military tradition; but the sea was a new element to them. The western coast of India had from time immemorial been inhabited by an intrepid race of seafarers, but no evidence can be found to support the view that any attempt had been made in the past to establish a naval power. Though the Yadava Kingdom, for example, had stretched right up to the seaboard, the ambition of the Devgiri princes seems to have been land-bound; they did not aspire to rule the waves. Shivaji may, therefore, be justly described as the father of the Maratha navy. The English factors in their wrath called him a robber and a pirate; but he was in reality trying to create a new sea power; and it was not his fault that the Maratha fleet did not ride the sea with as much confidence as the Maratha horse scoured the land. His policy was, however, not one of mere adventure, nor was his object by any means impracticable. The coast-line of the Konkan, broken by many creeks, offered excellent shelter for ships; and the rocky islands near the coast presented excellent sites for naval strongholds. Shivaji had before his eyes the example of the Sidis and the merchant powers of Europe, and he could not have been ignorant of the exploits of the pirates known to European writers as 'Malabars'. Once in secure possession of the Konkan, it did not take his keen intellect to perceive the advantages as well as the necessity of a strong fighting fleet. The peace of his country and the prosperity of his ports equally demanded it. The peace of his country was threatened by the Abyssinian ruler of Danda Rajpuri. Secure in his island stronghold he could and did harass Shivaji's land with sword and fire. The towns and villages on the coast were burnt and plundered, women and children were kidnapped to be sold as slaves, yet Shivaji's governors were helpless, directly the invaders betook themselves to their native element. Shivaji's ports offered him a brilliant chance of improving his finances. Foreign merchants, attracted to these new marts, would not only improve the general prosperity of the country by purchasing its products but would contribute directly to the coffers of the State in the shape of customs duties. He could also derive greater profit by embarking on commercial enterprises on his own account, in consonance with the practice of the Portuguese rulers of Goa and the English traders of Bombay. But free navigation of the sea was in those days denied to all who could not enforce their right. The sovereignty of the sea had been for many years effectively claimed and exercised by the Portuguese. No merchant dared to launch his bark on the Arabian Sea or the Indian Ocean without first purchasing the permission of the Government of Goa. Even sovereign powers like those of Golkonda and Bijapur had to undergo this humiliation. It is true that they obtained Portuguese cartazes to a specified number merely for the asking; but these permits were accompanied in all cases by vexatious conditions. They were not to import or export certain articles mentioned in the cartaz, they were not to visit the ports of the Imam of Muscat and of other enemies of the Portuguese and were not to carry with them any Christian slave. To ascertain whether these conditions were loyally observed the Portuguese claimed and exercised the right of search. In short they denied their weaker neighbours the freedom of the sea.",

Although Indian traders and Indian rulers had accepted the Portuguese sovereignty of the sea as a settled fact, this assumption of authority had been from the very beginning disputed by the merchants of other European nations. And in Shivaji's time the English, the Dutch and the French successfully demonstrated the possibility of defying the Portuguese in their own element. Shivaji, possessed of a strong fleet, could secure for his subjects the same rights, the same immunities and the same advantages. Moreover, a fleet in those days did not cost the State much to maintain. While protecting the mercantile fleet of the country the fighting fleet would raise a revenue by emulating the example of the European powers settled on the western coast. Like the English and the Portuguese, the Marathas could also sell their passports to alien traders if they could hold their own afloat. There was another advantage which Shivaji must have foreseen even in the earliest days of his struggle with the Muslim powers of the Deccan and Hindustan, that his enemies might try to starve him into submission by prohibiting the export of provisions from their country, as Bahadur Khan actually did.

The ship's crew wcre divided into two classes-gunners and ordinary soldiers intended for boarding thc enemy vessels.

There was 4 scarcity of expert gunners, who were much in demand, and we may reasonably surmise that were mere mercenarics and readily transferred their services fron one master to another. Sidi Kasim seduced a number of gunners from Bombay by offering them higher pay, and when thc English expostulated, he wrotc to them: You write me conccming a gunner and I would faine know what service YOu want by him, but if you have need of him and will content him, by paying hinl what is his duc you may send for him: I have taken severall gunners from our cnemys (i.e Shivaji) and have many others, therefore by that rcaSon I shall not be revenged and besides you have one of my gunncrs in your scrvice, who if he be contented to come to me, YOU may give him leavc and send hun to me.

Thc navy was clearly not 3 Maratha institution as the army was. Did Shivaji employ European sailors in his navy? Wc have Icason to believe that he did.

The fleet returned to Dabhol after encountering and capturing a Portuguese ship near Daman, only to face Portuguese retaliation, resulting in the capture of twelve Maratha ships. Shivaji's primary objective was the conquest of Janjira, a struggle that began as early as 1648.  He attempted various tactics, including storming the island, building a mole, and employing a floating battery, but ultimately failed to conquer it. The island of Bombay played a significant role in this conflict, serving as a wintering and provisioning base for the Sidi's fleet. However, the Sidi's sailors caused trouble on the island and launched raids on Shivaji's mainland territories from Bombay. This led to protests from Shivaji, who accused the English of violating neutrality by harboring the Sidi. The English authorities, caught between the Mughal Empire and Shivaji, were in a difficult position. They depended on Shivaji for supplies but also had to consider their interests within the Mughal Empire.",

They attempted to mediate between Shivaji and the Sidi, but their efforts were unsuccessful.  Shivaji, frustrated by the Sidi's continued attacks and the English harboring of the Sidi's fleet, ordered an attack on the fleet at Mazagon. However, logistical challenges and Portuguese intervention prevented the attack. The English, wary of Shivaji's intentions, reinforced their defenses.  In 1678, provoked by the Sidi’s enslavement of his people, Shivaji ordered another attack on the Sidi's fleet at Mazagon.  This attempt also failed due to logistical issues and the Sidi seeking refuge under the protection of Bombay's fort.  Determined to halt the Sidi’s raids, Shivaji sent troops to occupy the island of Kenery, which partially commanded Bombay's harbor.  The English, aware of Shivaji's plan, ordered the construction of a fort on Kenery, but the Marathas had already occupied the island.  Despite English requests to withdraw, the Marathas refused, leading to a conflict that resulted in an English defeat. A subsequent naval battle saw the English defeat Daulat Khan's fleet.",

Having sailed with six Pals and some Gallivats, he blockaded the port. The Angria, who was not inclined to hazard a naval action, responded by hauling his fleet ashore out of range of the Portuguese guns and leaving Froes to continue his ineffectual blockade. Three months later the Portuguese Captain was forced to depart by the receipt of news of the arrival of the Arab fleet at Surat. In consequence, possibly of the Viceroy's complaints against the Sidi for lukewarminess, the latter in December, 1713 also sent an expedition to Kolaba; but as Angria obtained his provisions by land, the Abyssinian was no more successful than his European ally. The Portuguese and the Sidi were not the only enemies that Kanhoji had to reckon with. In 1712 he had captured the Governor of Bombay's yacht armed with another English vessel, the Anne of Carwar. As a partisan of Tara Bai, he had waged a successful war against Shahu and extended his dominions on the mainland by the reduction of the strong fortresses of Lohagad, and Tikona. Shahu's Peshwa, Bahiro Pant Pingle, had been taken a prisoner by his forces. But these successes did not turn Kanhoji's head. As a practical man he realised the limits of his resources and decided to conclude peace with Shahu and the English so that he might be free to defend his territories against the joint efforts of the Sidi and the Portuguese.",

Consequently, he decided to come to terms with the English at once, and sent a messenger to Bombay in February 1713 with proposals for peace; offering to deliver the captured vessels if an Englishman of credit was sent to Kolaba. The Governor and Council proposed the following terms: (1) 'That he deliver up all that he has taken that belonged to the Company and our people.' (2) 'That upon no pretence whatever he meddle with any English ships or with the ships belonging to the merchants who live under the protection of the English as Madrass, Bengall or any other factorys or colonys belonging to the English whatsoever.' (3) 'That whatever ships or vessels to any nation whatsoever that are coming into our harbour and in sight thereof he is not (to) meddle with them that is between Mahim stakes and and at their going out the same rule is to be observed;' (4) 'That he grants our merchants the free liberty of his ports paying usual customs conformable to the rules thereof. If any vessels belonging to Sevagce Rana (Raza) or Sow Razah shall take or molest any vessels belonging to Bombay having his convoy which he is obliged to give he shall be answerable for the damage.'

(6) 'We grant him free liberty of our port of Bombay to buy and sell merchandise he paying the usual customs and observing the rules of our port, which if he complies with that we send the Blenheim, Ann and Manchua to fetch the Company's effects which he has taken and our people.' These terms were accepted by Kanhoji, as they imposed little or no sacrifice on him.

Governor Boone, recognizing the need for a more decisive strategy, sought to exploit internal divisions within the Maratha polity by attempting to align with the Raja of Kolhapur against Angria.

He informed his successor that Bombay had no more than eighty Englishmen, all of whom were merchants and clerks. The Count, therefore, strongly urged the new Viceroy not to conclude any alliance with the English, the only power whom he could recommend as reliable being the Sidi of Janjira.\nBut when Robert Cowan, the English agent, reached Goa in March 1721, they had been at war with Angria for three years, and the loss they had suffered probably provided sufficient evidence of their resolution. Moreover, a squadron of four ships under Commodore Thomas Mathews had left England for the East in February of that year, and the news must have reached the European settlements in India sometime before the conclusion of the treaty, which was signed on 20 August 1721, only two weeks before the arrival of the English fleet at Bombay. The treaty consisted of fourteen Articles and provided for the division of the spoils of the war and the conquered territories: Of the naval strongholds of the Angria, Kolaba was to be awarded to the Portuguese, while Gheria was to fall to the English. Evidently, the allied powers were planning the complete conquest of the Angria's possessions and the total destruction of his power. It was therefore decided that no peace proposal was to be entertained by either of the allies; all such questions were to be jointly decided. The success of the scheme depended upon its secrecy. But the Portuguese began to enlist Pathan mercenaries at Bassein, and before long Kanhoji became aware of the new menace that threatened him. He promptly tried to avert the danger by diplomacy and sent peace proposals to the Portuguese authorities. The Viceroy, however, curtly rejected Kanhoji's offer and continued his warlike preparations. The Angria not only strengthened his position by enlisting fresh forces but also applied for help and reinforcements from his liege-lord, the Chhatrapati of Satara.",

The morale of the Bombay men, habituated to defeat in their attacks on Angrian strongholds, was naturally not very high. Mathews was a brave officer but did not possess tact and other qualities of leadership. The first serious reverse so infuriated him that he insulted his Portuguese colleague, and the breach between the allied armies was so great that Col. Biddulph thinks that a little more enterprise on the part of the Mahrattas would have destroyed the whole force. Kanhoji Angria was a diplomat of uncommon ability. We have already seen how he had tried to prevent the conclusion of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. In his letter, he had made a pointed reference to the English failure in 1719 against Kolaba and Kenery, and although he had refrained from mentioning it, the Viceroy was well aware of the results of the Portuguese expedition against Angria's headquarters under Antonio Cardim Froes in the following year. Better success was expected from the reinforcements Mathews had brought; but the enthusiasm and confidence aroused at Goa by the arrival of the English fleet had now been rudely shaken. The Maratha Admiral did not fail to exploit the mutual recrimination and suspicion which now recurred and again made peace proposals to the Portuguese. In spite of the best efforts of the allies, Angria's fleet still kept the sea and the Viceroy learned that Angria's captains had captured a Portuguese boat near Diu. Kolaba itself was well provisioned and strongly garrisoned with one thousand infantry and seven hundred cavalry. Fresh reinforcements from Poona and Satara were daily hurrying to the field of war. First Pilaji Jadhav and then Baji Rao had appeared in the neighbourhood with an enormous Maratha horde that now numbered twenty-five thousand cavalry. Whatever chance of success there had been at the earlier stage of the campaign now completely vanished. The Portuguese Viceroy, therefore, deemed it wise to accept peace proposals and return to Goa.",

    "text": "Portugal's strategy for dealing with the Angrias at Bassein and other Portuguese locations had two potential approaches.  A blockade of these ports to sever communication with Goa was possible, but never implemented.  Reinforcements and expeditions were successfully dispatched by the Portuguese from Bassein.  The Angrias, despite their naval presence, didn't attempt a blockade. A second, more effective strategy would have been to cut off Goa's vital rice supply from Canara. This would have starved both Goa and Bassein into submission. However, neither of the Angria brothers systematically targeted the Portuguese merchant ships. This inaction can be attributed to their divided attention; unlike the Peshwa's singular focus on the Portuguese, the Angrias were also engaged with the English, often diverting their efforts upon encountering ships of other nations. They deviated from their father's strategy of concentrating on one enemy at a time.  Information about the Angria brothers' naval operations during the Maratha-Portuguese wars is primarily derived from Portuguese records. In 1735, the Portuguese navy engaged and defeated two of Sambhaji Angria's ships.  However, in 1738, Sambhaji captured a Portuguese ship near Dahanu.  His fleet, comprising five Pals and eleven Gallivats, also captured the Portuguese warship Sao Migual near Gheria, along with its valuable cargo. He further seized three Parangues, one carrying a substantial sum of money. These successes emboldened Sambhaji's men, causing concern among Portuguese captains escorting supply boats from the south. However, their fears were allayed when Sambhaji captured two Dutch ships, diverting his attention and allowing the Portuguese provisions to reach port safely. This capture was a tactical error as it prompted a Dutch fleet to appear near Agoada the next year, intending a demonstration against Sambhaji’s stronghold at Gheria. The Portuguese Viceroy, seeing an opportunity, proposed an alliance with the Dutch against both the Angrias and the Marathas.  He advocated for a united European front against their Asiatic enemies. However, these negotiations proved fruitless, and the Dutch fleet departed without action. In 1739, Sambhaji attempted what he had failed to do in 1738. He engaged a Portuguese frigate, Nossa Senhora da Victoria, escorting forty-seven Parangues laden with salt returning with rice.  Despite a day-long battle, the superior artillery of the Portuguese frigate inflicted damage on two of Angria's ships, forcing their retreat. The frigate successfully escorted the Parangues to Goa. Manaji Angria, however, achieved more success. Shortly after Sambhaji’s defeat, he landed on Karanja with his forces and secured its surrender after a short siege. He then proceeded to besiege the Portuguese port of Chaul.",

    "text": "On May 23, 1739, the Marathas captured Bassein, but peace did not immediately follow.  In 1740, the Angria brothers inflicted heavy losses on the Portuguese.  Sambhaji’s fleet engaged the Portuguese near Gheria but disengaged and sailed south.  Near Onore, they learned of Portuguese boats under heavy convoy from the south.  While some Portuguese vessels escaped, the main convoy, consisting of two Pals, two galleys, and a Charrua, was swiftly defeated and captured by the Marathas. Sambhaji, confident in his naval power, sailed past Anjidiv and Agoada with his prize, unchallenged by the Portuguese.  He treated his prisoners well, releasing them to Goa. Portuguese accounts attributed this act to parsimony rather than generosity. This was not the only Portuguese setback that year. Manaji captured a Diu fleet pataxo-of-war by luring it with a single ship and ambushing it with four Pals. Despite their naval prowess, the brothers’ internal conflicts hindered their father’s ambition of conquering the coast from Bombay to Goa. In the same year as their successes, they turned on each other.  Sambhaji, seeking to regain Kolaba from his brother, attacked and captured Hirakot and Sagargad before besieging Kolaba. Manaji appealed to the Peshwa and the English for help. Despite prior hostility with Manaji, the English, along with the Peshwa, feared Sambhaji’s growing power. A combined Maratha and English force compelled Sambhaji to retreat. This defeat, along with a clause targeting him in a later Portuguese treaty with the new Peshwa, likely impressed upon Sambhaji the need for alliances. Despite strained relations with both the English and Portuguese, these were the only powers whose alliances held value.  Although he had captured the Derby in 1735, his fleet’s defeat by Commodore Bagwell’s squadron in 1738, along with other events, led him to seek peace with the English in 1739.",

He demanded exorbitant fees for trade vessel passes and free navigation, which were promptly rejected. Following this unsuccessful attempt, he turned his attention southward, engaging in minor conflicts with the Portuguese. However, alliances and hostilities in that era were fluid, driven by convenience and shared interests. Sambhaji and the Portuguese found common ground in their mutual dislike for the Peshwa.  Sambhaji approached the Portuguese for an alliance, likely motivated by their shared enemy. Although the specifics of his offer remain unknown, the Portuguese Viceroy responded favorably, referencing Sambhaji's father with respect.  The Viceroy invited Sambhaji to send a representative to Goa for treaty negotiations. However, this letter likely never reached Sambhaji, as he died shortly after.\n\nRegarding the strength and tactics of Sambhaji's navy, limited information exists. A 1738 pamphlet provides some insight. Sambhaji was described as a diligent leader who personally oversaw all operations. His crew, including European gunners, were poorly and irregularly paid, receiving only a small portion of their salary in cash and often facing long arrears.  Sambhaji meticulously planned every expedition, and upon their return, the men were thoroughly searched.  No one could leave Suvarnadurg without his permission, and everyone was expected to pay their respects to him daily, ensuring he knew who was absent. In 1736, when Captain Anselm was his prisoner, Sambhaji had seven Grabbs afloat and thirty fighting Gallivats.  The Grabbs were well-maintained, hauled ashore for cleaning and oiling after each voyage. They were heavily armed, with prow-guns being their most effective weapons.  The Gallivats, smaller and faster vessels, served as support, carrying ammunition and men. Sambhaji issued orders publicly, and upon the fleet's departure, relatives of the crew were kept in the fort, possibly as hostages.",

    "text": "The Maratha navy of this period had not advanced beyond the galley stage, relying more on oars than sails, particularly in naval engagements, which they preferred to conduct in calm seas.  Their gunners were often foreign, and Muslim captains were still employed. While less advanced than European fleets, the Maratha navy held a strong reputation along the Malabar Coast and was considered a valuable training ground for naval officers.  Both Ismail Khan and Apaji Gopal, notable naval commanders who later earned Portuguese recognition for their skill and bravery, began their careers in Sambhaji's service.  Despite its reputation, the Maratha navy's development stagnated after reaching a certain point.\n\nSambhaji's death did not unify the Angria family. Tulaji inherited Suvarnadurg, while Manaji continued to rule Kolaba. The brothers remained estranged, mirroring the divisions during Sambhaji's reign. Manaji, mistreated by the Peshwa and stripped of some forts, complained to Shahu. Despite their shared animosity towards the Peshwa, the brothers' feud prevented a united front against Poona.  Driven by rivalry, Manaji coveted his father's title of Sarkhel.  Shahu suggested that the title must be earned through valorous deeds. Tulaji then captured Arjanvel, showcasing his capabilities.  Manaji, undeterred, aimed for the even higher title of Sawai Sarkhel. In November 1744, he attacked a Portuguese merchant fleet with a considerable force. The battle lasted for several days and nights, with the Hindu sailors pausing for daily worship. Despite outnumbering the two Portuguese frigates, Manaji ultimately withdrew, failing to achieve his objective. Subsequently, he appeared to pursue a friendlier relationship with the Portuguese. The Marquis of Alorna noted Manaji's consistent solicitations for friendship and offers of cooperation against Balaji Baji Rao.",

While making occasional peace overtures, he made no substantial effort to resolve his disputes with the Portuguese until 1755, when facing imminent danger.  He maintained peace with Goa in 1748 and 1749, even sending an envoy to negotiate an alliance the previous year. However, the Viceroy's limited resources resulted in a non-committal response.  In 1749, a naval engagement between Tulaji's fleet and a Portuguese frigate was aborted when Tulaji's admiral clarified the attack was unintentional, citing friendly relations. Despite this, Tulaji seized Portuguese boats in 1751 and, the following year, renewed alliance proposals through the Sardesai of Kudal.",

The Marchioness of Tavora rightly wrote that his policy was uncertain and regulated by the needs of the moment. The Portuguese were not the only European nation to suffer from Tulaji's fleet. The French and the Dutch had also suffered similar losses; but the English suffered most, probably because their mercantile interests were far superior to those of any other nation. In 1742 Tulaji took the Jupiter, one of the best vessels of Europe that La Bourdonnais had sent to Goa for provisions. The next year he captured the Neptune, another French ship, near Calicut. But henceforth Tulaji completely changed his attitude and sought the friendship of the French. In 1747 he actually sent two envoys to Mahe with a proposal of an offensive alliance against their common enemy, the English of Bombay; but his offer was politely rejected by Dupleix. On different occasions the Angria had seized and carried away the following vessels belonging to the East India Company or their subjects: The Charlotte, belonging to Madras, the William, belonging to Bombay; the Severn, a Bengal freighter; the Derby, the Grab Restoration, the Pilot, and the Augusta, the Dadaboy from Surat, the Rose from Mangalore, the Grab Anne from Gombroon, Benjimolly from the Malabar coast and the Futte Dowlat from Muscat. It is needless to remark that the heavy financial loss caused by the Angria brothers greatly exasperated the English, but their fleet and several strongholds were still considered invincible and all attempts against them had for nearly half a century proved futile.",

    "text": "Mutually antagonistic and disunited as they were, the Angria brothers could still defy any single maritime power of the coast. Unfortunately for Tulaji he had to contend against a simultaneous invasion by the strongest sea power and the most formidable land force that India knew at the time. When Kolaba was attacked by the joint Anglo-Portuguese army in 1721, his father obtained reinforcements from Poona led by Peshwa Baji Rao in person; but when the English bombarded Suvamadurg in 1755, the Peshwa's army co-operated with the invaders and Tulaji had no ally to befriend him. Various conjectures have been made as to the cause of the Peshwa's attitude towards Tulaji. It has been suggested that Tulaji had failed to send the annual tribute and had further insulted the Peshwa by mutilating his messenger. It has also been hinted that Tulaji was a cruel persecutor of the Chitpavan Brahmans and that Balaji Baji Rao was consequently actuated by strong feelings of revenge. But the apologists of Balaji Baji Rao conveniently forget that fifteen years before the joint Anglo-Maratha assault on Suvamadurg the Peshwa had provided for a Portuguese alliance against Angria in his treaty with that nation concluded at Poona in 1740. It should also be remembered that the docility of Manaji did not save him from unfair and unjust treatment. The Peshwa regarded the Angrias as possible rivals whose maritime power placed them in a position of special advantage. He could enforce his will on the Dabhades, on the Gaikwads and the Bhonslas, but the Angrias were beyond his reach. That was the sole reason of his alliance with the English. The English, of course, welcomed this opportunity of removing the only power who could challenge their supremacy of the sea; but the Peshwa gained practically nothing and only set a bad example to the other Maratha chiefs by co-operating with a foreign nation against one who claimed to be a subject of the Satara Raja.",

    "section": "The Fall of Tulaji and the Decline of the Angrias",
    "text": "The story of Tulaji's fall need not detain us long. Negotiations for an alliance between the Peshwa and the Governor of Bombay had been opened early in 1755, and a treaty was concluded on 29 March. But both allies had been busy with their military preparations and within three days of the conclusion of the pact Commodore James left Bombay with his fleet. Their first objective was Suvarna-durg, and a joint attack was promptly made. After very little resistance the fort capitulated on 3 April, but the Angria's fleet had already effected its escape. The Peshwa was eager to finish the war that year; but his fleet, though numerically considerable, was no match for that of Tulaji and he had to rely absolutely on the co-operation of the English squadron for the reduction of the Angria's naval stronghold. The English Commodore and his official superiors at Bombay were unwilling to expose their vessels to the fury of the monsoon and Gheria, the principal headquarters of Tulaji, was, therefore, left unconquered when the campaign of the year came to a close. The respite thus given to Tulaji enabled him to seek an ally. He applied for help to the Portuguese, who demanded a very heavy subsidy. Tulaji had no time to haggle and promptly paid a portion of the stipulated sum. On 5 November 1755, a treaty was concluded, by which the Viceroy undertook to send a reinforcement of five hundred men to Gheria. A Portuguese detachment had already been dispatched to the Angria's headquarters when an angry protest from the Peshwa reached Goa. The palmy days of Portuguese power in India had passed away and the Viceroy did not dare offend the mighty leader of the Maratha State. The reinforcement was, therefore, quickly recalled on a hollow excuse that deceived nobody, and Tulaji was left to his doom. He could not count even on his own servants, for we learn from a Maratha chronicle that Ramaji Mahadev had bribed most of them. This statement is corroborated by the little resistance that the garrison of Suvamadurg offered. Clive and Watson found the capture of Gheria as easy as James had found the reduction of Suvamadurg. Despairing of success, Tulaji left the fort, and the garrison, in the absence of their master, did not exert themselves to defend it. Edward Ives, an eyewitness, observes: 'The fort was so strong both by art and nature at the time we attacked it, that it might have held out a long time against all our efforts, had it been defended with any tolerable degree of skill and resolution.' The victors found in the fort two hundred and fifty pieces of cannon, six mortars, an immense quantity of stores and ammunition, one hundred thousand pounds sterling in silver rupees and about thirty thousand more in valuable effects; but the great fleet which for sixty years had terrorised merchant vessels in the Arabian Sea was reduced to ashes either by the fire of Watson's fleet, as the English reports state, or by its despairing master, as the Portuguese account suggests, before the garrison capitulated. The last days of Tulaji were spent as a prisoner of the Peshwa. After his death his sons managed to reach Bombay, but all trace of them was lost for a while. The Portuguese papers mention a Raghunath Angria, who was a captain in Hyder Ali's fleet. On August 3, 1800, one Raghuath Angria, who 'claimed to be a son of Tulaji, addressed a letter to the Bombay Government offering his services against the Peshwa. It will not be wrong to identify him with the captain of Hyder Ali's fleet.",

    "text": "After the fall of Gheria the Angria tradition was maintained, though feebly, by the Kolaba branch of the family. Manaji's vessels had taken part in the expedition against Janjira in 1758, and after his death in that year his son Raghuji assumed command of the fleet. Raghuji took part in the conquest of Hennery in 1760, and in 1778 captured a Portuguese sloop-of-war belonging to Diu, after which he concluded a treaty with the Government of Goa on terms of equality. As certain changes in these terms were suggested from Lisbon this treaty was not ratified; but it shows that Raghuji, like his father and grandfather, deemed himself competent to conclude treaties and alliances with foreign powers without any reference to the Peshwa. John McCluer, who surveyed the Malabar coast in 1787 and 1788, met Raghuji at his capital. He describes him as 'an arrant pirate who will make free with any vessel he can manage.' But he remarks that Raghuji 'behaves very civil to any English vessel that goes nigh Kenery' which was in his possession. As Raghuji may be rightly regarded as the last of the Angrias, we may here quote McCluer's account of his interview with the Chief of Kolaba. 'When we landed there was a numerous train to receive us, many of them Purvoes who spoke good English and no doubt carry on a regular correspondence with their friends at Bombay. We were shown to an open booth, near the gate of the fort, and there seated on a carpet till the great man came out. Some time before he made his appearance, his approach was noticed by the clashing of cymbals, and rattling of tomtoms. He came out in great state, attended with 100 armed men, whose arms were all covered with red clothes. At first I took them for sepoys that carried muskets. He received us very kindly, seemed very happy to see his 'friends,' as he called us, and asked a number of questions which I knew wanted no answers, as he seemed well informed of everything transacted in Bombay. After a discourse of about half an hour upon various subjects, we took our leaves of him, and at parting we were almost suffocated with perfumes, and drowned with rose water. Nor did his civility end here, for he ordered a boat to attend us to the vessel, with a tray of sweetmeats, which part of the ceremony I could have gladly dispensed with, as it entirely prevented my sounding between the shore and the vessel.' Though Raghuji could still indulge in the pomp and splendor associated with his house, its power vanished forever with Tulaji. His fleet no doubt still rode the sea and harassed merchantmen; but it was no longer a source of apprehension to any European power except the Portuguese. After Raghuji's death there was endless confusion in the small principality owing to the minority of his son and the ambition of his uncle.",

    "text": "It is uncertain at what date the Peshwas first cast their eyes towards the sea and decided to extend their authority in that direction. The treaty of 1713 left the best ports and harbours in the possession of Kanhoji Angria, and no mention is made of the Peshwa’s fleet either in the treaty concluded in January 1722 between Baji Rao and Francisco Jose de Sampaio C Castro or in the treaty of 1732 (1731-32 30 February) between Krishna Rao Mahadcv, Governor of Kalyan, and Martinho de Silveira de Menezes, Captain-General of the fortresses and lands of the North. But Baji Rao must have organised a navy sometime between this date and 1739, for reference is made to the Peshwa’s fleet in Baji Rao’s treaty with the English in 1739, as well as in the treaty of 1740-41 concluded between the Governments of Poona and Goa.\nBy 1750 the Peshwa’s fleet had also begun to exercise authority by sea like the older navy of the Angrias; for on 14 January 1751, Padre Angelo dos Serafins wrote from Goa to a friend in Portugal that in spite of the amity established between the two States by the treaty of Poona the Marathas did not desist from harassing Portuguese trading vessels at sea. In 1755 Edward Ives saw the Peshwa's fleet near the harbour of Bombay: ‘During my stay at Bombay two fleets of country vessels came into the bay: One of them belongs to the Nanna or prince of the Maharattas, the other to Monagee Angria, the brother of Angria the pirate: These vessels were not unlike the Tartans of the Mediterranean, only a great deal lower; they carried two guns in the bow, and a vast number of men. Each fleet consisted of about 30 sail.’ But this was not the total strength of the Peshwa’s fleet in the middle of the eighteenth century: It consisted of more than fifty vessels when it was sent to co-operate with Commodore James in the same year. As Commodore James complained of the cowardice of the Peshwa’s fleet; that it rendered him no assistance but only caused loss of time, we may assume that the Peshwa had not yet been able to enlist experienced seamen. His Admiral was Naro Pant who, according to Captain Low, had earned some distinction as a soldier on land, but had had no experience of the sea.",

    "text": "Naro Pant still held the chief command of the Peshwa's fleet when Balaji Baji Rao attempted to conquer Janjira after the reduction of Gheria. Gheria, however, had been reduced by the prowess of Watson and the machinations of Ramaji Mahadev and not by the valour of Naro Pant who preferred to lie behind whenever a bombardment was imminent. The Peshwa solicited English assistance in his attempts against Janjira, but here his interests were not identical with those of his late allies and they refused to fight the Sidi. Henery was reduced by the joint efforts of the Kolaba fleet and the Peshwa’s Navy, though the exact share of the latter in this achievement is not specifically recorded. It soon became evident that the Peshwa’s strength was very inadequate for the reduction of the Sidi's island and he applied for help to the Portuguese. The Portuguese welcomed the suggestion and were sanguine about their success. But when they appeared near the island, they found the English flag flying there. The Portuguese were annoyed; but were not prepared for a war with the English. Henery was, therefore, occupied by the Peshwa’s troops and a small squadron was stationed there, while the other island remained in possession of Raghuji Angria. The proximity of the two islands led, as McCluer informs us, to constant bickerings between the two chiefs about the division of the spoils.\nFoiled in their attempt against Janjira, the Peshwa’s fleet employed itself for the next fifteen years in their routine work of issuing passports and seizing ships that did not possess them. These duties could not always be effected without fighting: In 1763, for example, the Peshwa’s captains seized a Dutch ship off Anjidiv; they also took a Danish vessel, which was rescued later by a Portuguese squadron. The Portuguese themselves lost several boats, as Conde de Ega informed the home authorities in 1764. The Maratha fleet, he wrote, infested the sea and respected no nation except the English. They had in the previous year captured a Portuguese ship of Macao, a Pal belonging to Mozambique and some small vessels belonging to the traders of Portuguese India. Their losses might have been much heavier had the Maratha Admiral been better versed in the art of navigation, for both the north and the south-going Portuguese merchant fleets had been attacked by numerically superior Maratha squadrons. In 1767, a Maratha fleet of six Pals and fifty-four Gallivats attacked a Portuguese squadron of one Pal and four Manchuas convoying a big merchant flotilla near Gheria but after two hours obstinate fighting the Peshwa’s fleet had to retire. Gheria still continued to be a point of danger for merchant fleets, though its prestige had evidently much declined since the days of Sambhaji and Tulaji Angria.",

    "section": "Chapter XII: The Maratha Fleet Under the Peshwas (continued)",
    "text": "During the first Maratha war, the Peshwa's fleet caused some anxiety to the Bombay Government, who wrote thus to the Governor-General and Council: ‘As a considerable part of our marine force is employed at Bassora and in the Persian Gulf, we have at present not a sufficient marine force for the protection of our trade on the Coast of Malabar from the Maratha fleet, which; it is most probable, will attempt making some depredations on it,’ But actually little damage was done, and the Maratha fleet proved vastly inferior to that of its English opponents. Only two naval actions were fought during this war. The first took place in 1755 near Gheria. The frigate Revenge and the Bombay ghurab encountered the Maratha fleet near that port. The latter tried to flee, but one of their largest ships, the Shamsher Jang, was overtaken. After three hours' fighting the Maratha man-of-war blew up and the Captain perished with most of his crew. The second action, which was fought after the conclusion of peace, was lost by the English. The Ranger, a small brig of twelve guns, was conveying a number of high military officials from Bombay to Calicut, when it encountered the Maratha fleet under Anand Rao Dhulap, the best known, if not the ablest, of the Peshwa’s naval officers. The Maratha Admiral was ignorant of the termination of war, and the English Captain chose not to enlighten him. After a most stubborn fight the Ranger was captured and carried to Gheria, but not before the great majority of the men on board had been either killed or wounded. The Ranger was restored to the English Government as soon as Anand Rao Dhulap learnt of the conclusion of peace.\nIn 1787 the Maratha Government proposed an alliance with the Portuguese, soliciting their co-operation in naval engagements against Tipu’s fleet. This clearly shows that the Maratha fleet had not yet earned the full confidence of the Poona Government, and six years later when they planned for the last time the conquest of Janjira, they deemed it necessary to purchase the co-operation of their Portuguese neighbours. The last achievement of the Peshwa's fleet was the capture of Ximpis in 1791. The Portuguese Government had planned to forestall the Marathas and occupy the stronghold of Pito on their own account; but in the name of their protege the Raja of Sunda, Babu Rao Saloc (Salokhe), the Maratha Admiral, took possession of the neighbouring island of Ximpi with two big Pals of three masts, two Ghurabs and four Gallivats. As Ximpi was fortified both by nature and by art and was deemed almost impregnable, the Portuguese were greatly surprised at its speedy reduction by the Maratha fleet. After this the Maratha fleet proceeded to Onore, where it divided into two squadrons. One of these started for the north, while the other waited at the port with the intention of capturing a ship belonging to their enemy, Tipu Sultan. On the whole, it may be safely asserted that the record of the Peshwa's fleet was neither great nor glorious, and, while the Maratha horseman had left a reputation behind him, the existence of the Maratha sailor will hardly be suspected by the average student of Indian History. We have more precise knowledge about the internal administration of the Navy under the Peshwas than in the previous periods. The military head of the Navy was the Subhedar or Admiral. The first Admiral of the fleet, of whom we know nothing but the name, was Baji Rao Bekse: He was succeeded in office by his son Trmbak Rao in 1749-50. The Admiral then enjoyed a salary of 1,000 Rupees a year besides allowances in cash and kind which amounted to 186 Rupees in cash and 16 maunds of grain. Thirteen years later, however, we find that the revenue of some Mahals was granted to Anand Rao Dhulap for meeting the expenses of the fleet in which his pay and allowances were undoubtedly included. The civil administration of the fleet was at first vested in certain hereditary officers commonly styled...",

In 1765-66, therefore, a Karbhari and an Amin were appointed to supervise the civil administration of the fleet and the Admiral was also associated with them in this work. The Amin was generally responsible for the accounts, muster-rolls, purchase of provision, etc. Even this arrangement did not prove entirely satisfactory, and in 1781-82 the Darakhdars were recalled and Anand Rao became the undisputed civil and military head of the Peshwa's fleet. He was directed to fit out a fleet of three Pals, three Ghurabs and thirteen Gallivats, and to meet the expenses of the fleet from the revenue of the Mahals as well as from the income derived from prizes taken at sea.

McCluer visited the principal ports of the coast in 1787 and 1788 and has left a brief account of the Maratha and their method of attack: 'send', he tells us, '2 large ketches, with a number of gallivats to cruise; each gallivat carrying 80 to 90 men armed with lances, muskets, and stones. One carriage-gun is lashed down in their prows to the beams with strong ropes, so I suppose when the gun fires the vessel recoils with it.' Compare with this the accounts of Angria's and the method of attack left by Captain Anselm and Benjamin Hall fifty-three years previously, and will be seen to tally in every detail. The ships were similarly manned, similarly armed and similarly maneuvered for a century and a half while immense improvement was effected in naval engineering and naval strategy in the west.",

It is needless to say that if such orders were issued to Portuguese naval officers in the middle of the eighteenth century when the Portuguese naval power was undoubtedly on the wane, they had sent out their fleet in earlier times with the sole purpose of taking prizes. The Dutch Governor-General and the Council of India wrote to the Directors of the Dutch East India Company in 1668: “The Portuguese vessels are now mostly engaged in piracy: they principally attack ships belonging to Canara several of which had been brought to the port of Goa.” In the previous year the Portuguese Government had actually suggested to the Dutch that they should join their naval forces and make prize of Moorish ships in Indian waters, as such an enterprise would be immensely profitable. In 1682 Captain Smith of the Returne, while sailing from Bombay, obtained among others the following instruction: “Whereas the Portuguese have beene lately very insolent and were so bold as to fire at the Eagle; if you should meete with any of them offer noe affront or violence to them; but if they fire at you and assault you defend yourselfe the best you can.”\nBut the Portuguese were not the only nation who made use of their maritime power against weaker states and denied to them the right of free navigation. On 11 February 1664, the Dutch East India Company concluded a treaty with Adersia, Ruler and Chief of the Moors, in the countries under the Kalatry, by which they not only secured a monopoly of the spice trade of the country but also restricted the right of free navigation of Adersia’s people as the following significant Articles show:\n18. The Company shall have the right to submit all the coming and departing vessels to inspection.\n19. No vessel shall be allowed to leave any port under the government of Adersia without a pass from the Director of the Company at Cannanore.\n20. The passes will only be delivered on the recommendation of Adersia to prevent any pirates from obtaining them.\nHow the Dutch enforced their rights against other nations in the seventeenth century we do not precisely know, but it appears from an entry in the Bombay Public Consultations that in the second decade of the next century they had also started the profitable business of capturing and confiscating alien ships. They had seized some English vessels apparently without any just reason, and the Bombay Council sent a strong protest to the Council of Cochin against their action. The English East India Company’s officers also issued passports and insisted on the trading vessels of the country buying them. Khafi Khan thought that the English behaved much worse than the Portuguese on the sea, and the account left by Sir Thomas Herbert, who visited the East in the earlier part of the seventeenth century (his book was published in 1634), substantially corroborates the Muslim historian.",

In 1672 Peter Johnson, Captain of the frigate Revenge, brought a Calicut merchant ship as a prize to Surat, as it had no English pass, and in 1675 the English factors of Broach warned the Nakhodas of some Malabar vessels that unless they provided themselves with English passes, their ships would be regarded as good prize if any English ship met them on the sea. But in the same year the Carwar factors had to remonstrate with their superiors at Surat for the leniency shown to those delinquents who refrained from procuring their passes:\n“The owners of ships at Batticola and at other ports hard by make their braggs that the taking of their vessels chances so seldom and when Your Honour doth take them without a pass Your Honour doth only hinder them in their voyage by carrying them to Bombay and afterwards letting them go. But Your Honour doth use them so civilly there that they think their time very ill spent to desire a pass of us, and we know that if Your Honour etc.’s vessels should but look out with a vigilant eye would find a great many Batticola and other vessels that belongs to the adjacent places without any pass, how beneficial this would be to the keeping up our Honourable Masters’ credit here in these parts, which hath been much impaired now a dayes as to this particular we leave the negotiation to Your Honour etc.’s serious consideration.”\nThis remonstrance shows that English opinion in India was not in those days adverse to the seizure of unlicensed ships, but held it as a lawful exercise of sovereignty of the sea. Three years later, on 27 February 1668-69, Captain William Norgrave was given the following instructions:\n“We have appointed you upon the Hunter to transport Mr. George Bowcher to Callicut; to whom we have given instructions to direct you to examine all vessels for English passes, you shall meet with in your going down; and such as shall be found to have none, belonging to any port of the Malabar coast, to be secured and brought up to Bombay especially such as may belong to Allee Rajah or the Moors of Burgora, Cotta, Durmapatam or Billiapatam, or the natives of Porcat, taking great care in your acts of seizure, you govern yourself and men with that moderation, discretion and conduct as to discharge yourself with courage and reputation and with that uprightness and faithfulness as to forbear yourself and prevent your men from purloining or embezzling any of their goods etc., a full return of all things being intended back to the owners when we shall receive satisfaction for the several wrongs done us from those places.”\nIn this case the English authorities did not intend anything but what they considered just retaliation. The instructions of Sir John Gayer were generally lenient but did not repudiate the principle on which the Portuguese and the Dutch were acting.",

    "text": "On 28 May 1695, he told Captain Leonard Edgecombe: “If in your passage out or home you meet with any country ships demand to see their passes and if they have none threaten them hard what you will do to them if you meet them without again but let them by no means be abused by you or any of your company but if you find any English on board them that have not our orders for being there take them (away).” But Governor Boone upheld the prevailing practice when he detained the Shibar Khanderao belonging to a subject of Kanhoji Angria. In defence of his action he wrote to Angria: “Concerning the Shybar Canderow belonging to Trimbuckjee Meggee, you write that his goods and those of the Surat merchants are stopped; as Trimbuckjee is an inhabitant of this place and has his warehouses here, and always takes my pass for said Shybar, and this year without said pass pretended to go to sea, how could it be permitted? In the same manner all the merchants of Surat take my pass to carry on their trade, and if their goods were laded in this Shybar, was not I acquainted therewith? The vessels and their cargos that sail without a pass, both the Portuguese and you make prizes of, as you well know and when this vessel was taken without my pass, it was on the same penalty, yet I am not determined to do so.” Thus it is clear that the practice of controlling the navigation of the Arabian Sea by the maritime powers of Western India had been by common consent recognised as a lawful act, and although the greed and cupidity of naval officers had frequently led to misuse of the custom, there is no doubt that it originally arose from a much-felt need. The coast was in those days infested by numerous pirates. They could and did frequent the ports in the guise of inoffensive traders and assumed their true character only on the high seas when a suitable opportunity occurred. Such practice could to a certain extent be stopped by the issue of passes to genuine merchants, and the price demanded for these safeguards does not seem to have been very high. From the Portuguese cartazes to Maratha merchants it appears that the Goa Government demanded 20 Xerafins for each hundred Khandi of the cargo carried by the vessel. The duty of an English pass varied according to the distance of the destination; the fee for a pass from Broach to Surat was 4 Rupees, from Goa 2 Rupees and from Cambay 3 or 4 Rupees per Soo Candy. It was demanded in return for the service rendered by the government concerned to traders in general by policing the sea, and the payment was made without much demur; as Henry Grose tells us: “Towards defraying the charges of this marine, the company required of all the vessels trading in those seas, those of the other European nations excepted, to take the passes of the Bombay Government, for which a small consideration was granted; at which I never heard the least murmuring, the merchants duly sensible not only of the benefit their trade received from the English protection, but that this contribution was far short of the cost of it.” How much Angria or the Peshwa’s officers usually demanded for their passes we do not know, but there is no reason to suppose that the sum was excessive for no complaint of that nature has come down to us. From the references made by Portuguese and English writers to the practices of the times it appears that the Maratha fleet generally gave convoy to merchantmen sailing from their ports. Evidently, the purchasers of the Angria’s pass also received a return for their money. The Maratha captains did not in fact act differently from their brethren in the Portuguese, English",

The peculiar constitution of the feudal empire of the Marathas with 'its states within the state' led to 3 misconception of the political status of the Angria family particularly when were on un- fricndly terms with the Peshwa Thc inconsistencies resulting from the inalienable hereditary rights climed and exercised by each feudal family cused great confusion; and forcigncrs not familiar with such practices in their own country were naturally bewildered when found that Angriadid not respect the Peshwa' $ passports and the Peshwa'$ officers similarly took no noticc of any safeguard granted by Angria. This led themn to believe that Angria was nothing but a rcbel against his sovereign, and thc depredations which he committed on thc sea werc, therefore, regarded by them as acts of piracy.

Where financial interests are involved, a may be easily stretched and the slightest injury to a may convert it in the eyes of interested into a wreck: So a wreck had to be defined officially, and this was done Article 2 ofthe treaty, concluded between the Bonbay Government and Peshwa Madhav Rao I on I4 September I761. This provided that 'all assistance be afforded in future to any vessel or vesselsin distress,having English colours o passes, without subjecting the owners o proprietors thereof to any impediments under thc pretence of thcir being wrecks from the splitting of a sail, the brcaking of their masts O and such mis- fortunes; whereas no vessels are to be deemed wrecks but such as are driven ashore, and thcre break to picces by stress of weather when the Maharatta officer and the people of the vessels are to join in saving all that is possible, which must be lodged in secure ware- houses,andthen onc-halfof whatisso shall belong to Madarao and thc other halfto the owners'.

The Bombay authorities took compassion on the poor merchants and solicited the permission of their superiors at Surat to restore to them what little of their property had bcen saved. The reply of the Surat Council not only explains the prevalent custom but places before us its justifcation. The Surat authorities permitted the suggested restoration after deducting the expenses incurred by the Company in saving the property from the wreck: But observed that restoration of such property was 'contrary to the custome of most nations",

All customs, military, naval or administrative, are based on past experiences: In course of time they become antiquated and are then rejected But in the period of transition, before their anachronism is detected and before they arc finally abolished, they cause hardship and inconvenicnce. But it will not bejust to condemn as inhuman or heartless those who may administer such antiquated laws and pursue such out-of-date customs in a period of transition. The average man hardly perceives the absurdity of the institutions he inherits from his fathers. Such was also the case with the Maratha naval leaders. Judged by the standard of modern times, their actions will undoubtedly appcar high-handed, but they were simply obscrving in thcir daily official routine the Same practices as their European contemporaries in Western India: The freedom of the scas was an idea yet unknown. Bothon land and on sea might still constituted the best, if not the only, right: We should not forget that this was the age of Letters of Marque' and a King' $ Commis- sion Or letter patent formed the sole difference between piracy and privateering: Piracy was condemncd, but privateering was held honourable: One was expected to respect the rights of one's com- patriots, but common usage allowed little consideration for the rights ofthe forcigner on the high seas,and the more remote a naval captain was from his home, theless was he inclined to be hampered by inconvenient conventions In Indian waters the Portugucsc had set up a precedent which was probably based on customs prevailing on the coast. The precedent was followed by other nations, Euro- pean and Indian: They challenged the Portuguese claim to the sovereignty of the sea, but the principle of the sovereignty itself remained unchallenged. This led to the numerous controversies and inconsistencics that mark the naval history of the period.",

    "text": "But for these inconsistencics the Marathas alone were nOt responsible. Had their naval power survived, they might have continued Or abolished the antiquated claims they had once enforced. But as it is, they can hardly be condemned today as pirates. Like thc Portuguese naval commanders, Shivaji, Kanhoji Angria and Anand Rao Dhulap could also claim to bc sovereigns of the sea, but, saddled with a hercditary system of naval command and incapable of advancing with time, they failed to compete with their English rivals, and their naval efforts seem as ineffectual and ephemeral as the short-lived reign of terror established on thehigh seas by pirate chiefs of the west:\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nTHE MARATHA empire suffered from many maladies. The principal chiefs professed to serve the same mastcr and thc same State but, divided by personal jealousy, were scldom able to pursuc resolutely a concertcd plan or a coherent policy and common intcrests wcre frequently sacrificed to private ends. The irregular cavalry was slow to mobilise and not generally available for prompt action or prolonged services in distant parts and the personnel of the army, therefore, had to be largely changed; the non-Maratha recruits who replaced the Maratha horscmcn werc mercenaries of the worst type drawn by prospects of plunder and wcre not bound to thcir masters by racial O any other affinity: The policy of indiscriminate aggression for financial purposes initiated by Balaji Baji Rao led to incessant but incomplete nd ineffective invasions, which naturally left bitter memories in the harassed principalities; the Marathas thus made many enemies, who were not without means and motives of retaliation and who waited for favourable circumstances, while they had very few firm friends to rely upon in any serious emergcncy. The proved superiority of traincd sepoys commanded by European officers led to the employment of a nuber of military adventurers of diverse nationalities, unknown antecedcnts and doubtful charactcr . The great majority of these offcers were either English or French, and naturally sacrificed their masters' interests to those of their own and of their respective nations. Thc craze for trained battalions of infantry led the Maratha chieftains to undercstimate the value of cavalry which had formed in the past the greatest source of their strength Cavalry was, there- fore, neglected and allowed to degenerate: The Marathas had been familiar with artillcry and firearms, but neglected to learn thescienceand technique of theseinvaluable weapons and continued till thcir final overthrow to rely for their supplies on the European settlements at Bombay and Goa. Nor was this all, the last decade of the cightecnth century found the Marathas without any able militaryleader, and it was no wonderthat the ill-led, ill-organised, ill-equipped and ill-disciplined hordes with irreconcilable methods of fighting wcre easily discomfited and routed by Wellington and Lake.",

    "text": "The first stcp in the Wrong direction was the revival of feudalism. Shivaji knew the defects of Maratha character better than any of his predecessors OI successors, and he deliberately set himself to undo the evils of that disintegrating system: He found his country- men divided by mnutualjealousy andinherited rivakry andleft them fairly united under a ruler of their own race with a national banncr and a common object to strivefor. But his success was by no means complete: Even in his lifetime onc ofhis principal ministers, Niraji Raoji, served as an agent of the English East India Company at his court. Though the rivalry of Moro Trimbak Pingle and Annaji Datto did not find expression in any overt act of hostility while their great master was alive, lesser officials did not hesitate to let their private feelings colour their public acts When the Subhedar of Chaul quarrelled with the English of Bombay, seized theic ships and threatened to stop their supply of fuel and provisions from the mainland, his colleague, the Subhedar of Kalyan, encouraged the English by every means in his power and assured them of his friend- ship and support. It was, therefore, obviously necessary that the anti-feudal policy, so wisely initiated by Shivaji, should have been vigorously pursued by his succeSsors, but unluckily it was aban- doned by them. Feudalism was revived under unusual circumstanccs, first for the dcfence and later for the expansion of the Maratha kingdom, and it certainly served its immediatc purpose The Mughals were permanently expelled from Maharashtra, and the Marathas soon afterwards penctrated into Gujarat and Malwa. But in the very prosperity of the Maratha empire lay the germs of its degeneration, decline and decay. Whilc engaged againsta power- ful external enemy, the Maratha generals could be cxpected to forget for the time their private differences, but hardly was that crisis over when they recklessly prosecuted their quarrels, oblivious of everything clse. The Mughal hordes of A urangzib found them resolutely united, but the triumph of the Maratha cause was long before marred by the ugly spectacle of Shantaji and Dhanaji engaged in a war of extermination: The crisis that culminated at Panipat rallicd the Maratha chiefs to the Peshwa' s banner; but the forces of disunion did not take long to assert themselves, and Bhonsla and Gopal Rao Patwardhan openly ranged themselves with the Nizam, the hereditary enemy of the Maratha empire: The inexcusable insult offered to the Peshwa and Nana Fadnavis helped to bring together the principal chiefs at Kharda, but soon afterwards followcd suicidal civil war which offered the English an effective opportunity of firmly establishing thcir suzerainty in India.",

Raghoba, fearing the reduction of his importance in the North due to peace, preferred to remain under English protection despite the risk of becoming a puppet leader like Muhammad Ali. This highlights a period where personal interests often overshadowed national honor and independence, partly because the concept of nationality was still nascent. High officials, such as Bahiro Pant Mehendale and Naro Ram Mantri, did not hesitate to serve as agents for foreign powers like the Portuguese, openly receiving rewards for their services. This era saw the Maratha chiefs failing to exploit their opponents' differences due to a lack of unity and effective diplomacy. For instance, during the First Maratha War, the Marathas fought within their territories while leaving English areas undisturbed, and potential aggressive moves like an invasion of Bengal from Nagpur were never realized due to personal interests overriding collective military strategy.",

The expansion of the empire across the Narmada worsened these issues, as newer generations like Daulat Rao Sindhia and Jaswant Rao Holkar, though Marathas by birth, lacked a deep connection to their homeland in the Deccan. This disconnection fostered a broader cleavage within the empire, making it difficult to maintain unity and coherence. Feudalism not only caused dissension among different principalities but also within ruling families themselves, leading to internal conflicts and weakening their collective military capabilities. Notably, during the First Maratha War, internal family conflicts in Nagpur and Baroda coincided with the larger conflict, further destabilizing the empire. The Second Maratha War saw similar divisions, with significant figures like Daulat Rao Sindhia lacking the military and political foresight necessary for leadership, contributing to the empire's eventual downfall.",

    "text": "would also permanently settle in the country and the rest of their lives in the service of those who treated them so well and generously. In this expectation, if it was ever entertained, they were sadly disappointed; not only the English subjects in Sindhia's army but the great majority of French officers also accepted the Governor-General's offer and deserted Daulat Rao when their services were needed most; while Pohlman, a German who was present at Assaye, behaved so despicably that Sir John Fortescue feels inclined to suspect disloyalty. The Marathas made a serious mistake in entrusting the defence of their empire to foreigners, and heavily did they pay for their mistake. The employment of European officers involved a serious change in the Maratha army. Their method of fighting was fundamentally opposed to the Maratha military traditions. Whether those two opposite methods could be profitably combined remains a doubtful question, but it is unanimously agreed that the Maratha military leaders never made a serious effort to find a satisfactory solution, and both at Panipat and at Assaye their discomfiture was largely due to their attempts to reconcile their old tactics with those they had recently introduced in their army but had not assimilated. In the meantime, their reliance on trained infantry had led them to neglect their cavalry, and two competent military critics like Sir Thomas Munro and Sir John Fortescue agree that the defeat of Assaye was due to the degeneration of Maratha cavalry.\nSir Thomas Munro wrote to his brother on 12 February 1804: 'I calculated, at the opening of the campaign, two years for the complete conquest of all the possessions of Scindia and the Berarman. I thought their cavalry would have shown a little more enterprise; but they ruined it and destroyed its spirit, by teaching the troopers that they did not depend upon cavalry, but upon infantry. By coming forward with regular infantry, they gave us every advantage we could desire. They opposed to us men that never could be made so good as our own, from the want of a national spirit among the officers, and of the support of European battalions; and trusted the success of the war to the event of close engagements. More credit has been given to the firmness of their infantry than it deserved. They seem to have made but little opposition, except during the short time our army was forming, and to have relied more upon their artillery than their musketry, as is proved by our horse having suffered little loss, unless by round and grape-shot.'\nSir John Fortescue's criticism is not so detailed, but he is equally positive about the mistakes made by the Marathas. 'Had Pohlman done his duty,' he remarks, 'he might at least have embarrassed Wellesley greatly; and if the Mahratta cavalry had behaved with even a show of spirit, the issue would have been certainly doubtful, and most probably disastrous to the British arms.' The degeneration of cavalry was also due to the departure from Shivaji's practice. Had the Peshwas continued to replace the Silhedar force by state-paid and state-equipped horse, the efficiency of their cavalry would certainly have been maintained. But the revival of feudalism naturally encouraged the employment of Silhedars, who were unwilling to risk their horses which formed their professional capital. At last, even the Jahgirdars began to hire horses for their personal cavalry, as we learn from Sir Thomas Munro. 'A great part of the horses employed in the Mahratta armies,' he wrote, 'are the property of men who do not belong to the military profession. Many of the wealthy inhabitants, most of the despandes, dessyes, and other hereditary civil officers of the villages, and many even of the most substantial rayets, breed horses for the armies. They send them to the field mounted by their own domestics and labourers, and hire them to the jagheerdars or the Government. They are horse-dealers rather than soldiers.' It is no wonder that untrained men mounted on hired steeds proved of little use in actual fighting.",

    "section": "CONCLUSION (continued)",
    "text": "If some defects of their military system were due to feudalism, others must be associated with the intellectual limitations of the Marathas. They readily adopted new arms but did not reject the old ones. While in Europe the crossbow was replaced by the longbow, the longbow by hand-guns, the hand-guns by matchlocks, and matchlocks by firelocks, in the Maratha army and the Maratha fleet muskets, bows and stones were simultaneously in use. During the hundred and fifty years under review the Marathas borrowed freely from their European neighbours but failed to make any contribution to military science either in strategy or in weapons. Yet they were not intellectually deficient; the failure, therefore, must be attributed to defects in education. The Maratha Government did not recognise their responsibility of public instruction. Distinguished Brahman scholars and physicians of all castes and creeds were encouraged by liberal grants of rent-free lands and pensions, but private individuals were generally left to equip themselves as best they could for the professions of their choice. The great majority of the upper classes joined the army; they learnt to fight, but there was no systematic arrangement for any instruction in the science of war. Fighting was more or less a matter of experience, and the general education that was then available consisted wholly of cultural training in literature, grammar, politics, logic and philosophy. There was no treatise on the science of war, and if we except a single chronicle, that dealing with the campaign of Panipat, there was no record of the military experience of the Maratha generals. An officer never retired from service and had therefore no leisure for writing about the theories and practice of war. His experience was, therefore, lost to posterity and only his near relatives, who had the fortune of serving with him, could profit by his teaching, and these could not always be expected to supply the best or the aptest pupils. The progress that Europe was making in the eighteenth century in theoretical science was absolutely unknown to the Indians of that age, and no Maratha chief ever attempted to master the superior military and nautical science of the west as Peter the Great did. The Maratha officers began their military careers too early, were much too tied to the time-honoured system to learn anything new and generally died early; if some of them had the good luck of attaining a ripe old age, they were too busy with their annual expeditions to leave a written account of their campaigns, and their limited education hardly qualified them for such work. At the same time the Maratha nobility had lost the simplicity of life that characterised their ancestors of Shivaji's time. What was condemned as an inexcusable vice by the founder of the Maratha kingdom was regarded as a necessity of life by his successors in the latter part of the eighteenth century. When the Peshwa's agent urged Tukoji Holkar to prohibit the sale of alcohol in his camp, he protested that alcohol was a necessity of life and soldiers could not be expected to dispense with it. Shivaji never allowed 'whores and dancing wenches' in his army. Govind Pant Bundele had to send handsome dancing-girls from Hindustan for the Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao. The degeneration was thus all-round and complete. The State degenerated from a national monarchy to a feudal confederacy, the army degenerated from a well-disciplined national force to an ill-disciplined band of mercenaries, and the military leaders degenerated from simple hardy soldiers to ease-loving voluptuaries. There could be but one result of such a general-sided decline both moral and material. A military empire cannot long survive its military efficiency and unfortunately for the Marathas their rivals were endowed with those very qualities which they themselves lacked. The English were imbued with a strong sense of patriotism, combined individual self-sacrifice with national ambition, their army was well-disciplined and scientifically trained, their generals were masters of military science; and the badly led, badly armed and badly organised feudal army of the Maratha empire had to relinquish the unequal contest after a brief struggle. The Maratha chiefs were compelled to acknowledge their failure after two short wars, the Peshwa was pensioned off, the Bargirs converted their sword-blades into ploughshares, peace was restored throughout the length and breadth of India and the Maratha empire became a far-off memory.",

    "text": "Aftabgir (or Aftabgiri, Aftagir) 'This sun screen (aftab, sun; gir, root of giriftan, to take), shaped like an open palm-leaf fan, was also called suraj-mukhi (Hindi, literally, sun-face). Among the Moghul rulers it could only be granted to royal princes (Mirat-ul-Istilah, fol. 3). In the eighteenth century, however, the Mahrattas adopted it as one of their commonest ensigns, and even the smallest group of their cavalry was in the habit of carrying one:' Irvine, The Army of the Indian Moghuls, p. 34.\nAlvara Charter or prince's letters-patent. Lacerda, A New Dictionary of the Portuguese and English Languages, P. 65.\nAmin The word is Arabic Amin, meaning a \"trustworthy person\" and then an inspector, intendant, Hobson Jobson, P 17.\nArrack This word is the Arabic arak properly 'perspiration' and then first the exudation or sap drawn from the date (arak al-tamar); secondly, any strong drink, *distilled spirit' essence etc. In India it is applied to a variety of common spirits; in S. India to those distilled from the fermented sap of sundry palms; in E. and N. India to the spirit distilled from cane-molasses, and also to that from rice. Crooke, Hobson Jobson, P. 36.\nBalparveshi (A compound of bal, child, and parwardan, to rear or foster:) 'A pension or maintenance granted by a Government to the family of a soldier or servant who died in its service. Molesworth, A Dictionary__Marathi and English, P. 579.\nBania Merchant, a man of the trading caste.\nBazar Market.\nBeldar Lugare-Beldar, a wandering caste of quarrymen. They are strong and dark and the men wear the moustache and top-knot: They speak Marathi. They are stone-cutters and bricklayers, digging wells, blasting rocks, and breaking stones. Their houses are like those of cultivating Marathas. The men wear the loin cloth, waist cloth, and short tight trousers or cholnas, the jacket, and the Maratha turban; and the women dress in the ordinary Maratha robe and bodice and do not tuck the end of the robe back between the feet. They eat fish and flesh and drink liquor. They are hard working, orderly, and hospitable but fond of drink. They have caste councils, do not send their boys to school, and are a steady people earning enough to maintain themselves.\" Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Vol. XX, PP: 91-2. Lugadu means a robber or plunderer. Beldar Lugare, therefore, stands for a plunderer of the Beldar caste.\nBildar The same as Beldar, but when used in relation to the army the word means a digger or pioneer. See Hobson Jobson, p. 94; Irvine, The Army of the Indian Moghuls, Pp: 173-4.\nBhaldar-Mace-bearer: 'An attendant on great men who waits with a wand in his hand--an usher.

Peshkash _ 'Persian Pesh-kash.Wilson interprets this as literally 'first fruits' . It is used as an offering or tribute but with many and technical senses which will be found in Wilson, &.g., 3 fine on appointment, renewal, or investiture; a quit-rent, & payment exacted on lands formerly rent-free, or in substitution for service no longer exacted; sometimes : present to a great man, or (loosely) for the ordinary Government demand on land:' Hobson Jobson, P. 701.

See Moreland, From Akbar to Aurangzib, P. 286. Rojnura Wages. Ramoshi claim descent from Ram, who they say created them when he passed through the Deccan to Ceylon: Their rites, ceremonies, and home speech seem to show a Telegu origin: are divided into Chavans and Jadhavs. Like Kunbis they eat fish, fowls, and the flesh of goats and deer, and differ little from them in house, dress, or customs. They have a bad name for committing thefts, burglaries and gang and highway robberies, and stealing cattle and crops. Their children are petty thieves and robbers. They act as watchmen and in return for their services hold rent-free lands and receive grain allowances. Some are labourers and others husbandmen. Their favourite village god is Khandoba, but they worship the usual Brahmanic gods and goddesses. Their priests are ordinary Brahmans. They practise bigamy and have to pay for their wives. They bury their dead:' Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Vol. XXIV, p. 107. Saranjam Lands held in surinjam involve the condition of military service; the term is of Persian origin, meaning \"furniture\" or \"apparatus\" imply- ing that the lands are to defray the expense of equipment: in fact Surinjam is synonymous with military Jagheer:\" Sykes, Special Report on the Statistics of the Four Collectorates of Dukhan under the British Government, P. 286. Sartandel Officer superior to Tandel, Serang S A native boatswain, or chief of a lascar crew; the skipper of a small native vessel ' Hobson Jobson, p. 812. Shikkdari A shikkdar is a revenue collector of a small subdivision. Shik- kdari is an abwab levied by a Shikkdar. Shutarnal Shutarnal, Zamburak, Shahin. These words seem all three to refer to the same weapon, what we should call a swivel-gun or wall-piece: Shutarnal is literally \"camel-gun barrel\" and denotes the fact that these were sometimes carried on and fired from camels' backs. Zamburak is derived from Zambur, a bee or wasp, with a diminutive added, and thus means \"a little wasp\", probably in allusion to its sound when fired, or its power of stinging or wounding: Shahin literally 'falcon\" seems a later name for the same thing; a name which was brought into India by Nadir Shah: Irvine, The Army of the Indian Moghuls, Pp 135-6. Tandel Malayal Tandal. Telugu, Tandclu. The head or commander of a body of men; but in ordinary specific application a native petty officer of lascars\n, whether on board ship (boatswain) or in the ordinance department, and sometimes the head of a gang of labourers on public works: Hobson Jobson , p. 923.

    "text": "In the annals of history we come across a few outstanding men and women whose life and work stand out as beacons to succeeding generations, summoning them to endeavour and achievement. One such person is Chhatrapati Shivaji, to whose memory a grateful nation paid reverential homage on the occasion of the tercentenary of his coronation. Though the times in which he lived were vastly different from our own, the values of personal integrity, patriotism, religious tolerance and public welfare which he cherished and promoted are very much valid even today. Public administrators have especially much to learn from this noble ruler of men, whom his guru Ramdas aptly described as “the high mountain of determination, the support of many people, unflinching in his ideals and rich in asceticism”.\n\nDeeply rooted in the glorious traditions of India’s ancient past, Shivaji was nevertheless innovative, pragmatic and even modern in his outlook and in his plans. He borrowed his administrative ideas from the ancient Indian writers on polity as well as from the contemporary practitioners of the art of government. But his practical statesmanship and constructive genius lay in the manner in which he successfully blended tradition with modernity and devised a novel system of administration suited to his times and his people. In this system, the pivot was the king himself who ruled as well as reigned. He was the supreme executive, the supreme law maker and even the supreme judge. Being all in all, the ancient Indian aphorism that the king is the moulder of his age fitted him like a glove. At the same time, he was a great upholder of Dharma in the most noble sense of that expression; and the weal of the common people, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, was the mainspring of all his actions. He threw careers open to talent and held his umbrella of protection and patronage over all his subjects alike. In an age of bigotry and ruthlessness Shivaji radiated tolerance and compassion; and even today, after three centuries, we are struck by the width of his outlook and the breadth of his vision. Jadunath Sarkar rightly described him as “the greatest constructive genius of medieval India” and says that the memory of men like him remains “an imperishable historical legacy for the entire human race to animate the heart, to kindle the imagination and to inspire the brain of succeeding ages to highest endeavours”.\n\nAs a part of the Coronation Tercentenary celebrations, the Maharashtra Regional Branch of the Indian Institute of Public Administration organised a series of lectures dealing with various facts of the many-splendoured achievements of Shivaji. These lectures, which were delivered by well-known scholars, attracted large audiences and were extremely well received. A suggestion was made to us that the lectures should be published in the form of a book so that a wider readership could benefit from it. We readily agreed; and the outcome is this slim volume which we are now placing in the hands of our readers.",

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Appropriately, these lectures commence with a masterly survey of the life and times of Shivaji by Shri Setu Madhava Rao Pagadi, whose biography of the Chhatrapati released at Raigad on the tercentenary of the Coronation is a very valuable and a most recent contribution to the literature on the subject. Describing Shivaji’s career as “an extraordinary story of expanding visions”, Shri Pagadi observes : “It was not as if he saw a vision in early childhood and then struggled for its attainment throughout his life. I believe that as he took one step, the next step became clear to him, and so he progressed, defeating the Jagirdars, securing the forts, annexing the Adilshahi territories, raiding the Mughal provinces and finally proclaiming himself Chhatrapati.... The seed which he planted in the soil of Maharashtra eventually grew into a huge banyan tree with branches sprawling far and wide; and within less than a century the Maratha influence was felt throughout the length and breadth of this vast country”.\n\nNext in this series is a lucid paper by Shri J. V. Naik of the Department of History, University of Bombay. Shri Naik expounds the idea that “the foundation of Swarajya was a composite movement caused by the interaction of various forces which had long been at work in Maharashtra. But it was left to the supreme genius of Shivaji to canalize all the available forces into one patriotic current and to establish an independent Maratha nation-State”. Of special interest is the section in which Shri Naik explains what Shivaji owed to his father Shaliaji in the establishment of Swarajya, Shri S. R. Tikekar, well-known journalist and historian, narrates the story and significance of Shivaji’s Coronation which was performed “in full accordance with similar ceremonies as described in the Ramayana or the Mahabharat”. It symbolised “an act of deliverance, bringing great hope and cheer”, and Tikekar compliments both Gaga Bhatt and Shivaji for this epoch-making event.",

    "text": "Dr. C. M. Kulkarni, who heads the Department of History at the University of Bombay, has contributed an erudite paper on the ideals and institutions of Swarajya. Describing Shivaji as “an untiring carrier-forward of the torch of the immortal values and traditions of our ancient heritage”. Dr. Kulkarni explains how the Swarajya was “the dharmarajya well organised with saptanga, all the seven limbs functioning efficiently and harmoniously towards the realisation of the ideal of the maximum welfare of the subjects”.\nThe concluding lecture by Dr. M. S. Agaskar deals with the place of Swarajya in Indian History. After delineating the cardinal principles of the new social and political order established by Shivaji, Dr. Agaskar observes that the departure from these principles in later Maratha history “broke up its organised unity and ultimately led to its dismemberment and dissolution”. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to our learned guest-speakers for the time and talent bestowed by them on these lectures. The brunt of the responsibility for the organisation of the lectures fell on Shri D. K. Kulkarni, Research Officer, of the Maharashtra Regional Branch of the Indian Institute of Public Administration. I would like to place on record the gratitude of the Institute to Shri Kulkarni and my deep appreciation of his excellent performance.

    "text": "Longman for the elegance of this publication and for the promptitude with which it was produced. Our own efforts we shall consider amply rewarded, if students, teachers and general readers find this book interesting and useful. V. Subramanian Honorary Secretary 141, Sachivalaya, Indian Institute of Public Administration Bombay 400 032 Maharashtra Regional Branch Tbe Life and Times of Chfaatrapati Siiivaji Maharaj SETU MADHAVA RAO PAGADI I ' ' There are a nitmber of people in our country who have mental reservations about the importance of the study of Shivaji and the Marathas for a general student of Indian history. There is indeed a school of thought which takes a dim view of Shivaji’s achieve- ments in an all-India context. He is looked upon as the leader of a particular community and of a small region. Like Rana Pratap he is credited with heroism and gallantry; but it is urged that he was going against the main current of Indian history which was in favour of the hegemony of a single central power controlling the destinies of the country from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. While Ashoka, Akbar and Aurangzeb (and later the British) strove to establish an Indian empire, Shivaji, it is said, attempted to reverse that tide. But Shivaji initiated a movement, and to appreciate the wide ramifications of that movement, we must view the Maratha period of Indian history as a whole. In the 17th century, the Mughal empire covered a major portion of India from the province of Kabul in the north to Trichinopoly in the south; from Gujarat in the west to the very outskirts of Assam in the east. The writ of the Mughal emperor ran in every part of the country. But in 1719, within twelve years of the mighty Aurangzeb’s death, the Maratha militia entered Delhi and marched in the main thoroughfares of the Mughal capital. By 1740 the Marathas held sway over Malwa and Bundelkhand; in 1751 they overran Orissa and levied chauth on Bengal and Bihar; in 1757 they captured Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat, and in 1758 we find them subjugating the Pimjab and planting the Maratha banner on the fort of Attock; * The stories of the successive tri- umphs of Maratha arms read like romantic tales from the Arabian Nights; but they are neveithele^s true. The Marathas took upon 2 SHTVAn AND SWARAJYA themselves the responsibility of fitting the foreign foes. They liberated North Konkan from the occupation of the Portuguese, and laid down their lives on the battle-field of Panipat to drive out the raiders from Afghanistan. In 1784 the Mughal Emperor himself came under the protection of Mahadaji Shinde, and from 1784 to 1803 the Maratha flag fluttered prou^y on the ramparts of Delhi’s Red Fort. As Forrest observes, it was only with the battle of Assai in 1803 that the supremacy over India passed to the British. If Shivaji had not been born, and if the Maratha revolution had not swept away the debris of the Mughal empire in the 18th century, the course of Indian history would probably have run on different and disastrous lines. The European traders would perhaps have parcelled out ixwrtions of India among them- selves a hundred years earlier. It was Shivaji who gave the Marathas supreme self-confidence and inspired successive generations to deeds of courage and valour. Yet he has been the victim of much misinformed and biased writing. He has been described as a petty chieftain and a rebel against the established order, and also as a champion of Hindu India, bitterly anti-Muslim. It is therefore necessary that we should clear these misunderstandings and arrive at a proper estimate of Shivaji’s role in Indian history.",

Amongst the biographies in English are those written by Chintamanrao Vaidya, Jadunath Sarkar, Bal Kjishna, H. G. Rawlinson, Dennis Kincaid, V. B. Kulkarni and D. F. Karaka. In Marathi we have the works of G. S. Sardesai, K. A. Keluskar. V. K. Bhave, D. V. Kale, B. M. Purandare, T. S. ShejwaUcar and V. S. Bendre. There is still scope for further research and for bringing out a comprehensive biography of Shivaji, as a considerable amount of contemporary source material is now available for that purpose in the Marathi, Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, English, Portuguese, French and Dutch languages. In Marathi we have the Bakhar literature. An outstanding specimen of it is the Sabhasad Bcdzhar, written by Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad within about 15 years of Shivaji’s death. The 91-Qalmi Bakhar and the Chitnis Bakhar, however, are later works. The THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ ‘3 family of Kanhoji Jedhe has left behind the Jedhe Karina and the Shakavali, which is a chronology of events of Shivaji’s times written by his contemporaries. Shivaji’s court poet Paramanand wrote a biography of his patron and master in Sanskrit, entitled Shivabharat. It yields considerable material of rich historical value. Jayaram Pindye’s Parnala Parvata Grahanakhyanam which gives an account of the capture of Panhala by Shivaji in 1673 and another work, Shivaraja Rajyabhisheka Kalpataru, which describes the coronation of Shivaji, are two other contemporary works in Sanskrit which deserve our study. The Raja Vyavahara Kosh, or the Deccani-Sanskrit glossary of administrative terms compiled by Raghunath Pant at the instance of Shivaji, throws light on the civil and military esta- blishments of Shivaji. The Jaipur State Archives have yielded valuable source material about Shivaji’s visit to Agra in the form of letters written by Rajput Officers in the Dingal dialect, which is the Rajasthani variety of Hindi. These letters, which have been edited by Prof. Jadunath Sarkar and Dr. Raghubir Singh, faithfully report the day-to-day news from the imperial capital during the period that Shivaji was incarcerated there. ' In comparison with any other language, the wealth of source material available in Persian for a study of Shivaji’s times is indeed vast; and any student of Maratha history would be well-advised to learn Persian in sheer self-interest. Among the works compiled by Shivaji’s contemporaries at the Court of Ali Adilshah of Bijapur are Nurulla’s Tarikh-i-Ali and Nusrati’s AJimma which give an account (the latter in Deccani Hindi or Urdu) of the various battles fought by Shivaji. Muhammad Kazim, the official biographer of Emperor Aurangzeb, has written a book of 1500 pages entitled AJamgir-nama, in which he has given a detailed history of the first ten years of Aurangzeb’s reign. But the draft of the book had to be submitted for approval to the Emperor, who read every line of it. Consequently, all those episodes which ended in disgrace to the Mughals have either been conveniently left out of the des- cription Or considerably underplayed in this book. Tie sack of Surat has not been mentioned at all and the Shaista KJiUn cam- paign has been dismissed te'' three wcwrds—^‘MamJa ua bast’. Muhammad Kazfm tells lis’thfet Shaista Khan’s campaign a^inst 4 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Shivaji did not quite succeed; hence Aurangzeb decided to send Mirza Raja Jai Sin^ in his place. And that is about all 1 An important history in Persian is Saqi Mustaid Khan’s Masir- i-AIamgiri.yfbich. was completed within a year of Aurangzeb’s death. . Bhimsen Saksena’s Jarikh-i~Dilkusha and Khali Khan’s Muntakhab-ul-Lid>ab are also valuable works, as the authors lived in the Deccan during Aurangzeb’s times. Some allowance has, of course, to be made for the anti-Shivaji bias of writers like Mu- hammad Kazim, Saqi Mustaid Khan and Khafi Khan just as we must take cognisance of the fact that the authors of contemporary Marathi and Sanskrit works were dazzled by the achievements of Shivaji and credit him with supernatural powers and feats. Another important source of information in Persian is the Akhbarat or court newsletters which are available in a copious stream, and have fortunately been preserved at Bikaner in the Jaipur State Archives. We also have several important letters written by historical personages. About 200 letters issued from Shivaji’s Secretariat have been^foimd, and’nearly 50 of them, which carry the legend ‘Ajrakhtkhane Shivaji Raje’, were written prior to his coronation.",

    "text": "A mass of English records is available in the archives of the Bombay Secretariat, which has about 12 lakh files covering the history of the last 300 years. You can find there the minutes of meetings held at Bombay Castle which throw a flood of light on contemporary events. Thus we come to know that in 1678 Shivaji threatened to burn the ships of the Siddi at Mazgaon; and the British were faced with the problem of what their attitude should be. The Home and Political Department files containing the correspondence of the British with the Marathas have also since been duly catalogued and published in three volumes edited by Dr. V. G. Dighe and Dr. P. M. Joshi. Several European travellers have left accounts of the Maratha country during Shivaji’s time. By far the most interesting among them is Storia do Mogor, which is the autobiography of an Italian named Niccolao Maniwci, who came to Surat around 1656 and died in this country in about 1717. He was in the employ of Mirza Raja Jai Singh during the latter’s expedition against Shivaji. His book contains a picture of Shiv^qi drawn by Mir Muhammad who was an employee of the Mugtol Prince Muazzam. William Irvine has translated Manucci’s voluminous work into English. The Portuguese records of Shivaji’s time are also useful for an understanding of his military, naval and diplomatic activities. Prof. Panduranga Pissurlencar has done considerable research into these papers and brought out a scholarly work on the rela- tions between the Portuguese and the Marathas. Further, we have the contemporary records of the Dutch, which were removed to Amsterdam and lay there for two centuries until they came to the notice of scholars. It is to the Dutch that we owe one of the most authentic portraits of Shivaji. The papers were sent to Holland; the picture was etched out and sent to England where Orme noticed it. The Dutch records have also been helpful for fixing certain dates. To give an instance, the Dutch had a factory at Hyderabad, and one of the clerks in their factory, while closing bis account for the day on the 4th March 1677, recorded in the ledger book : ‘Today Shivaji met Qutb Shah in Dad Mahal’. A rich heritage of documents and other source material in various languages is thus available for a detailed study of Shivaji’s life and times. Let us now consider the situation in Maharashtra before Shivaji’s birth. The sixteenth century was a period of constant instability and violent change in the Deccan. The offshoots of the Bahamani kingdom were engaged in continuous internecine strife when the armies of Emperor Akbar swooped dovm on Maha- rashtra towards the close of that century. In 1596 the Mughals annexed Berar; in August 1600 they capured the fort of Ahmed- nagar and in 1601 annexed Khandesh. It appeared that the Nizam- shahi kingdom had come to an end; but just then Akbar had to return to the north, and died there in 1605. His son Jahangir resumed the war of conquest in the Deccan; but his forces were successfully kept at bay till 1626 by the astute Malik Ambar on behalf of Sultan Hizamshah. It was in the course of this war that Shivaji’s father Shahaji Bhonsale and other Maratha captains came into prominence as the lieutenants of Malik Ambar, who trained them in the tactics of guerilla warfare. The Marathas were waiting for such an opportuiuty and they readily joined the fray with their infantry and light cavalry. As Sayid Ahmed Tabatabai, an immigrant from Persia who joined the service of the Nizamshah and became 6 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA his official, mentions in his book Burhan-i-Masir, the Maratha bargirs were comparable to the Uzbeks in sheer bravery and endurance. They were therefore highly prized by the Sultanates of the Deccan as well as by the Mughals. Prominent among the Maratha chieftains was Lakhuji Jadhav of Sindkhed (the maternal grandfather of Shivaji), who entered the service of the Mughals in 1620 with a mansab of nearly 24,000 for himself and his de- pendents. In 1629, Lakhuji, his two sons and a grandson were treacherously murdered by the Nizamshah.",

    "text": "Shahaji Bhonsle, after leaving the Nizam-shahi service, joined the Mughals as a Mansabdar of 5000. However, in 1632, he rebelled against the Mughals, seizing a vast territory. He even set up a puppet Nizamshah and raided Mughal territories.  Under pressure from Shah Jahan in 1635, Shahaji was forced to leave Maharashtra and establish a new barony in Karnataka, though retaining his Poona jagir, which he entrusted to his young son, Shivaji. Shahaji's defiance of the Mughals instilled in Shivaji a confidence that influenced his later ambitions. While Shahaji's goal was to be a kingmaker, Shivaji aspired to kingship himself.  The claim that saints and poets of 13th-17th century Maharashtra roused social and political consciousness, preparing the ground for Shivaji's independent state, is disputed. While saints like Dnyaneshwar, Tukaram, and Ramdas strengthened Hindu faith, their contribution to political consciousness was limited, with the possible exception of Ramdas. Shivaji, through his actions, created this consciousness. The Maratha elite of the time, including Jadhavs, Nimbalkars, Desais, and Mores, did not support Shivaji's movement.  Chandrarao More, a loyal vassal of the Adilshah, actively opposed Shivaji.  The Deshmukhs and Deshpandes also had vested interests in the existing order. The general populace remained apathetic. Neither economic disaster nor high political consciousness, the usual drivers of revolutions, were present in 17th-century Maharashtra.  Shivaji's success stemmed from his ability to organize the Mavlas and inspire ordinary men to extraordinary feats.",

    "section": "Shivaji's Vision of Swarajya",
    "text": "The theory that Shivaji envisioned Hindavi Swarajya as early as 1645, based on a letter supposedly written to Dadaji Naras-prabhu Deshpande, is debated.  The authenticity of the letter, which mentions establishing Hindavi Swarajya, is questioned by scholars due to its modern language.  The story of the oath-taking at the Rohireshvar temple is also considered unreliable.  Furthermore, the meaning of \"Swarajya\" in the 17th century might not have equated to an independent state as it does today. Shivaji might have been referring to control over his jagir.  Examples of his usage of \"rajya\" in other contexts support this interpretation. It is suggested that Shivaji's vision evolved gradually. Starting with smaller objectives like controlling his jagir and securing forts, his ambitions expanded to annexing territories, raiding Mughal provinces, and ultimately proclaiming himself Chhatrapati. The decision to establish an independent state, implemented in 1674, likely did not exist in 1645 when Shivaji was only 15.  Great movements often begin with small incidents. The Adilshah's order to ravage Shahaji's Poona jagir in 1643, leaving Shivaji with no place for his family, could be seen as one such incident.",

This act enraged the Adilshah, who dispatched troops to attack Shivaji, but they were defeated.  Subsequently, Shivaji’s father, Shahaji, was arrested and imprisoned in Bijapur, with his release contingent on the return of Sinhgad. Shivaji was compelled to comply, and Shahaji was released but subsequently distanced himself from Shivaji and his ambitions, focusing instead on his affairs in Bangalore with his second family.",

Both Paramanand and Sabhasad vividly describe the Shivaji-Afzal Khan meeting on November 10, 1659. A 19th-century debate in Maharashtra questioned who struck first. The Chitnis Bakhar suggests Shivaji anticipated Khan's blow, seemingly uttering, \"It is good that you struck the first blow. Now meet my Bhavani sword.\" Paramanand notes the impossibility of knowing what transpired between two individuals in such a situation. Both harbored treachery. A burly Afzal Khan might have been tempted to strangle the smaller Shivaji, who seemingly clung to him in terror. Shivaji, perhaps sensing a struggle's fatality, may have preemptively used his dagger. Sarkar describes it as \"diamond cut diamond,\" where the more alert Shivaji triumphed. Tragedy followed. Afzal Khan was beheaded, his bodyguards slain, and 3,000 of his men slaughtered. The Marathas seized immense booty: 4,000 horses, 65 elephants, 1,200 camels, 2,000 bundles of clothing, and Rs. 7 lakhs in cash and jewelry. This wasn't a Hindu-Muslim conflict, with Hindus in Khan's camp and Muslims on Shivaji's side. Khan's bodyguards included Marathas Shankaraji and Pilaji Mohite, while Shivaji's uncle Mambaji Bhonsale fought for Khan and perished. Khan's envoy was Hindu Krishnaji Bhaskar, and Shivaji's aide was Muslim Ibrahim. Paramanand records Khan's death at 2 p.m. on November 10, 1659, a pivotal moment in the Maratha state's birth. This emboldened Shivaji. Had he fallen, the Maratha period might not exist. This context is crucial when discussing Shivaji's \"treachery.\"  Shivaji capitalized on his victory, conquering Satara and Sangli, and capturing Panhala. However, by March 1660, Bijapuri general Siddi Jauhar (Salabat Khan) besieged him at Panhala. Aurangzeb dispatched his uncle Shaista Khan as Deccan viceroy, who also received Bijapur's plea for help against Shivaji. On May 9, 1660, Shaista Khan entered Poona and captured Chakan to secure supply lines to Ahmednagar. Firangoji Narsala's valiant defense cost the Mughals two months, 268 soldiers, and 600 injuries. Shaista Khan returned to Poona, establishing Mughal Deccan headquarters and administering the region. Shivaji, besieged at Panhala, escaped on July 13, 1660, pursued by Bijapur forces. Baji Prabhu Deshpande's courageous defense in a narrow ravine secured Shivaji's retreat to Vishalgad, though Baji Prabhu fell, immortalized in ballads.",

    "text": "In November 1660, Mughals seized Parenda from Bijapur, and in May 1661, recaptured Kalyan in North Konkan. Shivaji defeated Mughal general Kar Talab Khan at Umbarkhind in January 1661, diverting to South Konkan and capturing Dabhol.  Retaliating against English grenade supplies to Siddi Jauhar, Shivaji raided Rajapur, plundering the English factory and capturing President Revington and three factors, releasing them years later. Shaista Khan’s 100,000-strong army camped in Poona (1660-1663), yet post-Chakan, made no major fort-capture attempts. Sarkar suggests Chakan's losses deterred him. Bhimsen Saksena's autobiography reveals Mughal motivations. Shaista Khan, Aurangzeb's maternal uncle, hosted his daughter Pari Begum's lavish month-long wedding to Prime Minister Muhammad Jafar's son (also related to Mumtaz Mahal) in Poona. Bhimsen recounts Namdar Khan's inquiry to Shaista Khan: Why not subjugate Shivaji's smaller force? Shaista Khan retorted: Ending the Shivaji campaign would leave Aurangzeb without enemies, leading to a Kandahar campaign against Pathans and Persians in harsh conditions. Further, ending the Maratha war would lead to Aurangzeb downsizing their 75,000-strong force, causing unemployment. This illustrates Mughal corruption. Shaista Khan also attempted to bribe Shivaji's officers with Mughal wealth and positions, leading to a demoralizing desertion of capable Maratha officers, including Sambhaji Kavji.  Fearing isolation, burdened by the Mughal presence, and betrayed by his officers, Shivaji made peace with the Adilshah by returning Panhala, then audaciously targeted Shaista Khan. On April 5, 1663, Shivaji led a midnight raid on Shaista Khan's Poona residence (Lai Mahal, Shivaji's childhood home). Mughal historian Khali Khan, whose father served Shaista Khan, describes the event. During Ramzan, amidst sleeping servants and busy cooks, Marathas entered by removing wall bricks, attacking anyone in their path. Shaista Khan, awakened, attempted a spear throw but lost fingers in the ensuing attack. Amidst the confusion and a fountain stumble, slave-girls rescued Shaista Khan. Abul Fath (Khan’s son), six wives/slave-girls, and forty attendants perished. Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur's condolences were met with Shaista Khan's sarcastic: \"Are you still alive? I thought you had already died fighting in defence of me!\"  Bhimsen mentions rumors of Jaswant Singh's complicity. Shivaji's humiliation of the Emperor's uncle resonated across India. His personal involvement in the dangerous raid won his followers’ devotion.  Humiliated, Shaista Khan retreated to Aurangabad and was transferred to Bengal. Prince Muazzam became Deccan Viceroy in January 1664.",

    "text": "This section refers to the Mughal attempts to conquer Shivaji's homeland. Shivaji's objective in the sack of Surat was not only to gain wealth but also to deter Mughal encroachment on Maratha territories.  In 1665, Emperor Aurangzeb dispatched Mirza Raja Jai Singh to subdue Shivaji. Jai Singh, a skilled general and diplomat, orchestrated a campaign that united Bijapuris, Portuguese, and rival Maratha chieftains against Shivaji.  The Marathas faced relentless attacks, their villages burned, and their people captured.  Dilir Khan's siege of Purandar fort resulted in the heroic death of Murar Baji. Recognizing the futility of further resistance, Shivaji surrendered unconditionally to Jai Singh on June 11, 1665. The Treaty of Purandar stipulated that Shivaji surrender 23 forts, retain 12 forts including Rajgad, pledge loyalty to the Mughal throne, and assist in the campaign against Bijapur. Some historians argue that Shivaji sued for peace due to Hindu casualties on both sides, citing a spurious letter where Shivaji purportedly urges Jai Singh to join him against Aurangzeb.  However, Shivaji's defeat was undeniable, and the treaty marked a significant setback for him. His letters to Aurangzeb during this period reflect abject surrender.  Despite this defeat, Shivaji's greatness lay in his ability to rise from adversity. His intelligence, strategy, determination, and unwavering faith in his goal are remarkable.",

    "text": "At Jai Singh's urging and under his protection, Shivaji traveled to Agra for an audience with Aurangzeb on May 12, 1666.  Instead of being honored, Shivaji was positioned behind ranks of noblemen and denied a khilat (robe of honor).  Enraged by the humiliation, Shivaji protested, rejecting the offered mansab and vowing not to return to the Emperor's presence.  Aurangzeb, informed of Shivaji's illness, had him escorted back to his residence.  Placed under semi-detention, Shivaji offered two crores of rupees for the return of his forts, but Aurangzeb demanded their unconditional surrender.  Shivaji's life was threatened on multiple occasions, according to records. Meanwhile, he bribed officials to secure his freedom, incurring a substantial debt.  Aurangzeb transferred Shivaji to Vithaldas' residence, where, according to Manucci, a plan was hatched to strangle him. Fearing for his life, Shivaji escaped on August 17, 1666, reaching Rajgad on September 12, 1666.  Infuriated, Aurangzeb arrested and tortured Shivaji's lieutenant, Netaji Palkar, forcing his conversion to Islam.  After Shivaji's escape, he wrote a diplomatic letter to Aurangzeb expressing his desire to serve the Emperor, even suggesting an expedition to Kandahar.  With a Persian threat looming, Aurangzeb responded favorably, urging Shivaji's obedience to his son, Muazzam, and encouraging him to conquer Bijapur.",

Jai Singh defended his decision, explaining that Shivaji had prepared for defense and that the Adil Shah of Bijapur had offered a united front with Shivaji against the Mughals.  A conversation between Dilir Khan and Jai Singh highlighted a crucial Mughal blunder. Dilir Khan advised against invading Bijapur, suggesting that Shivaji be appointed as the Mughal general in the Deccan. Jai Singh dismissed this advice, a decision that both Elphinstone and Lane Poole considered a missed opportunity to contain the Marathas and focus on the north. Lane Poole criticized the Mughal's political shortsightedness, observing that Shivaji, who could have been a powerful ally, became an enraged enemy.  Aurangzeb’s shortsightedness and lack of consideration for Shivaji, coupled with the Mughal’s wasted resources in conquering the declining Bijapur and Golkonda, ultimately contributed to the rise of the Maratha Empire.",

    "text": "But Shivaji used to say till the end of his days that the only mistake he committed in his life was his visit to Agra, and Aurangzeb said his greatest mistake was that he allowed Shivaji to escape from Agra! Aurangzeb died on 20th February 1707, and in his last will and testament he wrote: ‘The greatest pillar of a Government is the keeping of information about everything that happens in the kingdom, while even a minute’s negligence results in shame for long years. See how the flight of the wretch Shiva, which was due to carelessness, has involved me in all these distracting campaigns to the end of my days.’\n\nProf. Jadunath Sarkar observes: ‘The historian who digs down to the root causes of great events cannot help feeling that Shivaji’s visit to Aurangzeb produced as its ultimate consequence a revolution in the destiny of the Maratha people. This event marks a decisive turning point in the history of India as a whole. The insults heaped by Aurangzeb rankled in Shivaji’s mind till the end, and he became convinced forever that the word of the Mughal was not to be trusted.’\n\nFor the next three years, however, Shivaji tried to curry favor with the Mughals with all the arts of diplomacy that he could command. He had to consolidate his own position first before he could contend with the mighty Mughals. He wrote to Prince Muazzam, the new Viceroy of the Deccan: ‘My son Shambhuji has been created a commander of five thousand but has received no jagir as tankha. I now beg that His Majesty may pardon the offences of this servant, restore the mansab of my son and assign a jagir to him. I am ready to render service in person wherever I am ordered.’ This was agreed to by the Emperor, and Sambhaji met Muazzam at Aurangabad on 4th November 1667. Sambhaji was created a commander of five thousand with a jagir at Malkapur in Berar, and on 5th August 1668, a Maratha contingent left for Aurangabad under Pratap Rao and Niraji Raoji.\n\nShivaji also requested that the title Raja might be conferred on him. Some of our modern historians feel that Shivaji could never make such a request. One historian goes to the extent of saying that Shivaji’s open defiance of the Emperor at Agra was in fact motivated by a desire to escape being given the title ‘Raja’ by the Emperor in a fit of generosity! The significance of one of the proudest moments in the history of India is thus being distorted! Another suggestion is that the securing of the title ‘Raja’ was indeed a feat of diplomacy on Shivaji’s part. The Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda called him a robber and a freebooter, as he had seized areas from their kingdom; but now their overlord, the Emperor of India, had himself called Shivaji a Raja. It was as if Shivaji had flaunted in their face a regular order from the highest imperial authority recognizing his status. On 9th March 1668, Prince Muazzam himself wrote to Shivaji: ‘His Gracious Majesty has elevated your head by granting you the title of Raja, which was the extreme point of your desires.’\n\nIt is clear that Shivaji stooped to conquer, and his intention was not merely to conquer but even to destroy the Mughal Empire when the moment was opportune. For three years, from 1667 to 1669, Shivaji was busy husbanding his resources, framing regulations for the governance of his territory, and preparing for his final assault on the bastions of the Mughal empire. In November 1667, Shivaji’s forces marched into the Portuguese territory of Bardes in pursuit of the Desais of South Konkan, who had taken refuge there and were making it a base of their operations against Shivaji.",

    "text": "Some historians have tried to show that Shivaji attacked the Portuguese to punish them for their proselytizing activities. He is thus sought to be projected as a champion of Hinduism! There is no doubt that Shivaji was a devout Hindu. His renovation of the temple of Saptakotishvar at Narve and of Jagadishvar at Raigad, and the grant given by him to the temple of Ghrishneshvar at Verul, are standing examples of Shivaji’s great concern for the religion and culture of his forefathers. But he did not allow politics to be mixed up with religion. The object of his campaign against the Portuguese was purely political, namely, to punish them for having given refuge and encouragement to the rebel Desais of South Konkan. Prof. Pissurlencar, who has brought out a well-documented study of Portuguese-Maratha relations, has expressed similar views. The terms of the treaty of 1670 between Shivaji and the Portuguese also do not refer to any religious issues.\n\nIn 1670 Shivaji broke his peace with the Mughals, and the fury of his attack was so great that he was immediately rewarded with a series of successes which wiped out the humiliation of the Treaty of Purandar. On 4th February, Kondana was captured after a memorable fight in which Shivaji’s lieutenant, Tanaji Malusare, laid down his life. On 8th March, Purandar was recovered by Nilo Pant. By the end of June 1670, the forts of Kalyan, Lohgad, Mahuli, Karnala and Rohida fell to Shivaji. In October of the same year, Shivaji made a second raid on Surat and plundered the larger houses of that opulent city for three whole days, carrying off a booty of Rs. 66 lakhs. As the raiders were returning with their loot, they were confronted by the Mughal army under Daud Khan. But the Mughals suffered heavy losses in the battle of Dindori which took place on 17th October 1670. Bhimsen Saksena has given a graphic eyewitness account of this battle in his Tarikh-i-Dilkusha. In December 1670, Shivaji captured the forts of Ahivant, Markanda, Ravla and Javla in Baglana and entered the territory of Khandesh. Advancing still further, he carried off booty worth nearly a crore of rupees from the rich and fertile province of Berar. In the meanwhile, Moro Pant Peshwa had captured the fort of Trimbak in October 1670 and on 5th January 1671 the fort of Salhir also fell to the Marathas. The English records mention that the Mughal generals, Bahadur Khan and Dilir Khan, were forced to retreat from the Maratha country with shame and loss. In 1672, the Marathas annexed the Koli States of Jawhar and Ramnagar in North Konkan.\n\nDuring all this time Aurangzeb was busy suppressing the Pathan rebellion in the north, and the stream of reports that went to him from the Deccan spoke of a succession of reverses for the Mughal armies. Shivaji’s conception of strategy was brilliant. He made use of every instrument of war. The nature of his attacks, their timing and the methods of warfare he employed win our instant admiration for this outstanding leader of men. Shivaji’s intelligence system is also praised by Francois Martin, the French Governor of Pondicherry. The English records of Bombay mention that Shivaji’s spies were spread all over the island. Fort after fort was seized from the Mughal qiladars, and Aurangabad was flooded with refugees from all parts of the Deccan. The Mughals were aghast.",

    "text": "In August 1669, Aurangzeb had destroyed the Vishveshvar Temple at Benares, and some historians hold that Shivaji's fierce attack on the Mughals was in retaliation for the Emperor's iconoclastic measures. However, Shivaji appears to have been motivated more by political than by religious considerations. Ever since his return from Agra, it had been clear to him that Aurangzeb wanted to destroy him, and a war with the Mughals was therefore inevitable. He had accordingly been preparing for it. Considering the tiny kingdom of Shivaji, with only twelve forts, and the vast resources of the Mughal Empire, a lesser man than he would have shrunk from such a course. But Shivaji knew that the Mughal Empire was an empty show; he had seen it in all its glory and all its decadence during his visit to Agra. Moreover, he was fighting for the protection of his motherland, and he knew that his cause was just. It was this conviction that sustained him as well as his successors in the long struggle against Aurangzeb which continued for almost forty years until the death of that Emperor in 1707. In the intervening period, Shivaji died, his son Sambhaji was captured and put to death by Aurangzeb, Sambhaji’s wife and son were taken prisoners and Rajaram who succeeded Sambhaji also died. The struggle went through many vicissitudes; but ultimately the Marathas emerged victorious and Aurangzeb died a broken man.\n\nAt this stage we may pause to consider the nature of Mughal rule in India, as that will enable us to understand why Shivaji decided to strike a decisive blow against it. The Mughals were not really Mongolians; they were Turks from Central Asia. Emperor Akbar was a great gift of the Turkish people to our country. He realised that there could be no salvation for the State unless there was a genuine understanding among the various religious communities living in a country. Akbar appointed a bureau of translators which translated into Persian the eighteen cantos of the Mahabharata including the Bhagavadgita, and the Yogavasistha. The torch was carried forward during the reign of Emperor Jahangir, when Mulla Masih translated the Ramayana of Valmiki and Faizee wrote an epic poem in Persian on the story of Nala and Damayanti. Prince Dara Shukoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, was an outstanding scholar who studied the doctrines of the Vedanta, the Talmud, and the New Testament besides the works of Sufi writers. The patron of Pandit-raj Jagannath, he also arranged for the translation of the Atharvaveda and of several Upanishads into Persian. This trend towards liberalism was however reversed by Aurangzeb when he became the Emperor in 1658.",

    "text": "In order to strengthen his hold on the Imperial Throne, Aurangzeb wanted to condemn his eldest brother, Dara Shukoh, as siding with the infidels; he also wanted to gain the support of the Mullahs and Moulavis by waging a ceaseless war against the infidels. Himself an orthodox Muslim belonging to the Hanafi school of the Sunni sect, Aurangzeb looked upon the Mughal Empire as an Islamic State, and he subordinated the policies of his government to the dictates of orthodox religion. Under his rule, the Hindus were equated with the Kafirs who fought against the Prophet at Mecca. On 9th April 1669, a general order was issued for the destruction of Hindu temples. The temple of Vishvanath at Benares was razed to the ground and a mosque was built in its place. Keshavji ka Kathda at Mathura, to which Dara had presented a beautiful balustrade, was pulled down, and a mosque of red stone was erected in its place. Jaziya was imposed on all Hindus, and the Hindu merchants were required to pay an additional import duty of 3% on all imported goods. The Hindus thus became second class citizens under Aurangzeb’s rule, and their way of life was in complete jeopardy.\n\nSecondly, there was personal rule during Aurangzeb’s time, and all powers were concentrated in the person of the Emperor who was the fountain-head of all decisions. He ruled with the help of a bureaucracy which consisted mostly of foreigners. Although Aurangzeb was born in this country and he died in this country, he was extremely proud of his Turrani origin and his racial consciousness was very strong. He held the Indians in contempt and often made a distinction between “you Hindustanis” and “we Turranis”. Turks from Central Asia and even Persians were preferred to Indians for recruitment to positions of authority. In his book *The Mughal Nobility under Aurangzeb*, Prof. Mohammad Athar Ali of Aligarh University has given a Civil List of Aurangzeb’s time indicating the racial origins of the various dignitaries, and it is very revealing. The Mughal Empire then consisted of 22 Subahs and during the fifty years of Aurangzeb’s reign a total number of 137 persons were appointed as the Governors of these Subahs. Only two of them were Hindus, namely, Mirza Raja Jai Singh and Maharaja Jaswant Singh. The remaining 135 were Muslims, and of them only a very few belonged to families which had settled down in India for five to six generations. The rest had come recently from Samarkand, Bokhara, Khorasan or Iran, or from some other place.",

Shivaji writes a letter to Emperor Alamgir explaining his reasons for leaving without permission, offering his service, and protesting the jaziya tax. He points out Aurangzeb's emptying treasury and contrasts his rule with the tolerant policies of Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan, who treated all communities equally. Shivaji argues that all are children of God and imposing jaziya is unjust and an innovation in India. He suggests that if Aurangzeb insists, he should first collect it from Raja Rajsingh, the leader of the Hindus.  This plea for tolerance in public affairs showcases Shivaji as a great patriot and a beacon of religious understanding in an age of bigotry.

He warned that robbing the poor would make them flee or starve, viewing his officers as worse than the Mughals. Shivaji promoted talent, elevating individuals like Moro Pant Pingle and Annaji Datto to high positions. His administration provided peace, tolerance, equal opportunities, a pure system of administration, a navy for trade, and a trained militia.

They confronted foreign invaders like Ahmed Shah Abdali when others hesitated, and were considered the primary enemy of the British in the early 19th century.

His royal seal symbolized his growing splendor, respected worldwide and spreading blessings. His teachings of patriotism, tolerance, and universal welfare remain relevant. The foundation of Swarajya by Shivaji was a decisive historical event, a composite movement driven by various forces in Maharashtra, but ultimately shaped by Shivaji's genius into a patriotic current establishing an independent Maratha nation-state. Contemporary writers and foreign accounts viewed Shivaji in superhuman terms. Justice Ranade, in his \"Rise of the Maratha Power,\" explained Swarajya as a manifestation of national spirit, not an accident, but a product of nature, history, religious revival, and three centuries of military discipline under Muslim rule.",

Ever since the days of Ranade, incessant research has been carried on in Maratha history. The prodigious labours of historians like Rajwade, Kiware, Sarkar, Sardesai, Bal Krishna and many others during the course of the present century have uncovered facts which impeach the validity of some of the former generalisations respecting the political life and thought of the Maratha people. The invaluable material that they have brought to light helps us to understand the Maratha freedom movement, under the extraordinary leadership of Shivaji, in its true historical perspective. The ideal of Swarajya came into being in response to the pressing need of the times. It signified the resurgence of Maharashtra which had fallen into a moribund condition under alien rule. It was not by accident that the Marathas inhabiting the hills of Sahyadri came to be politically sensitized beyond all other nationalities of India so as to establish an independent nation-state.",

Maratha nationalism was a compound of geographical integration and linguistic and cultural affinity, cemented by a common religious faith and stimulated by the galling Muslim domination. Of the various elements that went into the making of the Maratha nation, religion was perhaps the strongest at least in its formative stage. Ever since the advent of the Muslim Rule the people of Maharashtra had lived in a terribly depressing condition. Their freedom was lost; their religion was treated with open disregard and their cherished susceptibilities were outraged in a wanton manner. It was in this condition that the concept of Maharashtra Dharma, which was at the root of Swarajya, came into being in defence of their way of living. It was not directed against Islam, nor was it intended for the propagation of the Hindu religion. It was certainly not meant to establish a communal empire. Its basic aim was to preserve and carry forward the ancient religion and culture of all the people residing in Maharashtra who are known by the comprehensive term Maratha.",

What is important for our purpose is quoted here. Writes Shivaji: I have just received your letter blessing me in the following words: 'By the Grace of God, I got over the difficulty, Kind Providence having given you the strength to fight for Swarajya and religion God Shiva and Goddess Amba are always your protectors and will, I am sure, give you victory. You must avenge all the previous wrongs on this occasion: I bless you, my worthy son'. It is true that Shahaji did not have the clear conception of Swarajya which his gifted son had.

In matters of state and the welfare of his subjects—Hindu, Muslim, or Christian—religious considerations never influenced his policies. He appointed Muslims to high positions, demonstrating his respect for Islam, as evidenced by even his harshest critic, Khafi Khan. Swarajya's foundation rested on Shivaji's military genius. A born leader, he understood the geographic factor in military tactics. He fortified the Sahyadri Ghats as the primary defense line and established a secondary line in the Kaveri valley. Recognizing the importance of naval power, he created the Maratha Navy. He maintained a ready army through provisions and discipline, employing mobile warfare, avoiding pitched battles, and favoring guerrilla tactics. He possessed a keen judgment of character and inspired his troops through personal example. Shivaji's ideal of Swarajya encompassed economic prosperity. He prioritized the well-being of his people, protecting farmers and promoting agriculture, the backbone of Maharashtra's economy. He actively developed trade, commerce, and industry, demonstrating sound economic sense. As Dr. A. R. Kulkarni noted, Shivaji aimed to make his state economically viable.  Shivaji not only founded Swarajya but established it on a firm foundation.  Ramchandrapant Amatya summarized his achievements: \"(He created an altogether new order of things.)\" Swarajya ushered in a glorious chapter in Indian history, fueled by Shivaji's genius. His enduring legacy is the spirit of self-reliance and independence he instilled in his people, a precious gift to modern India. His unparalleled patriotism, along with peace and benevolent administration, especially considering the socio-political context, places him among the world's greatest nation-builders.",

    "text": "Swarajya’s impact on Indian history is undeniable. Shivaji’s revolt against foreign rule inspired succeeding generations, from the Maratha War of Independence (1689-1707) to India's freedom struggle. Aurangzeb's failure against the Marathas stemmed from his inability to grasp their higher moral characteristics, their passion for independence, and their unwavering devotion to Shivaji's memory, example, and institutions. The successful Maratha War of Independence vindicated Shivaji's cultivation of national spirit. The memory of Shivaji inspired soldiers and leaders during the Indian Revolt of 1857.  Nineteenth-century Indian Renaissance leaders like Nyayamurti Ranade sought guidance and inspiration from Shivaji’s resurgent Maharashtra. Lokmanya Tilak, who initiated Shivaji Utsav to fuel Indian nationalism against British rule, echoed Shivaji’s early declaration of Swaraj as a birthright. The Hindu world has celebrated few events as significantly as Shivaji's coronation 300 years ago, second only to the Somnath temple's restoration.  Shivaji’s coronation, officiated by Gaga Bhatt from Benares, was a unique event, requiring the establishment of Shivaji's Kshatriya lineage, expiation for the delayed Upanayana ceremony, and Vedic marriages. Gaga's willingness to oversee the complex 10-day ceremony demonstrated his expertise and authority, impressing local priests.  Gaga's solutions to the ritualistic hurdles, particularly the late Upanayana, sparked debate. Justice K.T. Telang criticized the decision, given Shivaji's age, prior marriages, and existing children. Dr. P.V. Kane defended Gaga, emphasizing a historian's role in considering all available evidence and the Shastric rules allowing Upanayana at any age with penance. This intellectual clash highlights the controversial nature of Gaga's decision, justified by his stature and the interests of the people.",

    "text": "It was a firm belief of the Hindus that in the Kaliyuga there was no Kshatriya living, which meant that no Hindu could be a real king.  Raja as an honorary title, many sardars could have; but a throne and a coronation were far beyond their reach. Kingship was equated with a divine authority; it was not the divine right of kings as understood in Europe. This was a firm belief that a ruler, a crowned king, was like a God. The exact saying is: [Sanskrit text omitted] literally meaning that only Vishnu can be the Lord of the Earth (King). Kingship meant sharing the mastery over the earth; and the earth as Bhu Devi is the second wife of Vishnu, the first being Lakshmi. Hence a king shares the lordship over the earth with Vishnu. To be able to be a peer of Vishnu, you must belong to the Kshatriya class, and in the Kaliyuga that class did not exist.\n\nBe that as it may, the conditions of the times were such as made another coronation necessary, and it was under the guidance of Nischalpuri that it was carried out. Here the Mantric and Tantric—but not Vedic—rituals dominated. The difference between the two indicates clearly the local prejudices which were firmly embedded in the public mind. Even the greatest authority of Gaga from Benares did not prove impressive before them. Hence Nischalpuri's effort of appeasing the local gods. This is neither the place nor the occasion to go into the disputed point of the Vedic versus the Mantric type of coronation. In Maratha social life, the controversy has raged over many years and it is known as the Vedokta Prakarana. For the purposes of our topic it is enough to note that there were two coronations: one to establish that Shivaji belonged to the Kshatriya clan and that he could be crowned a Chhatrapati and the other to show that he was not entitled to the Vedic form of recitations at the time of the coronation. It must then be taken as a progressive acceptance on the part of Nischalpuri that he approved of the proposal of Gaga to have Shivaji crowned; the way of crowning may be different. But that Shivaji was considered worthy to be crowned was quite a welcome and reformist attitude.\n\nBut what does a coronation really mean? What constituted its full performance? Actually, from the term employed in the Dharmashastras, the coronation of a King is a ceremonial bath, an abhisheka. Whether a crown was actually used or not in India, we do not know. The reference to patta (in pattabhisheka, patta-rani) is there, and out of fifteen different meanings of the word, one does signify a head-dress, which may be considered as a sort of a crown. In one book it is mentioned that the length of the patta should be twice the breadth at the centre and this does indicate that it was a broad head-dress. In many image-plays even today the royal figures appear with a silken broad cloth round the head. That again is according to a meaning of the word patta. The King is considered the protector of the earth; in fact he is wedded to her, and hence becomes a part of Vishnu whose second wife is Bhu Devi, the earth. According to the English custom, the sceptre and the crown seem to be the symbols of royalty. According to the Hindu custom, chamara and chhatra are the inseparable emblems of royalty. Chamara is the fly-whisk made from the tail of the wild cows of Nepal (Chamari; hence, i.e. the wild cows are killed for the sake of their hair), and chhatra, a royal umbrella. The danda is also mentioned; but it is to be carried by others, not by the King. The chamara and chhatra also are carried by others. Only the patta, whatever it may mean, is put on the head or forehead by the king. According to the Islamic custom, the morchel and mahimaratab were the insignia of royalty. A morchel was a bunch of peacock tails held on one side of the person, while he occupied his exalted seat. On the other side was the flag with the figures of a fish.",

    "text": "The coronation of a Hindu King meant that he undertook to rule the country and its people according to the dictates of Dharma. What he had to do was to observe Dharma so that the people were protected and that they were happy; thus the earth too was happy and prosperous. It is interesting how the texts of the various authorities are unanimous on this point. In the happiness of the people, the kings sought their own happiness. At one place, the Mahabharata asks the king to follow the way of the would-be-mother. As she is very careful about the well-being of the child unborn, so also should the king be careful that he guards the interests of the people entrusted to his care. Was it a chance coincidence or was it by plan, that those very sentiments found a place in Queen Victoria’s Proclamation, issued as she took over the empire of India under her care? In their prosperity will be our strength; in their contentment our security, and in their gratitude our best reward.\n\nThe Hindu ceremony of instituting authority in an icon or an idol has its counterpart in human relations also. The ruler had to be properly instituted with authority to be able to rule. Without such a ceremony, his writ had difficulty in being honoured and respected. With the investiture of authority, i.e. after the coronation, the ruler was within his right when he issued this order or that. He had the full judicial authority to pronounce capital punishment, even as a king had the inherent right to grant pardon in such extreme cases. The need for such a ceremonial function will be realised only after appreciating the scale of gradation, into which the people were divided; and gradation was the hall-mark of Hindu society. Thus the Mores of Javli considered themselves far superior to the Bhonsales. Why? The reason may sound ridiculous; but even as seniority in service counts for much in government, one need not laugh at the Mores, who considered themselves superior to the Bhonsales on the strength of the family’s far longer service under the Adilshahi. By the coronation, the Bhonsales were at once raised to the highest place in the social scale. According to one authority on Shivaji’s times, some of the Brahmans were not so willing to obey Shivaji’s orders, and they considered him not to be a constituted authority for dispensing justice in social or other disputes. To satisfy such doubting Thomases, it was necessary to have a regularising ceremony—the coronation—performed as soon as possible. It is pertinent to note that among the expiations which Shivaji underwent before being formally crowned, there was one for a possible Brahma-hatya (death of a Brahmin) by one who was already a grand hero of many battles. What then were the responsibilities of a king crowned according to the Dharmashastras? What did the coronation signify? Rajadharma enjoined on the kings to undertake to govern according to dictates, not of his own but of Dharma. And that Dharma was as old as man.\n\n(When there was neither king nor kingdom, no punishment nor punishing authority, [under such conditions] the people protected themselves [by mutual cooperation] by observing Dharma.) A crowned king has to respect the dictates of such a Dharma, which assures full protection to all the people. It is common knowledge that the king as a ruler was entitled only to a sixth of the total produce of the land, which comes to a little more than 16%. So the ancient texts fully regulated the powers of the Sovereign, although he was equated with Vishnu, thus firmly establishing the overriding supremacy of Dharma. For these reasons, the coronation had established the Hindu Dharma firmly at a time when it was believed to be on the wane. Historians call the function epoch-making because it does mark the beginning of a new, bright and hopeful era. That is also why the Raja Shaka, a new era, was introduced from the day of the coronation. The people were not expecting anyone from among themselves to be a king in his own right. But they were prepared to accept any Sultan or even a Siddi as a ruler on par with Vishnu! It did not matter to them at all that the ruler was anti-Hindu in spirit and deed. Shahaji, for instance, was virtually a king-maker; he carried the infant Nizam shah in his lap. The thought of having a throne for himself never crossed his mind. Similarly, many Maratha sardars knew full well that this or that Sultanate depended on their valour and swordsmanship. Yet they never desired a throne for themselves. Their loyalty even to the weak occupant of the throne was exemplary. They were more loyal than the king! It was a curious mind that believed that there were no kshatriyas living and therefore the Hindus could not be kings, but at the same time felt that any chance comer who could usurp the throne by hook or crook was entitled to be respected by the people. It was this utter humility to and full dependence on the Sultans that Shivaji revolted against. He wanted his countrymen to be free and self-respecting.",

    "text": "Reverting back to Gaga and his grand ceremonial, we note with an unusual satisfaction that the royal function as outlined by him was in full accordance with similar ceremonies as described in the Ramayana or the Mahabharata. Coronations had become quite unusual in those days and Gaga could only depend on the details as mentioned in the epics. He must be complimented for his wise vision and his uncommon boldness in acting up to that vision. Another contemporary pandit, the poet Bhushan, has observed: “If there were no Shivaji, all India would have been converted to Islam”. This then is the answer to the question about the significance of the Coronation. “If there were no Shivaji”, is the poet’s way of saying, “if there were no coronation and if there were no Chhatrapati”, because Shivaji and his coronation are inseparables. When two cultures, the Hindu and Islamic, were together in close juxtaposition, with a powerful Islamic ruler at the top, there was always the fear of total disappearance of the other. In the present secular state of the Republic of India, we may not be in a position to appreciate adequately what the coronation meant to the then Hindu mind. We have seldom considered why most of the historical Marathi papers that have been printed so far invariably bear dates according to the Islamic calendar. It is not yet adequately realised that Marathi vocabulary generally and that of diplomacy in particular, is overladen with Persian-Arabic words and expressions. All this has happened because of the dominant position which Islam enjoyed during many centuries. To a dominated people, the Coronation was an act of deliverance, bringing great hope and cheer. Shivaji by his coronation preserved this aspect of Hinduism for centuries. We are grateful to both Shivaji and Gaga for this epoch-making coronation, which was performed at Raigad just 300 years back.\n\nThe Ideals and Institutions of Swarajya\n\nAt the outset I must state that my study of Shivaji and the Marathas has been a part of my study of Indian history. Therefore I am compelled to present Shivaji, his ideals, institutions and achievements in the context of the long and fascinating history of our motherland and to emphasize the significance of Shivaji as a great champion, a dauntless defender, an untiring carrier-forward of the torch of the immortal values and traditions of our ancient heritage. History, according to the Indian tradition, is the unfolding of the human values symbolised by the term purushartha consisting of dharma, artha, kama and moksha. As these values are too well-known, I do not desire to elaborate on their meaning and significance. However, I want to bring to your notice that: The Indian life and culture, in all their myriad facets of religion, philosophy, ethics, literature, social organisation and traditions of art and architecture, have their secure roots in purushartha alone. A long procession of poets, philosophers, teachers, saints, law-givers and historians from the earliest age to this day have endeavoured to explain these universal values and have enjoined our people to strive for their realization in life. Purushartha, therefore, is the criterion of our history. An objective study of Indian history is possible only when we bear this in mind. Then alone we can discover the meaning and message of our heritage. The message of our history is Universal Harmony. Indeed if one were to sum up the dominant theme that runs through Indian history in one word, it is samanvaya or harmony-harmony between the individual and the society, between the ruler and the ruled, between the nation and the universe, between action and knowledge, between the material and the spiritual, between earth and heaven, and not less significant, the harmony among the various castes, communities, creeds and faiths, gods and goddesses. Any meaningful interpretation of the events, personalities, traditions and institutions has to project itself from this basic",

    "text": "The study of Shivaji’s ideals and institutions is crucial for understanding Indian history.  Indian history is marked by periods of prosperity when traditional values were upheld and periods of decline when these values were abandoned.  Great leaders emerged during these times of decline to restore order and progress, and Shivaji was one such leader. He emerged during a period of conflict, understood the needs of his time, and translated them into action. To understand Shivaji’s ideals and his swarajya (self-rule), we need to examine his heritage, the contemporary political and socio-cultural environment, the influences that shaped his personality, his own words and pronouncements, his coronation, his patronage of religion and scholarship, and his lifelong struggle to establish dharmarajya (righteous rule). This study will help us understand the significance of Shivaji’s achievements, policies, and his mission to unite his people into a strong nation that defends its heritage. Shivaji inherited the legacy of the Vijayanagara empire, founded to defend Hindu Dharma. The empire’s collapse in 1565 was a national disaster, and its impact on Shivaji is evident in his character. T.S. Shejwalkar points out Shivaji's absorption of the Vijayanagara spirit, manifested in his deep study of Hindu scriptures, adherence to religious tenets, attendance of religious sermons, reverence for religious preceptors, generosity towards religious institutions, and personal devotion.  While the source of this influence is debated, it's clear Shivaji embodied Vijayanagara's spirit and zeal. He aspired to be Vijayanagara’s successor, demonstrated through his conquest of Karnataka, adoption of Vijayanagara coinage, Hindu-patterned government, patronage of Vedic scholarship, coronation, and dedication of his kingdom to Ramdas. Swarajya, as S.R. Sharma suggests, was a continuation of the Vijayanagara Samrajya.",

    "text": "Maharashtra and Karnataka shared deep cultural and religious ties, strengthened by the movement of troops, saints, scholars, and traders. The bhakti movement, beginning with Jnanadev, democratized religion and brought sacred knowledge to all.  The movement's vitality is evident in the hundreds of saints who followed Jnanadev over the next five centuries. These saints were aware of the people's suffering and the oppressive rule of the 'mlenchhas' (foreign rulers). Namdev, Eknath, and Tukaram's writings reflect the social and political turmoil of the time, marked by oppressive rulers, religious persecution, and social decay. Tukaram, whose kirtans Shivaji attended, emphasized moral values and the interconnectedness of life.  Tradition suggests Tukaram directed Shivaji to Ramdas, a prophet of activism who advocated social and political action. Ramdas's Dasbodh integrated religious pursuits with practical life skills. He established maths (monasteries) with akhadas (training grounds) and images of Rama and Hanuman. In a letter to Shivaji, Ramdas described the societal devastation and called for concerted efforts to overthrow Mughal rule. He also preached moderation, transforming the bhakti movement's tolerance into a proactive defense of religion. Ramdas's teachings profoundly influenced Shivaji, who dedicated his kingdom to him.  Ramdas's message also helped the public understand Shivaji's mission, contributing to nation-building. S.R. Sharma summarizes the bhakti movement's contribution: it laid the psychological and moral groundwork for Shivaji's military and political genius, making Swarajya a collective effort rather than the work of a single individual.",

His letters, seals, titles, and administration reflect the spirit of Ramarajya or Dharmarajya. His primary goal was to liberate the people from oppressive Muslim rule. G.S. Sardesai quotes Shivaji’s court historian, Sabhasad, expressing the desire to reclaim their land from Muslim rulers who desecrated temples, destroyed idols, plundered wealth, forcibly converted people, and killed cows. This passage, whether directly Shivaji’s words or an interpretation of his sentiments, reflects the contemporary understanding of his mission. Shivaji aimed to establish an independent polity that protected people’s religion and culture, based on the ancient dharmarajya and the principle of samanvaya (harmony). Evidence suggests he strived to create a just rule based on shastras (scriptures), traditions, and the wisdom of learned individuals.",

    "text": "Voi. I, Phoenix Publications, Bombay, 1971, p. 103. THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 73 the grand coronation which gave formal recognition to the swarajya and defined its ideals and obligations in clear terms. The tercentenary of the Coronation in 1974 naturally created considerable interest in the people of India about Maratha history in general and Shivaji and his coronation in particular. Therefore, I do not wish to discuss it in detail. However, it is necessary for my study to point out that coronation enjoys the most prestigious position in the Hindu tradition. One becomes a ruler only after coronation; otherwise one remains a military adventurer, however strong, just and humane one might be. Coronation invests in one the spiritual and political power to rule, protect and conquer. Shivaji was, before the coronation, an established ruler with an organised machinery of administration; he had the title Raja, his own flag, his own seal ; he was a sovereign both de facto and de jure in his own territory. In his age, the recognition accorded to him by the Mughal emperor was sufficient to make him the de jure ruler. But that did not make him an accredited monarch according to the shastras of the faith which he shared with his own people. Shivaji ardently desired to be such an accredited monarch and therefore he decided to undergo this very cumbersome and expensive Vedic ritual The coronation secured for Shivaji the approval of the people, invested in him the powers of the guardian-deities, and at the same time bound him by oath to the rule of dharma. It is significant to note that Shivaji did not acquire more powers by the coronation; on the contrary his absolutism was chastened into a monarchy obliged to rule according to the sacred law of the land. He could levy taxes, administer justice and carry on the military campaigns only according to Law and not according to his whims and fancies. He could never be arbitrary ^ Malhar Ramrao Chitnis in his Shiva Chhatrapatichen Charitra mentions that Shivaji took an oath (pratijna) at the coronation to restore the world which had been overrun by the yavanas (yavanakranta) and re-establish the Hindu dharma and to govern in accordance with the dharmashastras as befits a descendant of the ancient Sesodia line. That Shivaji willingly accepted the limitations on his sovereignty made him worthy of universal respect. The coronation assured Shivaji a place in the galaxy of the great monarchs of yore and inaugurated a new epoch in 6 74 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA the history of our country. Thus, Shivaji’s heritage, the spirit of the age, the influence of his mother and tutors, his own observations, the impact of Ramdas, all these moulded Shivaji’s personality. His ideal was the ancient dhaimarajya. Shivaji became, as Nehru points out, the symbol of a resurgent Hindu nationalism, drawing inspiration from the old classics, courageous and possessing high qualities of leadership. We have to assess and appreciate Shivaji’s achievements in this light. Long before the coronation, however, Shivaji had made the ideals of the dharmarajya his own. They were reiterated at the time of the coronation and again proclaimed in a document dated 28th January 1677, which S. R. Sharma terms as the possible Magna Carta of Maratha Swarajya : This document recounts the circumstances of Shivaji’s coronation in accordance with ascertained sacred laws for the protection of all Hindu religious and social traditions. It promises to render the most speedy and impartial justice to all who should invoke Shivaji’s dispensation following established traditions, scriptures and public opinion and calls upon people of all communities to act with one accord and cooperate with the government in defeating the yavanas coming from the north. This document reveals the spirit of Shivaji’s administration. It shows that he was not a mere empire-builder adding territory to territory. It proves that Shivaji was a man with a mission who drew his inspiration from history, from the classics, from the society and culture around him, from Ramdas and the saints of Maharashtra, and more constantly from his mother Jijabai as an embodiment of all these. Now, what were the ideals of dharmarajya adopted by Shivaji for his swarajya? The dharmarajya aimed at establishing a society based on dharma, the principle that holds people together. In other words, the ideal of the state was to promote harmony among all people by protecting their life, property, rights and duties. The ruler was thus a symbol of harmony. He was to protect the subjects, promote their welfare, and administer justice,",

    "text": "6. S. R. Sharma, op, cit,, p. 198, THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 75 punish the wicked and in general create conditions necessary for progress. The conditions of an ideal state are summed up thus : 5T % sr i f?r: u (In my kingdom there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without a sacrificial fire, no ignorant person, no adulterer, and where is the adulteress?— Upanishad, V. 11-5). The state must create such conditions that the people can live fearlessly as sons move about freely in their father’s house. The oft-repeated benediction reflects the aspirations of the people : 'irSOTsaien’iT t *«#»r ’Ptff \\ ^T: >1 (May there be good for the subjects ! May the rulers rule the land by the path of justice! May there always be good for the cows and the brahmanas! May all people be happy!). Kingship in this context could be an institution of service and not of power. Bhishmacharya defines the rajadharma thus: Sacrifice of the self, kindness towards all beings, understanding and protecting all people, redress of the aggrieved and rescue of the oppressed—^these constitute the dharma of rulers. The ruler was thus expected to identify himself with the subjects. The happiness of the subjects was to be his guiding motto. He had no other interests. What was liked by the people was to be the desire of the ruler. A ruler’s highest aspiration was the greatest happiness of his subjects. All ancient Indian thinkers thus emphasize the obligations of the ruler to society. Society indeed was higher than the state. The function of the state was to maintain and protect the social order with all its values, institutions and traditions. Individuals and groups were to be given opportunities for performing their duties without let or hindrance. Erring individuals were to be punished, but according to law. Thus, the state and monarchy were endowed with powers because they were to perform the necessary functions. The very nature of the kingdom as conceived and practised throughout long centuries precludes all possibility of despotism. 76 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA The state or kingdom, according to Indian tradition, is a corporate entity with seven limbs or elements: swami, amatya, kosha, bala, durga, janapada and mitra. I will briefly discuss the nature and significance of some of these, with particular reference to their place in swarajya. Fortunately we have a comprehensive study of Shivaji’s polity in the Ajmpatra ani Rajaniti of Ramchandrapant Amatya. This great treatise not only summarises the traditional thought and practices but also deals with several contemporary situations and innovations introduced by Shivaji. The ‘swami’ or the ruler was undoubtedly the most important limb of the state. He was responsible for everything good or bad that happened in the kingdom. It was his responsibility to pilot the ship of state smoothly and ‘successfully. The ruler was to be a father to the fatherless and a son to the sonless.. Therefore, ancient thinkers emphasized the king’s personal character, his education and training, his austere life and his constant consultations with elders and ministers. The ruler had to perform a number of functions. A list of functions given by Ramchandrapant Amatya is interesting : Regulation of the royal troops, forts, fortresses, cavalry, infantry; protection of the people; enquiring and looking into the prevalence of dharma and adharma; giving gifts at the proper time; payment of fixed salaries to the servants; collecting taxes from the people at the proper time; storing of acquired articles; keeping a regular check on income and expenditure; anticipating general, special, routine and unforeseen works by planning their execution beforehand according to their nature; punishing the guilty after determining the punishment in accordance with the shastras and taking into consideration what is just and what is unjust; planning of the means to ward off the dangers of foreign invasion; collecting information by sending spies to different countries; timely consideration of diplomatic ties—^peace, war, neutrality towards the enemy; protection of the existing territories and acquisition of new ones; proper observance of delicate rules regarding female apartments; promoting further the prestige of respectable persons and keeping baser elements within limits; acquiring the blessings of gods and THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 77 god-fearing and pious brahmanas; destroying unsocial tendencies and promoting dharma, thereby gaining the shelter of the eternal world. These and such others are the duties of the king. All students of Shivaji’s career know that Shivaji exerted himself to the utmost to perform all these functions and more, most efficiently and with an eye on the welfare of his subjects* All sections of the subjects praised him without reservation. The Brahmans called him ‘go-brahmana pratipalaka’ ; the Marathas felt elevated; the merchants, agriculturists and artisans breathed freely; the masses were liberated from the oppression of the yavana rule and hailed him as an avatar of Shiva. Perhaps the most wholesome appreciation came from Swami Ramdas: Remember Shivaji! And count this life as grass! In this world and the next, rely on fame alone. Remember Shivajil His form, his noble arms. Forget not also all his valiant deeds on earth. It is significant that this praise is from one who ruthlessly censured all the hypocrisy and magic of the so-called saints. Ramdas Swami was a hard task-master, and that Shivaji could win such adoration from him is really gratifying. Even Aurangzeb had to admit Shivaji’s magnanimity and outstanding ability* The unique character of Shivaji as a ruler will be brought out in the concluding remarks. Here it is sufficient to note that Shivaji achieved remarkable success in realizing the ideals of a dharma pravartaka. Cleverly enough, Ramchandrapant gives the list of royal functions at the beginning of the section on ministers and points out that these functions can be performed only with the assistance of the ministers. But curiously, he does not make any reference to Shivaji's council of eight ministers. The minister in the Ajmpaira is no doubt an exalted functionary but only a sarkarkun. He is next to the ruler in authority, dignity and qualifications. Perhaps this arrangement was suggested by him for the smaller state of Kolhapur* Yet it is difficult to understand why the author, himself a member of Shivaji’s council, did not refer to the most important limb of the Maratha State. It is certainly a serious lacuna in the otherwise comprehensive treatise Perhaps some pages might have been irrevocably lost.",

    "text": "'78 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA There is no doubt that Shivaji governed with the help of an Ashta Pradhan Mandal consisting of the Mukhya Pradhan (Peshwa), the Amatya (Majmuadar), the Sachiv (Shuru-navis), the Mantri (Waqia-navis), the Senapati (Sar-i-naubat), the Sumant (Dabir), the Panditrao (Sadr) and the Nyayadhish (Qazi-ul-quzat). There was also a secretariat attached to this Council. All these ministers and secretaries worked during the pleasure of the monarch. They had no constitutional or legal status except that granted by the ruler. Yet it is to be noted that Shivaji’s ministers were of great eminence, senior in age, ripe with experience and unsurpassed in loyalty. As such, he usually listened to their advice. After all, the relation between the ruler and his ministers varies according to the relative strength of their personalities. What is quite relevant to our purpose is that Shivaji did have a council of ministers, as prescribed by traditional texts, to help him in governing the territory; and all of them shared his enthusiasm for bringing about the conditions necessary for the peace, progress and welfare of the subjects. Next in the order of importance is the element of the kosha or the treasury. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of a full treasury, a sound financial policy, a just system of taxes, revenue and customs and protection of trade and commerce, for the realization of the aims of a welfare state. That Shivaji took proper care of all these is well known. However, it is necessary to emphasize at least two aspects of Shivaji’s financial administration. Shivaji always exerted himself to keep his treasury full. And at the same time, he was very vigilant about expenditure. Ha did not like pomp or grandeur but lived in a very simple style. Orme writes : His life was simple even to parsimony; his manners void of insolence or ostentation; as a sovereign most humane and solicitous for the well-being of his people the same principles of frugality and expense were observed in the municipal disbursements of his government.^^ ;• It is true that Shivaji paid his ministers, officers and servants of all cadres quite well. But he was careful to maintain a strict 7. Cited in V. B.",

New settlers received money for seeds and cattle, recovered in installments. The Swarajya was divided into Prants, Subhas, and Mahals, each Mahal yielding ¾ to 1¼ lakh in revenue. Shivaji replaced the Mughal system with direct revenue management by Subhedars or Mahalkaris, while Kamavisdars managed village groups. He disempowered Mirasdars who controlled revenue and built forts, bringing the government closer to cultivators. Land grants for service were avoided; officials' cultivated lands were assessed, and the due amount deducted from their pay. Army, militia, and fort personnel were paid by revenue assignments or cash.\n\nShivaji's religious policy contrasted with Aurangzeb's intolerance. Aurangzeb, a fanatic, believed in waging war against infidels until their lands became Islamic. Non-Muslims were considered a depressed class, subject to disabilities and jizya, and forbidden from fine dress, horseback riding, and carrying arms. They had limited legal rights and could not build new temples. Aurangzeb's early tolerance faded, and in 1669, he ordered the demolition of temples and schools, appointing temple-demolishers and censors of public morals. Numerous shrines and famous temples were destroyed.",

In Udai- pur and Chitor alone, in two months 239 temples suffered ruin by Aurangzeb’s order. The work of destruction was often accompanied by wanton desecration , such as the slauglitering of cows in the sanctuary and causing the idols to be trcdden down in public squares. The abwabs or illegal exactions levied during the Mughal period were also a prolific source of oppression to the people. These included duties on the local sale of prcduce, fees on sale of immovable property, perquisites exacted by officials for their own benefit, as well as fees and commissions levied on behalf of the state on almost every conceivable occasion, licence tax for plying certain trades and forced subscriptions.^ There were special imposts on Hindus, including for instance a tax of Rs. 6.25 per pilgrim for bathing in the sacred waters at Allaha- bad, and a fee charged for carrying the bones of dead Hindus to throw them into the Ganga. As a tax was also levied oh the father for the birth of a male child, it could truly be said that under the Mughals, illegal cesses pursued a man from birth to death. “In this age of renewed persecution,” says Sarkar, “Shiv# appeared as the star of a new hope for the Hindu World”.'I® His spirited letter of protest to Aurangzeb on the reimpositioB of jaziya is justly famous. He wrote: In strict justice, the jaziya is not at all lawful. If you imagine piety to consist in oppressing and terrorising Mm Hindus, you ought first to levy the tax upon Rajsinh who is the head of the Hindus. But to oppress ants and flies, is neither valour nor spirit. If you believe in the Koran, God is the Lord of all men and not of the Muhammedans only. Islam and Hinduism are only different pigments used by the Divine Painter to picture the human species. To show bigotry for any man’s creed and practices is to alter the words of the Holy Book. Your officers neglect to tell you of the true state of things and cover a blazing fire with straw”.^^ Although Shivaji considered it his mission to defend the Hindu religion and way of life against the onslaught of the Murals, he was not animated by any hatred towards Muslims. Full relHgious liberty for all was his ideal as well as practice in the Swarajya. He respected the holy places of all religions even during his raids and made endowments not only for Hindu temples, but also for mosques as well as tombs of Muslim saints. Just as he granted pensions to Brahman scholars versed in the Vedas, he built hermitages and provided subsistence for the holy men of Islam, notably Baba Yaqut of Kelshi in Ratnagiri district. He also employed a number of Muslims in positions of trust and responsibility, and they served him with great zeal and devotion.",

    "text": "About the patronage extended to learning in the Swarajya, the Bakhars tell us : The lost Vedic studies were revived by Shivaji. One maund of rice was annually presented to a Brahman who had mastered one of the Books of the Vedas: two maunds to a master of two Books, and so on. Every year the Panditrao used to examine the scholars in the month of Shravan and increase or decrease their stipends according to their progress in study. Foreign Pandits received pre- sents in goods, local scholars in foed. Famous scholars were assembled, honoured and given money rewaids. No Brahman had occasion to go to other kingdoms to beg.^^ As Justice Ranade observes in his Rise of the Maratha Power Ihe system of civil government established by Shivaji was distin- guished from those which preceded it or succeeded it in several important respects : Firstly—^In the great importance he attached to the hill forts, which were virtiially the starting unit of his system of govern- ment. Secondly—^In his discouragement of the hereditary system of transmitting high offices in one and the same family. Thirdly—In refusal to grant Jahagir assignments of land for the support of Civil and Military Officers. Fourthly—^In the establishment of a direct system of revenue management, without the intervention of district or village zamindars. Fifthly—^In the disallowance of the farming system. Sixthly—^In the establishment of a Council of Ministers with their proper work allotted to them, and each directly responsible to the King-in-Council. Seventhly—In the subordination of the Military to the Civil element in the administration. Eighthly—In the intermixture of Brahmans, Prabhus and Marathas in all offices, high and low, so as to keep check upon one another. 13 The men who occupied the seats of power in later Maratha history departed from the sound system laid down by Shivaji, either because they did not appreciate the wisdom of his plans or else because they succumbed to the needs of expediency and present convenience. This encouraged the growth of centri- fugal forces in the Swarajya, which broke up its organised unity and ultimately led to its dismemberment and dissolution.",

    "text": "Shivaji had set up the Council of Eight Ministers as a repository of outstanding talent for continuous aid and advice to the mon- arch. But in the reign of Shahu, this system gradually fell into disuse, as the Peshwa alone started managing the affairs of state and functioned as his own general, his own finance minister and foreign minister too. This system of personal rule by a single minister deprived the government of the multi-pronged support it would have received from the institutional arrangements devised by Shivaji. With the Peshwaship becoming hereditary, all other hr^ offices of State also became hereditary in the later Maratha period. .But natural capacity and talent are not always inherited; and inefficient and unworthy persons occupying important positions became a drag on government. Really competent persons had to resort to force and craft in order to climb to positions of power and this gave rise to an unhealthy rivalry and court intrigue. Shivaji had tried to maintain a social balance between the different communities in his kingdom by equitably distributing among them the various offices of state according to their inherited aptitudes. The Peshwas tilted this balance in favour of Brah- mans, which sowed the seeds of bickerings. The Prabhus ceased to occupy any important positions in the later Maralha pericd. Shivaji had realised that the Jahagirdars were a source of weak- ness to the Central Power; and he therefore sought to defeudalise his state. This wise precaution was, however, thrown to the winds by his son Rajaram and grandson Shahu. Whatever may have been the justification for it, there is no doubt that the growth of Saranjams in later Maratha history ultimately spelt the ruin of the Swarajya. The Gaikwads became the virtual rulers of Gujarat, the Bhonsales became supreme in Nagpur and Shinde, Holkar and Pawar had the north all to themselves. They resented any interference from the Central Power and soon became unamenable to its control. This hastened the process of disintegration of the Maratha State. The salutary principles of government laid down by Shivaji were thus abandoned by his successors, and this was one of the major causes of the decline of Swarajya. Yet it cannot be denied that Shivaji and his Swarajya have had a significant impact on the course of our history. The intense love for our motherland and for our culture generated by Shivaji are power- ful forces even today. His achievements inspired many a leader and soldier of our freedom movement. Indeed, Shivaji’s ideals and virtues are an eternal source of inspiration and guidance. Let us pray that we will be wise enough to learn useful lessons from the fascinating storjt^f his life and work.",

    "text": "FOREWORD Shri V. B. Kulkami was good enough to request me to write a Foreword to his book on SHIVAJI. There are several books on Shivaji, but, as Shri Kulkami has himself stated, the aim of his book is very simple, viz., to present Shivaji not only as a man of great personal rectitude, of broad humanity and of a wider perspective, but also as a maker of history. Although it is stated that the book does not seek to unearth any startling facts or throw new light on the obscure comers of Maratha history, there is no doubt that Shri Kulkami has drawn upon a large number of published works on Shivaji and presented a lucid picture of the Maratha history of the period. Shivaji played a very important role in the resurgence of our nation. He was not only a great warrior but a sound administrator. His life and work is no doubt a source of great inspiration to all of us. I am glad that Shri Kulkami has attempted in this book to present the subject methodically and in lucid language. I have no doubt that the book will be a useful addition to the study of the life of Shivaji and the Maratha history. Y. B. CHAVAN Union Minister for Defence, New Delhi New Delhi 15 April 1963 PREFACE The aim of this book is to present a true picture of Shivaji’s greatness as a soldier-statesman. Like some historical per- sonages, Shivaji has suffered grievously at the hands of a few but influential writers. The fact that they too acknowledge his greatness rather emphasises the Olympian stature of Shivaji than bear witness either to their sense of impartiality or their faculty for sound judgment. Shivaji’s true eminence can be understood only after a full realization of the deplorable condition to which the majority of the Indian population had been reduced before his rise to power. Similarly, we cannot measure the depth of the degra- dation of the people of his time unless we gain a clear perspec- tive of the heights of civilization that had been scaled by their ancestors in ancient and medieval India. It is for this reason that the first chapter in the book has been devoted to a detailed discussion of this essential theme. Shivaji’s message will r'emain valid so long as courage, self- reliance and tolerance are esteemed as virtues worthy of cultivation. It was with the aid of these qualities that he succeeded in changing the course of history. Perhaps, the best justification for the present book is that it seeks to prove that he was indeed a man destiny. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Y. B. Chavan, India’s Defence Minister, for writing his Foreword to this book. I thank Mr. D. S. Bakhle, I.C.S. (Retd.) for going through the typescript of this book. My thanks are also due to Mr. A. A. E. Rasquinha for his help. CONTENTS CHAP.

    "text": "There are already a number of books on Shivaji, but the need for many more well-informed and competently written ones will always be felt. Like things of beauty and joy, the lives of truly great men are of abiding interest and instruction. We behold the mighty and towering Himalayas and are again and again lost in wonder at their rugged and snow-crowned splendour. It is equally so with the grandeur of human achievement. We cannot turn our backs on history and yet remain loyal to our heritage. The civilization of mankind is the sum total of the strivings of a succession of exalted personages. It is precisely for this reason that our interest in the doings of such men as Alexander, Ashoka, Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon and Abraham Lincoln is undiminished and perennial.\n\nShivaji’s title to fame and to our grateful remembrance rests on sound foundations. By his historic labours he uplifted a downtrodden and degraded people and restored to them their manhood and the immemorial pieties of their ancient land. He saw with the clarity of a statesman the need for asserting the political independence of the Hindus as the only means of establishing a real community of interest between them and the Muslim minority. He realized the futility of promoting such concord so long as the majority of the population lay suppliant, with no courage or ability to remedy the wrong. It was only from a position of strength that the aggrieved community could hope to create a new basis for Hindu-Muslim relations. Shivaji undertook this historic task with the sword in one hand and with the emblems of peace and tolerance in the other. There was no hatred or animosity in his campaign on behalf of Hindu resurgence. His respect for Islam and its Holy Book, his veneration for the learned men of that faith and the liberal recruitment of Muslims to his army and navy, furnish the most convincing proofs of the essential catholicity of his crusade.\n\nFor this reason and for many others that will be discussed in the subsequent chapters, Shivaji stands apart from, and far above, the successful adventurers. Indeed by founding the Maratha Empire he gave a new direction to Indian history and thus paved the way for Hindu-Muslim collaboration in the common cause of national freedom when in later centuries the country came under the rule of another alien power. Such a new dispensation could never have been possible if the Muslim rule had remained unchallenged. Shivaji was thus the benefactor, not of any one community, but of the entire Indian nation. His cause and its success brought him instant recognition as a great liberator. “Divine honours,” says Mahamahopadyaya P. V. Kane, “were paid to Shivaji even in his lifetime for effectively freeing his people from the curse of capricious and tyrannical rule.” It, therefore, behoves us to make a deeper study of this remarkable man and to reflect on the lessons which his achievements have taught us. The abiding significance of his contribution to Indian history can best be understood by recalling the splendour of the ancient Hindu civilization, its decline and its eventual rehabilitation, following the patriotic labours of outstanding men like him.",

    "text": "The history of India, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization, dates back to many millenniums before Christ and unfolds to our view the spectacle of the monumental achievements of her people in all the essential domains of human activity. The Aryan seers, who gave India and the world the Vedas and the Upamshads, those archives of Hindu wisdom, delved deep into the unprobed regions of the mind and stumbled upon new truths and experiences that have made a vital contribution to the philosophic heritage of mankind. The antiquity, the depth and the great empirical quality of the Hindu philosophic literature have made a profound impression on many distinguished Western scholars and thinkers. “The study of the Upamshads,” declared Schopenhauer, “has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death.” The eminent Professor Max Muller, besides heartily endorsing this remarkable affirmation of faith, proclaimed his own indebtedness to Vedanta in guiding him through life.\n\nAncient India’s contribution, however, was not confined merely to the concerns of the spirit. She rose to great altitudes of material prosperity and played no small part in extending the frontiers of secular knowledge. A long procession of poets, bards, scholars, sculptors, artists and master-builders flourished during the Hindu period, continually enriching and enlarging the culture of the country. Pursuit of knowledge became the governing passion of the country which abounded in schools and teachers, and the gift of *vidya* or knowledge was considered the highest form of charity. The traditions of scholarship established at such ancient and celebrated seats of learning as Taxila, Banaras, Nalanda, Kanchi, Vallabhi and Vikramasila have ensured the preservation of the country’s enthusiasm for knowledge down the ages so that education has never been exotic in this land. Indeed, in no country were the words of Cicero in praise of the study of literature better appreciated than in India. The classical language of the land, Sanskrit, was developed to the highest pitch of excellence, evoking the unstinted admiration of many scholars, including that of that linguistic genius, Sir William Jones, who wrote that, whatever could have been its antiquity, Sanskrit was of a “wonderful structure, more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin and more exquisitely refined than either”.\n\nIndia’s record in art, architecture and painting is no less inspiring. Beginning with the austerely utilitarian architecture of the Indus civilization, she steadily built up her artistic traditions which found their highest fulfilment in the times of the Guptas, rightly described as the Periclean Age of India. Among her votive offerings to human knowledge the invention of the decimal system is perhaps the most precious and conspicuous. The greatest Indian astronomer and mathematician, Aryabhata, discussed with profound understanding such abstruse subjects as quadratic equations and sines and explained eclipses, solstices and equinoxes, besides announcing the roundness of the earth and its diurnal revolution on its axis, in “daring anticipation of Renaissance science”. Great progress was also made in the science of medicine and as far back as the sixth century before Christ, Hindu physicians were able to describe a large number of the delicate parts of the anatomy hidden from the eye with amazing clarity and confidence.",

    "text": "the ‘infidels’. Aibak, a manumitted slave and a “typical specimen of the ferocious Central Asian warriors of the time”, became the founder of what has come to be known as the Slave dynasty, with which Muslim rule began in India—a fitting retribution to the disunited, demoralised and suicidal Hindus. Aibak’s able general, Muhammad Khalji, played a notable part in extending the frontiers of Islam in India by conquering Bihar and Bengal. After the destruction of Hindu independence in the north it was impossible to expect that the Deccan and the south could long be successful in defending their integrity. They too presented the melancholy picture of a house divided against itself. In fact, the region had deteriorated into a veritable cockpit of competing sovereignties, inviting conquest and enslavement. In 1294 Ala-ud-din Khalji, Governor of Kara, waged a successful war against Ramachandra, the Yadava ruler of Devagiri and, capturing his capital, exacted an astounding amount of tribute from him. After stealing the throne of Delhi by cruelly putting his aged uncle and patron to death, Ala-ud-din, who has won notoriety in history as the man who “shed more innocent blood than a Pharaoh was ever guilty of”, deputed his favourite, Malik-Naib Kafur, on a second expedition to the south. Kafur was a converted eunuch and there was ironic justice in the choice of this commander for the destruction of Hindu manhood in the south. Devagiri was promptly reduced to submission and thenceforward Ramachandra, its ruler, became the most pliant and debased tool of the Delhi Sultan. To retain the favour of his paramount lord, Ramachandra sold the honour of his family and became an accomplice in the destruction of the ancient ruling houses of Warrangal and Dwarasamudra. The victorious general penetrated deep into the south and desecrated the temples of the famous pilgrim centres of Chidambaram, Srirangam and Madura and returned to Delhi laden with immense booty. Two years after Ramachandra’s death, his assertive son was defeated and the historic realm of the Yadavas was finally annexed to the Sultanate of Delhi in 1313. Earlier, in 1297, Ala-ud-din’s army had overrun Gujarat and eclipsed its independent sovereignty.",

    "text": "The reasons for the downfall of the Hindus and the conquest of their ancient land by a handful of foreigners comprehend nearly all the important aspects of their national life. First, the institution of Ashwamedha or horse sacrifice, originally conceived and used as a device for bringing the entire or large parts of the country within the frame of a single government, eventually degenerated into a potent instrument of disunity among the members of the ruling class. A weak emperor became a convenient target of attack by his vassals whose competition for independent sovereignty gravely undermined the country’s political unity. The fact that Mahmud of Ghazni could launch seventeen sanguinary invasions against India with impunity furnishes the most conclusive evidence that the princes of the country had forgotten the value of concerted action both then and thereafter. Secondly, the Hindus showed an amazing inability to adapt their military methods to the changing requirements of the times. The composition and the strategy of their armies were dictated by principles that had become hopelessly out of date, especially when they were ranged against a resourceful and determined enemy like the invading Muslims. Their absurd and incurable faith in the value of war-elephants was often disastrous to their cause. The vastness, combined with the looseness of the Hindu hordes, gravely undermined the mobility and the striking power of their troops. There was no provision in their strategy against the contingency of surprise attacks from the flanks and the rear. It did not take long for the Muslim commanders to detect the fatal weakness of their adversaries, against whom they invariably won resounding victories with ludicrously small but well-disciplined and mobile armies consisting mostly of cavalry.",

    "text": "Thirdly, the concept of fair fighting was often carried to absurd lengths by the Hindus, despite their repeated experience that the opposing forces were inhibited by no such scruples. The Rajput, for example, was imbued with all the kindred virtues of the Western cavalier*, he was recklessly bold and more than a match for the redoubtable Turk, but he was extremely deficient in organization. His belief that he should win or perish on the battlefield was suicidal both to him and to his country. Large-scale self-destruction, involving the flower of Hindu chivalry, rendered the task of the enemy in overrunning the country much easier. The concept of retreat and of rearguard action in order to be able to return to the attack under more favourable conditions did not find much favour. “The live dog,” says Professor Basham, commenting on Hindu strategy, “was no longer thought to be better than the dead lion, in so far as the spirit of the Epics permeated Hindu life.” Fourthly, the issues of victory and defeat were often staked on the safety of the commander. An entire army, even though it might have been on the verge of victory, was apt to suffer a complete rout if it became leaderless due to the sudden death or disappearance of its commander. Again, the fortunes of an entire kingdom and the fate of many generations were almost irretrievably committed to the outcome of a single battle. One decisive blow nearly ended all effective future resistance. Too much was staked in a single throw of the dice. Lastly, social disharmony hastened the dissolution of Hindu leadership of the country. By abandoning their wide-ranging interests, the Hindus developed strange obsessions and prejudices that were most inimical to progress and reform. Alberuni, the eminent Muslim scholar and a man of keen perception, noted and deplored the conceit, the smugness and the narrow outlook of the Hindus and, commenting on their fallen condition, recalled that their ancestors were refreshingly different from them. The Hindus were brought face to face with the Muslim invaders when they were in such a degenerate condition.",

    "text": "The newcomers were not barbarians, but most of them were indifferent to the fact that tolerance is the highest attribute of civilized behaviour. The sword having won the most glittering prize for them, they refused to see any greatness in the country and its people. The immense undefended wealth of the land excited their avarice beyond measure, provoking them to acts of unbridled vandalism. Bigotry also played no small part in distorting their mental outlook. Ala-ud-din Khalji, for instance, framed comprehensive rules to hasten the debasement of the sons of the soil and to ensure their exploitation. “No Hindu,” it was decreed, “could hold up his head and in their houses no sign of silver or gold … or of any superfluity was to be seen.” Another monarch, Firuz Shah, claimed that India was a Mussalman country and sought to make good this assertion by encouraging widespread apostasy. Commenting on Firuz’s missionary labours and their success, the Oxford History of India says: “Such was the origin of a large part of the existing Muslim population. Several other sovereigns continued the process of conversion by bribery.” And such, we may add, is the perversity of human affairs that, by a process of political jugglery, the descendants of these very converts were in later centuries transformed into a separate ‘nation’ and given a new homeland by partitioning the country. The disabilities of the Hindus were indeed all-embracing. Since it was impossible on religious grounds to take them into partnership in the government of the country, they were reduced to the status of a disfranchised community, with no political rights of their own. “If their existence,” writes Sir Jadunath Sarkar, the eminent historian of the Moghuls, “was tolerated, it was only to use them as hewers of wood and drawers of water” and as tax-payers “for the benefit of the dominant sect of the faithful”. The list of Hindu disabilities presented by Sarkar is formidable, and the unjust treatment meted out to the community offered the most convincing proof of the need for creating a new order based on justice and tolerance. There were, of course, excellent Muslim princes like Sher Shah and Akbar who refused to surrender their sense of justice and fair-play to fanaticism. But, apart from the fact that there were no enforceable sanctions to ensure the continuity of good and impartial government under successive Sultans, there was an inherent injustice in the very basis of the country's political disposition. No system of government could be morally or legally acceptable so long as the majority of the population was denied a share in the administration in its own right. Such a partnership between the Hindus and the Muslims became virtually impossible when the entire policy of the government was so blatantly religious and communal. To add to these political disabilities, the Hindus were often subjected to religious persecution. Relief for the Hindus, therefore, lay in the recovery of their manhood and in the restoration of their sovereignty.",

    "text": "Such resurgence was inaugurated in the south by the great Rayas of Vijayanagar. Founded in 1336 to stem the tide of Muslim conquest, the Vijayanagar Empire served as the citadel of dharma for nearly two and a half centuries, during which period it rose to great altitudes of prosperity, attaining the highest glory under the government of its wise and valiant ruler, Krishnadeva Raya. The Muslim succession States of the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan had never accepted the existence of a powerful Hindu empire in their proximity as a desirable political disposition, but their predilections were of no importance so long as the Rayas remained invincible. They, however, succeeded in uniting among themselves and in destroying the great empire in the fateful battle of Rakshasa-Tangadi, miscalled Talikot, on January 25, 1565. The victorious armies of the allied Muslim powers fell upon the noble city of Vijayanagar with unexampled savagery. ‘‘Never perhaps in the history of the world,\" writes Robert Sewell, “has such havoc been wrought, and wrought so suddenly, on so splendid a city; teeming with a wealthy and industrious population in the full plenitude of prosperity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged, and reduced to ruins, amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors beggaring description.” Reflecting on the destruction of Vijayanagar, Will Durant writes with deep sadness. “It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace, may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.” After the disappearance of the Vijayanagar Empire, panic and defeatism once again gripped the hearts of the Hindus who began to share the conviction of their conquerors that it was the unalterable ordinance of Providence that the Muslims alone should govern the world. Only a man of genius and of superhuman abilities could combat such fears and frustrations. Shivaji accomplished this task with conspicuous success. The aim of this book is, therefore, simple. It does not seek to unearth any unknown or startling facts or to throw new light on the obscure corners of Maratha history. Its central object is to present Shivaji, not only as a man of great personal rectitude, of broad humanity and of penetrating perception, but also as the maker of history. In trying to appraise his stature we should ask ourselves what the fate and the future of India would have been if he had not been born and fulfilled his mission. If he and his successors had not proved conclusively that military skill and valour are not idle exclusive monopoly of any one race or community, it is inconceivable that the debased Hindus and the exultant Muslims would ever have come together on the plane of equality, accepting India as their common mother-land. In fact, it was the Maratha military victories that ushered in a new era in the Hindu-Muslim relations, destroying once and for all the complexes that had for centuries kept them apart. Such mutual understanding and concord stimulated among them in later centuries a common spirit of nationalism which alone made it possible for India to regain her political independence from the British. We do not know whether Shivaji or the Peshwas could foresee that their actions would lead to such amazing results, but no right-thinking person can deny the fact that that is how history took its course. The following pages are intended to unfold the story of the remarkable man that inaugurated such a revolution in India’s life.",

    "text": "Maharashtra, the home province of Shivaji,\nwas pre-eminently suited for the inauguration of a new era of Hindu re-\nsurgence. The physical features of the region and the traditions and the temper of its inhabitants favoured the pro-\nmotion of such a momentous enterprise. Maharashtra, which holds a pivotal position in the Deccan, consists of two clearly- demarcated geographical regions, namely, the coastal strip call-\ned the Konkan and the plains of the Desh. The Sahyadri mountain ranges, running almost parallel to the western seaboard, have from time immemorial played a decisive part in moulding the political, social and economic life of the people of Maharashtra. Lofty, rugged and in most places barren, the Ghats, as the mountain ranges are also call-\ned, dominate the landscape, towering majestically over the sur-\nrounding valleys and plains and standing sentinel to the free-\ndom of the people. Their numerous passes, little known to outsiders, and the inaccessibility of the rugged terrain around the hills, offered a veritable tactical paradise to men inured to elusive warfare and a logistical nightmare to the invading armies. Here, in these mountain fastnesses, sheltered by deep and wooded valleys, the hillmen of Maharashtra performed prodigies of valour, often defeating and disgracing the mighty hordes that were sent against them time and again. The ex-\nploits of the Marathas were greatly helped by the hill-forts about which we will write at some length in a later chapter. In many places the flat summits were converted into strong-\nholds, whose natural strength and inaccessibility made it rela-\ntively easy for a small but determined and resourceful garrison to hurl defiance at the most powerful enemy. The heavy rains on the Ghats, which in some places are as much as 250 inches in one season, ensured a regular and abundant supply of water to the defenders of the hill-forts. Grant Duff, who wrote his famous history of the Marathas more than a century ago, was perhaps right when he claimed that militarily there was “pro-\nbably no stronger country in the world” than the hilly regions of Maharashtra.\nThe Konkan is a narrow strip of country sandwiched be-\ntween the Arabian sea and the Sahyadri mountains. At no place in this region is the land between the sea and the monu-\ntain more than sixty miles broad. The climate of the Konkan, which receives a heavy rainfall, is generally moist and humid. During the monsoon the rivers overflow their banks, some-\ntimes causing heavy damage to property, before they empty their waters into the sea. Most of them go dry during the hot months. While the land is singularly barren in places where the terrain of the Ghats dominates, the other districts are remarkably fertile and produce abundant crops, especially rice. The Konkan strip is inhabited by an enterprising people who, besides their seafaring traditions, have in the past sup-\nplied some of the ablest rulers, warriors and administrators to Maharashtra and indeed to India.\nThe second geographical region, the Desh, forms a considera-\nble part of Maharashtra, where the bulk of the State’s popula-\ntion lives. The people here are more sturdily built and are pas-\nsionately devoted to their farmlands. The rolling plains are ideally suited for modem agricultural operations. In spite of the insufficiency and the uncertainty of the rains, the Desh has long been the granary of Maharashtra and grows wheat, jawar and cash crops in abundance. Fortunately, Maharashtra is well-served by large rivers like the Godavari, the Bhima, the Krishna, the Koyna, the Tapi, the Wardha and the Vainganga. The comprehensive proposals under the successive five-year plans to harness these rivers for purposes of irrigation and power supply will, when they materialise, not only liberate the peasantry from the vagaries of the monsoon, but also usher in a new era of industrialization in the State.",

    "text": "Dating back to many centuries and recorded by diverse observers, we have copious accounts about the racial char-\nacteristics of the people of Maharashtra, their courage and re-\nsourcefulness, their pride and patriotism, and their hospitality and generous disposition. As in most parts of the country, the Maharashtrians are a composite race, in whose veins the blood of both the Aryans and the non-Aryans flows. The famous Chinese traveller and scholar Hiuen Tsang, who visited Maharashtra about the year 641 during his long stay in India, writes about its people: “Whoever does them a service may count on their gratitude, but no one who offends them will escape their vengeance. If any one insults them, they will risk their lives to wipe out the affront. If any one in trouble ap-\nplies to them, forgetful of themselves they will hasten to help him.” The courage of the Marathas on the battlefield and their skill and determination in facing the most implacable enemy are the subject of high praise both by medieval and modem writers. In the days of Shivaji and the Peshwas and in our own time during the two world wars, the Maratha troops covered themselves with glory by their unflinching courage and valour. They are indeed the sword-arm of the Deccan. The Maharastrians have shown the same sterling qualities in pur-\nsuit of peace and this is exemplified by their devotion to reli-\ngion, art and literature. The simplicity, the frankness, the spirit of independence and the liberal outlook that mark the character of the people of Maharashtra are fully shared by their women-folk. There is nothing weak or pliant about these women who bring lustre to the Maharashtrian homes by their vivacity and by their re-\nfreshingly realistic attitude towards life and its problems. They are in fact looked upon and treated as honoured part-\nners whose counsel is much prized and respected. As we shall see in the following pages, the influence of Jijabai upon her great son, Shivaji, was decisive. Her granddaughter-in-law, Tarabai, has won an honoured place in history by leading her people to victory against the powerful Moghul aggressors. Who has not heard of Ahalyabai Holkar whose piety and noble deeds are still remembered with deep respect? Nor can we forget the celebrated exploits of the Rani of Jhansi during the great uprising of 1857. Such is the glorious tradition of the womanhood of Maharashtra. \nWe may now refer briefly to the history of Maharashtra be-\nfore the advent of Shivaji. Little is known about the period before the doings of the great Shatavahana rulers who flourished for some three hundred years till the second century A.D. Paithan, their capital, was acclaimed as “the jewel and glory of Maharashtra” and abounded in spacious palaces, splendid mansions and gorgeous temples. It was during the sway of the Shatavahanas and their successors that the largest and most famous artificial caves were excavated in the Western Deccan. Bhaja, near Poona, is the oldest cave temple in this part of the country and it set the pace for a further development of shrines of this kind both in size and splendour. Probably excavated about the beginning of the Christian era, the Karla cave temple, with its, great chcdtya hall, is described as the finest single example of such places of worship.",

    "text": "The Shatavahanas were followed by the Traikutakas and the Vakatakas. The latter were powerful monarchs whose govern- ment lasted from 300-600. The Vakatakas were patrons of art and learning and encouraged further excavations of the famous Ajanta caves. The earliest of these caves date back to the second century before Christ, but the series were not completed before the seventh century A.D. “The splendid sculpture and lovely paintings,” writes Professor Basham, “with which they are adorned make them one of the most glorious monuments of India’s past.” As observed earlier, the murals of Ajanta are pronounced to be “among the great- est surviving paintings of any ancient civilization”. Then came the imperial Chalukyas of Badami in the Bijapur district of north Karnatak. They governed extensive regions of the Deccan, including Maharashtra, for about two centuries from the middle of the sixth century till about the middle of the eighth century. Pulakeshin II (A.D. 610-11 to 642) was their greatest ruler and the Aihole inscription claims that the Chalukyan monarch defeated the great Harsha of Kanauj. Pulakeshin’s conquests were extensive and they secured for him sovereignty over three maharashtrakas or great kingdoms con- sisting of 99,000 gramas, a word of doubtful meaning. It was during the reign of this king that the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang visited Maharashtra. Pulakeshin’s fame spread far and wide and he was known in Persia. The Chalukyas were re- nowned patrons of art and architecture. About 752, the Chalukya dynasty was overthrown by Danti durga, a feudatory of the Empire. His successors, the Rashtra- kutas built up another extensive empire which they governed with great wisdom and efficiency. Distinguished among the Rashtra- kuta rulers was Krishna I who was not only a great conqueror but also a mighty builder. He patronised the construction of the famous rock-cut Shiva temple at Ellora which is rightly looked upon as a marvel of architecture. The ascendancy of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan lasted from about 753 to 975. Paying a high tribute to them, Dr. Altekar says that “no other ruling dynasty in the Deccan played such a dominant part in the history of India till the rise of the Marathas as an imperial power in the eighteenth century”. Similar eulogy was bestow- ed upon them by the Muslim writer Masudi who praised the dynasty for its tolerance towards his co-religionists. Refer- ring to the Rashtrakuta Kings as Balhara, Masudi wrote: “There is none among the rulers of Sind and Hind who in his territory respects the Muslims like Raja Balhara. In his king- dom Islam is honoured and protected. And for them mosques and congregational mosques, which are always full, have been built for offering prayers five times/'\nThere was a revival of the Chalukyan hegemony in the Dec- can which lasted with varying degrees of effectiveness till 1189. The last king of the dynasty was stripped of his sovereignty by Bhillama in that year or earlier. Bhillama founded the Yadava dynasty which began to govern the Deccan from Devagiri. The Yadava monarchs were enlightened men who liberally used the resources of their State to promote learning and scholarship. It was during their reign that Marathi took a definite shape, claiming its rightful place among the important languages of the country.",

    "text": "A good deal of uncertainty exists about the actual antiquity of the Marathi language, but it is, without doubt, much more than seven hundred years old. A large part of the Marathi literature of the pre-British period has still to see the light of the day. Even so, there is ample published material, which is being continually augmented by the devoted labours of con- temporary writers. The classical Marathi poetry is of great excellence and the richness and the variety of the language is best reflected in the ballad poetry and folk-songs. Marathi is indeed a vigorous and resilient language, which is wholy un- affected by the prejudices of the so-called purists against en- riching itself by means of judicious adaptations from other tongues. It is precisely because it has protected itself from stagnation and atrophy that Marathi faces the future with great confidence, being determined to develop itself into an effective vehicle of thought and expression in order to meet the manifold needs of a modem society. The first great Marathi author was Mukundaraja whose famous philosophical work Vivekasind.hu was written in 1190. He wrote many other books on philosophy and was greatly honoured for his scholarship. By far the greatest luminary in the Marathi literature is Dnyandev whose historic contribution to the domain of letters will be discussed pre- sently. Much impetus was given to the language and literature by the movements in Maharashtra devoted to the reformation of the social and religious life of the people. Pre-eminent among such crusaders were the inspired band of the poet- saints of the Pandharpur school whose pious labours, as we shall soon see, caused a great revolution in the mental outlook of the common people, thus paving the way for Shivaji’s cam- paign for political emancipation. The sovereignty of Maharashtra and indeed of the entire south suffered a long period of eclipse following the defeat of die Yadava King, Ramachandra, by Ala-ud-din",

    "text": "Khalji in 1294. The circumstances in which Hindu leadership in the south was destroyed by the Muslim invaders have already been discussed in the first chapter. As in the north, perpetual warfare among the rulers of the Deccan and the south gravely undermined their unity and their will to resist the aggressors. It was, for example, the proud claim of the Rashtrakuta imperialists that during the reign of Dhruva, one of their energetic and expansionist sovereigns, a number of his neighbouring princes were either in his prison or were his defeated vassals. Again, Ramachandra, the unfortunate Yadava King, failed to realize, notwithstanding his wisdom and benevolence, that a career of conquest was extremely dangerous when his own State and the entire south were threatened with common ruin by the waxing power of the Muslims. The fact of the matter is that the Hindu princes were obsessed with the misguided belief that territorial aggrandizement was part of their kingly responsibilities and a religious obligation. And when their thrones toppled down, it was not they but the common people who struggled and finally succeeded in winning back the heritage of the land under the inspiration of saints and savants.\nAs we saw earlier, among the many factors that contributed to the downfall of the Hindus was the failure of their social organisation to retain its pristine vigour and resilience. It is true that an essential feature of the caste system was the division of society into a hierarchy, with its principles of status and subordination, but the gradation had caused no great harm so long as the social order functioned basically as a nexus of rights and obligations. It was precisely because of its remarkable adaptability that such diverse races as the Greeks, the Huns and the Scythians that poured into the country from time to time, found a ready asylum in its hospitable and capacious bosom. There would indeed have been no religious problem in India if Hinduism had exercised a similar beneficent influence upon the early settlers of the Islamic faith in this country. Its failure to do so and the absence of a spirit of adjustment and accommodation among the newcomers, especially in the government of the country and in the propagation of their religion, caused a further demoralization in the Hindu ranks. Seldom in history have a defeated people served as a model to their masters in fashioning and regulating their lives. Restoration of cohesion and flexibility to the social system of the Hindus thus became a necessary prelude to the realization of their political aspirations. Religious reformers arose in many parts of the country and turned a powerful stream of criticism on the champions of the status quo, reaction and obscurantism. The Alvars and others of the Tamilnad, the great Basaveswara of Kamatak and his followers known as the Lingayats, the Vaishnava devotees of Bengal led by Chaitanya, Baba Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, and many others, inveighed against caste arrogance, against a blind adherence to ritual and dogma and against unbridled fetish worship. In fact, they declared war on every belief and practice that lengthened the distance between God and man.",

    "text": "The tradition of reform and progress was particularly strong in Maharashtra. A succession of saints and scholars, drawn from every stratum of society, proclaimed the unity of God's creation and from the depth of their own mystic experience, communicated the “symphony of the soul” to their followers. The leader of this great movement was Dnyandev, who flourished towards the end of the thirteenth century. He was a man of amazing versatility and, besides being a saint and a scholar, he was an outstanding literary genius. His masterpiece, Dnyaneshwari, which is an exposition of the Bhagavad Gita, is venerated as a treasure-house of Marathi literature. “All the weight and distinction,” wrote the late Mr. - Justice M. G. Ranade, “that the Marathi language possesses, it owes to Dnyaneshwar” and added that “to realize the depth of meaning that is contained in the language one must study the Dnyaneshwari.” The rendering of a great work in a foreign language is perhaps a form of vandalism. It has been truly said that you have only to translate Cicero to despise him. Bearing this limitation in mind, we may reproduce here a piece from the 'Dnyaneshwari:\n\nWho day and night are from all passion free,\nWithin their holy hearts I love to be,\nDwelling in sanctity.\nHearts of a fervent faith to them belong,\nWhere Dharma reigns; in them that power is strong,\nThat knows right or wrong.\nThey bathe in Wisdom; then their hunger stay,\nWith Perfectness; lo, all in green array,\nThe leaves of Peace are they.\nBuds of Attainment these; columns they are\nIn Valour’s hall; of joy fetched from afar\nEach a full water-jar.\nSo dear the path of bhakti, they despise\nThe great Release; e’en in their sport there lies\nThe wisdom of the wise.\nWith pearls of Peace their limbs they beautify;\nWithin their minds as in a scabbard I,\nThe All-indweller, lie.\nTherefore their love waxes unceasingly,\nThese great-souled ones; not the least rift can be\nBetween their hearts and me:\n\nThis great prophet of Vedism, who bore the weight of his knowledge so lightly, disdained boastful scholars and taught them some memorable lessons in humility. He dismantled the barrier between the common man and the learned few by writing his great works in Marathi, the language of the people. He was foremost in establishing the tradition that language is a cultural instrument par excellence and certainly not a collection of dead sentences. The example of Dnyandev communicating his experiences, thoughts and wisdom through the language of the people was followed by a band of poet-saints who not only revolutionized the Marathi literature, but also stimulated a feeling of oneness among the people. Pandharpur became the centre of their devotions and Vithoba, the presiding deity, the object of their adoration and pious labours. The movement was broad-based and democratic and gathered strength and volume with the efflux of time. Men of humble origin, equipped with no formal education, sang in praise of God with all the fervour of their unsophisticated consciousness.",

    "text": "Namdev, a saint of the fourteenth century, was a tailor and yet the fact of his so-called low birth did not prevent him from writing lyrics of unsurpassed beauty and simplicity, which still work like an enchantment on his readers. Indeed, so great and popular are his literary compositions that they have secured an honourable mention in Guru Nanak’s Granthsaheb. Namdev died at the age of eighty in 1350 and had the satisfaction of watching the amazing career of his female attendant, Janabai, who became an accomplished poetess, her devotional songs winning a distinctive place in the abhanga literature of Maharashtra. Here is a brief example of Namdev's abhorrence of egoism. He says:\n\nFrom Vedic students first the truth I sought,\nAnd found them full of “Thou shalt”, “Thou shalt not”.\nNever shall they possess tranquillity,\nFor mighty in them is the power of “me”.\n\nEknath, described by G. S. Sardesai, the well-known historian of the Marathas, as the “greatest Marathi writer of the sixteenth century,” was a Brahmin who sincerely strove to eliminate all man-made distinctions among his fellow-men. He pleaded for the firm establishment of equality and fraternity in the regulation of human affairs and set a shining example in religious and social democracy by taking his place with the humble and the lowly. The doctrine of equality, so eloquently preached by Eknath and others, crystallized into what is known as the varkari movement, the fundamental aim of which was to ignore the unjust and inequitable caste distinctions and gradations in the Hindu social system. “The varkari preachings of equality,” says an authority, “find willing hearers among the Deccan Marathas who in peace as in war have always a hankering after equality.” Eknath urged for a democratic outlook, not only in the relations between man and man, but also in the domain of letters. He showed exemplary devotion to Marathi, his mother tongue, and asked, if Sanskrit was the creation of gods, whether Marathi was the offspring of thieves. Eknath’s liberal outlook is best portrayed in the following lines:\n\nThey say that women and Shudras belong to a low caste.\nBut when you say that God dwells everywhere, then is He not in the heart of a Shudra?\nHas not a Shudra come from the same place as the Brahman?\nIs he not also composed of five elements?\nHas he no birth; has he no death?\n\nEknath says: You are misguided when you say that a Shudra belongs to the lowest class. The spiritual and cultural renascence in Maharashtra assumed wider proportions as more and more poet-saints of the Pandharpur school came forward to educate and enlighten the mind of the common man. Men and women, drawn from all classes and creeds and from every station in life, constituted this galaxy. Saint Sena was a barber, Sawata, a gardener, Chokhamela, an untouchable; Narahari, a goldsmith and Joga, an oilman. Far from being a disability, their humble origin was their best qualification for teaching the common man the first principles in belief and in social outlook so that, he could emerge all the more readily from the trammels of superstition and ritualism. Indeed, it was the untiring labours of these devoted sons and daughters of God that greatly helped to popularize religion and to give unity of belief, “a tranquillizing daily ritual of prayer and a disciplined perspective of life” among all sections of the people.",

    "text": "The name of Tukaram stands pre-eminent among these popular teachers. This unique saint, whose abhangs are sung daily in millions of homes, sang in praise of Vithoba, his favourite deity, with an ecstasy that surpasses belief. His songs, meant for the learned as well as the lowly, are composed in the language of the common man with uncommon wisdom. Tukaram hailed from the vani or trading community and was a contemporary of Shivaji. It was both beyond his scope and his temperament to preach the sermon of political revolt to the people, but by stimulating in them a passionate devotion to their faith, he paved the way, perhaps unwittingly, for the advent of swarajya under the leadership of the great liberator. As a Marathi writer pertinently remarks, the region of Tukaram’s ministrations became a prolific ground for the recruitment of soldiers to Shivaji’s army. The following passage vividly portrays Tukaram’s capacity for complete self-surrender to God. He sings: “This is my prayer to Thee, O God. I place my head on Thy feet. Let my body be where it likes, but let my mind always rest on Thy feet. Let me spend my time in meditating on Thee. Let me turn away from body and mind and wealth. Release me at the time of death from such dangers as phlegm and wind and bile. So long as my senses are whole, I have called upon Thee, in order that, Thou mightest help me ultimately.”\n\nRamdas Swami, who was born in 1608 and survived his royal disciple, Shivaji, by a year, was cast in a different mould from that of the religious teachers that preceded or were contemporaneous with him. He was indeed a saint without the sackcloth. The tireless labours of a succession of poet-saints, extending over many centuries, had created among the people of Maharashtra a sense of oneness in their social and spiritual concerns, thus preparing the ground for a rapid growth of political consciousness. Ramdas Swami took full advantage of these favourable conditions. His heart bled at the sight of poverty and suffering and he was roused to indignation at the degradation of his people and their unchallenging submission to tyranny and oppression. He was a Brahmin, but he attacked the priestly class with devastating frankness for its failure to maintain high standards of personal rectitude, of learning and of leadership. He exposed the folly of despising worldly wisdom and refused to countenance any extreme form of “other-worldliness”. It is precisely because Ramdas’s teachings constituted a remarkable combination of the spiritual with the mundane that they became most acceptable to Shivaji. The Swami advised his disciple “to adorn his body, not with clothes and ornaments, but with shrewdness and wisdom”. To spread the message of God, to protect the poor, the pious and the helpless, to strive for the well-being of his subjects, to remain eternally vigilant, and to practise the virtue of forbearance and tolerance—these, declared Ramdas Swami, were the essential qualifications of a good and great ruler. He assured Shivaji that he enjoyed all these noble attributes in full measure and bade him Godspeed in his mighty undertaking. “Activism,” declare the learned authors quoted earlier, was the most characteristic feature of Ramdas’s teachings. “No wonder,” they add, “that with this teaching, he",

    "text": "helped the foundation of the Maratha kingdom as no other saint had done before.” Conditions were thus most propitious in Maharashtra for striking boldly, in the cause of independence, but the task could be undertaken only by a man of genius. Maharashtra abounded in powerful Maratha chieftains, but they had all sworn undying loyalty to one or the other of the three surviving succession States of the Bahmani kingdom, namely, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Golkonda. Lukhji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed, Shivaji’s grandfather from his mother’s side, was the premier Maratha nobleman at the court of the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar. He was in command of ten thousand horse, for the support of which he enjoyed large estates. He was a man of great distinction and affluence and was widely respected both in the realm of his sovereign and outside. But his ambition never transgressed the bounds prescribed for a dutiful feudatory—a melancholy fact which did not prevent him from holding himself in the highest esteem, especially in his dealings with his fellow-Marathas. Shivaji's own ancestors, the Bhosles of Verul,* a village near Daulatabad, were in the service of the Sultans of Ahmadnagar. In conformity with the convention of the time, they claimed descent from a remote scion of the Sisodia dynasty of Udaipur in Rajasthan. Maloji, Shivaji’s grandfather, was an ambitious and determined person and it was these estimable qualities, more than his lineage, that brought him to the fore. Maloji and his brother, Vithoji, did not inherit any great fortune, but the absence of material prosperity at the beginning of their career was amply compensated for by their supreme confidence in themselves. Both were sturdily built and both were endowed with an abundance of courage and daring. They were never in doubt about their ability to forge to the forefront by their own resourcefulness. Maloji began his career by taking service under Jadhavrao, but the social distance that separated him from his master never daunted this determined man from entertaining the most vaulting ambitions both for himself and his family. His pertinacity and his value to the Sultan as a competent soldier eventually gave him success in full measure. After much hesitation, the proud Jadhavrao gave the hand of his daughter, Jijabai, in marriage to Maloji’s son, Shahaji/the illustrious father of Shivaji. Bijapur claimed the allegiance of a larger number of Maratha families among whom the Mores were pre-eminent. The Mores of Javli, near Mahableshwar, the famous hill-station in the State of Maharashtra, rose to power by their unflagging devotion to their Muslim overlords and by their ruthless campaign of aggression against their own kinsmen. They received the hereditary title of Chandrarao for the conspicuous display of courage by the head of the family in a critical situation and enjoyed a plenitude of prestige and influence in the hilly region till a just retribution overtook them for their perfidious conduct towards the great liberator. “The invariable submission,” writes Grant Duff, “manifested by this Raja probably induced the government to exact little more than a nominal tribute from districts producing so little, and which had always been in disorder under Mahomedan management” The Nimbalkars of Phaltan, whose original surname was Pawar, were among the other Maratha pillars of the Bijapur Sultanate. Jagpalrao Naik was a shining light of the Nimbalkar family and, both in his ambitions and in his ability to realize them, he bore a striking resemblance to Maloji Bhosle, upon whom he bestowed his sister, Dipabai, in marriage. The union of the two distinguished families was of much significance and the advocacy of Jagpalrao on behalf of his brother-in-law played no small part in influencing the decision of the chief of Sindkhed to marry his daughter to Shahaji. Though small in size, Phaltan survived many political vicissitudes and functioned as a feudatory of the British Government in India till, along with the other Deccan States, it was integrated into Bombay State, following the merger agreement of February 1948. It is profitless to pursue further the story of the Maratha vassals of the Muslim rulers, but the Ghorpades deserve special mention.",

    "text": "With a few exceptions, the Ghorpades played an outstanding part both during the war of independence and later, thus winning an honoured place for themselves in the annals of Maharashtra. Originally known as Bhosles, they secured the new surname, following the display of exceptional resourcefulness by one of their ancestors. During the Bahmani dynasty, a daring Bhosle scaled what was regarded as an impregnable fort in the Konkan with the aid of an iguana or ghorpad, thus winning for himself and his descendants the new surname. Among the Maratha captains that hastened the destruction of the Moghul Empire after the death of Shivaji by demoralizing and defeating Aurangzeb’s armies, the name of Santaji Ghorpade stands supreme. But the record of some of the Ghorpades of Mudhol was darkened by treachery and intrigue against their own countrymen. In the wars between Bijapur and Vijayanagar, the sword of Mudhol was always employed against the great Hindu empire. In 1520, Maloji, the ruler of Mudhol, laid down his life in one such conflict in an attempt to save that of his master, the Sultan. His son, Karansingh, out-heroded Herod by enthusiastically participating in the great coalition of the Muslim Powers of the Deccan that led to the destruction of the Vijayanagar Empire in 1565. The intrigues and machinations of Baji Ghorpade in Shivaji's time indicated the depth of degradation to which some of the members of the family had descended. Indeed, selfishness, treachery and an abject submission to Muslim authority were the triple evils that dominated the careers of most of the Marathas before the advent of Shivaji. They were animated by no noble ambitions nor were they inspired by any high sense of purpose. Quick to take offence, they fought among themselves with bitter animosity, much to the advantage and delectation of their Muslim sovereigns. A mere rood of land, the headship of a petty village and an insult, real or imaginary, could set off the most murderous strife among the chieftains, while their principal concern ought to have been to unite and to strive for the restoration of the country’s greatness. Grant Duff writes : “Neither national sentiment, nor unity of language and religion, prevented their fighting against each other. Not only did Mahratta subjects of these governments (namely, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar and Golkonda) stand in array opposed to each other, but the most active enmity was frequently evinced between members of the same family. They fought with rancour wherever individual dispute or hereditary feuds existed; and that spirit of rivalry in families, which was fomented by the kings of the Bahmani dynasty, was one means of keeping the Mahrattas poised against each other in the dynasties which succeeded them.” The pestilential doctrine of divide and rule has always proved a potent instrument in the hands of aggressors to keep their subject peoples in a state of helplessness. The Muslim rulers reaped a rich harvest from Maratha disunity in precisely the same manner as the British Government in India profited from Indian disunity in later centuries. By skilfully playing one Maratha chieftain against another, they insured and strengthened the loyalty of both factions to their own person and dynasty. Having thus secured the adhesion of these powerful but misguided men, they could play with impunity with the life and honour of individual Marathas, no matter how highly they were placed. The extent of the internecine quarrels in Maharashtra is best illustrated by the uncompromising hostility that plagued the relations between the Jadhavs of Sindkhed and Shivaji’s father and grandfather, although the two families had been united by the sacred ties of marriage. It was the certainty of the knowledge that no retribution would overtake him that the Nizamshah could summon courage to massacre treacherously such a powerful military leader as Lukhji Jadhavrao, his sons and his kinsmen on July 25, 1629. No Maratha raised his little finger in an attempt to compel the Sultan to atone for his crime. Shivaji’s own father, the powerful Shahaji, could be imprisoned, humbled and humiliated with impunity by the Bijapur Sultan, despite the fact that the stability of the State depended in no small measure upon the sword-arm of the Maratha nobleman. There cannot be a shadow of doubt that the unquestioning loyalty of the Marathas was ill-requited by their Muslim masters.",

She suffered many privations and humiliations during her wanderings through dangerous and inhospitable regions in her desperate attempts to elude the Moghul troops. She was eventually caught and interned at Kondana or Sinhgad, the famous hill-fortress near Poona. She, however, successfully shielded her new-born child from the difficulties and dangers that surrounded her by concealing him in an unknown place like “a flame in a vessel”. The married life of Shahaji and Jijabai was not quite happy. Apart from the fact that he had taken another wife, which was, * The actual date of Shivaji’s birth is the subject of much learned debate and discussion. Whether he was born on the date indicated above or on February 19, 1630, as some authorities contend, the basic facts about his career and achievements remain unaffected. t A NEW STAR RISES 83 however, in perfect accord with the prevailing custom, there was an obvious incompatibility of temperament between the two. Jijabai was a sensitive and proud lady who had seen much at Ahmadnagar to cause her deep distress about the unhappy condition of her countrymen. The iron had entered her soul, following her harrowing experiences soon after Shivaji’s birth. If a high-born and influential lady could not gain immunity from persecution, it was easy to imagine the plight of the common, defenceless people. Besides experiencing the imperious will of his wife, Shahaji could not escape the premonition that his son, when he came of age, would not be readily amenable to paternal discipline, except on his own impossible terms. When peace was restored in the Deccan, Shahaji entered the Bijapur service in October 1636. There, in the capital of his new master, he received ample evidence of his son’s recalcitrance and spirit of rebellion. A growing lad of ten, Shivaji spent the most impressionable three years at the Adilshabi court, which, thanks to his precocity, gave him a valuable insight into the political system of the Muslim kingdom. Introduced to Mahmud Adilshah, he declined to make the traditional obeisance of servility, contenting himself with the manlier Maratha style of salutation. Perhaps, it required all the persuasive eloquence of Shahaji to pacify the irate Sultan and his mischievous courtiers, who regarded the advent of the new Maratha chieftain to the court as an unpardonable invasion of their own interests. The city of Bijapur was large, well-populated and abounded in stately mansions and splendid tombs and mosques. There was wealth, luxury and refinement, but to the common folk these amenities were as remote as the stars in the sky.",

Apart from the violent tenor of life inevitable in such a society, it was obvious that the majority of the Sultan’s Hindu subjects were oppressed intermittently but irritatingly.’' 34 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT In this city of splendour and barbarism, where “processions of execution were as frequent as processions of holiday and festival”, Shivaji saw much that both instructed and repelled him. He saw how persistent attempts to impose the hegemony of the minority over the majority with the aid of intolerance and oppression had led to an almost irreconcilable estrangement between the two communities. He also saw how the noblest sons of the Maratha race prided themselves upon being privileged to place their heads on the foot-stool of the Sultan. Burning with anger, the mettlesome youth created a stir in the capital and gravely compromised his father’s position by registering an open protest against cow slaughter. His spirited attack on the Muslim butchers was an unheard of occurrence in the city. The parting of the ways between father and son came sooner than was probably anticipated by either. Shahaji, who was directed to proceed to the south on a military expedition, welcomed the opportunity to send his wife and son to Poona, the seat of his jagir, so that the youth might no longer implicate himself and his father by getting into new scrapes. Thenceforward the company of his father became rare and uncertain for Shivaji. He, therefore, began to lean heavily upon his mother whom he gradually raised to the pedestal of a deity, The ways of his father were indeed different. Shahaji was brave, chivalrous and generous to a fault. He was also a great patron of learning; indeed, he was endowed with all the gifts and abilities necessary for raising the standard of revolt. But he recoiled from that undertaking, seeking solace from the belief that he, at any rate, was not equipped to tempt fate. He, therefore, felt no uneasiness when drawing the sword against the remnants of the Vijayanagar Empire in the south. Nor did he allow himself to be roused to anger when the Bijapur armies plundered the great pilgrim centres in the south and earned away the rich booty to the capital. Shahaji was a valiant soldier, but unhappily he was not gifted with a wide-ranging mind When he met his death by accident in January 1664, he had, however, the supreme satisfaction of seeing his son grow in power and glory as an independent sovereign. A NEW STAR RISES 35 The task of preparing Shivaji for his historic mission fell upon two outstanding persons. His mother, a woman of great perception and of masterful personality, decided that her son, in whom alone she now found the solace of her life, should not on any account seek a career for himself under a Muslim monarch. Like Euripides, she defined a slave as a man who had lost his liberty of thought, opinion and action. It was impossible that Shivaji should sink into ignoble anonymity by joining the crowd of enslaved sardars at the Muslim courts. He should be prepared for a truly noble and exalted task, namely, the liberation of Maharashtra and through it of India from the incubus of intolerance, oppression and misrule. In this great undertaking, Jijabai was enthusiastically supported by Dadaji Konddev, the kulkarni of the village of Mal-than, who was, in the words of Grant Duff, one of Shahaji's “most confidential men”. Dadaji was much more than a village officer. He was shrewd, competent, industrious and, what was rare in his time, absolutely honest. The jagir extended from Junnar in the north to Wai in the south and “included Chakan, Supa, Baramati and Indapur as the principal Talukas”. Dadaji built a large house for the young jagirdar and his mother at Poona and set about improving the condition of the village which was then little better than an unhealthy and robber-infested place.",

    "text": "He hunted down the wild animals that roamed in the region and restored law and order by firmly suppressing robbery and brigandage. The magnitude of the reform undertaken and accomplished by him and the blessing which it conferred on the people of the jagir is best illustrated by the following description of the lawlessness that had prevailed before he took charge of the estates. “To grow a crop.” say Kincaid and Parasnis, “was merely to invite a troop of hostile cavalry to cut it and probably kill its owner. Nor was this the only danger. The invaders usually carried away with them the children of both sexes and the young women and forcibly converted them. Thanks to Dadaji’s efficient management, confidence revived and more and more hillmen descended to the plains to till the lands that were offered to them on easy 86 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT and attractive terms. Cultivation increased, and with it, prosperity returned to the jagir. Fruit trees were planted on an extensive scale, and the mangoes of Shivapur are still greatly prized in the district. Dadaji’s personal rectitude became proverbial and made a profound impression upon the mind of his ward. Great care was taken by Jijabai and the Brahmin tutor in preparing Shivaji for his responsibilities. He was taught history in order to make history. Dadaji was a learned man and showed great earnestness in painting before the young patriot an inspiring picture of India’s ancient greatness, her spiritual and material splendour and her monumental achievements. He described to the wondering lad the heritage of the country, as portrayed in its great religious and literary works, including the Epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Arjuna, the incomparable archer, and Bhima, the club-wielding Hercules of the Epics, were held before Shivaji as exemplars of ancient India’s brave and skilful warriors. The virtues of Dharmaraja were explained to him to prove that truth and goodness would always prevail when judiciously supported by strength. . The Ramayana also became an enthralling theme for Dadaji’s discourse: And ’tis told by ancient sages, during Rama’s happy reign, Death untimely, dire diseases, came not to his subject men; Widows wept not in their sorrow for their lords untimely lost, Mothers wailed not in their anguish for their babes by Yama crost; Robbers, cheats and gay deceivers tempted not with lying word Neighbour loved his righteous neighbour, and the people loved their lord, Trees their ample produce yielded as returning seasons went, And the earth in grateful never-failing harvest lent. Rains descended in their season, never came the blighting gale, Rich in crop and rich in pasture was each soft and smiling vale, Loom and anvil gave their produce, and the tilled and fertile soil, ' And the nation lived rejoicing in their old ancestral toil. A NEW STAB RISES 37 This is utopia par excellence, but the receptive mind of Shivaji accepted it as a feasible goal. At any rate, it was perfectly within the region of possibility to rescue Maharashtra from the vale of tears. Besides these heart-warming stories, he was instructed in the simple wisdom embodied in the sayings and songs of the saints of Maharashtra. In short, all the latent impulses in the young man were roused to active consciousness by reminding him of India’s past greatness and of her present prostrate condition. In addition to the training of the mind and the intellect, Shivaji was taught all the accomplishments necessary for the profession of arms. Perhaps the most significant part of his education was the opportunity presented to him to learn invaluable lessons from the book of life. As part of the practical training of the young man in the administration of the jagir, Dadaji often took him to different parts of the fief during his tours of inspection. What he saw and heard during these visits was a great revelation to Shivaji. He soon developed a passionate attachment to the country around the Sahyadri hills known as Maval and its hardy inhabitants called Mavlas.",

    "text": "The unadorned beauty of nature, represented by the rugged and tree-clad hills and valleys, exercised an irresistible fascination on him. Not only on the occasion of Dadaji’s tours, but independently and more often, he ran to the hills around Poona and held long and intimate communion with nature. He saw with the eye of a born military leader that no terrain could offer better scope for the Parthian methods of warfare. He wandered widely but purposefully in the wilderness 1 and became familiar with every nook and corner and every glade and thicket of the forests. The hills and valleys unfolded their secrets to the diligent explorer whose wanderings, besides hardening his body, inspired him with lofty resolutions. Shivaji evinced a sincere and spontaneous affection and admiration for the humble hill-folk, whose rough exterior, he realized, merely screened their sterling qualities. They were brave, loyal, hardy, hospitable and industrious. Despite their poverty and subjection to unjust government, they had not abandoned .38 stttvajt : THE PORTRAIT’ OF A PATRIOT the old virtues of rustic simplicity, of honest toil, and of unaffected devotion to their ancestral faith. With such inestimable qualities in them, it was possible to organize them into an irresistible force and to win great causes. “Shivaji,” says Grant Duff, “was always partial to the Mavlis” because he observed that “they were active and intelligent in anything to which they had been accustomed, and remarkably faithful in situations of trust.” The earnestness of Shivaji and his attractive personality fascinated young and old that came near him. To the old beards, from whom he heard harrowing tales of suffering and humiliation, he confided the hopeful message of early deliverance. It was a period of anxiety and uncertainty, but the wise men of the villages soon discovered in the young master a true incarnation of courage and fortitude. They readily assured him of their own co-operation and that of their sons in his crusade for national independence. To the young men in particular the attraction of Shivaji’s personality was irresistible. Though the son of a nobleman, his democratic attitude, his affability, and his spirit of comradeship won for him the undying loyalty of the flower of Maharashtra’s manhood. Gomaji Naik Panasambal, Yesaji Kank, Tanaji Malusare, Baji Pasalkar and Bajirao Jedhe were among his earliest adherents. Some of these men enjoyed much prestige and influence in their villages and their adhesion to",

    "text": "Shivaji’s cause gave a great fillip to the patriotic movement. A shrewd judge of men and things, Dadaji clearly foresaw the coming events and inwardly rejoiced at his protege’s noble incli- nations. The old Brahmin, however, owed a responsibility to Shahaji and shrank from the risk of being accused of negligence in the performance of his duties or of conniving at what an adherent of the status quo would undoubtedly have regarded as the growing intransigence and “disloyalty” of Shivaji. Even so, hig protests to the young man were mild and were merely intended to ensure that Shahaji was not implicated by his son’s adventures.\\n\\nFor his jpart, Shivaji was careful not to embarrass Dadaji and regulated his conduct accordingly, without at the same time compromising with any of his cherished principles. The old and trusted friefad of the family died on March 7, 1647 which released the fledgling genius from all unnecessary con- straints, his future course of action being guided almost entirely by the exigencies of the situations that confronted him from time to time. Besides, he was fortified in his resolution by the benedictions of the dying man who, to quote Grant Duff, “advised him to prosecute his plans of independence; to pro- tect Brahmins, kine, and cultivators; to preserve the temples of the Hindus from violation; and to follow the fortune which lay before him”. It was impossible for Shivaji to adopt any other course. Apart from the dying wish of his respected benefactor, his own incli- nations were strongly in favour of striving for an independent career. “There seems to be little doubt,” says Rawlinson, “that Shivaji grew up with a genuine sense of a mission— that his career was inspired by a real desire to free his country from what he considered to be a foreign tyranny.” Moreover, his mother’s firm conviction about the need for establishing a new polity in the country through his instrumentality admitted of no doubt or vacillation on his part in the choice of his career.\\n\\nApart from these considerations, everyone of which was weighty; the situation in the country clinched the issue. In Bija- pur, to which his father had pledged his loyalty, a tyrant and a bigot was on the throne. Sir Jadunath Sarkar draws attention to a Muslim authority’s detailed description of the unbridl- ed oppression of the Hindus by Mahmud Adilshah as a deliberate State policy. Besides, “the inconsistency, intrigue and bloodshed which stained the court of Bijapur” were the most decisive deterrents to Shivaji’s acceptance of service under its Government. “I have seen,” declared Bis- marck, “three kings naked and the sight was not always a pleasant onel’\\ The sight of a single nude sovereign was evidently too much for Shivaji! A career in the Moghul Empire was fraught with even graver consequences. “The imperialists,” to quote Sarkar again, “had killed Kheloji Bhosle, his uncle, and their superior resources and organization made it unlikely for the Hindus of the Deccan to enjoy greater toleration or power under them than under the weaker and smaller sultanates close at hand”. Shivaji, there- fore, gladly responded to the natural bent of his mind and took the solemn decision to draw the sword in the cause of inde- pendence, depending for his success on the righteousness of his undertaking and the spontaneous support of his people.",

    "text": "forewarned of coming events. One day, his scouts brought him news that a large treasure was on its way from Kalyan, then as now an important town at the head of the Bombay creek, to Bijapur to relieve the financial embarrassment of the Sultan's Government. The route of the convoy was through the rugged hills of Maharashtra and it would have been the height of unwisdom on the part of Shivaji not to annex such a great prize. He made careful preparations to intercept the convoy and to capture the treasure by surprising the guards. The Marathas fell upon the Bijapur troops as the convoy was laboriously negotiating a difficult ascent along a mountain pass and gained possession of the treasure by killing or dispersing the Sultan’s soldiers. The loss of life in the skirmish on Shivaji's side was negligible, but the families of the men that fell in action were generously rewarded, while the wounded were suitably looked after and provided for. Shivaji had no illusions about the consequences of his open defiance of the Bijapur Government and in order to gather more strength for consolidating his position, he made a surprise attack on the forts in the vicinity of Kalyan and annexed as many as nine of them to his territory. More important among these acquisitions were Lohgad, Rajmachi and Rairi. Rajmachi is a stupendous fortified hill at the foot of the Bhor pass, while Rairi eventually won the distinction of becoming Shivaji’s capital, as much on account of its natural strength as because of its accessibility to the plains of the Konkan and the mountainous regions of Maharashtra. The traveller from Poona to Bombay can see the lofty fortress of Lohgad, with the sister hill-fort of Visapur, perched on the heights of the Bhor Ghat. While Shivaji was making these important conquests, one of his officers made a surprise attack on Kalyan and captured it. Kalyan was the seat of the Muslim Governor of the Bijapur Government and, besides being a prosperous port, was the chief “point of departure for the numerous pilgrim-ships plying between Western India and Mecca”. At this time, the office of Governor was held by an Arab foreigner called Mulla Ahmad, one of the leading nobles of Bijapur. His administration was lax and unpopular and a change in the government was heartily welcomed by the people. “The capture of Kalyan,” says Professor H. G. Rawlinson, “was the signal for a general uprising. The people were tired of Mahommedan misgovernment, and Shivaji prudently established Dadaji’s wise revenue system in each of his fresh acquisitions. Fort after fort opened its gates and the Konkan, as far as the border of Sawantwadi, was soon in the hands of the Marathas.” The Government of the new province was placed in charge of Abaji Sondev, a trusted officer of the Maratha State. Many pleasant episodes have been recorded in the annals of Maharashtra to illustrate Shivaji’s abounding generosity, his innate goodness and his sense of rectitude when dealing with women. It was customary for Mulla Ahmad, the dispossessed Governor, to spend most of his time away from his charge in order to be close to his sovereign at Bijapur. When Shivaji conquered Kalyan, the family of Mulla Ahmad fell into the hands of the Marathas. The young daughter-in-law of the Muslim nobleman, a woman of striking beauty, was sent to Shivaji. The great Maratha rose as the lady was brought into his presence and, bowing to her graciously, complimented her on her charming appearance, exclaiming: “How I wish that my mother had been as beautiful as you are! I would then have been more handsome!” The assembled persons were dumbfounded at the spectacle. By his simple and soft-spoken words, addressed to a captured lady, Shivaji proclaimed his firm adherence to the noble policy of respecting women, no matter to which religion or country or station in life they belonged. To give another example of Shivaji’s large-heartedness during his expedition around Kalyan, he captured Prabalgad, near Panvel, then under the control of a Bijapur officer called Kesari Singh. The commandant was killed in action and his family sought refuge in a corner of the fort, fearing that the Maratha leader would put them to the sword. When the report of their panic and distress was brought to Shivaji’s notice, he promptly went to the place where the mother and other members of Kesari Singh’s family had taken shelter and prostrated himself before the lady as a token of his respect for her. Despite her grief, the woman was mollified by his kindly behaviour and was sent back to her village in a palanquin, loaded with riches and with a liberal provision for the surviving members of the family. The mortal remains of the dead captain were consigned to the flames according to the prescribed rites and with all the honours due to a valiant foe. Such examples of Shivaji’s sense of fair play and generosity towards his adversaries greatly increased his reputation as a high-principled and humane conqueror.",

    "text": "Bijapur was now roused to a fuller realization of the magnitude of the peril that threatened it from Maharashtra. But there was no change in the imbecility of the court which clung to the absurd belief that a great movement, deriving its strength and sanctions from popular support, could be smothered by wielding the simple but despicable weapon of reprisals. The advisers of Mahmud Adilshah deluded their monarch with the suggestion that Shivaji could be reduced to submission by arresting and threatening the life of his father. Decadent governments, with premonitions of their impending doom, commit the most unpardonable blunders in a desperate attempt to save themselves from dissolution. Shahaji had rendered distinguished military services to Bijapur and had helped it to carry arms deep into the south. Besides losing his eldest son in one of the southern campaigns, he had, with the resignation of a fatalist, accepted his subordinate status almost as a divine dispensation. This man, who had dedicated the best part of his chequered career to the advancement of his Muslim rulers’ cause, was unceremoniously arrested on August 6, 1648 by the commander-in-chief of the Bijapur army which was then engaged in investing the famous Jinji fort in the district of South Arcot. The details of the part played by Baji Ghoxpade, the chief of Mudhol, in this sordid affair are not clear, but the fact of his collusion with Shahaji’s captors is undoubted. The proud Maratha nobleman was sent in chains to Bijapur as if he was a common felon. Shivaji was in a dilemma since further inroads into the Bijapur territory would undoubtedly have sealed the fate of his father. But the edifice of independence he had built with such patience and foresight could not be allowed to be destroyed for any personal reasons, however weighty they might be. He took counsel with his mother and the wise men around him, but opinion was divided. Eventually, he decided to appeal to the Great Moghul to intercede with the Bijapur Darbar on his behalf. He offered to serve the Empire with distinction if his prayer was granted. The weight of evidence disproves the general belief that Shahaji's release was accomplished through Shah Jahan’s intervention. Sarkar categorically discounts it by maintaining that the Emperor “always treated Muhammad Adil Shah with marked courtesy and kindness, while Shahaji was bitterly hated at the Mughal Court for the trouble he had given them in 1633-1636”. It is, however, possible that the Bijapur Government belatedly realized the monumental folly of humiliating and punishing a powerful officer without any evidence to establish his guilt. Shahaji’s Muslim friends at the court must also have played their part in hastening his release and in the restoration of his property and military contingent. The reconciliation between the Sultan and his Sardar was perhaps complete. Years later, on May 26, 1658, Ali Adilshah, the son and successor of the guilty monarch, assured Shahaji of his complete confidence in him and promised not to inflict any vicarious punishment on him for the “disloyalty and audacity” of his son, Shivaji. The Sardar was exhorted to serve the Bijapur throne with his customary zeal and devotion, rejoicing in the knowledge that his sovereign and master would not entertain any allegations and calumnies against him in future. Shivaji did not, however, forget the affront to his illustrious father. No special act of retaliation was necessary against the Bijapur Government since the whole purpose and significance of his career was to overrun it. But the Maratha chieftains who refused to countenance his grand project and, what is worse, who missed no opportunity in their attempts to defeat it, deserved special attention. Notable among such misguided noblemen was Chandrarao More of Javli, about whom a brief reference has already been made in an earlier chapter. The Mores were men of great influence who had acquired large territories around Mahableshwar and accumulated a vast amount of wealth by an unashamed policy of appeasement and subservience to the Sultans of Bijapur. They refused to see the signs of the times or to note the ferment that had begun to change the minds of the people and determine them to oppose misrule and religious persecution.",

    "text": "With Mores, as with other Sardars, loyalty to the Bijapur Raj had become an obsession and a disease of the soul. Nothing could move their hearts and nothing could convince them about the paramount need for destroying the iniquitous status quo. Their most ambitious and exalted aim was to serve the Sultan with undeviating loyalty and to strive for their own advancement. In pursuit of this two-fold objective, they were prepared to sacrifice any principle. Chandrarao gave shelter and facilities to Baji Shamraj, who had been sent by the Bijapur king with a large force to capture Shivaji by fair or foul means. The fact that the designs of the treacherous foe were frustrated by Shivaji did not diminish the enormity of the guilt of Chandrarao who deserved condign punishment for so flagrantly violating the obligations of a neighbour to the great liberator. Nevertheless, with exemplary patience and perseverance, Shivaji attempted to cure the Mores of their warped mentality. He tried to convince them of the paramount necessity of establishing a system of government that ensured religious freedom and promoted the welfare of the people. He pointed out the injustice of a dispensation which condemned the real producers of wealth and prosperity to the status of serfs so that their masters could with impunity abandon themselves to luxury and indolence and saunter away their lives in secluded places, refusing to recognize that there existed an entity called the common man. It took years for Shivaji to realize that the Mores were least susceptible to the promptings of patriotism. After all, you cannot make silk purses out of a sow’s ears! Only the argument of force could wean them from their selfish and suicidal course. Shivaji accordingly took the deliberate decision to destroy the Mores by any means. Being in possession of Javli, they held a key position which effectively prevented his expansion in the south and south-west. All the leading men in the area, such as Kanhoji Jedhe and Haibatrao Silimkar, were Shivaji’s enthusiastic supporters and it was impossible to allow the common cause to suffer merely because a misguided chieftain obstinately refused to abandon his selfishness. \"The State of Javli”, says Sarkar, \"by its position, barred the path of Shivaji’s expansion in the south and south-west. Chandrarao thwarted Shivaji’s policy of drawing the various Mavli headmen to his side, and tried to form in that locality an anti-Shivaji coalition in concert with the neighbouring Adil Shahi governor, because the progress of Shivaji in that region would have naturally led to the loss of More’s power and independence.” Shivaji, therefore, decided that there should be no Mores at Javli. He entrusted the task of encompassing their end to Raghunath Ballal Korde and Sambhaji Kavji, two of his trusted comrades, who overran Javli with complete success. Most of the leading members of the More family were killed, while their large accumulations of wealth were confiscated. Shivaji himself promptly moved into the town and, in January 1656, annexed the important and extensive principality to his own government. His gain in prestige and resources was immense. The conquest gave him control over “all the twelve Mavals from Junnar to Wai,” while the hardy hillmen and the intellectuals of the region supplied soldiers to his army and administrators to his government. Another notable achievement of Shivaji on this occasion was the adhesion of Baji Prabhu, the deshpande of Javli, to his cause. The heroic sacrifice of this man in defence of his new master will be described in a later chapter. Shivaji built a fort on the crest of the hill commanding the valley of the famous Parghat and appropriately gave the new stronghold the name of Pratapgad, which, in less than four years after its construction, became the scene of his historic encounter with Afzal Khan. The fort was built by Moropant Pingle who gave much care to ensure its impregnability. The Javli episode furnished one more proof to the people of Maharashtra that Shivaji",

Baji had assisted in Shahaji's arrest and provided military aid to Bijapur during the siege of Panhala in 1660. Shahaji urged Shivaji to avenge this betrayal.  In November 1664, Shivaji attacked Mudhol, sacked its treasury, and slew Baji in battle. Despite this, Shivaji installed Baji's son, Maloji, as the new ruler, demonstrating that his aim was not annexation but justice. He later wrote to Maloji, expressing a desire to reconcile and rebuild their relationship.  Among Shivaji's many exploits, his defeat of Afzal Khan, the night attack on Shaista Khan, and his escape from Agra stand out. Shivaji's rising power alarmed Bijapur. After the death of Mohmud Adilshah, the Dowager Queen Badi Sahiba, ruling for her son Ali Adilshah, resolved to reclaim lost territories and sent a powerful army against Shivaji. Afzal Khan, a formidable general known for his strength, diplomacy, and treachery, accepted the command. He was tasked with capturing or murdering Shivaji through deceitful means.  Afzal Khan set out with a well-equipped army of ten thousand cavalry.  His reputation for ruthlessness preceded him, exemplified by the murder of his wives before embarking on the campaign.  During his march, he desecrated Hindu temples, including the shrine of Vithoba at Pandharpur and Tuljapur, the site of Shivaji's guardian deity, Goddess Bhawani.  Shivaji, aware of the Khan's reputation and actions, retreated to Pratapgad fortress to plan his strategy.",

He attempted to incite local disaffection against Shivaji, but his efforts were largely ineffective due to his own harsh conduct and the growing support for Shivaji.  The Khan sent a seemingly conciliatory letter to Shivaji, inviting him to a meeting and promising rewards and recognition from the Bijapur court.  Shivaji, recognizing the deception, deliberated on his course of action.  He consulted with his mother, Jijabai, and his advisors, who offered divided counsel.  Ultimately, guided by his religious convictions and intuition, he decided to meet the Khan. His plan was to persuade the Khan to return peacefully, but if war was inevitable, he would choose the battleground.  Shivaji sent secret orders to his armies in the Konkan and the Ghats to position themselves near Pratapgad. He then replied to Afzal Khan, accepting the invitation and expressing his desire to seek the Khan's advice.",

Would he, therefore, condescend to proceed to Pratapgad and accept his humble hospitality? Every arrangement would be made for his reception on a scale appropriate to his eminence. The letter served its purpose admirably. Afzal Khan suppressed his initial apprehensions about the wisdom of meeting his adversary on his own ground by fetching his iron muscles and comparing his own enormous physical strength with the small build of Shivaji. The great dissembler was hoist with his own petard ! Shivaji’s carefully worded and diplomatic reply was sent to Afzal Khan with Krishnaji Bhaskar who was accompanied on his return journey to Wai by Pantaji Gopinath, a man of keen perception and sound judgment. It was the task of the clever Brahmin, who acted as Shivaji’s agent in the negotiations, to divine the mind of the Khan and, by an astute display of elo- quence and earnestness, persuade the Bijapur general to agree to meet his principal at Pratapgad. Shivaji took the additional precaution of sending with the party Viswasrao Nanaji, an expert spy, who, assuming various guises, was able to collect useful intelligence about the Bijapur military camp. During his secret interviews with the Khan’s envoy, Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji had gained sufficient knowledge about the Khan’s evil intentions. His impressions were fully confirmed by his agent, Pantaji, who, by a liberal recourse to bribes, learnt from high authority that Afzal Khan “had so arranged matters that Shivaji would be arrested at the interview, as he was too cunning to be caught by open fight”. But it was the Brahmin’s greatest achievement that he succeeded in inducing the Khan to fall in with Shivaji’s pre-concerted plan. The stage was now set for the historic encounter. The jungle was cleared and a road made from Wai to the foot of Pratapgad for the movement of the Bijapur army. Food, water and recreation of the choicest kind were arranged in profusion at different places along the entire route to relieve the tedium of the journey. The Khan and his men were supremely happy 58 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT at the excellence and the cordiality of the reception. Mean- while, with great discernment Shivaji selected the crest of an eminence below the fort of Pratapgad as the site for conferring with the Khan. Visitors to the fort and the place where the two men met can only gain a faint idea of the frightening character of the terrain as it was three hundred years ago.\" To-day a modem motorable road leads the traveller to the foot of the fortress, the doors of which are no longer shut so that, without much trouble or exertion, he may visit the famous temple of goddess Bhawani for worship and then, after surveying the rolling hills and valleys that lend enchantment to the landscape, proceed to see the recently installed equestrian statue of Shivaji that dominates the scene miles around the mountain ranges. But in the time of Shivaji the region was incredibly inhospit- able, with the jungle growing in all its chaotic exuberance so that the traveller was forced to watch every step of his lest he should be tripped up by the uncleared undergrowth or be taken unawares by the denizens of the forest. Sitting serenely on a maze of tree-clad and mist-crowned hills and overlooking valleys sunk deep into the bowels of the earth, Pratapgad des- pised the pitiful attempts of evil-minded men to gain possession of her by force or fraud. Built on a high rock near the source of the Krishna, it commands the entire area embraced by the banks of the Nira and the Koyna, besides, at the time of which we are writing, strengthening the defences of the Par pass. About the natural strength of Pratapgad a writer says: “The western and northern sides of the fort are gigantic cliffs with an almost vertical drop in many places of seven or eight hundred feet. The towers and bastions on the south and east are often thirty to forty feet high, while there is in most places a scarp of naked black rock not much lower.” Overlooking the Koyna valley, the place selected for the Khan’s reception was least suited for conversion into a battle-ground. When the Bijapur general agreed to meet Shivaji on this cleverly chosen site, it was decreed by an inscrutable destiny that the THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS Khan should not return alive. Rightly does",

    "text": "Khali Khan say: “The Angel of Doom led him by the collar to his fate.” An artistically decorated and richly furnished shamiana was erected in the open space for the reception of Afzal Khan. As the day of the interview dawned, November 10, 1659, Shivaji rose early, offered devout prayers for victory against the mighty enemy and prepared himself to meet any situation. He ap- pointed a small council, with his mother as the head, to carry on the administration of his newly-acquired realm in the event of his death or imprisonment. To secure his person from sudden and treacherous attack, he donned a light but well- made armour and similarly covered his head with a steel hel- met. A sharp and short sword called bichwa was concealed under his long and flowing robe, while a set of steel claws known as waghndkh worn on the fingers of the left hand, completed his precautions for self-protection. As the appointed hour for the interview approached, Shivaji bowed reverently before his mother, Jijabai, and taking Jivba Mahala and Sambhaji Kavji, both distinguished for their courage and skill as swordsmen,* as his companions, descended slowly from the fort to meet the waiting Khan. The Khan, who had been transported earlier to the shamiana in a palan- quin, was foaming with fury at the costliness of the pavilion and its furnishings and asked the waiting envoys how such appurtenances of royalty could have been acquired by the son of a mere Sardar. The Brahmins diplomatically pacified the angry man by assuring him that the things that belonged to the Sultan would soon be restored to His Majesty ! Shivaji, who had now approached the shamiana with his attendants, saw Syed Banda, the famous swordsman of Bijapur, inside the tent and sent word that the man should be removed from the place and stationed at a distance. Seeing that his * Different authorities give different names of the men that accompanied Shivaji during his interview with Afzal Khan. B. M. Purandhare, in his Marathi volumes on Shivaji, quotes a source which mentions the following names: Jivba Mahala, Sambhaji Kavji Kondhal- kar, Sambhaji Karvar, Kathoji Ingle, Kondaji Rank, Krishnaji Gaekwad, Siddi Ibrahim, Surji Katke, Visaji Murumbak and Esaji Kank. 60 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT request was complied with, he walked briskly towards the pavilion and entered it, leaving his men outside. The Khan, who was seated on a heavily cushioned platform, rose ostensib- ly to embrace his host. Taking advantage of his superior height and strength, he suddenly drew Shivaji towards him and raising his left arm caught the head and the neck of the Maratha under it. Shivaji was overwhelmed by the sudden- ness of the assault and the terrible pressure on his neck. The Khan next unsheathed his sword and struck a savage blow at Shivaji who was now almost entirely at his mercy. He was, however, saved by the hidden armour he had so prudently worn. Shivaji, who had been temporarily put out of action by the suddenness of the attack and by the equally unexpected impact of a vastly superior physical strength upon his body, recovered quickly and, realizing the magnitude of the peril that faced him and the need for prompt action, struck the waghnakh at the Khan’s body with all his strength, the sharp steel claws biting deeply into the powerful man’s bowels. With the same sudden- ness that had made him helpless Shivaji now became the master of the situation. His blow relaxed the Khan’s strangle- hold and, releasing himself promptly from the man’s “embrace”, Shivaji struck the enemy again this time with his bichwa. The Bijapur general was not made of clay, but even his powerful frame could not sustain two smashing blows. He fell down bleeding profusely and shouting “treachery”. Syed Banda, the faithful attendant of Afzal Khan, who was watching the grim drama from a distance, rushed at Shivaji and struck a powerful blow at the latter’s head with his long sword, but again Shivaji’s forethought saved him. Borrowing one of the two swords held by his companion, Jivba Mahala, Shivaji faced his new assailant, but before the two accomplished swordsmen could make much progress with their duel, Jivba made short work of the Syed with his other sword. The mortal agony of the severely wounded and disembowelled Afzal Khan was mercifully ended by Shivaji’s second attendant, S\nambhaji THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 61 Kavji, who cut off the Khan’s head as he was being carried to the waiting palanquin.",

    "text": "A stirring ballad on the famous encounter was composed in Marathi soon after the event and even at this distance of time it is heard with unabated enthusiasm and excitement over the length and breadth of Maharashtra. Here are a few lines from Acworth’s excellent translation of the ballad, describing how the two men met: “The Moslem leap’d upon him, His grasp was fierce and fell, And how he plied the dagger The dinted mail might tell. But Shivaji the Raja In answer made him feel The twin sting of the scorpion* The deadly claws of steel. His entrails torn and bloody Gap’d through the horrid wound; But Abdul was a warrior bold And falter’d not nor swoon’ed, He loos’d his girdle deftly, Uncoil’d the sword below, And dealt upon the Raja’s head A fierce and furious blow. It cleft the embroider’d turban, And twisted chains fourteen, And the Raja felt, as steed the spur, The sword edge sharp and keen. His blade leap’d out and wrapped the Khan, Like the sacred thread to view, Between the neck and shoulder It struck and clove him through. He fell, down fell the Moslem, While steadfast stood the King. Hearken, Maratha princes, His glorious state I sing.” \"The bichwa, derived from bichti or scorpion, is a double-bladed dagger. 62 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT When Shivaji and his companions returned to the fort with their ghastly trophy, a gun boomed to announce their arrival in safety. It was also a signal to the waiting Maratha armies to attack the enemy. The carnage on the Bijapur side was terrible and only those that promptly surrendered were spared. Some members of the dead general's family, including his eldest son, Fazl Khan, who lived to become Shivaji’s inveterate enemy, escaped. The booty that fell into the hands of the Marathas was im- mense. “All the artillery,\" says Sarkar, “wagons, ammunition, treasure, tents and equippage, transport — cattle and baggage of an entire army, fell into the victors’ hands. Among them were 65 elephants, 4,000 horses, 1,200 camels, 2,000 bundles oi clothing, and 10 lakhs of rupees in cash and jewellery.” Thus ended the career of a man and his army that had sallied forth with exultant hopes of extinguishing the flame of independence kindled by Shivaji. Afzal Khan’s severed head was buried beneath a tower in the fort of Pratapgad and is called Afzal Buruj. Conflicting versions concerning what is known as the Afzal episode have found their place in the pages of history. With a self-assurance wholly unbecoming of responsible writers when dealing with dubious facts, some historians have branded Shivaji as a “treacherous Maratha”. None of the persons on the side of the Khan, excepting his Brahmin envoy, Krishnaji Bhaskar, who were present in the shamiana escaped alive after the Bijapur general’s death. How then could an eye-witness account be produced on behalf of the so-called “murdered” man to prove that Shivaji struck the first blow? And yet what may truly be described as one of the most impudent fakes has been given currency by some writers as a sober fact of history. The king of Maharashtra was a man of great veracity and he could be trusted to present an unvarnished account of his meeting with Afzal Khan when narrating it to his spiritual leader, Ramdas Swami. Shivaji told the Swami: “When at our interview, Abdulla (i.e. Afzal Khan) caught me under his arm, I had almost lost my consciousness. But for the Swami’s blessing, I would not have escaped from his grip”. THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 63 Any detailed discussion of the rights and wrongs of the episode is, however, as irrelevant as it is absurd. Afzal Khan was notoriously unprincipled and cruel and to these forbidding traits he added the unforgivable offence of bigotry. The death of such a man, in whom the milk of human kindness had congealed into a poisonous hatred for his fellowmen, certainly does not deserve the tribute of tears, no matter in what maimer his earthly career was ended. When dealing with this episode, we may well recall the struggle between Christian and Apollyon in John Bunyan",

Sarkar’s well-considered verdict on the Afzal episode clinches the issue: “The weight of re- corded evidence as well as the probabilities of the case sup- ports the view that Afzal Khan struck the first blow.” Shivaji did not rest on his laurels after sending Afzal Khan to his doom. Scarcely before Bijapur recovered from the confusion and consternation caused by the event, he sent an army into the enemy territory under the command of Annaji Datto who took possession of the important fort of Panhala in the former State of Kolhapur on November 28. Panhala was the capital of the western district of the Adilshahi kingdom and the officer in charge of the region, Rustam-i-Zaman, was loath to surrender valuable territory without a fight. His forces were joined by those of Afzal Khan’s son, Fazl Khan, who missed no opportunity in his attempt to avenge the death of his father. The battle near Panhala, fought on December 28, 1659, gave decisive victory to Shivaji who pursued the flee- ing enemy upto the gates of Bijapur. Collecting a large booty from some of the prosperous towns in the area, he returned to his stronghold, Rajgad, towards the end of January 1660. Young Ali, the unfortunate Sultan, was confused and con- founded by the repeated reverses to his arms and fortunes. He saw the mighty edifice of the royal power, built in the 64 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Deccan for his dynasty by its founder, Yusuf Adilshah, crumbl- ing steadily before his eyes. Its disintegration was indeed inevitable. Like the Bahmani Kingdom, the States that were built on its ashes were entirely wrong as survivals in the same manner as the rise of Hyderabad, Oudh and Bengal as inde- pendent States after the destruction of the Mughul Empire was a political enormity. In the extremity of his despair, which was also a measure of the imbecility of his court and govern- ment, Ali Adilshah readily accepted the offer of a rebellious Abyssinian slave, Siddi Jauhar, to save the situation for him.",

    "text": "Jauhar was a competent soldier, but he was both a fool and a traitor, who made grandiose projects to establish an empire for himself ! He had earlier usurped the fief of Kamul in Andhra Pradesh and had fallen from royal favour for his traitorous ambitions and activities. Such a man came forward to salvage the fortunes of the decaying Adilshahi kingdom. He was dignified with the title of Salbat Khan and sent against Shivaji. By a grave error of judgment, Shivaji allowed himself to be blockaded in the fort of Panhala, (March 2, 1660), which was besieged by the Siddi and his allies with great determination. Formidable forces were ranged against Shivaji. Salbat Khan’s own considerable army was reinforced by the troops of the ubiquitous Fazl Khan, and those of another defeated general, Rustam-i-Zaman. Fazl Khan’s chief retainer, Siddi Halal, was also an able soldier. Both he and his master spared no efforts or expenditure in pressing the siege with the utmost vigour. The blood of Afzal Khan cried for vengeance — immediate and terrible ! As if such an array of armed strength was not sufficient, Baji Ghor- pade, about whose well-deserved destruction we have already written, and several other Maratha nobles contributed their levies in order to hasten the surrender of the fort. Shivaji was thus confronted by another major crisis, so soon after overcoming the danger from Afzal Khan’s invasion. The fragile State of Maharashtra was forced to wage an unequal war on two fronts against two formidable Muslim powers, while its architect and mainstay was condemned to enforced the formidable antagonists 65 idleness in a closely invested fortress. The repeated attempts of Netaji Palkar to compel the Bijapur general to raise the siege of Panhala proved abortive. In the north, the premier nobleman of the Moghul court, Shaista Khan, threatened to engulf the entire kingdom of Shivaji by invading his territories with a large and well-equipped army. A shrewd and competent general, the commander of the imperial forces saw in the Maratha prince’s predicament a heaven-sent opportunity for him to deliver a mortal blow at the new State. He occupied Poona in May 1660 and took up his residence in Shivaji’s house, Lai Mahal. Shivaji was confident of dominating the situation if only he could escape from Panhala, but he could not make his exit except by coming to terms with the besiegers — an extremely remote possibility.",

    "text": "He pondered deeply over the situation and at last decided to try the weapon of diplomacy against Siddi Jauhar. He knew that the Siddi was a vainglorious man and amenable to flattery. He, therefore, attempted to win the besieging commander’s confidence by judiciously stimulating his personal ambitions. A meeting was arranged between the two men, one a credulous fool and another a subtle and farseeing planner. Shivaji invited the newly ennobled Abyssinian slave to consider whether his status, however much it was elevated, could ever be equal to the position of a sovereign in his own right. The crown was indeed the only fitting reward for his outstanding abilities and enterprise. It would be an affront to his eminence if he were to be content with a lesser position. Shivaji wound up his exhortation by promising his wholehearted assistance to the Siddi in his attempts to win a kingdom for himself. The upstart was jubilant. With a daring and resourceful “friend” like Shivaji, was there anything he could not accomplish? The siege of the fort ceased to interest the Siddi! But Fazal Khan, who had been watching the happenings around him with the unsleeping eyes of Argus, could not be similarly wqn over. His attempts to force the surrender of the fort, how* ever, had cost him dearly and he no longer wished to abandon •66 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT discretion in favour of valour. His tents were accordingly pitched at a respectable distance from the ramparts of Pan- hala — a circumstance that helped Shivaji and his men to clear out of the fort without attracting immediate attention. The night of July 13, 1660 was an ideal one for making the escape. It was a particularly dark and rainy night when the guards of the camp preferred the security and warmth of their tents to a zealous performance of their watch and ward duties. Taking a large body of his men with him, Shivaji stole out of the fort through a rear gate and, after destroying or dispers- ing the Bijapur troops that noticed his escape, he made for Vishalgad, twenty-seven miles to the west, with every possible speed. Fazal Khan, who was soon apprised of this escape, speedily collected his troops and pursued Shivaji, lighting his way through the darkness with blazing torches. The distance between the pursuer and the pursued narrowed dangerously as night was followed by day. Shivaji was in a dilemma. Being outnumbered, it was evidently impossible for him to give battle to die enemy with any hope of success.",

    "text": "He, therefore, adopted a more workable plan of action. Detaching a sizable number of troops from his escort, he put them under the command of Baji Prabhu with orders to contest the advance of the pursuers to the bitter end, while he himself continued the journey to Vishalgad with the rest of his party. The scheme worked admirably. Baji Prabhu and his gallant men held Fazal Khan’s troops at bay for five precious hours till their master reached his destination. During the heroic stand Prabhu lost his life — an inspiring episode in Maratha history which will be dealt with in a later chapter. Wiser than his father, Fazal Khan refused to attack Shivaji in a difficult legion and withdrew to Panhala with a heavy heart. Shivaji was now free to make his plans to meet the Moghul menace. From his recent encounters with the Bijapur armies he was able to take the true measure of their strength and weakness. He could see that the proud Adilshahi kingdom was now in the throes of death and could not, therefore, effec- tively challenge his great work. The Moghuls, however, were THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 67 of a different mettle. Their resources were infinitely superior to those of Bijapur, while their fighting forces were almost invincible. Besides, the man who sat on the throne at Delhi was a determined and implacable foe, who considered no means unfair in contriving the destruction of those that chal- lenged his policies or paramountcy. By returning Panhala Shivaji secured a patched-up peace with Bijapur in September 1660 so that he could give his undivided attention to the in- vaders from the north. His war with the imperialists and how he eventually overcame their aggression will be described in the chapters that follow.",

    "text": "Aggression is an old infirmity of the strong man. The rulers of ancient and medieval India practised it against one another with a thoroughness that eventually encompassed the ruin of their country. Pax Romana was a frank assertion of the over- whelming military superiority of the Roman conquerors in their far-flung empire. European imperialism, also deriving its strength and sanctions entirely from force, is still a current coin, although it is fast wearing out and may soon cease to be legal tender ! The Moghuls were convinced and enthusiastic practitioners, of imperialism. Babar’s sojourn in India was too short to permit him to conceive ambitious projects of conquest inside the country, while his son, Humayun, spent the best part of his effective life as a fugitive. The aggressive trait of the- Timurids found its full play during the long reign of Akbar. This great and benevolent sovereign, who, like Antoninus* governed his realm like a father, abandoned all the civilized canons of moderation and justice when dealing with other independent States in the country. The massacre of Chitor, the conquest of Gondwana by driving its valiant Queen to com- mit suicide, and the spoliation of Ahmednagar after hastening, the death of the brave, noble and sagacious Sultana Chand Bibi, are irrefutable examples of Akbar’s unprovoked aggressions. The siege of Asirgarh and its occupation in January 1601 through “perfidy and bribery” furnish one more illustration of the great ruler’s indifference to ends and means where his own amour-propre was concerned. Jahangir was also animated by vaulting ambitions, but being heavily addicted to liquor and opium and enslaved by the charms of Nurjahan, this “able degenerate” was incapable of any sustained action. But the forward policy of his son and successor, Shah Jahan, amply compensated for his sloth. Shah Jahan's aggressions culminated in the destruction of the inde- THE IMPEBIAJLtSTS pendent State of Ahmednagar in 1632. Being dedicated Sunnis, both he and his son, Aurangzeb, took “special pleasure in warring with the Sultans of Golkonda and Bijapur, who adhered to the Shia faith, and looked for alliance and protection to the Shah of Persia rather than the Padshah of Hindustan”. Aurangzeb was extremely fond of playing the role of “a great pike in a pond”. He had acquired the title of Alamgir, mean- ing ‘World Compeller’ or ‘Universe Grasper’ with every intention of proving worthy of it. His first Viceroyalty of the Deccan in 1636-37 was brief and uneventful. He had, however, become a maturer man, with his aims and objects well defined, when he was reappointed to the charge in 1653. Aurangzeb possessed qualities of greatness, with which few in his dynasty were endowed in such abundance, but goodness and tolerance were not among them. He was competent, clear- headed and extremely clever. When he reached man’s estate, nothing influenced him more strongly than the belief that the imperial crown belonged to him and to none else in his family, including his father, the reigning monarch! His moves and actions were, therefore, guided by an overpowering desire to seize the prize by any means. The gold of Golkonda and the wealth of Bijapur, amassed by despoiling the rich temples and the fertile regions of the south, were of inestimable value in his contest with his brothers for the peacock throne. Considerations of right and wrong were of no value to",

His tactics, involving subterfuge and perfidy, were condemned even by the Oxford History, highlighting the treachery employed against a Muslim king whose only offense was independence.  The Mughal imperialists’ dealings with Bijapur were even more aggressive. Shah Jahan’s war of 1635-36 against Bijapur was infamous for its brutality, ending only after the Adilshah submitted to Delhi, offered a substantial peace offering, and guaranteed respect for Golkonda's borders. In return, he received a portion of the annexed Ahmednagar territory.  This treaty provided a brief respite, but after Mahmud Adilshah's death in 1656, the imperialists renewed their aggression under a flimsy pretext, challenging young Ali Adilshah's legitimacy. Aurangzeb, like his father, employed burning, massacre, and loot to terrorize his victims. Aided by Mir Jumla, he deeply penetrated Bijapur territory and might have conquered it entirely in 1657 if not for his father's intervention.  This allowed Aurangzeb to focus on the rising Maratha power, but his father’s illness in September 1657 shifted his attention to the struggle for the imperial throne, providing Shivaji a crucial period to consolidate his position.",

    "text": "Initially, Aurangzeb underestimated Shivaji, viewing him as a minor adventurer. Shivaji offered his services to Aurangzeb during the renewed Bijapur war in 1657, a move designed to gauge the Mughal prince's intentions. Aurangzeb, aiming to exploit the Marathas without cost, instructed his governor to maintain communication but offered no concrete response. Shivaji, equally astute, demanded recognition of his sovereignty, a proposition at odds with Aurangzeb’s imperial ambitions and religious convictions.  Despite this, Aurangzeb feigned amity, approving Shivaji's claims in a letter dated April 23, 1657, and calling for Maratha military support against Bijapur. Shivaji, recognizing the emptiness of these promises, declined to bolster the Mughal forces.  Exploiting the Mughal preoccupation with Bijapur, Shivaji launched successful raids near Ahmednagar, alarming the city's commander. He also captured Junnar in a surprise attack, securing substantial loot.  Aurangzeb, enraged by these actions, ordered brutal reprisals against Shivaji's territories, demanding the merciless slaughter and enslavement of the population.  This reign of terror, however, failed to quell the Maratha resistance. The Deccan hostilities temporarily ceased in September 1657 with a peace treaty between the Mughals and Bijapur, prompting Shivaji to also halt his offensive and seek terms from Aurangzeb.  The impending struggle for the Mughal throne now absorbed Aurangzeb's attention, though he maintained a facade of goodwill towards Shivaji.  His true feelings, however, were revealed in instructions to his officers, emphasizing the need for vigilance against the Marathas and expressing his deep disdain for Shivaji.",

Shaista Khan commanded a large army and enjoyed the full support of the Emperor and the Bijapur court, creating a two-front war for Shivaji, which he faced with courage and resourcefulness. Confident in his strength, Shaista Khan marched towards Poona in February 1660, securing strongholds along his route to protect his supply lines.  By April, he controlled the regions around Poona and Baramati, advancing south to Shirval and occupying Poona itself on May 9.

The rains and floods aggravated the hardships of the luxury-accustomed Mughals. Chakan, a fortified town eighteen miles from Poona, became their encampment. The Khan, confident of overrunning the seemingly weak fort, began siege operations in June 1630. However, he underestimated the spirit of the garrison under Phirangoji Narsala, a veteran soldier loyal to Shivaji. Narsala, aware of Shivaji's predicament and unable to expect reinforcements, held the fort with unwavering devotion. Despite the Mughals' superior weaponry and engineering, the siege dragged on for weeks, with the Marathas repulsing attacks and utilizing night raids. On August 14, 1660, after fifty-four days, the Mughals exploded a mine, breaching the fort. Yet, Narsala and his men mended the breach overnight. Finally, facing dwindling supplies and no hope of reinforcements, Narsala capitulated.  Shaista Khan, admiring Narsala’s heroism, offered him a position in the Mughal army, which Narsala declined. Shivaji, grateful for Narsala's loyalty, made him commandant of Bhupalgad. The Chakan episode revealed to the Viceroy the difficulty of conquering Maharashtra.  Despite peace inclinations, the Emperor forbade any such understanding, sending reinforcements under Maharaja Jaswant Singh. The war continued, with the Mughals making slow but steady gains.",

Shivaji countered with conquests in South Konkan towards Goa, but the Mughals maintained pressure. The conflict became a war of attrition. Recognizing the stalemate, Shivaji devised a daring plan to attack the Mughal Commander-in-Chief, Shaista Khan, in Poona.

Shivaji attacked the Khan, but a woman extinguished the lights, creating confusion. Amidst the chaos, the Khan's fingers were severed, and several of his family and attendants were killed or wounded. Shivaji's men withdrew as suddenly as they came, returning to Sinhgad. The audacious raid was a resounding success, significantly damaging Mughal prestige.

    "text": "Shivaji did not allow the grass to grow under his feet after his great exploit at Poona. The attack on Shaista Khan, the Moghul Viceroy, and his retirement from the Deccan in disgrace, besides constituting a great personal triumph for himself, delivered a serious blow at the prestige of the imperialists. Shivaji considered it necessary to repeat such performances with the object of exposing the myth about the so-called invincibility of the Empire until he developed sufficient strength of his own in order to be able to inflict a decisive military defeat on the enemy. The prosperous port of Surat on the west coast was among the prized possessions of the Moghuls and Shivaji’s plunder of the town in January 1664, both to acquire the means for waging the war of independence and to cause further public humiliation to the imperialists, provoked Aurangzeb to take strong measures with the object of annihilating the Maratha power. It now became clear to Aurangzeb that nothing could be more preposterous on his part than to continue to regard Shivaji as little better than a minor refractory chief, inherently incapable of offering an effective challenge to the Empire. The Maratha ruler had humbled and humiliated no less a person than the Emperor’s own uncle, besides neutralising the effectiveness of the armies that had been sent against him. Jaswant Singh, the premier Rajput nobleman at the imperial court, had proved himself equally useless in dealing with Shivaji.\nIn the Context of the bitter rivalry that existed between the ruling houses of Jodhpur and Jaipur and of his own insatiable ambition to bask in the sunshine of imperial favour, as none else could ever hope fo do,’ the aspersions cast on his integrity when operating against Shivaji, appear to be wholly unfounded. Indeed, the realization of his own inability to face the Marathas after the discomfiture of Shaista Khan was the only reason why his attempts to retrieve the situation proved so futile. His recall from the Deccan, like that of Shaista Khan, became inevitable, following the failure of his expedition. Aurangzeb was deeply concerned about the choice of a military successor to the Maharaja. He saw that Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Jaipur was the only man among his senior generals who could be trusted to grasp the Deccan nettle. With a rare charm of manner, he confided to the Raja his unbounded faith in his integrity and ability to bring the southern issue to a successful conclusion. He further flattered the Rajput by declaring that in the wide Empire there were only two men who could hope to force Shivaji to go down on his knees, they being his own imperial majesty and his devoted and valiant servant, Mirza Raja Jai Singh! The Raja should, therefore, proceed to the Deccan with all expedition and bring Shivaji to the imperial court “by any means”. The new appointment was announced on the occasion of the Emperor’s birthday celebrations on September 30, 1664.",

    "text": "Aurangzeb’s confidence in Jai Singh was not misplaced. The Raja belonged to a state that had become the pillar of the Moghul Empire from the days of Akbar. Indeed, he was the inheritor of the traditions of loyalty so ably established by the valiant Man Singh. Jai Singh ascended the gadi of Amber in 1622 when he was barely thirteen years old. From that year till his death in the south, he knew no rest or respite in his service of the Empire. He was a good Hindu, but his obligation to his ancestral faith did not go beyond his personal devotion to it. He did not regard it as part of his responsibility as a premier Hindu nobleman of the realm to protect the venerable dharma from insult and suppression. His capacity for righteous indignation at the growing intolerance in the country had been destroyed by his early apprenticeship to the Moghul service. His own career meant everything to him and in his pursuit of personal success, he allowed no such considerations as country or religion to disturb his thoughts. While the loss of the services of such a brilliant and valiant man to the country undoubtedly rendered it the poorer, his adhesion to the Moghul cause gave considerable strength and prestige to the imperialists, although they were none too anxious to acknowledge this fact.\nJai Singh was endowed with many towering qualities. Making the Moghul cause his own, he had fought in almost every part of the far-flung Empire— from Balkh in Central Asia to Bijapur in the Deccan and from Kandahar in the west to Mungri in the east. His superb courage and resourcefulness, his mastery over military strategy and tactics and his charming address had helped him to win dazzling prizes under the Moghuls which no Hindu could expect to gain after Akbar’s impartial and beneficent regime. In the campaigns abroad Jai Singh was given command of the imperial armies with a status equal to that of the Emperor’s sons. And to his eminence as a warrior he added the lustre of an accomplished diplomat and linguist. Age and experience had brought to his outlook and judgment a mellowness which helped him to realize that not infrequently diplomacy was much superior to mere force. Thus, though beginning his career as a bluff soldier, he steadily developed into a patient, subtle, soft-spoken and tactful diplomat who often used all these artful powers against the adversaries of the Empire with much success. A high-born Rajput and supremely conscious of his lineage, he had acquired complete mastery over the manners and etiquette of the imperial court so that conversation with him was invariably pleasant and instructive. His proficiency in Turki and Persian as well as in Urdu and in his own dialect of Rajasthani gave him great advantage in discussions and negotiations. It was this man, now in his fifty-sixth year and in the plenitude of his mental vigour, that was sent to the Deccan, charged with the responsibility of destroying the great work of Shivaji. He was, as Sarkar observes, “an ideal leader of the composite army of Afghans and Turks, Rajputs and Hindustanis that followed the crescent banner of the sovereign of Delhi”.\nThere was, however, not much significance in the class composition of the army commanded by Jai Singh against Shivaji. The fighting forces of those times and of the earlier and subsequent periods were mostly composite in character, but by choosing Dilir Khan, a Pathan officer, as the second in command to the Rajput Commander-in-Chief, Aurangzeb ensured that Jai Singh did not allow the bonds of religion to interfere with his dealings with Shivaji. But such precautions, which merely gave one more illustration of the Emperor’s suspicious nature, were wholly unnecessary since the Raja considered nothing more sacred than implicit obedience to his overlord’s orders. In fact, at a later date, when writing from the Deccan on the Maratha affairs, he greeted Aurangzeb in his letter of June 1665 as the “shadow of God”. Such a man could be trusted to carry out his responsibilities not only loyally but with ruthless thoroughness.",

    "text": "Collecting a large army and equipping it with the best of weapons and engines of destruction which the times could furnish, Raja Jai Singh left North India and crossed the Narmada on January 9, 1665, arriving at Aurangabad on the tenth day of the following month. During his brief stay of three days in the city he called on Prince Muazzam, who had succeeded Shaista Khan to the Deccan Viceroyalty, and, after fulfilling the formalities of the court, proceeded to his destination, Poona, the future capital of the Maratha Empire, reaching that place on March 3. A veteran of many wars, Jai Singh was nevertheless overcome by strange misgivings about the outcome of his undertaking. Many commanders, Moghul and Bijapur, had in the past come to grief when measuring their strength with the strange and unpredictable Maratha, although some of them had possessed resources nearly as great as his own. He was unable to divine what new forces would be unleashed by Shivaji to accomplish his defeat and disgrace. He, therefore, decided to make the most comprehensive arrangements with the object of convincing the Marathas of the futility of resistance to the invaders. Reporting to Aurangzeb the progress of events in the Deccan, the Raja wrote that he allowed himself no rest or ease but laboured day and night to fulfil the task for which he had been sent. He used both sword and sabotage in his grand offensive against Shivaji and politely declined to be deflected from his carefully laid out course of action when advised by the Emperor to attack the Maratha king in the Konkan. He demanded and received supreme powers to plan and direct the campaign according to his own judgment.\nThere was, as we saw in the preceding chapters, a traditional and inveterate enmity between Bijapur and Delhi, the latter missing no opportunity to encompass the ruin of the Deccan Sultanate. Frequent wars were waged against it, the imperialists often carrying sword and fire to the very gates of its capital. Jai Singh was not deterred by the embittered relations between the two Governments when he urged the Adil-shah to make common cause with the aggressors. He invited the Sultan to embrace the opportunity now afforded to him to settle his accounts with Shivaji by forgetting the fact that an open antagonist is always preferable to a dissembling ally. The number of men in Maharashtra who had long been biding their time to destroy the handiwork of Shivaji was by no means negligible. The Mores of Javli were prominent among such disruptionists. They, along with many other disgruntled Maratha sardars, rallied under the imperial banner, determined to fight for the restoration of Muslim rule in Maharashtra! The country abounded in men of straw upon whom bribes and honours worked like an enchantment. At the same time, the prospect of tasting the sweetness of revenge drew to the Moghul standard men like Fazl Khan, the persevering son of Afzal Khan, and many other defeated and dispossessed Muslim noblemen in the Deccan. The indefatigable Rajput general was still not content with his work of sabotage and disruption. He sent two of his Portuguese emissaries to Goa to instigate their compatriots there to undertake a naval expedition against Shivaji, while the Siddis of Janjira were similarly urged to capture and ravage his coastal towns. Even Niccolao Manucci, the young artillery chief of Jai Singh’s army, was not exempted from the disagreeable task of fomenting disunity and disaffection among the people of Maharashtra. He was commissioned to incite the local chiefs, in the northern regions of the Maratha country to repudiate their allegiance to Shivaji. Indeed, Jai Singh spurned no method or technique that promised to strengthen his hands. He attempted to tamper with the loyalty of Shivaji’s own officers by making them tempting offers, but drew a blank from that source. Having thus created a nest of fifth columnists and saboteurs, who could be trusted to stab the valiant fighters for freedom in the back, Jai Singh set about making his military dispositions with equal thoroughness. His aim was two-fold, namely, to draw the Maratha forces into the open and overwhelm them with the aid of his superior equipment and numbers, and to neutralise the value of their hill-forts by stationing strong Moghul outposts in their vicinity.",

    "text": "A prominent feature of the astute Rajput’s strategy lay in preventing the Marathas from taking advantage of the difficult terrain of their country. His immediate target was the famous fortress of Purandar. He moved his camp to Saswad, six miles south-west of Purandar, in order to give personal attention to the operations against the fort. The task of besieging and attacking it was given to Dilir Khan, his second in command. The establishment of strong outposts at the strategic points around Poona and the garrisoning of the town with 4,000 cavalry effectively blocked all assistance to the defenders of Purandar, who were forced to bear the brunt of Moghul attack without any hope of receiving reinforcements or other aid. Large flying columns were regularly detailed to penetrate the countryside and to sack and burn the villages as a deterrent to any help reaching Shivaji and his men from the local population. One such flying column was directed “not to leave any vestige of cultivation or habitation, but make an utter desolation”. But no excesses on the part of the invaders could weaken the determination of the garrison at Purandar to defend it to the last. As we saw in an earlier chapter, the fort is naturally endowed with considerable strength, and in those days when the siege operations were exasperatingly slow, its capture demanded almost superhuman efforts. Such efforts the Moghuls were now determined to make and the stage for the capture of the fortress was set with the arrival of Dilir Khan before it on March 30. The garrison, which consisted of two thousand troops, was commanded by Murar Baji who, from the first day of the siege, realized the impossibility of beating off the aggressors. He knew that Shivaji, then in the Konkan, did not have the means to come to his aid or to compel the enemy to raise the siege by any other strategy. But the idea of surrender never crossed his mind. He was a typical Maratha captain, simple, brave and selfless, who had been taught to do and die for his master. It did not matter if the Moghuls were in overwhelming numbers. That fact did not deprive the garrison of its indestructible superiority which it had acquired from the determination of every trooper to lay down his life in defence of the fort.",

    "text": "Dilir Khan concentrated his artillery fire on Rudramal or Vajragad, an independent fortified enclosure situated on a ridge running east of Purandar. Possession of this fort was of vital importance to hasten the capture of the main stronghold. Vajragad, in the words of Jai Singh, was “the key that would unlock Purandar”. The efforts of the garrison to repulse the invaders were most ineffective against the pitiless cannonade of the Moghuls. Vajragad fell into the hands of the enemy on April 14. The parlous condition of the garrison at Purandar was realized by the Maratha army outside and renewed attempts were made to force the invaders to abandon the siege. Netaji Palkar, the indomitable cavalry leader, made several diversionary attacks on the Moghul outposts, but with no conspicuous success. The fate of Purandar was sealed, but the pressure on the aggressors from the Maratha forces was not relaxed. As Jai Singh himself ruefully admitted: “Sometimes we have failed to prevent the enemy from accomplishing their hostile designs.” Khafi Khan, quoted by Sarkar, is even more explicit. “The surprises of the enemy,” writes this hostile historian, “their gallant successes, attacks on dark nights, blocking of roads and difficult passes, and burning of jungles, made it very hard for the imperialists to move about. The Moghuls lost many men and beasts.” But such Maratha gains did not deflect the course of events or save Purandar from passing into Moghul control. Murar Baji’s position was truly desperate. With the fall of Vajragad, Dilir Khan moved his camp to the foot of the fort, known as Machi, or ridge. Determined to dislodge him from his vantage position, the Maratha commander, taking seven hundred men with him, delivered a powerful attack on the Khan when the latter was climbing the hill with five thousand Afghans and other Moghul troops. A desperate hand-to-hand fight ensued in which neither side asked for or gave quarter. Murar Baji and his valiant followers slew five hundred Pathans, besides a number of other infantrymen. The intrepid Maratha leader decided not to return to the fort unless he killed the Khan himself. Detaching sixty men from the rapidly thinning ranks of his followers, Murar Baji rushed at Dilir Khan, but, before he could reach his chief opponent, he lost one arm and the protecting shield. Despite the mortal blow, he moved forward, tying the maimed hand with a scarf. The toll of enemy life taken by him and his desperate band of followers was really terrible. Dilir Khan, himself a renowned soldier, was amazed at the courage and impetuosity of the Maratha captain and his men. He pleaded with Murar Baji to stop fighting and to join the Moghuls with the fullest conviction that his interests would be advanced by his new masters far beyond his most optimistic expectations. The Maratha spurned the offer with contempt regarding it as an affront to his patriotism and fell upon the Khan and his men with such vigour as his bleeding body could allow.",

    "text": "Apprehending danger to his own life, Dilir Khan shot an arrow which ended the earthly career of the indomitable Murar Baji. His head was severed by the enemy, but the trunk was retrieved by the Marathas who later sent it to Shivaji for the final rites. Thus perished a great patriot and soldier and the place where he fell is known as Ranatemb, meaning the hillock where the battle was fought. The death of its leader did not, however, disspirit the garrison which decided to carry on the struggle to the bitter end. With a courage, rare in the military annals of any country, the defenders continued to hurl defiance at the invaders, declaring that the death of one man made no difference to their determination to fight. “Are we not brave like our beloved leader? Why then should we surrender?” they asked. There has never been any effective answer to the challenge of patriotism. Shivaji, who had by now returned from the Konkan and stationed himself near Purandar, watched with deep concern the ebbing fortunes of Maharashtra. It was clearly impossible for the new State to sustain unaided the full impact of the might of the Moghul Empire. Many years of assiduous labour, devoted to the building up of new assets on a vastly larger scale, together with the creation of a wider and a more intensified national consciousness, was necessary to enable the Marathas to face the imperialists on terms of equality. He watched the plight of Purandar, one of the famous fortresses of swarajya with a heavy heart and the death of its commander, Murar Baji, was a personal blow to him. The great cause could ill afford to lose such brave and devoted men. Moreover, Raja Jai Singh was most unlike the many men he had dealt with before. There was an inexorable thoroughness in all that he did so that his adversaries could find no opportunity to turn the tables on him. Appeals to his religious sentiment were worse than useless, since the Raja had transformed the worship of power and the service of the Emperor into the best form of religion. Shivaji was faced with two alternatives— either to accept dictated terms from the Moghuls or to carry on the unequal and disastrous struggle with the certain knowledge that very soon nothing would be left to him. Both courses were extremely repugnant to him, but he was a realist and appreciated the manifest imprudence of staking the future in one big gamble. He, therefore, decided to salvage as much of his kingdom as possible through a negotiated settlement, but if the Moghuls, riding on the crest of victory, spurned his offer of friendship and attempted to swallow everything he had won in the past, he would then review the position.",

    "text": "It is strange that Shivaji, noted for his shrewdness and circumspection, allowed himself to be persuaded by Jai Singh to pay a visit to Aurangzeb at Agra. The cruelty and the treacherous character of the Emperor had become a bye-word over the length and breadth of the country. Indeed, he regarded duplicity as an axiom of state policy. He himself wrote: “One cannot rule without deception. A government depending on cunning will last for ever.” It is true that Jai Singh had given Shivaji a solemn assurance that no harm would befall him during his stay in the Moghul capital, but what sanctions could the Rajput chief forge against his overlord whom, as we saw, he worshipped as God on earth, if Aurangzab decided either to kill his enemy or to imprison him for life in an impregnable fortress like Gwalior? Indeed, both these diabolical plans were actually considered when the Maratha ruler went to Agra and one of them would certainly have been adopted if Shivaji had not made his bold escape betimes. It was impossible for the Emperor to forget Shivaji’s attack on his uncle, Shaista Khari, and the sack of Surat.\n\nOverwhelming reasons, transcending even considerations of personal safety, must have prevailed with Shivaji when he decided to undertake the journey to the north. What those reasons were cannot now be explained with any degree of certainty. A desire to study the strength and the weakness of the Moghul Government at its source and to understand the reactions of the people in the north to the oppressive regime could perhaps have been one of the reasons for his decision, but it would be straining one’s credulity too much if it is urged that that consideration alone impelled him to absent himself from Maharashtra at a critical time. Nor was there any stipulation in the treaty with Jai Singh that he should meet the Emperor in person. There is, however, no doubt that Shivaji regarded his visit to the imperial capital as one of the most fateful episodes in his career. He fully appreciated the magnitude of the risk he was taking and made arrangements for the administration of his affairs during his absence with a thoroughness that has rightly been characterized as a “masterpiece of forethought and organization.” His sagacious mother, Jijabai, was appointed Regent, with Moropant Peshwa, Nilopant Muzumdar and Prataprao Gujar, the Senapati or commander-in-chief, as her counsellors in administering the realm. To ensure that the efficiency of his Government was maintained, he toured his kingdom extensively, sometimes paying surprise visits, and exhorted his officers to carry on during his absence with their customary zeal and devotion to duty. Perhaps, no better tribute can be rendered to his personality and leadership than by recalling the fact that, in spite of the grave risks and uncertainties that attended his visit to the north, the government of his territories was conducted with amazing smoothness and efficiency as though he had never been away from his kingdom.",

    "text": "On March 5th 1666 Shivaji started on his journey to Agra from Rajgad, taking a small but efficiently equipped escort with him. He was accompanied by some of his intimate friends, including Tanaji Malusare, Yesaji Rank, Baji Sarjerao Jedhe, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Avji, Niraji Raoji, Raghunath Ballal Korde, Trimbak Sondev Dabir and Madari Mehtar. En route he visited Aurangabad where he was given an enthusiastic reception by the citizens, much to the chagrin of the Moghul Governor. That official, who had at first insolently refused to extend to Shivaji the courtesies due to a distinguished visitor, soon discovered his mistake and made appropriate amends so that cordiality was restored between the two before the Maratha party left the city. During his journey Shivaji received a letter dated April 5 from Aurangzeb promising him a warm reception at his court. Shivaji and his escort reached the outskirts of Agra on May 11. The following day, May 12, was an eventful day for Aurangzeb.\n\nSince the incarceration of his father in 1658 and his death on January 22, 1666, the Emperor had not ventured to visit the city. He had, therefore, decided to make his first entry after so many years memorable by holding a magnificent Darbar in the Agra palace on May 12 in celebration of his fiftieth lunar birthday. The resplendent peacock throne had been refurbished for the occasion, while one thousand four hundred carts had been employed to transport the treasures of the imperial household from Delhi. The Governors and the feudatories of the realm had been directed to attend the ceremonial and to rejoice at the might and majesty of their paramount lord. It was the special wish of Aurangzeb that Shivaji should witness the imperial splendour so that he might realize, if he were so faint-hearted, his own “smallness”. But the stars in their courses ordained otherwise. Kumar Ram Singh, the son of Mirza Raja Jai Singh and his agent at the court, who was in charge of the arrangements for Shivaji’s stay at Agra, was, through a series of mishaps, unable to conduct the Maratha king to the imperial palace till late in the afternoon of the Darbar day, although he had arrived near the city the previous day. Without any rest or relaxation, without any opportunity to collect his thoughts or to adjust himself to the new surroundings, and oppressed by the midday heat of the Agra sun, Shivaji was virtually hustled into Aurangzeb's presence at diwani-i-khas or the “hall of select audience”.",

    "text": "Nevertheless, Shivaji showed no vexation or resentment at the treatment meted out to him and extended to the Emperor all the honours and courtesies due from one sovereign to another, offering him the presents he had brought from the Deccan. Aurangzeb, who had shown such eagerness to meet the Maratha hero and who had promised to give him a reception worthy of his eminence, did not condescend even to make a gesture of recognition. Shivaji waited in vain for a word of goodwill and friendship. To add insult to injury, he was conducted to an inconspicuous place in the hall and asked to stand in the row of second-rate nobles of the Empire. The pride of Shivaji was deeply wounded. In front of him he saw the backs of many Sardars, some of whom had been worsted by him on the field of battle. If Aurangzeb had organised the Darbar to “dazzle the eyes of the world with his grandeur and wealth”, it is evident that the particular kind of reception he had arranged for Shivaji was intended to humiliate him in public. Both by his upbringing and in his outlook Shivaji did not attach much importance to the gradations and hierarchies in the society. He had lived and moved with the simple-minded hillmen of Maharashtra, heartily sharing their frugal fare and enjoying their humble but generous hospitality. No change in his position or fortunes could deflect him from that democratic and fraternal attitude. But humility, derived from an innate nobility of the mind, is as different from servile submission to insult as heaven is from earth. The great avenger of injustice could, on no account, acquiesce in any affront to his dignity and honour. He was roused to anger and, summoning Ram Singh to his presence, called his attention to the undeserved treatment that had been meted out to him, despite the fact that both his father and the Emperor knew well his status and standing as an independent sovereign. Anxious to avoid further insults to his person, he walked out of the hall of audience, at the same time leaving no doubt in the minds of the assembled nobles and others how deeply he resented the Emperor’s calculated act of discourtesy. Aurangzeb, who had been watching the scene created by his Deccan adversary with an observant eye, welcomed it, as it gave him one more pretext for planning Shivaji’s destruction. The fact that his trusted lieutenant, Jai Singh, had given Shivaji the most solemn guarantees concerning his personal safety while at Agra, did not in the least affect Aurangzeb’s designs. In the estimation of this cruel man, who had won the throne through violence and treachery, what was an obligation to an opportunity? Apart from Aurangzeb’s own wicked disposition, powerful forces had long been at work to poison his mind against Shivaji. Maharaja Jaswant Singh believed that he had sound reasons for persuading the Emperor to destroy Shivaji. The failure of his expedition in the Deccan and Shivaji’s openly-expressed derision at his military incompetence had deeply offended the Maharaja’s amour-propre. Perhaps, even more galling to his pride was the outstanding success of Mirza Raja Jai Singh in the south which contrasted sharply with his own dismal record. The enmity between the ruling houses of Jodhpur and Jaipur was long-standing, bitter and irreconcilable. It is a melancholy fact of history that the inter-Rajput rivalry played no small part in strengthening the Muslim power in the north. Distinguished for their valour and chivalry, the Rajput princes could achieve anything but unity amongst themselves.",

    "text": "The reasons, if there had really been any, for the sustained antagonism between the ruling dynasties of Jaipur and Jodhpur could on no account have been of such overwhelming importance as to warrant their permanent estrangement. Students of Maratha history are well aware of the utter puerility of the differences that divided the House of Scindia and Holkar in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thus causing them to default criminally in the fulfilment of their obligations and responsibilities to the Maratha Empire. The Rajputs under the Moghuls, like the Marathas under the Deccan Sultans, considered no pursuit worthier than the service of their masters whose smiles and favours they courted and welcomed like manna from heaven. \n\nShivaji’s second adversary was Jafar Khan, the Prime Minister, whose wife was the sister of Shaista Khan, the man who had lost his fingers, wives and sons in his encounter with the Maratha king at Poona. The infuriated woman never allowed a moment to be lost in persuading her husband to intrigue for Shivaji’s downfall, while another influential lady in the imperial palace made unceasing efforts to achieve the same results. Jahanara, the powerful sister of the Emperor, was deeply offended at the sack of Surat which had deprived her of her normal customs revenue from that port. The opportunity was too good to be lost for wreaking a terrible vengeance upon Shivaji. Shivaji knew the gravity of his peril and was left in no doubt about his future when armed guards were posted around his residence.. But, however desperate the situation, he flatly refused to see the Emperor again. Indeed, he had an unconquerable aversion for bowing his head before any temporal authority, although he was ever so willing to prostrate himself before pious men. The utmost concession he made during the period of his duress at Agra was to allow his little son, Sambhaji, who had accompanied him, to visit the palace and wait upon the Emperor. But he abated no efforts to secure his early release from Moghul surveillance. He addressed . frequent requests to Aurangzeb to permit him to return to the Deccan so that he might advance the cause of the imperialists by co-operating in their campaigns against Bijapur. He tried various other methods towards this end, including his plea to the high dignitaries to intercede on his behalf. But on every occasion he drew a blank. He tried one more expedient. He asked the Emperor to allow him to go to holy Banaras and to spend the rest of his life there like a recluse. With a cynicism worthy of his sinister nature, Aurangzeb replied: “Let him turn a fakir and live in the fort of Allahabad where my officers will take good care of him!” In those days the fortress of Allahabad, like the forts of Gwalior, Asirgarh and Daulatabad, had won notoriety as a place of life-long detention for state prisoners.",

He must devise his own plans to secure his emancipation from the Moghul duress. It was characteristic of this dauntless and resourceful man that adversity invariably stimulated his mind, with brilliant successes following closely his gravest disasters. During the period he was not making plans for his escape he employed his enforced idleness in studying the Moghul system closely so that, on his return to the Deccan, he might give it a vigorous push towards dissolution. Shivaji saw that the Government of Aurangzeb rested on injustice and iniquity. We have already discussed at length the religious bigotry of the Emperor. No religion claimed his respect, not even Islam as practised by sects other than his own. The Bohras, according to Sarkar, “have a tradition that their spiritual guide, Sayyid Qutb-ud-din of Ahmedabad, was killed with 700 of his followers by order of Aurangzeb”.",

    "text": "The inveterate hostility of Aurangzeb and his father to the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda was largely due to the profession of the Shia faith by their rulers. The Sufi philosophers, with their broad-minded outlook, were equally stigmatized and persecuted by the gladiatorial Emperor as the heretics of Islam. Even the simple and eclectic faith of the Sikhs, founded by the great pacifist, Baba Nanak, was not spared the hammer-blows of Aurangzeb whose truculence played no small part in transforming the Sikhs into a militant fraternity. Thus, an overwhelming majority of the population, comprising the entire Hindu, Sikh and Christian communities, and a sizeable section of the followers of Islam, outside the narrow circle of the Sunni sect, were victims of unbridled religious oppression. To belong to the creed of the Emperor, therefore, came to be regarded as an especial privilege, its adherents behaving as if they were heaven-born. The religious policy of the Government was thus grossly unjust and the injustice was vastly aggravated by the imposition of the hateful jaziya tax on the Hindus in 1679 in order, it was asserted, to “spread Islam and put down the practice of infidelity”. Shivaji, who had by this period acquired sufficient strength to face the Moghul aggression without flinching, took the lead in addressing a letter of remonstrance to the Emperor. Drafted by Nila Prabhu, his Persian Secretary, the protest read: “It has recently come to my ears that, on the ground of the war with me having exhausted your wealth and emptied your treasury, your Majesty has ordered that money under the name of jaziya should be collected from the Hindus and the imperial needs supplied with it.” Recalling the growing impoverishment of the country, the letter declared: “Your peasants are downtrodden; the yield of every village has declined— in the place of one lakh of rupees only one thousand, and in the place of one thousand only ten are collected, and that too with difficulty.... It is a reign in which the army is in a ferment, the merchants complain, the Muslims cry, the Hindus are grilled; most men lack bread at night.... How can royal spirit permit you to add the hardship of the jaziya to this grievous state of things? The infamy will quickly spread from west to east and become recorded in books of history that the Emperor of Hindusthan, coveting the beggars’ bowls, takes the jaziya from Brahmins and the Jain monks, yogis, sanyasis, paupers, mendicants, ruined wretches, and the famine-stricken — that his valour is shown by attacking the wallets of beggars — that he dashes down to the ground the name and honour of the Timurids!” Reminding the bigot that all great religions are one, Shivaji goes on to say: “If you believe in the true Divine Book and word of God (i.e. the Quran), you will find there that God is styled as the Lord of all men and not as the Lord of the Muhammedans only....To show bigotry for any man’s own creed and practices is equivalent to altering the words of the Holy Book. To draw new lines on a picture is to find fault with the painter: In strict justice, the jaziya is not at all lawful.... But to oppress ants and flies is far from displaying valour and spirit.” The spirited protest concludes: “I wonder at the strange fidelity of your officers that they neglect to tell you of the true state of things, but cover a blazing fire with straw!” (Sir Jadunath Sarkar's translation.) It is not known what effect the letter produced on the Emperor, but it certainly yielded no results. Aurangzeb’s mind had long been sealed against considerations of prudence and humanity.",

    "text": "The second most egregious blunder of Aurangzeb was his inaccessibility to all counsels of moderation and fairplay. Akbar was a despot, but he deferred to the advice of wise men whom he encouraged to influence his ideas and ideals and to guide the policies of his government. But Aurangzeb was cast in a different mould and was congenitally incapable of sharing his confidence with others. He was intensely suspicious and never knew the quality of gratitude. All despotisms are hateful because they are a potent instrument for the debasement of man. But autocracy under Aurangzeb was utterly insufferable. In the Moghul polity, kissing the feet of the Emperor was regarded as a unique privilege! Aurangzeb demanded that the entire country should crawl before him in abject servility. Besides, Aurangzeb’s absurd idealism gave rise to a good deal of sanctimonious humbug. He hated music and drinking and tried to banish both from his realm. He made futile attempts to promote chastity through legislation, failing to realize that reform can succeed only when it becomes an organic part of the society’s outlook and adaptability. “All the cultural development of Islam,” says a writer, “all its philosophy and gaiety and grandeur of soul, meant nothing to him.” The kill-joy Emperor thus became an unwitting instigator of dishonesty and dissimulation. Manucci records that there were few persons who did not drink secretly and that “even the ministers and Qazis loved to get drunk at home. Gambling continued to be practised in his camp, and his order to all the courtesans and dancing girls to marry or leave the realm remained a dead letter”. Thus, from the year of his usurpation of the throne till his unlamented death in 1707, this suicidal man drove the country remorselessly to the brink of ruin by adopting bigotry, oppression and impractical idealism as the triple principles of his statecraft. During his stay at Agra Shivaji saw and heard sufficiently to confirm his belief in the vulnerability of the Moghul system.",

    "text": "Great courage, imagination and planning were necessary to ensure Shivaji’s escape from the clutches of the imperialists. As weeks melted into months, the restriction on his movements became far more rigorous than those of a mere house arrest. Perhaps, he could manage to leave the house unnoticed, but a vast sub-continent, policed by a hostile government, stretched between him and the place of safety. His retinue was not large, but as a party in flight it was too big to escape detection. Moreover, it was dangerous for him to share the secret of his intentions with many. He, therefore, secured permission to send the bulk of his escort back home— a course of action that was heartily welcomed at the court which believed that by depleting the number of his adherents, Shivaji had unwittingly made himself even more helpless. Shivaji’s plan of action was bold and simple and it succeeded admirably precisely for the same reason. For some weeks he had confined himself to bed announcing indisposition. Prolonged treatment, rest and prayers for his early recovery were considered necessary to ensure his return to good health. Large baskets containing sweetmeats were sent out of his house daily for distribution among Brahmins, mendicants and courtiers. The number of such baskets, slung on poles and carried by porters, increased with each day. The guards’ devotion to duty by searching every container did not long survive the tedium of the task. Little did they imagine that the baskets could become an excellent receptacle for conveying the great state prisoner from thraldom to freedom. In blissful ignorance of the fateful consequences of their carelessness and not realizing that, with Shivaji at large, there would be a most significant change in the course of Indian history, the easy-going guards allowed the baskets to move out freely without inspection. On the afternoon of August 19, 1666,* Shivaji and his son, Sambhaji, entered a pair of baskets and were promptly conveyed to a place of safety outside the city. There, on a lonely spot, he was greeted by his faithful followers who had made perfect arrangements for his onward journey to Maharashtra. The small party split into two, the king being accompanied by his young son, Niraji Raoji, Datta Trimbak and Raghu Mitra. Shivaji, who had acquired consummate skill in putting on an infinite variety of guises, concealed his identity and that of his party by donning the robes of wandering mendicants and proceeded to the great pilgrim centre, Mathura. At Agra his trusted officer, Hiroji Farzand, who had taken his place in the house, never left the “sick-bed” the whole of that day. He somewhat resembled Shivaji whose signet ring he wore to complete the deception about his real identity. The guards, who had been instructed not to disturb the “patient” on any account, left him in peace with no doubt or suspicion crossing their minds, especially when they saw the familiar ring on his finger. Hiroji left the bed on the following morning and, admonishing the watchmen to be considerate towards his “ailing” chief, made his exit from the house never to return. A strange silence fell over the house, which, only a few days earlier, had been humming with activity. The guards became suspicious and their worst fears were soon confirmed when they failed to see the prisoner in his place. Their frantic search for Shivaji proving abortive, they rushed to the police chief, Siddi Fulad, who had been commissioned by the Emperor to be in charge of the Maratha king’s detention, and broke the astounding news to him. Bewildered and shaking with fear, the unfortunate officer promptly reported the incident to Aurangzeb, asserting that Shivaji had made his escape with the aid of occult powers. The astute Emperor did not, of course, allow himself to be taken in by any such absurd explanations and ordered an immediate despatch of search parties in all directions. By then Shivaji had gained a lead of fourteen hours.",

    "text": "Shivaji made his escape not a day too soon. More than three months had elapsed since his arrival at Agra. Aurangzeb had by now made up his mind to seal the fate of his adversary. He abandoned the original project of sentencing Shivaji to life-imprisonment in the dungeon of a fortress because he knew that so long as his enemy lived he would continue to torment his thoughts. Death was the only fitting reward to the Maratha for his temerity in unfurling the flag of independence. But Aurangzeb must commit this diabolical crime without risking popular odium. The north-west frontier was in a ferment. It was decided that Shivaji and Jai Singh’s son, Ram Singh, should accompany the punitive expedition against the tribesmen. A Muslim officer, called Radandaz Khan was directed to join them with secret instructions that the Maratha king should be killed at a convenient time and place on the way to the north-west frontier. The man was a specialist in perpetrating such atrocities. Pending preparations for the distant expedition, Shivaji was to be removed soon to another house from where escape would have been impossible. This carefully nurtured plan, however, went hopelessly awry by his timely flight. Providence could not have dealt a more staggering blow to the evil-minded plotters. In planning the route of his journey from Agra to Maharashtra Shivaji showed the same depth of perception as marked his escape from the city. He threw the Moghul hordes in his pursuit off their scent by proceeding to the north instead of the south. Mathura was his immediate destination, which he reached safely with his son and followers within six hours. Both on account of his tender age and the greater risk of detection with him as a companion of the fugitives, Sambhaji was left behind in the holy city in charge of a Brahmin family from Maharashtra. The boy was later restored to his parents after the commotion caused by the escape had died down. Shivaji shaved off his beard and moustache to complete his disguise and, taking his trusted men with him, proceeded eastwards to Allahabad. From there the route of his journey lay through Bundelkhand, Gondwana and Golkonda. On September 12, 1666 he reached Rajgad where his mother was in residence. Shivaji’s home-coming, after an absence of more than six months, was an event of historic importance and of great rejoicing throughout the Deccan. Fervent thanksgiving prayers were offered from thousands of temples and from the tabernacle of millions of hearts on his safe return. In the eyes of his mother, whom he pleasantly surprised by appearing before her in the garb of a sanyasin, it was a virtual rebirth. His unique exploit increased the respect and admiration of his people for him tenfold. Only he and none else, they rightly believed, could have won his deliverance from the stranglehold of the wily Emperor and eluded the vigilance of his alerted minions. Shivaji noted with supreme satisfaction that the high standard of his administration had been maintained during his long absence from his realm. Not a single Maratha officer had succumbed to the seductions of the Moghul service, thus demonstrating to the misguided careerists in the country that it was impossible to set any price on patriotism. Aurangzeb never forgave himself over Shivaji’s escape. The episode haunted his dreams till the end of his life in 1707. Reflecting on it philosophically, he expatiated on the need for a",

Shivaji’s escape, he lamented, would involve him in wars and vexations till the end of his life. His immediate reaction was, however, to seek a scapegoat. He found one in the unfortunate Ram Singh, an innocent man, whom he denounced as a traitor, stripped him of all his honours and estates and forbade his attendance at the court. In the extremity of his despair and anger, he failed to realize that no son of Mirza Raja Jai Singh would venture to deviate from the path of loyalty to his person and throne. The plight of Jai Singh in the Deccan was even more pitiable. With an astonishing disregard for the solemn promise he had given to Shivaji, he refused to rejoice at the Maratha king's emancipation from the clutches of his unscrupulous master. No- thing mattered to him more than his own prestige and influence at the court, despite his knowledge of the faithlessness of the Emperor. Shivaji’s escape, the disgrace of his son and his own failure in the campaign against Bijapur presaged the end of his career as, to quote his own words, the “slave of the court.” One cannot write about this man without a heavy heart. By THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 107 virtue of his eminent qualities and the opportunities that came his way, he should have striven for a place with patriots like Shivaji and Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, but he chose the easier path of service and personal advancement under a government and a master both of whom were dominated by narrow-mind- ed bigotry. ' Jai Singh’s letter to Jafar Khan, the Moghul Prime Minister, reveals how even an honourable man can sink to incredible depths of degradation by taking a distorted view of his respon- sibilities and obligations. It was, of course, impossible for him to apprehend Shivaji by any means, but, at the behest of his lord and master, he captured Netaji Palkar, who had already joined the Moghuls, and sent him a prisoner to Delhi. The misguided and impetuous Maratha was converted to Islam, circumcised and called Muhammed Kuli. He was used as a mercenary and served in Afghanistan for ten years till his escape from Moghul thraldom and return to his former master, Shivaji, in May 1676. The sad man, who had perhaps grown wiser after his experi- ence in the north; was soon reclaimed to his ancestral faith. Jai Singh did not long survive his humiliation. A lone and tragic figure, he found escape from his grief and misery in death which overtook him at Burhanpur on August 28, 1667 while on his way to Delhi, posing a problem to the historian in determining his place in history. His exit was, however, of much value to Shivaji who knew that it was impossible even for the Moghul Empire to nurse more than one man of Jai Singh’s calibre.",

    "text": "Shivaji’s escape from Agra in September 1666 marked the be- ginning of a new era in Maharashtra and indeed in the whole of India. His safe home-coming gladdened and galvanized his people to an extent that no other event could have done. The great deliverer was back in their midst to lead them to victory against misrule, oppression and intolerance. His sensational escape thrilled millions of his countrymen in other provinces, and those that had banded themselves together to overthrow the imperial yoke watched his subsequent activities with deep interest and expectation. Shivaji had, however, to act with great caution. Some of the important strongholds of Maha- rashtra were in the hands of the enemy and were being guarded by competent and vigilant commanders, although no fortress could long remain in hostile possession so long as the inhabi- tants in the surrounding regions were animated by sentiments of patriotism and by a willingness to make any sacrifice for the common cause. Shivaji, therefore, prudently avoided an open conflict with the Moghuls soon after his return from Agra. Following his arduous and nerve-shattering journey, he was in dire need of rest Besides, after his long absence from his people, it was necessary for him to understand their temper and their pre- paredness for another trial of strength with the imperialists, which was likely to be more bitter and prolonged than the pre- vious struggle. The next campaign would necessarily have to be directed towards winning back the ceded hill-forts, which certainly was not a small undertaking. Time was also requir- ed to repair the damage done to his realm by Jai Singh’s vic- tories which had greatly contracted his territories and re- sources. Every consideration of prudence thus demanded that he should remain at peace both with the Moghuls and the Bijapur Government till the right time for action came. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 109 Shivaji could afford to bide his own time, especially after Jai Singh’s death. Under Prince Muazzam’s viceroyalty of the Deccan, there was a manifest disinclination on the parr of the Moghuls to renew the hostilities against the Marathas. With his customary astuteness Shivaji wrote a conciliatory letter to Aurangzeb, explaining that his precipitate departure from Agra was prompted solely by his fear for personal safety and not out of any desire on his part to provoke a conflict with the Emperor. Whether Aurangzeb, a consummate practitioner of the art of cunning and duplicity, was mollified by such gestures from his mortal foe is doubtful, but he made a virtue out of necessity by outwardly accepting Shivaji’s offer of friendship and co-operation. In the administration of his charge Prince Muazzam was assisted by Maharaja )aswant Singh, who shared his master’s partiality for the seductions of sloth and self-indulgence. Both were fond of the chase and organized frequent shikar expedi- tions. They certainly did not subscribe to the Emperor’s en- thusiasm for renewing hostilities against the elusive and in- domitable Marathas. And when Shivaji made his peace offer, they eagerly grasped his hand of friendship, eventually persuad- ing a reluctant Emperor to endorse their action. Peace thus prevailed between the Marathas and the Moghuls from 1667-69, although discerning men on both sides could see that no dur- able understanding was possible so long as the most vital region of Maharashtra remained under alien control. Shivaji, who had observed the weakness of the Empire at the source, now found his conclusions confirmed by the squab- bles among the Moghul imperialists in the Deccan. Dilir Khan, who had accompanied Jai Singh to the south as his second in command and who survived him, was not endowed with any estimable accomplishments except the lone virtue of courage as a soldier. He was ambitious, jealous, truculent and treacherous and was indeed a typical representative of the 110 SHIYAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Rohilla clan which continued to figure in Indian history even after the dissolution of the Moghul Empire.* Dilir Khan had won the confidence of the Emperor by prov- ing false to his superior, Jai Singh, which policy he practised even against Prince Muazzam. He wrote to Aurangzeb de- nouncing his son as a traitor. Deliberately misconstruing the relations between the Prince and the Marathas, he complained that Muazzam was in collusion with Shivaji with the wicked object of usurping the imperial throne. The Emperor did not dismiss the charge as the fabrication of a spiteful man since his own conscience never forgave him for a similar crime. The Khan’s estrangement from Jaswant Singh was complete and no- thing could bring the two men together. The Emperor was in a quandary since both his son and his Rajput lieutenant repeatedly accused Dilir Khan of insubordi- nation and of arrogant behaviour. To ascertain the truth, which had been obscured by the recriminations of his quar- relling oflicers, Aurangzeb sent his own Chamberlain to the Deccan with directions to find our whether it was really the Khan or the Prince who was contemplating a rebellion against the Government.

    "text": "As a contemporary English observer wrote: “He played the Jack on both sides, and told the Prince that Dilir Khan was his enemy, and went to Dilir Khan and told him that the Prince would seize on him if he came to Aurangabad.” Sarkar, who quotes this passage, adds: “His unfortunate advice to Dilir only prolonged the tension.” Muazzam’s persistent attempts to prejudice the Emperor’s mind against Dilir Khan at last succeeded. An order was sent to the Viceroy to arrest the contumacious Khan and “bring him back to the path of obedience”. Forestalling the imperial directive, Dilir fled in panic northwards to Malwa. It was a suicidal move of which his enemies took full advantage. The Prince and Jaswant Singh went in pursuit of him, at the same time inviting Shivaji to come to their aid. This sordid episode furnished the most convincing proof of the growing imbecility of the Moghul counsels in the Deccan. Thinking men began to wonder whether the feud among the imperialists was not in fact a prelude and a dress-rehearsal for a full-scale civil war. The Emperor’s timely intervention, however, saved the situa- tion, though only temporarily. The trouble with the Moghuls, as all who had eyes to see could observe, was that their Empire was rapidly heading for its dissolution. It had long passed the pinnacle of its glorious achievements. Neither its vast armies, representing a museum of diverse nationalities, nor the wealth of its grandees, nor the splendid palaces and mausoleums of the Emperors, could con- ceal the mortal disease that had seized the Moghul body politic. The decline in the moral and spiritual power of the realm was noticed by contemporary observers even during the reign of Jahangir. The demoralization was far more pronounced under the government of Aurangzeb whose morbid fanaticism and amazing ignorance of the economic consequences of bis 112 SIIXVAJX : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT interminable and costly wars, hastened the process of disinte- gration. A rupture in the relations between the Moghuls and the Marathas was inevitable. The Emperor’s disrespect for the religion of the land angered the Hindus all over the country. Jijabai, the pious and spirited mother of Shivaji, considered the destruction of the Vishweshwar temple at Banaras as a wanton affront to Hindu manhood. Sardesai holds that she played no small part in influencing her son’s decision to renew hostilities against the Moghul bigot and tyrant. Shivaji’s dignified re- buke to the Emperor, composed in a language worthy of his high purpose, provides one more example of how all thinking sections in the country felt revolted by Aurangzeb’s excesses and cruelties. Apart from these religious considerations, Shivaji could clearly see the growing distractions of the Empire. Soon after his departure from Agra, the Moghul troops were deployed to the Punjab to guard the province against an apprehended invasion by the Shah of Persia. Indeed, the unhappy Aurangzeb had little respite from trouble and vexation.",

    "text": "The chronically agitated North-West Frontier erupted in March 1667, compelling the Mughals to rush their troops to Peshawar. The turbulent tribesmen's refusal to submit to the Emperor, even one of their own faith, offered no lesson to the bigoted Aurangzeb. The strained imperial treasury is evident in Aurangzeb's order to recover the paltry sum of one lakh rupees advanced to Shivaji for his Agra journey. The agreement with Prince Muazzam, obligating the Mughals to maintain a Maratha contingent, further burdened their finances and caused the Emperor deep anguish.  A Maratha chronicler candidly records that jagirs (land grants) were assigned to the Marathas within Mughal territory, allowing their troops to “feed themselves at the expense of the Mughal dominion”. Aurangzeb, characteristically, attempted to end this arrangement through treachery. He instructed his son to arrest Shivaji—a near impossible task. Failing this, he ordered the detention of Shivaji’s son and generals as hostages. Repulsed by his father's lack of scruples, the Prince, forewarned of the Emperor's intentions, advised the Maratha commanders, Prataprao Gujar and Niraji Raoji, to flee Aurangabad.  This plan's failure disappointed Aurangzeb, though he found solace in the Marathas losing access to the jagirs. The uneasy peace of 1667-69 dissolved into open war in early January 1670.  The Marathas, eager for action, aimed to reclaim the forts of Sinhgad and Purandar from Mughal occupation.  Jijabai, the Queen-Mother, yearned to see the invaders expelled, her wish a command to her devoted son, Shivaji. The loss of Sinhgad particularly pained her, and she deemed no sacrifice too great for its recapture. The fort, guarded by the Rajput warrior Uday Bhan, was retaken on February 4, 1670, by Tanaji Malusare and his Maratha troops, though both commanders perished in the battle. Purandar, which had previously withstood a Mughal siege, became the next target. Its valiant garrison, once led by Murar Baji Prabhu, had demonstrated the Deccan highlanders’ military prowess. Now under Raziuddin Khan, the fort fell to Nilopant and his men on March 8, effectively nullifying the Treaty of Purandar.",

    "text": "Confident in their cause, aware of their adversaries' weakening state, and adhering to the doctrine of offensive warfare, the Marathas raided Chandwad near Nasik, seizing valuable imperial treasure. Their attack on Mahuli in north Konkan initially faltered, but the Rajput keeper, Manohar Das Gaur, surrendered on June 16, anticipating no support from his government.  A resounding victory followed in early March with the recapture of Kalyan and Bhiwandi near Bombay, eliminating Mughal presence in north Konkan. By April's end, Maratha forces penetrated deep into imperial territories, extracting levies from Junnar, Ahmednagar, and Parenda.  Surat was sacked a second time on October 3, 1670, yielding sixty-six lakhs of rupees. This deeply wounded Aurangzeb’s pride, though he delayed his personal Deccan campaign, perhaps due to northern distractions or recognition of Shivaji's strength. He dispatched able generals, however, with ample resources.  Prince Muazzam, equally humiliated, ordered Daud Khan Qureshi to intercept the returning Marathas. Despite numerical superiority under Prataprao Gujar, Vyankoji Datto, and Makaji Anandrao, the Marathas were burdened by the treasure from Surat. Shivaji, dividing his force and employing guerilla tactics, ensured the treasure’s safe passage through a secret pass. He then personally led a charge, inflicting heavy casualties, capturing horses and officers (who were later released with gifts).  Siddi Hilal, the Mughal Governor of Dindori, defected to the Marathas. The Battle of Dindori, October 17, 1670, temporarily crippled Mughal power in the Deccan, an opportunity Shivaji exploited.  In December, he led an army into Khandesh, sacking Bahadurpura near Burhanpur and capturing Karanja, which yielded one crore of rupees. Khandesh subsequently became a key revenue source for Maharashtra.  The chouth system, levying one-fourth of the revenue, was implemented at this time. Maratha incursions continued largely unchecked, prompting Aurangzeb to appoint Mahabat Khan to the southern command with orders to ruthlessly crush the enemy. Mahabat Khan, arriving in Aurangabad in January 1671, was assisted by Daud Khan, with Jaswant Singh and Dilir Khan ordered to cooperate. However, concerted Mughal action was hampered by internal rivalries and personal ambitions. Daud Khan, for instance, considered serving under Mahabat Khan beneath him.",

    "text": "Mahabat Khan, despite his military skill, lacked magnanimity and was consumed by jealousy when Daud Khan achieved success against the Marathas.  Heavy rains in 1671 brought pestilence to the Mughal camp at Pamera, causing widespread death.  Yet, Mahabat Khan remained unmoved, indulging in entertainments while his troops perished.  This callous indifference, combined with the leadership's pursuit of pleasure and neglect of duty, contributed to the empire's decline.  Mughal cruelty further compounded the situation, exemplified by Dilir Khan's massacre of Poona's citizens above the age of nine in December 1671. The Battle of Salher in early February 1672 marked a turning point. With renowned generals like Prataprao Gujar, Moropant Pingle, and Anandrao Makaji leading the Marathas, both sides fought fiercely. The Mughals suffered a decisive defeat, with senior officers captured. Sarkar notes the capture of Ikhlas Khan and Muhakam Singh, while Rao Amar Singh and numerous soldiers were killed, the entire siege camp falling to the Marathas. The Peshwa, instrumental in the victory, recaptured Salher and Mulher.  Sardesai cites Sabhasad's account, attributing the success to the Peshwa's strategy and valor, celebrated in contemporary poetry. Sabhasad highlights the Maratha victory over renowned Mughal commanders, emphasizing the joy it brought Shivaji, who rewarded the messengers and distributed sweets.  Dilir Khan escaped, while wounded Mughals were captured, treated, and released with gifts, some even joining Shivaji’s service. The impact of Salher resonated with foreign observers, marking a shift in the balance of power.",

    "text": "According to the English records of that period, Shivaji “forced the two generals (that is, Bahadur Khan and Dilir Khan), who with their armies had entered into his country, to retreat with shame and loss”. Grant Duff, who describes the battle in some detail, observes: “This victory was the most complete ever achieved by Shivaji’s troops in a fairly fought action with the Moghuls and contri- buted greatly to the renown of the Marathas. Its immediate consequence was the abandonment of the siege of Salher and a precipitate retreat of the army to Aurangabad.” The British historian also mentions the nobility and the generous attitude of Shivaji towards the captives and says that he “treated the prisoners of rank, who were sent to Raigad, with distinction, and, when their wounds were healed he dismissed them in an honourable manner. Such prisoners as chose to remain were admitted into his service; and deserters, both from the Bijapur and the Moghul armies, began to join the Maratha standard in considerable numbers.”\nIt was characteristic of Aurangzeb that he failed to see the signs of the times by attributing Maratha success to the treachery of his own trusted and highly-placed officers. His bigoted mind and warped outlook exempted none from his all- embracing suspicion. He mistook Mahabat Khan’s ineffective- ness for collusion with Shivaji, which was an entirely baseless assumption. The unfortunate commander-in-chief, who was recalled, left the Deccan for the north in May 1672, leaving the vacant office to be held by Bahadur Khan. The conquest of the Koli territory by Moropant Pingle in the same year gave the Marathas “a short, safe and easy route from Kalyan upto Northern Konkan to Surat and laid that port helplessly open to invasion from the south”. Bahadur Khan’s combined office of viceroy and commander-in-chief, held by him till August 1677, produced no outstanding results in favour of his Government, both he and Dilir Khan, the latter in charge of Gujarat, being constantly under pressure from the exultant Marathas. Bijapur, like its counterpart in the north, was on its last legs. The death of its penultimate ruler, Ali Adilshah, on November 24, 1672 gave his self-seeking nobles a great opportunity to advance their own interests, to the detriment of the kingdom. Sikandar, who succeeded Ali, was only four years old and became the plaything of a coterie of ambitious and faction-ridden sardars.",

    "text": "In the manoeuvre for power an Abyssinian general called Khawas Khan double-crossed his other accomplices and became the regent of the boy king. The State, the internal cohesion of which had already been seriously undermined by the implacable hostility between indigenous and imported Muslims and by the sullen resentment of the majority com- munity over its fallen condition, was no longer able to with- stand the attacks of the Marathas and the invaders from the north. Shivaji certainly did not let go the great opportunity of bene- fiting his new kingdom from Bijapur’s growing distractions. Panhala was among his favourite forts and was ideally situated for the protection of his southern province. Its restoration to the Bijapur Government in 1660 to avoid war on two fronts was a hateful transaction to which he had never reconciled himself. His preoccupations with the imperialists had given him no opportunity to recover it. The time was now propitious for restoring Panhala to the galaxy of Maharashtra’s famous fortresses. He put Annaji Datto in command of a small army consisting of men well- versed in the scaling of fort walls. Annaji requisitioned the services of a courageous and resourceful man called Kondaji Ravlekar whose plan of action for the capture of the fort was as ingenious as it was bold. He sent inside the fort a small group of Marathas in disguise, with instructions to win over the garrison secretly to Shivaji’s cause and took upon himself the most perilous and daring task of entering the stronghold by climbing its walls from the steep hill-side with the aid of rope- ladders. Sixty adventurous Marathas shared the glory in per- forming this memorable exploit. Kondaji’s feat at Panhala re- minds us of a similar brilliant episode in the eighteenth century when Colonel Popham of the East India Company covered him- self with glory by his escalade of the impregnable fortress of Gwalior, which unnerved even such a great soldier as Mahadji Scindia. Panhala is a big fort and on the day of its capture, March 6, 1673, it was garrisoned by a large force under the command of Babu Khan. To create the illusion that a large number of Marathas had entered it, Kondaji and his men produced a mighty commotion inside the fort by blowing trumpets and other noisy instruments and by shouting at the top of their voices, in which diversionary strategy they were heartily joined by the party that had entered the fort earlier in various dis- guises. Before the bewildered garrison could recover from the surprise, the main gates of the fort were thrown open so that the Maratha troops that had been waiting outside rushed into the fort, shouting the famous war-cry Har Har Mahadev, and put to the sword all men that opposed them. The keeper of Panhala, Babu Khan, was killed and his deputy put to flight. A vast treasure fell into the hands of the victors. It was a great day for Shivaji’and his cause. The ease with which the stronghold was captured confirmed the widely held belief that the Marathas were indeed unique in this mode of warfare. Shivaji promptly visited Panhala to congratulate and reward his valiant comrades and to make permanent arrangements for its administration. Soon afterwards, Satara and Parli were wrested from the Bijapur Government. The fort of Parli was donated to Ramdas Swami and was renamed Sajjangad, meaning the Fort of the Pious.",

    "text": "void of insolence or ostentation”. But his own predilections were not of much importance when weighed against considerations of policy and propriety. On the issue of his coronation, he anticipated that unique Corsican, Napolean, who became the Emperor of France, assuming the attributes of sovereignty more out of policy than from his own volition. “What is a throne?” asked Napolean, and answered, “a piece of wood covered with satin!” And yet he chose this piece of little used but costly furniture to sustain the majesty of his power. Commenting on Napolean’s decision to crown himself, his biographer, Emil Ludwig, says: “Indeed, the glamour of the throne is stronger, and therefore he will take the establishment of his throne more seriously than he took the foundation of the Legion of Honour. It is an instrument of policy, a means for the management of men. In the real world, where no one can call familiar spirits to his aid, the private person, the poet or the philosopher, can raise his head heavenward without bearing the burden of a crown; but the statesman needs the insignia of power, for the f p°p T u J ace caimot beIieve in reality of power unless he wno wields power wears the insignia.” If a nineteenth century France, which had earlier boldly and decisively proclaimed the paramountcy of liberty, fraternity and equality as the basis for the government of human affairs, thus causing mortal terror to the crowned heads of Europe, found it necessary to invest one of its citizens with the insignia of sovereignty after deliberately destroying the previous occupant of the throne, it was far more essential that the new realm of Maharashtra in India should have a king. Obviously, the anomaly of a kingdom without a duly anointed ruler to govern could not be allowed to persist. Besides, in India, as in many other countries, the institution of kingship was nearly as old as her civilization. Most of the old treatises on statecraft insisted on government by king as the only system most conducive to the stability of society. The dread of anarchy had played a prominent part in investing the occupant of the throne with divine rights and honours. A manual on government insisted that the first choice of a man should be his king and then his wife, for “without a king in the world where would wife and property be?” It is true that the same law-givers laid down that, since the main purpose of government was to establish order, the king, as the head of the administration, should regard himself as the first social servant. But to the common people, who could not be expected to understand the abstract principles of political philosophy, the king became an object of profound respect and veneration, since he was a pre-eminent symbol of stability and protection. Indeed, the concept of kingship had been so firmly woven into the very texture of the people’s beliefs that it often warped the judgment of even the most enlightened and sagacious men. But no king had the right to obedience if he was a tyrant and an oppressor. It was in fact the duty of responsible citizens to ensure the removal of a bad ruler, but this right was seldom exercised and fell into disuse under Muslim rule. Government by a minority was an insufferable affront to the dignity, the honour and the interests of the majority, but, besides the political and military weakness of the Hindus, the spectacle of the ruler being a crowned personage played no small part in their acquiescence in Muslim rule. It is for this reason that Mirza Raja Jai Singh, an outstanding Rajput of his time, did not regard it as a personal debasement when he supplicated himself before Aurangzeb as “the slave of the court”. Shivaji was both shrewd and sagacious in realizing the political and psychological value of the glittering and expensive headgear. The territory he had won was still small, but the value of his conquest was incalculable. It was necessary to carry on his great work, and continuity of succession, with the consent of the people, could best be ensured by his becoming a king. His successors would inherit a sovereignty which in capable hands could perhaps eventually extend to the whole country. Even if some of them proved ineffective, they could always be guided by competent men, once the line of succession was firmly established. The sovereignty of the House of Shivaji thus offered the best guarantee of stability to the administration of Maharashtra. Besides, the crowning of Shivaji would strike the imagination of the Hindus throughout the country. It would herald the coming of an age when they could confidently hope to regain their heritage, not for their exclusive enjoyment or gratification, but in order to share it in full measure with the rest of their countrymen. His coronation would mark the end of the dismal and defeatist belief that the Hindus could never be independent rulers of their land and thus pave the way for the establishment of more normal and harmonious relations between the two great communities. At the same time, it would fill the enemies of the new State with despair that it was no longer possible to supplant it. Finally, Shivaji’s assumption of the insignia of royalty would thoroughly expose the hollowness of the pretensions of the Maratha mankaris or nobles, some of whom, like the Mores, disdained to regard him as their equal, despite the fact of their unqualified subordination to the Muslim rulers. All their attitude of arrogance and effrontery and all their supercilious behaviour towards him would end once he became both the de facto and de jure monarch of his realm.",

    "text": "At least, the more discerning ones among them would realize, though belatedly, that the kingdom of Shivaji was a source of inspiration and a rallying-point to the Hindus all over the country, symbolizing the revival of India’s great and glorious traditions of the past. After the Rayas of the Vijayanagar Empire, no Hindu ruler had chosen to ascend the throne with all the solemn ceremony and circumstance that had marked the accession of the great sovereigns of old. To Shivaji belonged this distinction. The historic ceremony was held at Raigad, the new capital of Shivaji. Originally called Rairi, it was conquered from Chandrarao More in 1656 when it was without any fortifications. Situated on a lofty and an almost inaccessible plateau, Raigad, with its spaciousness and strategic position, was in every way qualified to become the capital of the new State — a distinction which had long been enjoyed by Rajgad near Poona. In his description of Raigad Dr. Fryer says: “It is fortified by nature rather than art, there being one avenue to it, which is guarded by two narrow gates, and fortified by a strong wall exceeding high and bastions thereto. On the mountain are many strong buildings, as the Raja’s court and the houses of other ministers.” It was in this place that Shivaji ascended the throne on Saturday, June 5, 1674. It was a great and glorious day for Maharashtra and, in the eyes of all discerning persons, for the whole of India. At Raigad elaborate preparations had been made for months to celebrate the . event with splendour and solemnity. Cool, clean and beautiful, the hill-city, with its stately palaces and mansions, glowed with festive gaiety. It played host to thousands of persons, consisting of men, women and children drawn from different parts of Maharashtra and from outside. Men known for their learning and piety mustered strong to bless the new monarch. The great Ramdas Swami, that uncompromising apostle of Hindu revival, was present to witness the realization of his dream for the establishment of righteousness in this ancient land. The Queen-Mother, Jijabai, was overwhelmed with joy at the crowning of her beloved son. Dignitaries from various parts of the country had assembled in the capital to witness a spectacle, the like of which had not been seen for centuries. Among the guests was Henry Oxenden, a relative of the chief of the East India Company’s factory at Surat, who has left behind a vivid eye-witness account of the coronation ceremony. Shivaji exercised great judgment in the choice of the officiating priest. Visweshwar or Gaga Bhat of Banaras, whose ancestors originally belonged to Paithan in Maharashtra, was a distinguished scholar and had made a profound study of the Vedas and other sacred texts of the Hindus. He effectively silenced all orthodox opposition to Shivaji’s enthronement by quoting chapter and verse from ancient authorities in its support. The assumption that only the so-called Kshatriyas were entitled to anointment as sovereigns was as absurd as insistence on the primacy of caste. Long before the birth of Shivaji it had been conclusively proved by history that not all the great monarchs of ancient or mediaeval India belonged to the Kshatriya or Rajput race. The Sungas and Kanvas were Brahmins, as were many other dynasties. We have the testimony of Hiuen Tsang that the great Harsha was a Vaishya, while the Nandas, and perhaps even the Mauryas, sprang from castes other than the first three. Indeed, the rational aphorism “whoever bears rule is a Kshatriya” was applied and, after the lapse of some generations, royal families from the so-called non-dvrija castes were quietly assimilated into the Kshatriya or warrior class. Armed with such incontrovertible facts, the scholarly priest from Banaras duly installed Shivaji on the throne with all the ceremonial appropriate to the occasion. Gaga Bhat enjoyed unrivalled prestige as “the greatest Sanskrit theologian and controvertialist then alive, a master of the four Vedas, the six philosophies, and all the scriptures of the Hindus” and was in fact acclaimed as the most learned man of the age. With such an outstanding authority presiding over the Raigad ceremonies, Shivaji’s assumption of the insignia of royalty was assured of wide acceptance. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 128 Enormous sums of money were spent during the festivities that began many weeks before the main event. Thousands of guests, Brahmins and others, were fed daily with sumptuous fare. Gifts were given freely to learned and holy men and to thousands of others. Shivaji was weighed in gold, totalling 16,000 hons or one hundred and forty pounds, and the entire money was given away in charity. The throne, variously described as “magnificent” and “rich and stately”, cost the exchequer fourteen lakhs of rupees. Estimates of the total expenditure differ, but according to one calculation, as much as fifty lakhs of rupees was spent on the occasion. Orthodoxy forced on Shivaji a second coronation, though on a minor scale, the date of the superfluous ceremony being September 24, 1674. The enthronement of her son marked the fulfilment of the most cherished ambition of Jijabai, who died on June 18, 1674, thirteen days after his coronation, full of happiness at her great good fortune.",

    "text": "Shivaji was stricken with grief at the death of his mother and the fact of her advanced age did not mitigate the anguish of his bereavement. Jijabai was not an ordinary mother; she was his guardian angel, a wise counsellor and an unfailing source of inspiration. This remarkable lady, who had all the grace and temper of a lioness, brooked insult from none, whether the offender was her own father or husband. And yet her devotion to her family was profound and unshakable. Jijabai was indeed a woman who was many steps ahead of her times. She had the vision, the patriotism and the pertinacity in training her son for the exalted mission of liberating the country from misgovernment and thus won the admiration of posterity as the woman who influenced the course of history. She was an emancipated woman and her progressive outlook played no small part in reclaiming some of the prominent Maratha converts to Hinduism. By her masterful personality and zeal for noble causes, she became a model of Maratha womanhood. Her example in courage and fortitude was followed in her own family by the widow of her grandson, the celebrated Tarabai, who, after the death of Raja-ram, took up the cause of Maratha independence against the Moghul armies, with astonishing tenacity and resourcefulness. In the death of his mother, Shivaji lost the mainstay of his life. While die Marathas were preoccupied with the festivities connected with the coronation, the Moghul Viceroy, Bahadur Khan, attempted to encroach upon their territories in the hope that his aggressions would go unnoticed. The imminence of the monsoon had further persuaded him that the Marathas would not be able to adopt any prompt retaliatory measures. In this, as in many other things when dealing with his Deccan enemies, he was thoroughly mistaken. Shivaji had not sheathed his sword by merely putting the crown on his head. The throne was for him not a soft cushion of indulgence but a stem seat of duty. Once he was free from the ceremonies at Raigad, he renewed the campaign against the Moghuls.

Shivaji, who re-admitted him to his confidence, would perhaps not have countenanced such a significant social reform if he had not learnt to appreciate and admire his mother’s catholic outlook. Many years earlier, Bajaji Naik Nimbalkar of Phaltan, who had been forced to embrace Islam, was reclaimed for his ancestral re- ligion at the instance of Shivaji and his mother.

The discomfiture of the ill-starred Moghul commander did not, however, end there. Shivaji knew the Khan’s frame of mind. In order to save his face, he would grasp any oppor- tunity to come to terms with his adversary so long as they did not smack of abject surrender on his part. The Maratha king deliberately threw out peace feelers and entered into long drawn out negotiations with the Khan who once again fell to the bait. He succeeded in securing the Emperor's farman endorsing the so-called peace terms when Shivaji had no inten- tion whatsoever of making any concessions to the enemy. When it was no longer necessary to continue the futile nego- tiations, he dismissed the Moghul envoys by reminding them that the very ineffectiveness of their master ruled out the possibility of any accommodating gesture from the Marathas. The unfortunate Bahadur Khan made many abortive attempts to forge a military alliance with Bijapur for chastising their common enemy, but the vitality of that state was fast ebbing away. In November 1675 the regent, Khawas Khan, was dislodged from his position by Bahlol Khan, who was far too pre-occupied with his own distractions to be able to take any effective action against the Marathas. Aurangzeb, whose hatred for Bijapur was nearly as great as his hostility to the Marathas, ordered his viceroy to attack the tottering Adil- shahi State. On May 31, 1676 Bahadur Khan launched a vigorous offensive against Bijapur — an act of aggression which forced the new regent to implore Shivaji’s assistance against the imperialists. That was precisely what Shivaji had been waiting for. He would certainly help Bijapur — but at a price. The negotia- tions between the two states were conducted through the good offices of the Golkonda minister, Madanna. The treaty pro- vided for the payment of an annual subsidy of one lakh hons to the Maratha Government by Bijapur in return for military assistance against the imperialists. The agreement also stipulated that the Adilshahi Government should pay an addi- 132 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT tional sum of three lakhs of rupees to the Maratha King at the time of its signature. The fact that Bijapur’s “subsidiary alliance” with Shivaji did not long survive the vicissitudes of its politics does not alter the significance of the compact. Both in its historical perspective and in the eyes of his contemporaries, Shivaji’s success in exacting a tribute from the proud masters of his father gave a true indication of his greatness. The rupture that soon took place in the relations between the two states caused him no regret. His mind was now set on a great adventure and he refused to be deflected from his new goal by the imbecilities or the caprices of the Bij'apur Government. He had undertaken the invasion of the South, described as the “greatest expedition of his life”.",

CHAPTER 7 THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS (i) SURAT In a detailed analysis of the factors that favoured the esta- blishment of British dominion in India, The Oxford History of India gives great prominence to the possession of enormous re- sources by the East India Company. The British had certainly many other advantages over their Indian adversaries. They enjoyed an unchallenged naval supremacy which gave them an unrestricted access to the Indian shores; their armies were dis- ciplined, better equipped and competently led; and their policy- makers and empire-builders in India were gifted not only with a wide-ranging vision, but also with a high sense of purpose. Even so, great as these assets were, they would not have been of much avail in winning an empire for the British in India unless they enjoyed the decisive advantage that accrues from the ownership of large and assured sources of income. The armies of the Company Sarkar did not consist of super men and yet the legend of their invincibility gained the widest currency in the country. A palpable myth was accepted as a fact, essentially because the Company Government had an almost unlimited capacity to replace losses and to pay and maintain troops regularly. None of the Indian powers that were ranged against it was capable of such a financial feat. The revenues of even the Great Moghuls were not large enough to match the resources of the British in India. Reference has already been made to the grave financial embarrassment of Aurangzeb which compelled him to adopt a policy of retrench- ment and retraction in the Deccan. The East India Company was the beneficiary of its country’s expanding economy based on a developing trade. Later, England attained phenomenal pros- perity as she began to realize the abounding fruits of the in- dustrial revolution. It is a fact of great historical significance 134 SHIVAJl: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT that, while the annual revenues of Akbar during whose reign the Moghul Empire rose to the pinnacle of its glory, amounted to about 17£ million pounds, the realizations of the East India Company in 1792 from a much smaller and war-ravaged terri- tory were well over 8 million pounds a year. The Oxford His- tory clinches the issue when it says: “Britain, for all her paucity of numbers, was in fact stronger in resources than any one Indian power and equal to all of them put together. When it is remembered that the Indian powers never were united, the success of the British ceases to seem either extraordinary or un- accountable.” These preliminary observations are necessary in order to help us appreciate the raison d’etre of Shivaji’s ceaseless quest for money without which the success of. his great undertaking could not have been assured. As we saw in an earlier chapter, he set out on his mission with no worthwhile means at his dis- posal. In fact, the revenues from the impoverished and devas- tated Poona district, his mainstay for many years, amounted to the meagre sum of 40,000 hons a year. His raids into the enemy territories were thus prompted by the compelling neces- sity of acquiring sufficient means for sustaining and strengthen- ing his war of independence. His first major incursion into the Moghul dominion with this well-defined object was made in January 1664 when the city of Surat was sacked. Surat was, as it still is, a large, populous and prosperous city in Gujarat. It was the premier emporium of the East and a prized possession of the Moghuls. In 1608, when the English began to trade with that city, it was of “considerable size, with many good houses belonging to merchants”. The fortunes of Surat bore a striking resemblance to the rise and fall of the Moghul dynasty. It enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity for about eighty-five years during the reigns of Emperors Akbar, Jehangir and Shah Jahan, winning praise as a bright jewel in the diadem of the Moghuls. Noted for the industry and enterprise of its population, it rode on the crest of prosperity, gathering im- mense wealth within its precincts through its wide-ranging commercial interests. THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 135 It was a beautiful city, with extensive gardens and orchards spreading for miles around it, yielding a rich harvest of flower and fruit. The gardens, it has been recorded, were “continual- ly refreshed with curious springs and fountains of fresh water”, evidently drawn from the river Tapti. Apart from its pre- eminence\nas a port of international importance, Surat had ac- quired added importance as the “gateway” to the Muslim holy places in Arabia. Indeed, it was a city where every prospect pleased, but only man was vile, that man being not the com- mon man. Its decline set in with the commencement of the disastrous rule of Aurangzeb whose bigotry and misgovemment hastened the general impoverishment of the country. Stagna- tion gradually gained ascendancy over its commercial and civic life, eventually relegating its glory to the pages of history.",

    "section": "Shivaji's First Raid on Surat",
    "text": "Shivaji Maharaj sent word to the Governor, Inayat Khan, requesting a meeting with three influential Surat merchants to discuss a ransom. Considering his needs and the noble cause he defended, Shivaji’s demand was moderate: fifty lakhs of rupees, with a promise of non-violence if paid promptly. Surat, filled with affluent individuals, could have easily met this demand collectively. Unfortunately, the city lacked capable advisors, and the Governor was cowardly and treacherous. Receiving no response, Shivaji marched towards Surat on January 6, camping near the eastern gate. The Governor fled to the fort, leaving the city leaderless. Shivaji entered Surat, compelled to take what he'd offered to accept voluntarily.  His orders were strict: avoid unnecessary violence. Cosme da Guarda, a contemporary, wrote that Shivaji ordered no killings unless resisted, and since none resisted, none perished. However, the city suffered due to the fort commandant's foolish decision to fire indiscriminately upon the crowded town. Barthelemy Carre, a Frenchman, recounted the devastation caused by the garrison's thoughtless action, noting that while dangerous to Shivaji's soldiers, it primarily destroyed the city and its inhabitants' homes and stores. The Marathas avoided taking bulky, cheap goods. The firing caused significant loss of life and property in Surat's narrow, crowded streets, filled with inflammable houses. The sack lasted four days. Despite the inevitable suffering, Shivaji and his men refrained from excessive cruelty or vandalism. His inherent nobility and concern for his fellow men prevented unrestrained oppression. Thevenot, a Frenchman visiting Surat two years later, recorded Shivaji's consideration for the Christian population, granting them immunity at Father Ambrose's request. Bernier corroborated this, noting Shivaji's declaration that the “Frankish padries” were good men and wouldn't be harmed.  Shivaji maintained a friendly attitude towards Europeans in India as long as they didn't interfere in his affairs, setting an example of non-interference by remaining neutral in their rivalries. Thus, during the raid, he ignored the English and Dutch factories, as noted by Cosme da Guarda. Contrary to fabricated tales of heroic English resistance, Shivaji wasn't afraid of the East India Company; he simply wasn't interested in their warehouses as they didn't hold significant wealth. He wouldn’t be intimidated by a handful of foreign traders after confronting the Mughals.  Surat factors themselves acknowledged Shivaji's military prowess. The sack continued unhindered. On the second day, Inayat Khan plotted to assassinate Shivaji, sending an envoy with impossible terms.  Shivaji, angered, questioned the Governor’s cowardice. The envoy then attacked Shivaji with a dagger. A Maratha guard intervened, cutting off the assassin’s hand and then killing him.  However, the attacker's body fell onto Shivaji, staining his clothes with blood. Mistaking this for Shivaji's own blood, his followers were enraged and prepared for a massacre, but Shivaji calmed them, assuring he was unharmed.",

    "section": "Aftermath of the First Raid and the Second Raid on Surat",
    "text": "A false narrative emerged accusing Shivaji of ordering the deaths of four and maiming of twenty-four in reprisal. This story originates from Anthony Smith, an English factor held by the Marathas, whose dubious character and long list of misdemeanours were noted by his colleagues. Smith is likely the sole contemporary source for this claim, lacking corroboration from other chroniclers like Bernier, Manucci, Thevenot, or Carre, nor the Dutch factors.  Like Holwell's fabricated \"Black Hole\" tragedy, Smith likely invented this story out of resentment.  Regardless, judging a historical figure based on isolated, dubious incidents is unfair, especially given the inherent nature of war. Shivaji's gains from Surat, estimated between one and two crore rupees, were used to strengthen and beautify Raigad, his new capital, and build the Sindhudurg fort at Malwan, bolstering his naval power. The Governor, returning to Surat after the Maratha withdrawal, faced the scorn of the populace for his cowardice.  His son, in a twisted act of revenge, shot a Hindu trader. Six years later, in 1670, Shivaji returned to Surat for a second sack. The English, whose supposed valor was absent this time, preemptively emptied their warehouses and sent goods to Swally. The President, Gerald Aungier, and his Council fled Surat, even moving their treasure to a ship. Their panic was unfounded, as Shivaji received their representatives kindly, assuring them of their continued friendship and promising no harm. This second raid yielded sixty-six lakhs of rupees.  Shivaji then demanded an annual tribute of twelve lakhs to prevent future invasions. After his departure, Surat was pillaged by a mob, including English sailors led by Streynsham Master – a stark contrast to their claimed role as defenders of Surat. Despite the Maratha raids, Surat remained a significant city, though its prominence as a trading hub declined due to the rise of new commercial centers, particularly Bombay, whose potential was recognized by the English. Their tolerant policies and the island's natural harbor facilitated its growth as a major trading center, eventually eclipsing Surat.  However, Surat retained historical importance as the English Company's first permanent settlement on the Indian mainland and its chief town until 1687. Its significance persisted even in 1799 when its administration was transferred to the Company Government, still recognized as a major center of maritime commerce in India.",

    "text": "In Shivaji’s time South India presented the sordid spectacle of a house divided against itself. The greatness of this land of shrines and scholarship had suffered a severe setback following Muslim invasion from the north which began in the thirteenth century, culminating in the destruction of the ancient kingdoms of the Yadavas, the Hoysalas and the Pandyas. As pointed out in an earlier chapter, it was indeed a fitting retribution to the suicidal rulers of the Deccan and the south that the destruction of their greatness and glory was accomplished by a converted Hindu eunuch, Malik Kafur, who carried his victorious arms as far as Rameshvaram, destroying or desecrating some of the greatest temples on his march. Such acts of vandalism and spoliation continued unabated till the rise and expansion of the Vijayanagar Empire which, for more than two centuries, stood as an impregnable bastion against the onslaughts of bigotry and idol-smashing frenzy. “The great commentary,” writes Professor K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, “on the Vedas composed by a syndicate of scholars with Sayana at their head, and the impressive additions made to the structure of almost all important temples in the country by the rulers of Vijayanagar, form the most typical monuments of the work of the great Hindu empire.” All the grim conditions of lawlessness and anarchy that had accompanied the Muslim conquest reasserted themselves soon after the dissolution of the great Empire. The efforts of the discomfited members of the royal family to repel the invaders and to re-establish stable conditions in the south were defeated by the treachery and the imbecility of their own subordinate chieftains. The attitude of the Hindus in other parts of the country was no less suicidal. They actively assisted the Deccan Sultanates in overrunning the south and in despoiling it of its great riches. The valiant efforts of Sriranga Raya to stop Muslim expansion were rendered abortive, not only on account of the inadequacy of the means at his disposal, but also because of the disruptive activities of his own nobles and their intrigues with the enemy. The fallen condition of the Hindus in general is best illustrated by the fact that the rich temple of Narasimha at Ahobalam was plundered in 1579 by a chieftain from Maharashtra in the service of Golkonda, who rendered further disservice to his country and religion by ravaging the territories of his conquest.",

    "text": "Thus, South India became a happy hunting-ground for the Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda, whose pomp and splendour were derived in no small measure from the riches taken from an industrious but disunited people. Watered by large and perennial rivers, the lands of the Tamilnad, miscalled Kamatak or Carnatic by certain early historians, were fertile and yielded abundant crops. Frugal, hard-working and enterprising, the inhabitants of the south produced abounding wealth which they liberally gave away to enrich their numerous temples. But none of these estimable qualities conduced to the promotion of their peace and happiness since they, like the rest of their countrymen, were totally destitute of the ability to defend their prosperity. The southern peninsula had degenerated into a congeries of petty principalities, governed by ambitious Poliagars and Naiks, many of whom were the descendants of the feudatories of the dismembered Vijayanagar Empire. All of them shared the passion of seeking to destroy one another in the name of bringing the south under a single sovereignty. The beneficiaries of such intestinal quarrels were the Muslims, who, by taking and changing sides with the warring chiefs, eventually succeeded in planting their own hegemony in the region. As a Jesuit missionary wrote from Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) in 1659: “The old kings of this country appear by their jealousies and imprudent action to invite the conquest of entire India by the Muslims.\" The Muslim Governors that held sway over the south under the overlordship of the kings of Bijapur and Golkonda were no less self-seeking and disunited. Their personal ambitions grew in proportion to the weakening of the central authority, which gave rise to chronic feuds amongst themselves. It was only the docility and the fatalistic resignation of the Hindu multitudes that had made the continuance of the Muslim rule possible. The vaulting ambitions of Sher Khan Lodi, the Afghan Governor of the Bijapur Government, who held charge of large regions in the south, with Valigandapuram as his capital, furnish a glaring example of how self-aggrandizement had become a notable feature of the political life of South India at the time of Shivaji’s invasion.",

    "text": "Taking the military assistance of the French at Pondicherry, he waged a relentless war against Nasir Muhammad, another Bijapur Governor, whose jurisdiction extended upto the French settlement, with Jinji as the seat of his government. The political goal of Sher Khan is best described in Sarkar’s words: “Sher Khan was bent on annexing the territory of Jinji with the armed help of the French traders of Pondicherry. Nor was this the limit of his dream. He would, after thus removing his only rival in these parts and doubling his strength, hire more French soldiers, despoil the Hindu Nayaks beyond the Kaveri of their fabulous riches, and employ these resources in conquering the kingdom of Golkonda for himself!” The States of Bijapur and Golkonda had advanced far on their journey towards extinction and were, therefore, utterly incapable of reducing their recalcitrant subordinates in the south to submission and obedience. The time was thus most propitious for the Hindu chiefs to unite and overthrow the feeble government of the Muslims in the south, but their own petty quarrels and ambitions prevented them from adopting any such patriotic course of action. However disunited amongst themselves, the Muslim rulers continued to play with impunity the role of a pike in a pond of small fish. The rivalries between the Naiks of Madura and Tanjore were bitter and irreconcilable. Vyankoji or Ekoji Bhosle, the step-brother of Shivaji, who had secured a firm foothold in the south by inheriting the jagirs of his father in Mysore and elsewhere, took full advantage of the antagonism between the two Naiks and eventually succeeded in winning the gadi of Tanjore for himself in January 1676. Two months later, in March, he crowned himself and began to govern his territories in a state of semi-independent regality. Though of a vacillating disposition, Ekoji, as we shall see presently, was a competent man. Being a product of the times in which he lived, he was, however, not gifted with the vision or the patriotism of his illustrious brother. The enforced idleness of Shivaji during the earlier months of 1676, occasioned by his prolonged illness, gave him ample time to reflect on the state of the country.",

    "text": "The plan was for Shivaji to lead a military expedition south, establish a stable government, and eliminate warring rulers and their small principalities. Golkonda's resources and cooperation were key to this plan.  Conceding nominal sovereignty to the Shah over recovered territories originally belonging to his state was considered acceptable as long as Shivaji and his officers retained actual power. Similar plans for Maratha continental sovereignty were discussed in the following century, but they never materialized.  Madanpant, a highly trusted minister of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah of Golkonda, supported the plan. Abul Hasan, wary of the imperialists' intentions to annex his realm, saw an alliance with the increasingly powerful Marathas as a strategic necessity.  He also likely relished the prospect of expanding his dominion using Maratha military strength. He invited Shivaji to Hyderabad to discuss the expedition's details. Shivaji, who had been preparing for a southern campaign, readily accepted. To secure his rear, he dispatched a force against Kopbaldurg, held by Bijapur's Afghan captains. The Marathas, led by Hambirrao Mohite and Dhanaji Jadhav, decisively defeated the Afghans, then joined Shivaji's main army at Hyderabad.  Shivaji departed Raigad in late January 1677 with a substantial army of 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. He carefully arranged for the governance of his realm during his anticipated long absence.  Aurangzeb, preoccupied with the Northwest Frontier, posed no immediate threat. Bahadur Khan, his deputy in the Deccan, was weary of fighting the Marathas and was easily placated with flattery and bribes. Bijapur, on the verge of collapse, was also not a concern. Golkonda, eager for the alliance, was committed to the expedition. Moro Trimbak Pingle and Annaji Datto were entrusted with administering Shivaji's territories during his absence.  The Maratha army maintained exemplary discipline during its march to Hyderabad, where a grand welcome awaited them.  Shivaji, despite his preference for simplicity, allowed his troops a splendid display.",

Shivaji reciprocated with generosity, distributing gold and silver.  King Abul Hasan received Shivaji cordially in his palace. Their discussions, facilitated by Madanpant, led to a formal alliance. Golkonda agreed to pay the Marathas 4.5 lakh rupees monthly for the expedition and provide 5,000 troops and artillery. In return, Shivaji would cede conquered southern territories not originally belonging to his father, Shahaji, to Golkonda.  The treaty also strengthened their defensive alliance against the Mughals, with the Sultan agreeing to an annual tribute of one lakh hons to Shivaji and a permanent Maratha ambassador at his court.

His focus shifted to securing key southern strongholds, including Jinji (Gingee or Chenjee) in South Arcot. Jinji, described as the strongest fortress in the Carnatic, consisted of three hills enclosed by walls and multiple fortifications. Recognizing its strategic value, Shivaji dispatched a contingent to capture it.  Nasir Muhammad Khan, the Bijapur general commanding Jinji, facing the superior Maratha force and the crumbling Bijapur administration, opted for a peaceful surrender in exchange for a cash payment and a jagir.  Shivaji inspected Jinji, strengthening its fortifications and establishing it as his southern administrative center. He built new offices and quarters, appointing Rayaji Nalge as commander and Vithal Pildev Atre as revenue administrator.  Shivaji's foresight in establishing a second capital at Jinji proved crucial after his death.

    "section": "The Conquest of Vellore and the Encounter with Sher Khan Lodi",
    "text": "The acquisition of Jinji by the Marathas set the stage for the conquest of Vellore, another strong fortress, situated eighty-four miles from Madras. It was held by an Abyssinian officer called Abdulla Khan who refused to surrender it. It was a powerfully-built fortress and among the strongest in the south. The fort is situated three-quarters of a mile from the foot of a high range of bare, rough and rocky hills and is equipped with high and broad ramparts. It abounds in bastions and towers and is separated by a broad and deep moat which was infested with alligators. Shivaji was not adequately equipped to capture such an impregnable stronghold within a short period. He detailed Narhari Rudra to continue the siege and proceeded against Sher Khan Lodi, the only Muslim governor of note that had openly disputed his career of conquest in the south. Vellore held on for many months and did not surrender to the Marathas till the third week of August 1678, by which time Shivaji had returned to Maharashtra. Sher Khan’s enthusiasm for confronting Shivaji outstripped his prudence. He encamped at Tiruvadi, determined to give battle to the Marathas. Shivaji appeared with six thousand cavalry.  The rest of the story is narrated from the chronicle of Francis Martin, the Governor of the French Settlement of Pondicherry: “Chircam (Sher Khan) advanced against his enemies; it is not known whether he still had the foolishness…to believe that his enemies would disappear when he approached them…This intrepidity did not…last long. Sivagy’s (Shivaji’s) army did not swerve…Chircam recognized…that he had taken a false step;…he decided to make a retreat…Sivagy…made his troops march; the retreat was precipitate and…a kind of flight…Chircam fled with his son and…officers.” The victorious Marathas pushed forward, forcing Sher Khan to sue for peace. He ceded the entire territory held by him, paid a large ransom, and left his son as a hostage. The Naik of Madura secured immunity from invasion by paying six lakh hons. The way was now clear for Shivaji to attempt a negotiated settlement with his step-brother, Ekoji.",

    "text": "Shivaji and Ekoji were different. They had the same father, but different mothers. Shivaji was blessed with his mother, Jijabai, a lady with vision and patriotism. She made sacrifices and ran risks to train Shivaji for his mission. On many critical occasions, she played a decisive part in influencing his decisions. Shivaji had the additional advantage of a careful and disciplined upbringing. Ekoji’s career and outlook were not similarly moulded. He was perhaps taught to believe that the status quo was the best. Like many other Maratha sardars, the service of the Sultans and a successful personal career became the focus of his life. Ekoji was brave and capable and employed these assets in the service of his masters. He was, therefore, unable to appreciate the significance of his brother’s undertaking and gave repeated proofs of such insensibility by siding with Bijapur against Shivaji. The estrangement between the brothers was fundamental. It would have been futile for Shivaji to rely on appeals to reason and sentiment to convert Ekoji. The cause of independence would have been stronger if Ekoji had united his resources with Shivaji’s, but since no such lofty sentiment animated him, Shivaji demanded his share of the patrimony. Ekoji had long enjoyed the revenues of their father’s jagirs without sharing them with Shivaji. This is essential to understand Ekoji’s intransigence and his failure to appreciate Shivaji’s stand.",

    "text": "After much persuasion, Ekoji agreed to meet Shivaji. They met at Tirumalavadi and spent some days entertaining each other before addressing their mutual relations. Ekoji’s attitude was unhelpful. Francois Martin writes: “The first conversation gave evidence of amity and tenderness; then it came to negotiation when Ecugy (Ekoji) discovered that his brother would not let him go unless he had satisfied him about his claims…he sought some means of withdrawing…he had a cattamaron (catamaran) kept ready…he…threw himself into the cattamaron and crossed…to his country.” Shivaji was furious over Ekoji’s departure, as it gave a false impression of duress. Shivaji ordered the detention of Ekoji’s counsellors but later sent them back with gifts. Shivaji was offended by Ekoji’s refusal to give up his service under Bijapur. He wrote a spirited letter appealing to his brother to abandon his suicidal course and offered him a jagir. It is to the credit of Dipabai, Ekoji’s wife, that the rupture was eventually healed. She persuaded her husband to be guided by Raghunathpant. Shivaji was happy at the change and wrote to Raghunathpant eulogizing Dipabai’s wisdom. He stipulated that revenues from Bangalore, Hoskote, and Shiralkot be settled on her. The agreement makes it clear that Shivaji’s dispute with his brother was not so much over property as over Ekoji’s adhesion to Bijapur. Article sixteen of the compact states: “We have conquered Tanjore…worth about seven lakh hons. We hand them back to him.” Other provisions dealt with political issues. Article six bound Ekoji to ensure that no enemy of the Hindu religion was entertained in his state. Article twelve recalled the 1662 treaty forbidding service in Bijapur. Ekoji’s acceptance was not wholehearted. He drifted into despondency. Shivaji’s exhortations to return to active life fell on deaf ears. His last appeal was written in January 1680, before his death.",

On his way back, he worshipped at shrines, while his armies made new conquests, including Ami, Kolar, Hoskote, Bangalore, and other places in Mysore State. He marched across Bellary and Dharwar and reached Panhala in April 1678. Shivaji’s conquests in the south have been variously estimated. According to Sabhasad, quoted by Sarkar, the new territorial gains yielded an annual revenue of twenty lakh hons. The conquered region contained 100 forts. A European wrote from Madras in August 1678: “Shivaji…has…possession of all these countries about…Jinji and Vellore…worth…550 thousand pounds sterling…in which he has…men and horse, 72 strong hills and 14 forts…60 leagues long and 40 broad.” The wealth taken away to equip his armies was considerable. Many men were imported from Maharashtra to administer the new charge. The Kamatak plains were placed under Santaji Bhosle, with Jinji as his headquarters. He was assisted by Raghunathpant Hanumante. Hambirrao Mohite was entrusted with defending the acquisitions. Rango Narayan was appointed to govern the Mysore tableland under the Viceroy of Jinji. Many accounts have been left about Shivaji’s expedition. The south, with its ancient shrines, gave him opportunities to express his devotional fervour. The wealth collected stood the Maratha State in good stead.",

It was Shivaji’s distinctive trait to cultivate and to win the esteem and confidence of the people visited by him rather than incur their rancor and antagonism. Abbe Carre rightly remarks: ‘To the quickness of movement, he added, like Julius Caesar, a clemency and bounty that won him the hearts of those his arms had worsted.” His simplicity was equally remarkable, thus offering one more proof that his expeditions for raising money were intended essentially to advance the common cause and not to promote his own interests or to gratify his vanity. A Western observer wrote from the south thus: “The camp of Shivaji was without pomp and without women; there was no baggage and there were only two tents made of cloth, coarse and very scanty, one for himself and another for his prime minister.” It is an unfortunate accident of history that Shivaji did not live long enough to be able to make enduring administrative and military dispositions in his new dominion. The regime set up by him required long years of effective control and guidance by a central authority enjoying commanding influence and prestige. Such unique direction could be supplied only by Shivaji, but he lived for only two more years after his southern invasion. What course history would have taken if he had been spared a decade longer, certainly presents an interesting theme for speculation, but guesses, however rewarding to one’s powers of imagination, are singularly futile.",

    "text": "Shivaji’s dealings with the European traders in India were marked by caution and kindliness and at the same time by a determination not to allow them to encroach upon his rights. It was impossible for him or for any of his contemporaries to foresee that one of the nations of these trading communities was destined to impose its sway eventually over the length and breadth of the country. In his time, the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and the French were all content to pursue their commercial interests undistracted by territorial ambitions. They fought amongst themselves bitterly to seize the monopoly of the abounding trade and, being largely preoccupied with considerations of profits and dividends, their activities, mostly confined to their coastal settlements, aroused neither jealousy nor fear. The days of Warren Hastings, the first outstanding British statesman in India, and of men like him whose nobility and vision elevated them far above the passions, the greed and the cruelties of the time, were still far off. Nevertheless, Shivaji, with his natural inquisitiveness and his desire to gain a wider understanding of the world around him, missed no opportunity to study the calibre and the outlook of the fair-skinned foreigners. He admired their spirit of adventure, took note of the advance made by their nations in the weapons and modes of warfare, and appreciated the tenacity of purpose that generally governed their activities. His long and animated conversation with Manucci, the Italian artillery officer in Raja Jai Singh’s army, in 1665, on a wide variety of subjects, testifies to a mind that was at once alert and awake. The coming of the Europeans to India was an event of great international significance. It not only broke the isolation of the East, but also paved the way for a closer integration of the world. Much of the credit for this historic achievement belongs to Portugal whose atrocious behaviour and misdeeds during the period of her decline and in our own time do not provide a true measure of her contribution in the past to the promotion of a better understanding of the vastness, the variety and the splendour of the world. The Portuguese sailors were men of great intrepidity, who roamed the high seas in their swift caravels, braving the perils of the uncharted oceans. The fifteenth century, in particular, was a period of unceasing activity for Portugal whose discovery of the sea route to India gave her access to the fabulous wealth of the East in addition to the unexploited riches of Brazil in the new world. In fact, Portugal held the so-called “gorgeous East” in fee for a century, claiming proprietary rights over that vast region. But this small country, with its severely limited man-power resources and its unbridled religious bigotry, could not long retain its far-flung empire. The Dutch waged a relentless war against the Portuguese and, with the aid of their superior organization and seamanship, dislodged them from most of their possessions in the East. The Dutch had, however, no heart in India. The Archipelago was the pride of their possessions and was in fact their main economic, strategic and administrative centre in the East. The stage was thus set for the English to secure a firm foothold in this country, although singly they were no match either for the Portuguese or the Dutch. The French, whose chances of founding an empire in India were as good as those of their traditional rivals, missed the great opportunity on account of the imbecility of their Government. By such a fortunate process of elimination the English eventually succeeded in establishing their hegemony in this country, although nothing was more remote from their thoughts than the idea of empire in the days of Shivaji.",

    "text": "Shivaji’s normally good relations with the English were exacerbated by three episodes which will be explained presently. He was one of the few Indians who realized the value of naval power to defend the integrity of the country and to promote its material prosperity. The Moghuls were singularly deficient in such a statesmanlike vision. They owned no gunboats to protect the long coastline, but specialized in erecting gibbets and guillotines instead to destroy their opponents inside the country! For such folly they paid heavily by forfeiting their sovereignty over the Indian waters and depending helplessly on the forbearance of the European trading companies in India for the unmolested movement of their vessels. Even the great Akbar tacitly acknowledged Portuguese paramountcy over the Indian coast by “taking out licenses for ships sent by him to the Red Sea, and the Moghuls made no attempt either to free or to command the waters”. Even after the decline of their power the Portuguese refused to give up their pretensions to be recognized as masters of the Indian seas. Such an arrogation of sovereign rights by a distant country over the home waters of India was an intolerable affront to her dignity and pride. Shivaji was determined not to permit it. He had neither the resources nor the time for building up a mighty armada and employing it against the foreign intruders in order to win pre-eminence for India as a naval power. But to secure the freedom of the seas along the country’s western coast-line was well within his scope and he strove towards this goal with all his might and resources till the end of his life. It was evident to him that neither the security of his realm nor its progress and prosperity could be ensured unless he built up a navy of his own. The west coast, dotted with a number of large and wealthy towns, was extremely prosperous and transacted an enormous volume of import and export business. The island of Bombay was still a little-known and unhealthy place, although the wise policy of the English and the excellence of the harbour had begun to attract to it entrepreneurs and others in steadily increasing numbers, thus guaranteeing its eventual growth as the foremost commercial centre of India. The imprudence and the bigotry of the Portuguese virtually barred the progress of Goa as an important commercial and industrial city and whatever pre-eminence it had acquired in the past centuries disappeared with the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire. Port towns like Dabhol, Rajapur, Karwar, Bhatkal and Vengurla, lying between Bombay and Cochin, acquired considerable importance and affluence by exporting a wide variety of goods of which spices and textiles were most conspicuous. The pepper of Sonda was highly-prized and its excellence was described in rapturous terms by calling it “the best and the dearest in the world”. The local Raja’s “pepper-country” yielded an enormous revenue, his annual collections being estimated at thirty lakh pagodas. Karwar became a leading exporting centre for the celebrated muslin and other fabrics, and the English factory in the town alone transacted a prodigious volume of business in this commodity by engaging inland an army of weavers to maintain a steady flow of exports. “The chief merit of Karwar,” says the authority just quoted, “is its spacious harbour, the only first-rate harbour on the west coast between Bombay and Colombo. It offers every convenience for shipping at all times of the year.” The capture of Kalyan and Bhiwandi by Shivaji in 1657 gave him a firm foothold in the Konkan. Thenceforward, he started ship-building in the well-sheltered creeks in the region and increased the tempo of his naval activities as he acquired greater control over the coastline. His ships were as good as any that could be built in India in those times and certainly compared well with those of Portugal. His crew consisted of men with long seafearing traditions, inhabiting the coastal districts, and his choice—a fact of supreme importance—was inhibited by no considerations of caste or religion. The Muslims of the Konkan, known for their courage and skill on the seas, formed a considerable element in Shivaji’s navy, one of his Commanders-in-Chief being an adherent of Islam. Shivaji also built a chain of strongholds on a wide stretch of the west coast to serve as convenient bases for his navy. The construction of the first fort of this kind, Vijayadurg, described as the “most perfect example of a great coastal fortress”, was begun in 1653, some four years before he had gained possession of the Konkan town of Kalyan. The second large fort was Suvamdurg which was completed in 1660. Sindhudurg off Malvan was the most formidable of Shivaji’s strongholds on the sea coast, on which he spent enormous labour and sums of money, a part of which was derived from the wealth secured from Surat. So great was the importance attached to this fortress that Shivaji is stated to have laboured with his own hands to strengthen its defences. The work of fortification was begun with solemn rites on November 25, 1664. The last important naval post to be constructed during his reign was Kolaba which was completed on the eve of his death in 1680. Shivaji’s policy in the Konkan was clear and well-defined. He was determined to secure his unchallenged supremacy over it by defeating and expelling the agents of Bijapur and of the Moghuls from the region. He desired that the coastal trade should prosper and entertained no thought of excluding any of the European traders from participating in it so long as they did not seek to thrust their oars into the country’s troubled political waters. He resolutely fought piracy on the seas and lawlessness on the coast and played no small part in establishing stable conditions in the districts. The Gazetteer of Kolaba and Janjira says: “Besides, by enriching it with the spoils of Gujarat, the Deccan and the Karnatak, Shivaji did much to improve the Konkan by giving highly paid employment in his army and in building and guarding his hill forts. He also introduced a more uniform and lighter land tax, suppressed irregular exactions, and fostered trade.”",

It will be recalled that after the destruction of his foe, Afzal Khan, in November 1659, Shivaji won a resounding victory over the Bijapur army and captured the strong fortress of Panhala in the last week of the same month. Before the enemy could recover from the blow he suddenly appeared in Ratnagiri district in the Konkan and conquered a number of important inland towns and ports. Dabhol fell and Rajapur would have followed suit, but Shivaji stayed his hand in order to oblige the Bijapur Governor, Rustam-i-Zaman, who was favourably disposed towards him. An unfair advantage was taken of this leniency by the defeated Governor of Dabhol, Muhammad Sharif, who, responding to the importunities of Afzal Khan’s son, despatched the latter’s three loaded junks to Rajapur for safe custody. The Marathas, who were at war with Bijapur, demanded the surrender of the three vessels which had been taken over by the English factors at the port. The chief factor, who falsely claimed that the junks belonged to his Company, fled from Rajapur and sought asylum of the sea when he discovered that his deceitful conduct would be severely punished by the Marathas.

He was, however, released later. Evidently, such a mild retribution made no salutary impression on the English. In 1660 they once again flagrantly violated the principles of neutrality by co-operating with the Bijapur Darbar in its attempts to reduce the fort of Panhala. In May of that year the fort, in which Shivaji had taken refuge, was closely invested by Siddi Jauhar, and the Maratha chief would in all probability have fallen a prisoner into the hands of the enemy, had he not risen to the occasion and made his escape from the stronghold. It was on this occasion, when he was exposed to grave danger, that the English factors from Rajapur not only supplied arms and ammunition to the Bijapur Government but actually participated in the campaign by opening destructive fire on the fort and by hurling grenades at the beleaguered garrison. These acts of aggression were committed openly, with the English Company’s flag flying during the operations. Shivaji considered it misplaced generosity if he condoned or treated lightly the second deliberate act of unfriendliness on the part of the foreigners. The reprisals in the circumstances could only be severe. On March 3, 1661, he suddenly appeared before Rajapur, causing mortal terror to the guilty factors. He thoroughly pillaged their warehouses and, in addition, took a few Englishmen into custody and sent them to a distant part of his realm for detention. They prayed and petitioned and fell upon their knees before him to be set free, but he was adamant. He, however, promised to release them if they paid a large indemnity—an appropriate punishment to the coin-spinning fraternity! The captives hummed and hawed and wrote copiously to their principals at Surat pleading, sometimes angrily but often piteously, for their good offices in securing their early deliverance. Unfortunately for them, the reply from Surat (March 10, 1662) was devastating. “How you came in prison,” wrote the President with remorseless finality, “you know very well. It was not for defending the Company’s goods; it was for going to the siege of Panhala and tossing balls with a flag that was known to be the English’s. None but what is rehearsed is the cause of your imprisonment.” Shivaji, however, relented and set them free in due course on his own initiative.",

    "text": "Shivaji’s armed incursions into the Konkan and the Karwar districts were frequent. They were prompted by the consideration to establish Maratha supremacy in the region on firm foundations and to teach useful lessons to the local chiefs that attempted to defy him at the instigation of Bijapur. At one time or another, the Naiks of Bednur and the Rajas of Sonda, among others, felt the weight of Maratha arms. Besides, it was necessary for Shivaji to supplement his revenues with the riches that could be collected from the Konkan and Karwar ports. But his levies were not ruinous since, as we saw earlier, his basic aim was to promote the prosperity of those districts. For instance, during his raid on Vengurla in May 1663, he liberally distributed documents among the civilian population guaranteeing immunity from harm. In the following year, 1664, he, however, carried away “vast riches” from that place, and in December the flourishing town of Hubli was thoroughly sacked, besides several other rich towns in the neighbourhood. Karwar escaped lightly in 1665. After making a raid by sea on Barkalur in South Canara, he dismissed the greater part of his fleet at Gokarn, where he had earlier worshipped at the famous shrine of Mahabaleshwar, scoured the region, and levied a contribution from Karwar. The English factors in the town paid him £712 as their share. It was not till ten years later that a major effort was made to capture the great fort of Phonda and to annex the Kanara coast. In that year Shivaji descended upon these districts with an army of 15,000 cavalry, 14,000 infantry and 10,000 pioneers. He detached a large body of forces to besiege Phonda which, in spite of its strong defences and the help secretly rendered to the garrison by the Portuguese, fell in May 1675. The treacherous behaviour of the foreigners was attributed to their extreme terror at the proximity of the formidable Shivaji to their chief town, Goa. Karwar also surrendered so that by May 25 “the country as far south as the Gangavali river had passed out of Bijapuri possession into his hands”.",

    "text": "It was, however, impossible for Shivaji to establish settled conditions in the Konkan unless he overcame the lawless activities of the Siddis of Janjira. Janjira is a rocky island, forty-five miles south of Bombay, whose rulers, the Siddis, constituted the most disturbing element on the west coast. The town of Rajpuri and the fort of Danda, situated in its vicinity and both regarded as one place, were of considerable strategic importance. Guarding the mouth of the Rajpuri creek and standing on the mainland, the place became a perpetual bone of contention between the Marathas and the Siddis in the same manner as the Doab of Raichur, now in Mysore State, had provoked prolonged and implacable wars between the kings of Vijayanagar and the Sultans of Bijapur. The forbears of the Siddis had established a colony of fellow-Abyssinians at Janjira as far back as the fifteenth century. Since that period they held sway over the local population whom they oppressed in order to sustain their aggression. Waring describes the Siddis as brave, active and staunch Muslims, “hostile by religion and by interest to the rise of a Hindu Power”. The smallness of their dominion and its barrenness compelled the rulers of Janjira to seek a permanent possession of Danda-Rajpuri from where they could launch their plundering expeditions in Kolaba and Ratnagiri districts in order to fertilize their sterile economy. Since it was impossible for them to challenge with impunity a well-entrenched government in the region, they sold their services and loyalties to whichever Muslim power that was strong for the time being, readily changing sides if the exigencies of the situation so demanded. They realized the dangerous implications of the rise of the Marathas as a naval power to their own continued existence. Shivaji, whose acumen and wide-ranging vision missed nothing, saw that by capturing Danda-Rajpuri it would be possible to stop the heart-beats of Janjira. The struggle between the Marathas and the Siddis of Janjira was long-drawn-out and bloody. Fath Khan, the Siddi chief, was a brave, resourceful and indomitable fighter. He knew that the military strength of the Marathas was infinitely superior to his own and dexterously overcame his deficiency by taking full advantage of Shivaji’s distractions and misfortunes. He was no less agile in retreating to his island fortress when he realized that only thus could he save himself from the terrible vengeance of the Marathas. There is much aptness in the observation of a chronicler that the Siddis were like mice in a house!",

    "text": "In 1659, when Afzal Khan proceeded against Shivaji, armed with a mandate from the Bijapur Government to destroy the nascent Maratha kingdom, Fath Khan fell upon the mainland in an attempt to benefit from his adversary’s preoccupation, but when Afzal Khan met his doom at the foot of Pratapgad, the Siddi beat a precipitate retreat to Janjira to escape Maratha reprisals. He adopted this strategy on many other occasions. In 1661 Shivaji concentrated his efforts and resources on the capture of Danda-Rajpuri, and the onset of the monsoon in all its fury did not relax his determination to conquer the town. His pertinacity bore fruit, and the much-prized place at last fell into Maratha hands. It remained in their possession for nine years, during which period Shivaji made repeated attempts from his vantage position to force Janjira’s surrender. Year after year, his artillery was directed against the island, but since his guns were weak, both in their range and firing power, no great damage was done to the stronghold. Shivaji organized his conquests in Kolaba district into a new province, rebuilt the defences of Danda-Rajpuri, constructed a chain of forts to strengthen his hold on the region, and placed the charge under a competent officer, Vyankoji Datto, with a permanent contingent of 5,000 to 7,000 men to protect it. These dispositions distressed and alarmed the Siddi who was now forced to launch his depredations further south, in Ratnagiri district. In 1669 Shivaji renewed his attack on Janjira with far greater vigour and, although he could not actually capture the island, he succeeded in reducing Fath Khan to extreme despair. Realizing the futility of waging a losing war against the Marathas, the Siddi agreed to surrender Janjira in consideration for a rich jagir and a large cash present. His decision to end the hostilities was, however, resented by three resolute men, Siddis Sambal, Kasim and Khairiyat, the last two being brothers. They imprisoned Fath Khan and applied to Aurangzeb to be taken under his protective wing, at the same time continuing the war against the Marathas. The Emperor was delighted and readily invested Siddi Sambal with the office of admiral of the Imperial Navy, besides conferring on him the title of Yakut Khan. To sustain his newly-acquired eminence, he received as his share three lakhs of rupees from the annual revenue of Surat. Kasim and his brother were similarly raised to dignity, with directions to remain in command of Janjira and the town of Danda-Rajpuri, although the latter was in Maratha hands. Siddi Kasim, who had never accepted the loss of the town as a fait accompli, patiently bided his time, with the object of wresting it from the Marathas.",

    "text": "Such an opportunity came to him during the holi holidays in 1671 when the Maratha garrison at Danda-Rajpuri, relaxing their vigilance, gave themselves up to revelry. The two Siddi brothers made a surprise attack on both the town and the fort and mercilessly cut down the defenders. To add to the misfortune of the garrison, a powder-magazine blew up, flooding the landscape with dense smoke and lurid light. Shivaji, who was then at Raigad, was awakened from his sleep by the loud report of the explosion and is stated to have exclaimed: “Something has gone wrong at Danda-Rajpuri”. The victorious Siddis refused to unsheath their sword even after their great victory. “Kasim’s revolting acts of cruelty,” says the District Gazetteer of Kolaba and Janjira, “to men and women deepened the animosity between the Marathas and the Siddis.” The loss of Danda-Rajpuri was a bitter disappointment to Shivaji who was never able to retrieve it, although he counted no cost in his attempts to regain its possession. He reluctantly cast about for an alternative naval base from where he could effectively curb the Siddi’s piratical activities. Khanderi or Kenery was the obvious choice. It is a small island near the entrance to the Bombay harbour, eleven miles south of Bombay and six miles north-west of Alibag. It is situated two and a half miles from the Kolaba mainland one and a half miles from another small island called Underi or Henery. For no valid reason, the English in Bombay objected to the fortification of the island by the Marathas. Khanderi had never before been inhabited and its only produce was fuel. The construction of breast-works and other defences in the place was begun by the Marathas in August 1679; the English had gained possession of the island of Bombay more than one and a half decades earlier. Had they discovered that they could not live in peace and security in Bombay without gaining possession of Khanderi, they ought to have instituted appropriate proceedings in that direction much earlier and not attempted to thwart Shivaji’s plans after they had been completed. Besides, Khanderi was well within his jurisdiction. On September 19, 1679, an attempt was made by the English to force a landing on the Khanderi island, but they gave it up after suffering serious reverses at the hands of the Marathas. Renewed efforts in that direction only ended in worse defeats, compelling the discomfited foreigners to admit ruefully that they were not strong enough to dislodge Shivaji from his new acquisition. They came to this conclusion after realizing the ineffectiveness of their naval operations even with the whole-hearted support of the Siddis of Janjira. Not to be outdone by the Marathas, Siddi Kasim promptly fortified Underi in January 1680 despite, this time, the combined protests of Shivaji and the English.",

    "text": "both in Bombay and Surat, was their great capacity for prevarication. It would be impossible to explain their various acts of inconsistency if they could not be traced to the inherent instability of their position both on land and at sea. Writing in January 1677 about the helpless condition of his Company in Bombay, an official lamented that the Portuguese were “ever exquisite seekers of all ways imaginable to do us mischief”. During the years 1676-1680, we are told, the chief foreign sources of trouble at Bombay were the Portuguese, “the haughty neighbours”, the “Malabars” or the pirates from the Malabar coast, and the Siddis of Janjira. The Siddis in fact showed scant respect for the sovereignty of the English in Bombay and entered and left the harbour at will, using the amenities provided by it with complete freedom as if the island was their own. The English naturally resented such aggressive proceedings, but protest was dangerous. Writing to the Bombay factor on April 14, 1676, the President of Surat observed: “We are sorry the Siddi’s fleet is come again to trouble your port. If he talks of staying at Bombay or at Mazgaon, you must tell him that it shall never be permitted”. The President, however, suddenly became panicky at his own boldness and hastily added in the same letter an admonition to his colleague that he should be very civil in his “discourses and arguments” with the Siddi. Besides, he should not fail to supply the intruder and his men “what they may want—wood, water and provisions”. We read a number of similar letters; here is an extract from President Aungier’s extraordinary letter dated May 7, 1677: “Now we understand that Siddi Sambal resides at the East India House where like the hedge-hog he hath nestled himself and, liking his lodging, intends to stay there whether we will or no.” Such was the position of the English during this period and the brave words that have been handed down to us about their EUROPEANS IN INDIA 175 prowess did not, as we have seen, have their counterpart in deeds. We may conclude this chapter by recalling the observations of a few contemporary Europeans in India on the character and achievements of Shivaji. Some of them were his ardent admirers, while others were not, but all were agreed that he was an Olympian figure. In his History of Shivaji Abbe Carre says that the Maratha King encouraged Europeans as a deliberate policy of his government in order to promote the commerce of his realm. His ports were hospitable to their ships. “I passed,” says this foreigner, “that way in 1668 with two ships of the Company and we were treated in a manner which was beyond our expectation.” The same authority points out that Shivaji was equally popular with “tradesmen and toiling merchants’' whose praise he won by “his method of governing and making men's minds yield to it”. We are further told that, although he possessed outstanding military abilities, he did not always draw the sword because he knew “more than one way of reaching his goal”. He was in fact one who could rightly be placed among the greatest men in the world.",

    "text": "Shivaji’s dominion was not large, but it was administered with great efficiency, imagination and benevolence. In the troubled conditions of his times, with the Moghuls constantly knocking at his door, the boundaries of his realm could not be firmly or finally fixed, but, according to Ramchandra Nilkanth, his Accountant General for ten years, the area of swarajya or the kingdom outside Muslim jurisdiction, extended from Salher and Ahiwant in West Khandesh in the modern State of Maharashtra to Tanjore deep in the south. Sarkar gives a more precise version of the extent of Shivaji’s kingdom at the time of his death. It included all the country (except the Portuguese possessions) stretching from Ramnagar in Gujarat in the north, to Karwar or the Gangavali river in the Mysore district of Kanara in the south. The eastern boundary covered Baglana in the north and, running southwards along a fluctuating line through Nasik and Poona districts, embraced the entire Satara district, besides large portions of the Kolhapur region. A third territory comprised western Kamatak, extending from Belgaum and reaching the banks of the Tungabhadra in the present administrative district of Bellary in Mysore State. In addition, his conquests in the south covered a considerable area yielding, according to Sabhasad, an annual revenue of twenty lakh horn, but his premature death and the descent of Emperor Aurangzeb on the Deccan in person in less than two years after this tragic event, gave no opportunity to the Maratha Government to consolidate Shivaji’s gains in the south. It is difficult to assess the actual revenues that were derived by the new state, but they are estimated to have amounted to seven crores of rupees annually, although the actual realizations in some years were likely to have been less. For the convenience of administration and taxation the kingdom was divided into provinces and placed in charge of able and experienced governors. To draw again upon Sarkar’s study, the northern province consisted of the Dangs and Baglana, the Koli country south of Surat, the Konkan north of Bombay, and the Deccan plateau south of Poona. This vital region was placed in charge of Moro Trimbak Pingle. The Konkan region south of Bombay, Savantwadi and the coastal territory of north Kanara, formed the southern satraphy and was administered by Annaji Datto, another sagacious lieutenant of Shivaji. The third division consisted of the districts of Satara and Kolhapur, besides the large and fertile territory extending from Belgaum to the banks of the river Tungabhadra, including Dharwar district. The government of this province was entrusted to Dattajipant Kaknis. The unsettled southern province of Tanjore was placed in charge of the king’s son-in-law, Harji Mahadik. The far-flung realm of Shivaji was effectively guarded by 240 forts of which as many as 111 were built in his lifetime.",

    "text": "Seventynine of the strongholds under his jurisdiction were situated in the southern province of Madras, Shivaji looked upon his forts almost with reverence and propagated their value among his followers by elevating them to the status of a mother. His respect and affection for them were indeed well founded since his historic career was heralded by the capture of the fort of Toma in 1647. Sheltered by the massive Sahyadri mountains, a considerable length of whose ranges was ideally suited for the construction of defensive fortresses, Maharashtra offered no easy access to the invaders. An eighteenth century foreign observer says that the government of the Peshwas extended over “a country of great natural strength, interspersed with mountains and defiles, all of which are defended by fortresses that are reserved as depots for treasure, or as retreats in the event of ill success or defeat”. The writer holds that “perhaps no country on earth is better calculated for the purposes of defensive war”. Generation after generation of soldiers and strategists had watched with unseeing eyes the inestimable value of this terrain for unfurling the flag of freedom. It was, however, left to the genius of Shivaji to take full advantage of the natural strength of the country around him and to train his followers THE STATE 179 in a mode of warfare, in which skill, resourcefulness and initiative could be far more effective than mere physical strength or superiority of numbers. The forts held a vital place in these Parthian methods of engaging the enemy. They provided much more than mere shelter from the pressure of the invading armies and served as a dependable shield against total defeat and annihilation. Indeed, during the early years of Maratha uprising the usefulness of the forts was inestimable. The scaling of forts with agility in order to recover them speedily in the event of their falling into enemy hands, became a necessary qualification for the profession of arms in Shivaji’s army. As we shall see in the next chapter, even the most impregnable fortresses were captured by his men with comparative ease, so that the Marathas became justly famous in this mode of warfare. Shivaji was endowed with an uncommonly keen perception in assessing the strategic value of a place. Both the situation and the structure of the new forts built by him amply bear this out. Many of his famous fortresses were built on hilltops, flat and rain-drenched, so that, besides providing the means for the maintenance of a large garrison, they could hurl defiance at the invaders for an almost indefinite length of time. Shivaji was well served by his engineers in making such lofty expanses really impregnable. Moro Trimbak Pingle, his Peshwa, was a man endowed with versatile talents; he was an accomplished soldier, a shrewd diplomatist and a competent administrator. To these inestimable abilities he joined the skill of a military engineer. Soon after the capture of Torna he built in its vicinity the hill-fortress of Rajgad which for long years remained the premier town of Maharashtra till the capital was shifted to Raigad. The same talented man was commissioned to build Pratapgad soon after the annexation of Javli from the Mores. The new capital of Shivaji, Raigad, soon won distinction as the Gibraltar of the East Another observer, also a foreigner, is even more enthusiastic in his appreciation of its strength. He says that Raigad was “the most completely impregnable place in the universe, for the enclosure of it is large enough, 180 SHIVAJX : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT independent of the stores accumulated there, to grow grain sufficient for the maintenance of its garrison, which, were it but a handful of men, could with pleasure defend it against the greatest armies that could be brought to take it”. Every care was taken to ensure that the fortifications fulfilled the most exacting requirements of defence. The skill of the engineer was not always accepted as final. Khafi Khan narrates an interesting story as to how Shivaji tested the strength of the ramparts of his capital. When his engineers announced the completion of their work, he invited his followers to win a gold bracelet by scaling the hill-fort without the aid of a rope. An intrepid Maratha won the reward as well as royal appreciation by accomplishing the feat. The route followed by him was promptly sealed off with appropriate defensive walls. Another resourceful person, this time a woman, exposed a similar weakness in the fortification by scrambling down the precipice in order to reach her home at the foot of the fort after its massive doors had been closed for the night. The exploits of the lady, who was a milk-woman, were duly reported to Shivaji who showed his admiration for her by kindly words and generous presents. The discovered loophole was also duly blocked. The result of such labour and vigilance in ensuring the soundness of the defences was most satisfying. Foreign observers were impressed with the skill and ingenuity of Maratha builders and we have one such testimony, based on an inspection of the fortification of the fort of Jinji in the south. According to one of them, Shivaji “constructed new ramparts round Jinji, dug ditches, raised towers and bastions, and carried out all these works with a perfection of which European skill would not have been ashamed”. The Maratha king devoted the same care and spent enormous sums of money on the construction of his sea-forts. Sindhudurg was the premier stronghold of its kind and deserved the panegy- rist's description that it was like a luminous star in the firma- ment. Three thousand skilled men laboured for three years to raise the stupendous fortress towards the construction of which Shivaji sanctioned as much as one crore of horn. THE STATE 181 It is only to be expected that Shivaji exercised the utmost care in organizing the defence and the management of his forts. Three senior officers, all of proved ability and integrity, were appointed to guard and administer each fort. It was the function of the havaldar or commandant, who was invariably a Maratha of good standing, to provide for the security of the fort, to keep a watchful eye over the duties and responsibilities of his subordinates in the combatant service, and",

    "text": "No laxity in the performance of his duties was permitted and defaulting commandants were severely punished. Shivaji’s visits to his forts were frequent and most often they were unheralded. It is a measure of his stem sense of discipline that he did not either desire or countenance any relaxation of the rules laid down for the administration of the forts even in his own case. It was the duty of the commandant to close the doors of his fort before nightfall each day and not to open them on any account till the prescribed hour of the following morning. The king repeatedly tested his officers by himself appearing before their forts and seeking admission during the prohibited hours. It required more than ordinary courage for a havaldar to refuse admission to his own monarch and in the conflict between his sense of duty and the need for obedience, the latter was some times allowed to prevail. Such unfortunate men were either severely censured or punished. There were, however, some who were made of sterner stuff and one of them was the commandant of the fort of Panhala. A heart-warming anecdote is told about him. One day, Shivaji presented himself before the fort after the gates had been clos-ed, demanding to be let in. The havaldar, who was sent for, politely but resolutely refused, saying that admission into the would be possible only on the following morning. Shivaji pleaded that he could not possibly allow himself to be captured by the enemy who were, he said, hotly in his pursuit. The commandant was, however, unmoved and promised to protect his master by stationing his men on the ramparts so that no enemy troops could come close to the fort wall. At the same time, he lowered a cot and a bedding, requesting the king to retire for the night in the porch outside, with complete confidence in the ability of his servants to protect his life! Shivaji was gratified and showed his appreciation of his subordinate’s steadfast devotion to duty by holding him up as an exemplar, besides rewarding him generously.\n\nPhirangoji Narsala, it will be recalled, was a valiant defender of the fort of Chakan when it was attacked by Shaista Khan’s imperial forces. Appointed to the command of Bhupalgad, he showed less energy and determination in defending it against the Moghuls in 1679. The reasons for his seemingly strange behaviour were, however, not personal. On this occasion, the fort under his command was attacked by no less a person than Sambhaji, who had, to the detriment of his good name, defect-ed to the Moghuls. Narsala refrained from opening fire on the enemy troops, fearing danger to the life of the heir-apparent, and thus made it easy for the invaders to capture the fort. Shivaji could see the dilemma of this seasoned and trusted servant of the state, but did not forgive him for his weakness. The unhappy Narsala was severely reprimanded “for not firing on Sambhaji and putting such a sinner to death”. Such was the Maratha King’s stem sense of duty and rectitude. The second senior officer of a fort was the Sabnis who exercised the power of the purse. This officer was a Brahmin who was charged with the responsibility of regulating the expenditure and keeping a proper account of all financial transactions. He also maintained the muster roll of the garrison. The third officer was the Karkhanis, a Prabhu, who was charged with the responsibility of maintaining adequate reserves of stores of all kinds required by the garrison and of ensuring an equitable supply. His duties were many and varied and often dovetailed into those of his other two colleagues in order to promote co-operation and interdependence among the principal officers of the fort.",

    "text": "Shivaji showed his customary caution and shrewdness in the choice of his men for key positions. Like Hanfeitse, the great Chinese sage who lived many centuries before him, he realized the unwisdom of expecting people to be good and, therefore, concerted measures to “make it impossible for them to be bad”. But the appointment of the Marathas, the Brahmins and the Prabhus to responsible offices was not entirely governed by the doctrine of counterpoise. Perhaps, the more important reason why Shivaji drew so liberally and impartially upon these three major sections of the community was that he wished to create the most spacious opportunities for talent. Indeed, a free career to ability and enterprise never failed to appeal to him. His catholic mind and his wide-ranging vision accepted no artificial or absurd constraints on the choice of his men. The Mahars and Muslims and men of other faiths and social gradations were all welcomed into service so long as they satisfied the criteria of ability and integrity. His prejudice was, therefore, not against any religion or caste, but against incompetence and disloyalty—a principle the wholesome implications of which have still to be fully appreciated in the India of our own times. The commandant of a fort and his colleagues were liable to transfer so that the scope for intrigue and for the creation of vested interests was minimized. In fact, Shivaji did not allow the hereditary system, the enemy of efficiency and progress, to weaken his administration. No office could be handed down from father to son unless the new incumbent deserved it. Such precautions, about which we will write more later, greatly helped Shivaji to maintain his government at a high level of efficiency. It was precisely because most of his officers shared his patriotism and enthusiasm for noble causes that no reverses, however frequent and devastating, could deflect them from the pursuit of their appointed tasks. The fall of the forts in particular was considered worse than a disaster and no sacrifice was considered too great to wipe out the “disgrace”. The Queen-Mother, Jijabai, did not hesitate to send the brave Tanaji Malusare to his doom when she peremptorily demanded her son to wrest the Lion Fort from the hands of the Moghuls. The affection with which the forts were looked upon and the fervour and determination with which they were defended did not long survive Shivaji’s death. The elaborate safeguards devised by him for their defence and management were not scrupulously adhered to or enforced so that during the reign of Rajaram, his younger son, many of the senior officers of his government gained possession of them, virtually treating them as their personal property. In 1710-11, for instance, Parashurampant Pratinidhi alone controlled as many as thirty-five forts, including such famous ones as Vishalgad and Pratapgad.",

In fact, Shivaji waged a relentless war against conditions that fostered the growth of the pernicious system of imperium in imperio. He sternly suppressed the petty barons in whom the country abounded and whose continued existence, with all their privileges and pretensions, constituted a serious menace to the state. He dismantled their castles, confiscated their properties, and enlisted the more discerning and patriotic ones among them in the service of his government. His administration was in every sense strong, clean and efficient. Naturally, he laid great stress on military service, but at the same time he interdicted any intervention of the army in the affairs of the civil government.\n\nShivaji showed keen interest in the recruitment of officers and men to his army. His uncanny ability to select the right type of man in his service was of inestimable value to him in his wars against the Moghuls and the Sultans of Bijapur. He was equally meticulous in the choice of the horses for his cavalry so that his army soon became famous for the celerity of its movement. Lightly armed and equipped, the Maratha horsemen were able to cover forty to fifty miles a day, while the heavily encumbered armies of the imperialists and of Bijapur found movement of any kind most painful. Accustomed to a simple and frugal way of life, the Maratha soldiers could live cheerfully on whatever fare and amenities they could secure from the provinces they invaded. Shivaji himself set an example in such simplicity. He forbade to himself the luxuries that were not given to his men. Foreign observers both at Surat and in the south were amazed at the King’s indifference to ostentation and to the seductions of an easy and comfortable life. He was a great captain who, like many of his famous equals that preceded and followed him both in his own country and in foreign lands, fully shared the trials and tribulations and the dangers of camp life with his troops, thus winning their unstinted loyalty and devotion to his person and cause.\n\nAfter Shivaji's death, the Marathas lost many of the virtues which he had so assiduously taught them, but their democratic spirit and their innate love of simplicity remained in their fighting forces till the last. It was quite common to observe mighty chieftains on the battlefield, upon whose valour and judgment the issues of success and defeat depended, besides the lives of hundreds of thousands of combatants, and others, performing the most humble chores at the end of the day without the slightest consciousness of their dignity or status. It was not derogatory to their honour to assist their orderlies in kindling the fire to keep themselves and their companions-at-arms warm during the night. For instance, a distinguished man was observed to sit on the ground on a spread saddle-cloth, “dictating to his secretaries and otherwise discharging the political duties of his station”. This “primeval plainness” had the most salutary and decisive influence on the discipline and outlook of the entire army.",

    "text": "Sir John Malcolm, who played the memorable role of performing the obsequies of the Maratha Empire by compelling the abdication of the last Peshwa, Bajirao, in June 1818, had intimate knowledge of the Maratha troops, although the picture presented by them in his time was certainly not the brightest. He wrote thus about the Maratha soldier: “Few could claim superiority to him in patience under fatigue, hunger, and thirst, and in that plain manliness of character which remained unchanged by success or adversity: nor can we deny to the Mahrattas, in the early part of their history, and before their extensive conquests had made their vast and mixed armies cease to be national, the merit of conducting their Cossack inroads into other countries with a consideration to the inhabitants, which had been deemed incompatible with that terrible and destructive species of war.\" Such a high tribute was indeed well deserved. The Marathas did not depend entirely upon mere physical prowess. Under the resourceful leadership of their master they made free use of skill and strategy, to which were added certain sterling moral principles. They lived for eight months in a year outside their home territories and were disciplined to observe certain norms of conduct violation of which involved severe punishment. First, all the spoils collected during their expedition were required to be made over to the state, the troops retaining nothing for their personal use. Secondly, women, places of worship, cows and sacred books were not to be insulted on any account. Indeed, this rule was enforced with such strictness that “a brave Mughal governor once deemed it safe to leave in a woman’s garb when the Marathas appeared at the gates of his city”. Shivaji was equally insistent that no soldier should take with him his wife or any other woman during the military expeditions.\n\nIt is precisely because the Marathas under Shivaji were trained to be considerate and respectful towards the civilian population and to observe certain commendable standards of behaviour that their expeditions were not regarded as a calamity. “In their first invasion of Central India,” writes Sir John Malcolm, “the war the Mahrattas carried on was evidently against the Government, and not the inhabitants. They appear, at this stage of their power, to have taken a large share of the revenue, but not to have destroyed, like more barbarous invaders, the source from which it was drawn, for if they had, it could not have recovered so rapidly, as we find from revenue records that it did. But there is in the whole of the proceedings of this period, the strongest ground to conclude, that they were acting with the concurrence and aid of the Hindu chiefs of the empire, whose just reasons for discontent with the reigning monarch, Aurangzebe, have been noticed.”\n\nLastly, Shivaji and his men were animated by a high sense of mission which helped them face their difficulties with a stout heart. Compared to the military resources and equipment of the imperialists and the Sultans of Bijapur, their own means were incredibly inadequate, but they overcame this serious handicap through superior discipline, greater mobility and hardihood and, what is more important, from the conviction that their cause was just and noble. The potency of patriotism has been repeatedly proved in history. The Anglo-Nepalese War may be cited as an instance in point. Though hopelessly outnumbered and equipped with the most primitive weapons, the humble hill-men of the Himalayas, who had never known military training or discipline, fought the mighty forces of the East India Company, led by renowned British generals, with such skill and doggedness that the campaign of 1814-15 electrified the entire country, with people in far-off places watching its fortunes with bated breath.",

    "text": "ceptor, Dadaji Konddev, who, in his turn, was influenced by the measures of the great Muslim statesman of the Nizamshahi Government,- Malik Ambar. Though a foreigner, this sagacious man did for the Deccan peasantry what Akbar’s Minister,: / Todar Mai, did for that of north India, “lake Todar MalM -, says Dr. Sen, “he divided the arable lands into four separate classes according to fertility and ascertained their produce, roughly it is true, and fixed the assessment once for all. He, however, did not want the peasants to pay in kind.” He reorganized the agency for revenue collection and made the offices of the Patil and other village officials heredi- tary, charging them with the responsibility for ensuring the collection of the government dues in full. Shivaji improved upon this system in many ways. The culti-, vable area of every village was carefully noted and the extent of each plot of land was measured, not with the traditional .rope or chain, but with a standard measuring rod. Assessment was determined on the basis of the fertility of the soil. “An esti- mate,” we are informed, “was made of the expected produce of each bigha, three parts of which were left to the peasant and two parts taken by the state.” Extension of agricultural opera- tions was encouraged by distributing seeds among the pioneer- ing peasants and buying cattle for them. Loans granted for such purposes were recovered by easy instalments and exemp- tions from payment were liberally given during bad seasons. Shivaji made a clean sweep of all intermediaries and put an end to the widespread evil of tax-farming by bringing the pea- sent in direct relations with the revenue officials of the central government. The village officers, namely, the Patils, the Kul- karnis and the Deshmukhs, were not given a carte blanche in the matter of revenue collections, although they performed, other duties and received their emoluments as before. It was a salutary check, since under the Moghuls and the Deccan Sul- tans. it had become customary for the village officers to appro- priate the bulk of the collections for their own use, remitting only a negligible portion of the revenue to the government. It was with the aid of such ill-gotten resources that they grew in strength which they often employed to, defy the central authority. Shivaji rendered them ineffective by organising his administration on a more efficient basis. Besides providing for the management, of the forte, as des- cribed earlier,; Shivaji’ sub-divided the provinces into subhas and, mahals, very much in the manner Of the present-day district and taluka administration. The average revenue of a mahal ranged from three-fourths of a lakh to over one lakh of rupees. A subha consisted of two or three such mahals. The head of the subha was called Subhadar, who was a man of considerable prestige and one who enjoyed the full confidence of the central government. His annual salary was 400 hons. Apart from his other duties, it was the function of this officer and his sub- ordinates in the mahds, known as the Mahalkaris, to adminis- ter the land revenue within their jurisdiction. Two or three villages were grouped together and placed in charge of an offi- cial called the Kamavisdar, who directly collected the land re- venue under the direction of the mahal and the Subha revenue officers. .Shivaji, who was deeply nurtured in the traditions of ancient India, was evidently aware of the injunction of the text- book writers that taxes should be collected in the same man- ner as the bee gathers honey from flowers. Indeed, his land revenue policy worked well and conduced to the growth of the' population of his kingdom and its prosperity.",

    "text": "The complex machinery of government, civil and military, de- vised by Shivaji was sustained by his unique personality. It needed his personal guidance and authority for its efficient operation, but the growing burdens of an administration that differed fundamentally from the prevailing ones called for the assistance of a team of seasoned officials who could be trusted to carry out loyally and diligently the policies and programmes prescribed by the king. Shivaji was generously endowed with the. capacity for masterful leadership, but in the wider interests of his cause he always associated wise and experienced men in his undertakings. He was both humble and sagacious enough to realize the manifest absurdity of any ruler claiming himself to be the state. . -'All the Talmud of interpretation that has been built around the famous Ashta JPradhan system would have been found to be wholly unnecessary if this simple fact had been recognized. The Ashta JPradhan was neither, a cabinet in the modem sense of the. terM, consisting of eight duly elected ministers answer- able to a cqnstitutional king, nor was it a cabal of clever offi-’ cials created with the object of advancing the personal inter- ests of a despot. It was simply an institution which, far horn divesting the king of his unlimited powers, helped him in exer- cising them with wisdom and moderation and with a view to promoting the well-being of the people. The powers entrusted to each member of the Ashta Pradhan support this point of view. Shivaji did not begin his kingly responsibilities with eight ministers around him. In fact, that number was not reached till 1674, that is, barely six years before his death. Chief in this team of expert advisers and executives was the Peshwa or the prime minister. It was undoubtedly a position of great responsibility and dignity. The government of the realm was conducted under the orders of the Peshwa during the king’s absence. He was to supervise the working of the administra- tion and to ensure its efficiency. All letters and charters issued by the king bore the seal of the Peshwa. The times demanded that the chief minister should also be a man of the sword and lead armies against the enemy. His salary was commensurate with his standing as the first servant of the state and amounted to 15,000 hons a year. The Majumdar or Amatya performed the role of the present- day auditor-general and carefully checked the income and ex- penditure of the government. He kept the king fully informed about the financial position of the administration. It was the duty of the Waknis or the Mantri to compile a careful and comprehensive daily record of the activities of the king and of the members of the royal family, besides function- ing as master of ceremonies. He was required to exercise a careful watch over the men that were invited to meet the king and to lunch or dine with him. The fourth officer was the Sachiv, known in Persian as Sutras. He was in charge of the king’s correspondence and ensured that both in content and in style it conformed to royal wishes and the convention of the. times. His seal of approval was essential on all the correspondence of the king. He was in addition called upon to check the accounts of the provinces. The foreign secretary was called Sumant, its Persian equi- valent being Ddbir. He advised his sovereign on foreign affairs and received ambassadors from other states on behalf of his government. He was to keep himself fully informed about tiie happenings outside the realm and to ensure that the gov- ernment of his master was held in high esteem at other courts. The duties of the Panditrao were to promote learning and in the Ashta Pradhan.",

The troops must be in the highest state of efficiency and measures designed to promote this end should be promptly adopted. The Commander-in-Chief should keep the king fully posted with the happenings in his depart- ment. He should also lead his armies in war and arrange for the integration of the conquered territories into the realm. The duties of the Panditrao were to promote learning and piety in the land and to reward scholarship generously. Men devoted to the pursuit and the propagation of knowledge and enlightenment should never bo allowed to suffer destitution or seek asylum outside the state for their livelihood. Besides, he should attract scholars from the rest of the country and suit- ably reward them for their attainments. He also settled reli- gious disputes and generally ensured that the theological in- junctions laid down for the governance of the society were scrupulously observed. The Nyayadish was the highest judicial authority in the kingdom and settled both civil and criminal cases that were brought in appeal before him. The village panchayats, which enjoyed considerable local autonomy settled most of the dis- putes that arose in their villages. All the ministers of the Ashta Pradhan, with the exception of the last two, namely, the Panditrao and the Nyayadish, were required to be on active service, should such a need arise, so that they were proficient as much in the arts of war as in the arts of peace. Everyone of the officers appointed by Shivaji to these responsible positions performed his duties with exem- plary devotion and ability. Besides these men, he was ably served by his personal secretary, Balaji Avji, whose quiet com- petence and attachment to his master have won for him a unique place in the Maratha history. Nila Prabhu, Shivaji’s Persian Secretary, distinguished himself for his penmanship and the letter of protest against Aurangzeb’s intolerance, drafted by him for his master, is remembered as much for its dignity and loftiness of sentiment as for its style. It was with the aid of such men, inspired by a sense of mis- sion, that Shivaji governed his country. But he remained the sole architect and builder of the mighty edifice of swarajya. He commanded the unswerving loyalty of his subordinates, the affection and admiration of his people and indeed of all dis- cerning men in the country, as much on account of his sterling character as his towering abilities. His administration was pure and efficient because he became widely known as an im- placable foe of every kind of jobbery, intrigue and dubious behaviour. He heartily hated the social drones that contribut- ed nothing to the common good but enjoyed large hereditary landed estates. He certainly did not seek to anticipate the socialist or welfare state of our modern conception, but by sincerely striving for the common weal, he unwittingly led his kingdom in that direction. His administration could justly claim this distinction because he was able to dismiss, to bor- row Burke’s famous phrase, “rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world” as mere glitter without substance and devote his entire attention and energy to the well being of his people.",

Like all great leaders, he had a natural capacity for separating the chaff from the grain. His shrewd and unerring judgment of men and things wag vastly helped by his training and outlook. Nothing escaped his penetrating perception. As the son of a prominent Sardar, with large estates in the countryside, he had ample opportunities for making a careful study of the quality and the character of the diverse elements that comprised the then Indian society. The Emperor and the Sultans were regarded as the supreme embodiments of God’s creation and their gratifica- tion and appeasement constituted the sumum bontim of the existence of their statellites. Few among the nobles that sur- rounded their monarchs had the courage of their convictions. As we saw earlier, the mental outlook of the Marathas till the advent of Shivaji as an exemplar of national resurgence was even more deplorable. There was nothing in their aspirations that was noble or heart-warming. They eagerly sold their swords either to the Sultans or to the Emperors, asking for nothing more elevating in return than jagirs for their personal enjoyment and a patronizing nod from their overlords. It is a moot point whether the numerous Maratha names, with which the pages of history are dotted, would have won any recogni- tion at all if there had been no Shivaji. In no country have ill- considered sacrifices been admired or cherished. It is incon- ceivable that men like Baji Prabhu and Tanaji Malusare would have won legendary fame if their heroic exploits and sacrifices had been made merely to sustain the status quo. Like the bloom of flowers in the wilderness going unnoticed, their great deeds would have been buried deep in the bowels of oblivion. Shivaji’s life and career have saved us from such a sterile vista of the past. It is a past that abounds in heroic and epoch-making episodes, not only in his own career, but also in that of his lieutenants, most of whom considered themselves twice blessed if",

Indeed, the bonds of comradeship that united him to his men were of a quality that transcended the relations that normally subsist between a master and his subordinate. It was a unique relationship and had little in common with the one that existed, for example, between Aurangzeb and Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The Raja’s capacity for sacrifice on behalf of his sovereign was no less considerable, but it lacked the sublime quality that is derived from the championship of worthy causes. It is for this reason that we look upon this eminent Rajput, not as a person worthy of emulation, but as a tragic figure who wantonly or unwittingly spumed a distin- guished place in history by his failure to subordinate his self to the country’s wider interests. To cite another but a gene- ral and a relatively recent example, the sufferings and sacri- fices of generation after generation of Indian soldiers under British rule have not won the recognition they would undoub-' tedly have deserved had they been made for the liberation and the greater glory of their own motherland. The cause for which sacrifices are made is thus as important as the sacrifices themselves. Shivaji’s goal was just and noble, but no less attractive was his personality. His engaging appearance and magnetism, his sobriety, his resourcefulness, his concentration of purpose, his fearlessnes and his personal rectitude were qualities that deeply impressed his friends and foes alike. He abhorred ostentation and preferential treatment for himself. His deep and abiding love for the humble hillmen of Maharashtra, who constituted the backbone of his great movement, not only pro- tected him horn the perversities of the times, but also stimula- ted in him a true and healthy sense of values. Like many great military commanders, he spumed discrimi- natory amenities on the battlefield. He fought, ate and slept alongside his comrades, always placing himself before them as a worthy example for emulation. Not for him were palaces of canvas in camp, provided with the choicest luxuries which the world of his time could produce- By his Spartan simplicity he stimulated the conviction among his troops that he went to. the front, not for self-indulgence, but to defeat the enemy. The contrast presented by the pomp and splendour of the Moghul camp was significant. The second outsanding characteristic of Shivaji was his fear- lessness and tireless energy. His courage became proverbial. In every engagement, where his personal appearance could decide the issue, he was always in the forefront, striking terror into the hearts of the enemy by his energetic attacks. He showed great sagacity and thoroughness in ascertaining through his superb intelligence service both the strength and the weak- ness of the opposing forces and fell upon them with relentless fury once he knew where to strike. His short and wiry frame was specially made to endure any fatigue. The celerity' of his movement and its secrecy deeply mystified and discomfited his enemies. His lightly-armed and fast-moving cavalry acquired undet-his' leadership and that of his lieutenant, Netaji Palkar, a felicity in manoeuvre and attack which proved most potent when dealing with slow-moving and heavily-equipped Moghul forces.",

    "text": "Orme the well-known English historian, gives Shivaji the highest tribute by holding that in courage, resource- fulnes and quickness of. action he had few equals in his time. No general ever traversed as much ground as he did at the head of armies. \"He met,” writes the historian, \"every emergency of peril, however sudden and extreme, with instant discernment and unshaken fortitude. The ablest of his offi- cers acquiesced to the imminent superiority of his. genius,’ and the boast of the soldier was to have seen Shivaji charging sword in hand.” • In many ways’ Shivaji was the beau ideal of a soldier. -His courage and his ever-flowing combative energy filled his men and others with wonder, often stimulating them to similar feats of endurance and valour. He did not believe in measureless sacrifices in order to win evanescent victories. Unjustified car- nage invariably repelled him. It is precisely because his methods of warfare comprised an infinite variety of ruses and strategems that victory invariably crowned his exertions. To these inestimable qualities he added a moral gift of leadership that inspired, as in the case of Hannibal, the devoted loyalty of his troops. Shivaji, says Justice Ranade, “attracted towards himself all that was hopeful and aspiring in the land, without distinction of class or caste or creed or colour\n”. Few among the men that accepted his leadership proved faithless to him which, says the same distinguished authority, is “the highest privilege of genius”. Apart from other reasons, such loyalty was willingly rendered because the King watched over the interests of his sol- diers with the greatest care, whether they were in canton- ment or on the battlefield. Instructions were issued to the com- manders and the governors of his realm to bring to his notice the names of men who distinguished themselves in war. Such soldiers were promptly honoured either by increased remunera- tion or by promotion to the higher rank. Thus, every member of the armed forces was animated by the resolution to exert himself to the utmost in the cause of his king and country, being convinced that merit would always receive its due recog- nition sad reward. • “Shivaji,” says the Portuguese writer, Cosme da Guarda was “naturally loved by all men of valour and good conduct”. There was a reciprocal understanding and affection between him and his men so that the fighting apparatus created by him soon developed into a powerful people’s army, held together by a comifiunity of language, thought and sentiment. New leaders came to the fore, unreservedly placing their newly-discovered but considerable talents at the disposal of the state. A good number of them were like Berthier, Massena and Augereau, French commanders of humble, origin who owed their distinc- tion entirely to Napolean’s discovery of their abilities. Thousands of skilled and strong hands helped Shivaji in rearing the edifice of stoarajya. Men of all classes and creeds enthusiastically took part in the great enterprise of building a new order in the country. The Pathan from the wilds of the North-West Frontier fought shoulder to shoulder with his Hindu comrade-in-arms in sustaining and strengthening the new crea- tion. The sea-faring Muslim from the Konkan was received with open arms in the Maratha navy and given positions of trust and responsibility without the slightest suspicion or fear that the ties of religion would triumph over his sense of loyalty and obligation. Indeed, the Muslim in the Maratha service had little to fear. He was assured of regular pay and promo- tion—a rare blessing, taking into account the bad record of the chronically impecunious Muslim governments—good and impar- tial treatment and a complete liberty of conscience. We have already referred to the brave defenders of the hill- forts among whom the names of Phirangoji Narsala and Murar Baji are justly famous. Indeed, the number of men who dis- tinguished themselves in Shivaji’s service was legion, but the rest of this chapter will be devoted to a brief description of the heroism displayed by Baji Prabhu and Tanaji Malusare during his lifetime and by Santaji Ghorpade after his death.",

    "section": "The Conquest of Sinhgad",
    "text": "Jijabai refused to share their hesitation. One morning, says the Ballad of Sinhgad*, while she was combing her hair at Pratapgad, she suddenly saw through the window of her palace the Lion Fort, “gleaming in the February air”. The poignant thought that it did not belong to her son made her unhappy. She summoned a rider and ordered him to go in all haste to Shivaji, then in residence at Rajgad, and tell him that she desired his immediate presence before her. The call was indeed urgent, for, in the expressive language of the ballad: “Within his walls my son may dine; But bid him wash his hands in mine.” Shivaji promptly responded to his mother’s summons, without knowing the reasons for its peremptoriness, but his heart sank within him when he heard what she wanted from him. He pleaded earnestly but in vain that the conquest of Sinhgad called for Herculean efforts which he was not, in the difficult circumstances prevailing, able to make. “To win it (he explained) went forth many, but There came back never any; Oft .planted was the mango seed, but nowhere grows the tree.” Jijabai was, however, adamant. Dreading his mother’s displeasure more than the hazards of the undertaking, he cast about for a suitable man to whom he could entrust the perilous task. Who else could he be if not Tanaji Malusare, his boon companion from boyhood and a man of iron will who almost invariably accompanied him on all historic occasions?\n* This is distinct from the one translated by H. A. Acworth who has called it The Ballad of Tanuji Maloosre. Both are quoted in these pages.\nTanaji was in the village of Umrathe or Umbrat in the Mahad taluka of Kolaba, engaged in celebrating his son’s wedding to the “fairest damsel in the Konkan”, when the call came to him to appear before his king at Rajgad. Neither the festivities nor the earnest entreaties of the bridegroom to delay his departure could detain him in the village. Collecting his retainers, he sped post-haste to Shivaji, accompanied by his eighty-year-old uncle Stieljirmama, and his brother Suryaji. Shivaji, who did not have the heart to tell his dear comrade that he had been summoned to his doom, directed Tanaji to the Queen-Mother to hear from her the nature of his mission. She told him: “Of all the Bhosle’s barons men shall deem thee as the first, Nay, I shall be thy mother and Shivaji thy brother, If thou wrest the Lion’s fortress from the rule of the accurst”. Undaunted by the terrifying nature of his mission, the lion-hearted knight from the Konkan marched towards the fortress with his men, reaching it unnoticed on a clear, cold, still and moonless night, “the ninth of the dark fortnight of the month of Magh”—February 1670. He had taken with him Shivaji’s favourite ghorpad or lizard to assist in scaling the fort wall. The creature, to whose waist a cord was tied, refused to climb the fort, as if to warn Tanaji of the impending disaster. The subhadar, as Tanaji was called, was furious and threatened to kill it if it tried to play prophet to him! The frightened lizard sped to the hill-top and fixing its talons firmly in the heath helped the Marathas to clamber the cliff. But scarcely before 300 men had reached the top, their arrival was detected by the guards.",

    "section": "The Battle for Sinhgad and its Aftermath",
    "text": "The sentries were pounced upon and slain by the Marathas, but the shouting and the dash of arms that accompanied the proceedings thoroughly roused the garrison. Tanaji was now faced with a grave dilemma. With 700 of his men still at the foot of the fort, he was forced to engage an enemy that greatly outnumbered his troops. He, however, did not take long to make up his mind and ordered his men to charge. The Marathas fought with desperate valour, knowing that neither timely succour nor escape was possible. Uday Bhan, the Moghul commander, who had lain “drenched in lust and wine”, was apprised of the invasion. Donning his armour and armed with a mighty sword, he rushed to the blood-drenched battlefield in search of his chief adversary, Tanaji. The two formidable men came face to face, each determined to destroy the other. The dice were, however, heavily loaded against the Maratha warrior. The long night march to the foot of the fort, the tremendous exertion involved in scaling the difficult cliff, the anxiety that weighed upon him by his failure to secure the arrival of all his men inside the stronghold, and the desperate hand-to-hand fighting in which he had been continually engaged before confronting Uday Bhan, had taken a heavy toll of Tanaji’s energy. But his spirit and courage never flagged. Uday Bhan, an accomplished swordsman, was hampered by none of these handicaps. The ballad describes the fall of Tanaji in these moving words: “As the lightning-flash descends where the Indrayani wends, When the thunder-clouds are gathered around Visapur in Jest (Jyestha) * On Malusare fell the blow, beating sword and sword-arm low, And Tanaji, the Lion, fell cloven to the waist.” The death of their leader unnerved the Marathas, but the timely arrival of Suryaji, who had by then entered the fort, and his exhortation to his men to fight courageously, saved the situation. In the fierce battle that ensued the Moghul commander was killed. The garrison was routed and several hundred soldiers, to save themselves from the fury of the invaders, ventured over the rock and were dashed to pieces in the attempt. It was a great victory for the Marathas, but there was no elation in their camp. The news of the victory was conveyed to the King who rushed to the fort, eager to congratulate his friend, but to his dismay he saw the brave man’s dead body. His grief was tremendous: “Twelve days the king wept o’er him for the great love that he bore him.” The sorrow of the Queen-Mother was no less profound. The ballad, translated by Acworth, reads: “The scarf removed, she saw his face, ‘No worthier chief of Kshatri race’, 'Twas thus she wail’d ’e’er drew a sword Before the armies of his lord. Shivaji, son and king, today Thy goodliest limb is lopp’d away” Nor less the monarch to his chief The tribute paid of royal grief.” Shivaji immortalized the sacrifice of his friend by exclaiming: \"I have got the fort, but I have lost the lion”—a laconism that has deservedly became famous in Maratha history.",

    "section": "The Rise of Santaji and Dhanaji",
    "text": "Santaji Ghorpade was among the younger generals who rose to prominence as a stout-hearted defender of the Maratha kingdom after Shivaji’s death. Santaji had seen active service in many theatres of war during the King’s lifetime, but the opportunity to display his abilities as an outstanding military commander came to him in full measure during the convulsive period that marked the history of the Marathas after 1680, the year of Shivaji’s death. The misfortunes that overtook the Deccan highlanders after this melancholy event were overwhelming. Sambhaji, who shared many of his father’s abilities, would undoubtedly have consolidated and enlarged the heritage of independence bequeathed by the founder, had he been endowed with one more gift, namely, stability of character. He paid a terrible penalty for this deficiency and, falling into the hands of the Moghuls, was cruelly done to death by Aurangzeb in March 1689. The Emperor, who had arrived in the Deccan towards the end of 1681 with a large army, determined not to return to his capital till he had accomplished the total destruction of the Marathas, was jubilant that the prospect of reaching his long-cherished goal was extremely bright, now that he had murdered the founder’s son. Rajaram, Shivaji’s second son, upon whom the responsibility for protecting the kingdom from annihilation fell, was known to be mild-mannered and good-natured. Could he rise to the occasion by making an abundant display of masterful leadership? Much to the disappointment of his enemies and to the elation of his nation, he did. What was equally fortunate, thanks to the enduring influence of his father’s genius, a band of competent men came forward to assist him in the darkest hour of Maharashtra’s history. Ramchandra Nilkanth, the progenitor of the Amatya family of Bavda in Kolhapur district, was a man of great vision and sagacity. He had been trained under Shivaji and knew well the art of promoting concord and concerted action among the self-willed leaders of government. He was himself not a man of the sword, but he was gifted with the rare spirit of rousing others to great heights of heroism. Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav were conspicuous among his lieutenants who shattered the imperialists’ dream of conquest. Rajaram’s warm tribute to Ramchandrapant presents the true measure of the Amatya’s valuable services to the nation. “The Maratha kingdom,” declared the King, “is a gift from the gods. Ramchandrapant saved it from a grave crisis by creating a band of leaders in its defence after a careful appraisal of their individual abilities. He made the best use of the nation’s resources for protecting it from the aggression of the imperialists. Providence has crowned his endeavours with success, while defeating the designs of the enemy.” Dhanaji Jadhav, one of the two outstanding captains under Rajaram, was born in 1650 and belonged to the family of Shivaji’s mother. He had received his training under the renowned Senapati Prataprao Gujar. His considerable military abilities were frankly acknowledged by the Moghul generals who felt the weight of his arms on many a battlefield. Dhanaji was a cultured and farsighted soldier who knew the value of humility and moderation even in the midst of resounding victories. For some years, he actively co-operated with Santaji Ghorpade in ensuring the security of the fugitive Rajaram and in inflicting crushing defeats on the enemy.",

    "text": "Santaji was cast in a different mould. He was a magnificent guerilla leader, with a genius for organizing large bodies of men and welding them into a mighty fighting force. He abhorred laxity and indiscipline and severely punished his men when such lapses were detected. There was no limit to his daring and resourcefulness. Nothing was impossible to this dashing general who proved his stature again and again by inflicting defeat and disgrace on many a renowned Moghul commander. Perhaps, the most memorable episode in his meteoric career was his attack on the camp of the Emperor at Koregaon. Taking a band of exceptionally courageous men with him, he entered the Imperial camp unnoticed in pouring rain and suddenly fell upon Aurangzeb’s tent. The supporting ropes were cut and the massive edifice of canvas collapsed, with the aged Emperor, it was at first believed, falling with it. Fortunately for him, he had slept elsewhere the previous night. Santaji and his men stripped the tent of its valuables and carried them away, together with the massive gold cupolas that adorned it. Santaji’s audacity always paid him rich dividends. No Imperial General dared to face him. Sarkar, who observes that the Maratha captain’s name “inspired abject fear in all ranks of the Moghul army,” gives an example in support of his view. The source quoted by him says: “When the news reached that Santaji had arrived within a distance of sixteen or eighteen miles from him, Firuz Jang (Aurangzeb’s highest general) lost colour in terror, and making a false announcement that he would ride to oppose him, appointed officers to clear the path, sent his tents in advance, but fled towards Bijapur by another route!” More than any other individual leader, Santaji saved his master and his kingdom from destruction by his brilliant victories against the imperialists whose dreams he haunted by his prowess. His incredible successes galvanized the waning energies of his people, stimulated their declining morale, and thus braced them up to overcome any danger. Grant Duff rightly declares: “Santaji Ghorpade was one of the best officers of whom the Maratha annals can boast, and his eulogy is best recorded, when we say, he was the terror of the Moghul detachments for seven years.” Unfortunately, this great soldier was stricken with the malady of conceit. In his dealings with his colleagues and subordinates, he had the narrow outlook of a martinet. He made enemies of his most intimate friends and became increasingly insufferable by behaving as if he was a man of destiny. He overreached himself by withholding from his own sovereign courtesies and obedience due to his eminence. The end of such a man could not be peaceful. A brilliant career was suddenly cut short…",

    "text": "the hand of an assassin. Santaji Ghorpade was the stormy petrel of Maratha history, but his role in stemming and repelling the tide of Moghul invasion will always be remembered with pride and gratitude. The hopes of the aged Emperor, who had despaired of fulfilling his mission in the Deccan, were suddenly revived when Rajaram, worn out by cares and anxieties, died at Sinhgad in March 1700. But unfortunately for Aurangzeb, whose overstay in the world was resented as much by the people as by his sons, a lady came forward to frustrate his ambition. Tarabai, the widow of Rajaram, was a spirited woman who had learnt her lessons in patriotism and discipline in the stem school of adversity. She was brave and resourceful and was abundantly endowed with the gifts of leadership. She inspired her military officers to organize effective resistance to the invaders and often shared the suffering and weariness of the troops by living and moving with them. Great care was taken to ensure that the standard of the civil administration did not decline. In brief, the widowed Queen assumed complete dominion over the life of the Marathas, holding them together and encouraging them to fight to the bitter end, and thus thoroughly exposed the hollowness of Aurangzeb’s boast that after Rajaram’s death Maharashtra would fall into the lap of the Moghuls like a ripe plum. Perhaps, the best tribute we can pay to this heroic woman is to recall the high praise that has been given to her by the hostile Muslim historian, Khafi Khan, who says that she was extremely wise and enterprising in the conduct of public affairs and popular with the army. In fact, she became so dearly loved and respected by her people that “all the efforts of Aurangzeb against the Marathas down to the end of his reign failed”. The inspiring leadership of Shivaji thus became a precious legacy which sustained the Maratha Empire through many vicissitudes even though the direction of its affairs sometimes fell into the hands of feeble men. Far away from his native province, his victories and wise administration stimulated a strong urge among the valiant people of the land, both during his lifetime and after his death, to establish a new order based on justice and tolerance. The Rajputs, the Sikhs, the Jats and the Bundelas, among others, strove mightily towards this end. Raja Chhatrasal of Bundelkhand, who drew the sword against the excesses of Aurangzeb, cherished the ambition of serving in person under the banner of Shivaji. When the two leaders met in Maharashtra, the Maratha king persuaded the Bundela chief to return to his home province and provoke hostilities against the imperialists from there, Chhatrasal, who went back to his people in 1671, fought for decades against the invaders and eventually succeeded in expelling them from his land. He died in December 1731, full of years and glory. Such heroic uprisings in the country marked the fulfilment of Shivaji’s crusading mission on behalf of a new order based on religious harmony and political justice.",

    "section": "Part 2: Shivaji's Final Years and Legacy",
    "text": "Shivaji was not vouchsafed a long span of life and yet his achievements are monumental. There was, however, an imperative need for his masterful guidance for some more years in order to ensure the consolidation and expansion of the Maratha Kingdom. But when he knew that he would not be spared long, he faced death with complete resignation and fortitude, seeing that it was a necessary end. A man of deep piety, he spent several months in the company of Ramdas Swami, his spiritual guide, philosopher and friend, before death claimed him. Religious discussions, prayer and meditation brought peace and tranquillity to his troubled mind and braced him up to meet the distractions of his domestic life with composure. Taking leave of Ramdas, whose ministrations had meant so much to him, he journeyed to Raigad on February 4, 1680, perhaps with the premonition that the two would never meet again. He busied himself in the capital with preparations for the wedding of his second son, Rajaram, who was married on March 15 to the daughter of Prataprao Gujar. A week later, he was laid up with fever from which he never recovered. The end came at midday on Saturday April 3, 1680. At the time of his death, he was fifty or fifty-three years old, according as we choose to accept the date of his birth as 1627 or 1630. A luminous star disappeared from the Indian firmament The last years of Shivaji were clouded with concern about the future of his realm. His eldest son, Sambhaji, was barely twenty-three years old at the time of his death. The young man was undoubtedly a chip of the old block. He was handsome, sturdy, brave and generous. He fully inherited his father’s enthusiasm for great and noble causes and valiantly donned Shivaji’s armour and sword as the defender of the faith. He had the benefit of careful and liberal education. Men known for their learning and rectitude had undertaken the training of his mind and had found in him an intelligent, if wayward, student. He was carefully instructed in the significance of his parent’s historic mission and was exhorted by no less a person than Ramdas Swami to qualify himself for taking Shivaji’s place after him. Composing his counsel in verse, the Swami urged Sambhaji to weld his people into a strong and purposeful fraternity, animated by a lofty conception of their obligation to their dharma or religion and to their rashtra or country. Despite his numerous pre-occupations, Shivaji missed no opportunity himself to enlighten the mind of his son and heir. At what proved to be their last meeting, the father made a moving appeal to his son to realize his exalted mission and act accordingly. He reminded Sambhaji that the essential quality of justice is impartiality and that discrimination in favour of the powerful and the so-called well-born would be gravely detrimental to the good name and efficiency of a government. It was the duty of a ruler to listen not only to the great, but also to the humble, because he himself, Shivaji declared, had “often received better and sounder counsel” from the latter. Moreover, it was the work and the worth of a man and not his birth or wealth, that determined his real importance to the society. “What I should most recommend to you,” Shivaji told Sambhaji, “is that in no case should you have a favourite if you are to spare your subjects from jealousy.” He added that by strictly adhering to this principle a ruler could count on the support of all sections of his people in a period of real crisis.",

    "section": "Part 3: Sambhaji's Character and Shivaji's Appearance",
    "text": "In spite of the nobility of his character, Sambhaji was by temperament one who brooked no constraints on his behaviour, no matter how very salutary and desirable they were. This mettlesome young man grew up with a feeling of grievance. He had been brought up in an atmosphere of stem rectitude, not sufficiently softened with love and affection which only a mother could give. Unfortunately, his mother had died when he was still a boy. He appreciated his father’s anxiety to give him the choicest training with the object of fitting him for his high office, but, in the exuberance of his youthfulness, he refused to accept discipline as a necessary adjunct to the realization of the goal. He was indeed the Prince Rupert of Maharashtra whose impetuosity often led him into grave difficulties and ended in his death under the most distressing circumstances. It was this lack of balanced judgment that led him to escape from Panhala with his wife in December 1678 and rush into the arms of the Moghul commander, Dilir Khan, at Bahadurgad. Nor did he consider it wrong to strain the loyalty of such a veteran servant of his father as Phirangoji Narsala by attacking Bhupalgad. Only the Khan’s excesses and his open contempt for the religious susceptibilities of Sambhaji served as an eye-opener to him and impelled him to return to the path of duty by stealing himself out of the Moghul camp in November 1679. After this date not many months remained for Shivaji to attempt the reformation of his son. A recent biographer of Sambhaji has made a grievance of the candid appraisal of the infirmities in the character of his hero by contemporary and later historians. Much of his admiration for the high qualities of the courageous victim of Aurangzeb’s religious wrath is justified, but it was necessary that the son and successor of Shivaji should not only be an Arthurian figure, but also a man of shrewd and sound judgment and of unlimited circumspection. This Sambhaji was not, as probably most others could not have been. Many pen-portraits have been handed down to us about the personal appearance of Shivaji. He was of medium stature and his limbs were sturdy and of excellent proportion. He was of a fair complexion, with a long nose and beaming eyes. He weighed one hundred and forty pounds and, although he ate only one meal a day, was extraordinarily agile and active. His skill and courage became proverbial and his followers placed implicit confidence in his superior wisdom and generalship.",

    "text": "“His life,” wrote Orme, “was simple even to parsimony; his manners void of insolence or ostentation; as a sovereign most humane and solicitous for the well-being of his people the same principles of frugality and expense were observed in the municipal disbursements of his government; far superior himself to magnificence, none of his officers were led to expect more than competence. In personal activity he exceeded all, of whom there is record. He met every emergency with instant discernment and unshaken fortitude Respected as the guardian of the nation he had founded, he moved everywhere amongst them with unsuspicious security and often alone.” Barthelemy Carre noted that the Maratha King, besides being dreaded by his enemies, was regarded as one whose stars invariably led him to victory and glory. Apart from these avowed admirers of Shivaji, even his most implacable foes and uncharitable critics were compelled to acknowledge his eminence. Grant Duff, whose judgment of men and things and more especially of the doings of the founder of the Maratha Empire, was warped when he wrote his famous History, felt constrained to extol Shivaji in these eloquent words: \"We view his talents with admiration and his genius with wonder. For a popular leader, his frugality was a remarkable feature in his character; and the richest plunder never made him deviate from the rules he had laid down for its appropriation.\" The historian of the Marathas goes on to say: “Shivaji was patient and deliberate in his plans, ardent, resolute and persevering in their execution”, and concludes by observing that the wisdom of the Maratha King’s plans “raised the despised Hindus to sovereignty and brought about their own accomplishment when the hand that framed them was low in the dust”. Aurangzeb, whose iniquity, according to Grant Duff, was “almost unparalleled”, whose “boundless ambition was concealed by deep dissimulation” and whose “boldness was equal to his hypocrisy”, was frank enough to concede that he found in Shivaji a truly formidable foe. When the news of the Maratha King’s death reached him, the Emperor declared: \"He was a great captain and, the only one who has had the magnanimity to raise a new kingdom. My armies have been employed against him for nineteen years and, nevertheless, his state has been always increasing.” No adversary of the Emperor, Muslim, Rajput, Sikh, Jat or Bundela, had caused him greater consternation than his Deccan enemy. In the course of his campaigns he reached a stage when it became impossible for him to choose a competent commander who could bring victory to the imperial arms against Shivaji. It has been recorded that in 1670 the revelation contained in a newsletter about the military successes of the Marathas struck Aurangzeb dumb. Asked which of his officers should next be sent against his Deccan enemy, Mahabat Khan replied with biting sarcasm and disdain: “No general is necessary. A decree from the Chief Kazi will destroy",

His leadership inspired unwavering loyalty and sacrifice among his followers, contributing significantly to Maratha victories and bolstering their confidence against the Mughals.

He actively sought feedback on his administration, demonstrating a commitment to effective governance.  His religious tolerance stood in stark contrast to the policies of Aurangzeb. Deeply devoted to his own faith, Shivaji nonetheless respected other religions, extending patronage to Muslim and Christian shrines and ensuring his Muslim subjects had a place to worship.  This tolerance, evidenced by the construction of a mosque near his palace, further highlights the contrast with Aurangzeb's policy of temple destruction.",

He emerged during a period of Hindu decline and his actions served to revive their morale and combat defeatism. His decisive victories against powerful enemies demonstrated that their supposed invincibility was a facade. Shivaji's primary goal was not societal reform but the salvation of a demoralized people. He recognized that strength and unity, derived from military power, were essential to achieving a new order based on Hindu-Muslim collaboration. By empowering the Hindu majority, he sought to establish a more equitable society. Shivaji's achievements fundamentally altered the course of Indian history. He ignited a national spirit among the Marathas, leading to their expansion and eventual dominance under later leaders like Peshwa Balaji Bajirao. Although continental sovereignty remained elusive, the Marathas successfully challenged the existing power structure, paving the way for a more balanced distribution of power in India. Their rise, fueled by Shivaji's initial impulse, significantly reshaped the political landscape of the subcontinent.",

    "text": "aji and his successors is not a mere episode in history, but an event of outstanding importance. Their achievements and of those that followed their example created a feeling throughout the country for the first time after many centuries that the Hindus could no longer be taken for granted. Better minds among both Hindus and Muslims began to wonder whether it would not be in the best interests of their communities and of the country as a whole that they should come together, sharing in full measure die joys and sorrows of belonging to a common motherland. The readiness and the confidence with which Emperor Shah Alam came under the protection of the sagacious Maratha soldier-statesman, Mahadji Scindia, in preference to the tutelage of his own co-religionist, Ghulam Kadir, is a signal proof of the fact that the wind of change had begun to sweep the country. Again, it was the Maratha supremacy in arms that prompted another great Indian of the eighteenth century, Suraj Mai Jat, to propound the startling scheme for bringing the entire country within the frame of a single government through the combined administrative skill and military strength of the Hindus and the Muslims. The fact that the plan was still-born does not detract from the revolutionary significance of the conception. New forces were at work to bring the two communities together and the degree of interdependence and mutual cordiality which they fostered would perhaps have surprised even Akbar. The establishment of British rule in the country gave a powerful stimulus to the new trend. There was complete impartiality on the part of the foreign rulers in treating Hindus and Muslims alike with contempt. With honourable exceptions, they functioned like J. B. Priestley’s Big Englanders, “red-faced, loud- voiced fellows, wanting to go and boss everybody about all over the world”. Their racial arrogance was only equal to their ignorance. Men like Clive, who mercilessly despoiled the country, spoke and behaved as if they were heaven-bom. By Wellesley’s time it became customary for the officials of the East India Company in Bengal to call certain parts of Calcutta a “Black Town” and to describe its dwellers as “dusky swarms”. As years rolled on, religion became increasingly intolerant and dogmatic and racial pride more exclusive. “A certainty,” write Edward Thompson and Garratt, “of immeasurable superiority settled on British minds. It was felt that Indians had no particular rights beyond that of accepting the government provided for them, without demur as to cost or kind.” It was not merely in social intercourse that the Indians were kept at arm’s length; they were also rigorously excluded from all positions of trust and responsibility in the government of their own country. The reservation of higher offices in India for Englishmen was introduced by Lord Cornwallis who, besides being influenced by racial considerations, held a dim view of the abilities of Indians. The manifest absurdity of such prejudices did not prevent the British rulers from persisting in their misguided views about the people of this country. In the early years of the Company’s territorial expansion many Indian officers commanded troops with European soldiers under them, but this “anomalous” position was soon rectified by cleansing the officer ranks in the army of the Indian element ! The sepoy army that was maintained in India underlined the subordinate status and the helpless condition of her inhabitants.",

    "text": "The first widespread protest of the principal communities against their confinement, in the words of Sir Thomas Munro, to a mere “animal state of thriving in peace” was made in 1857. It was a tremendous uprising in which both Hindus and Muslims participated, but it was not decisive enough to bring about the deposition of the British from their paramount position. Part of the reason for its failure has been explained by Maulana Azad who says: “As I read about the events of 1857, 1 am forced to the sad conclusion that Indian national character had sunk very low. The leaders of the revolt could never agree. They were mutually jealous and continually intriguing against one another.” But to discerning men the rebellion, despite its failure, gave unmistakable proofs of the formidable omens under which .the country was destined to march towards its goal. The Hindus and the Muslims were thus bound together by their common suffering and by the genuineness of their grievances. A great opportunity for building up a secular and democratic order in continental India through the united labours of her principal communities was, however, lost because the Muslims increasingly pursued a separatist policy. The myth—and it was none else, as the pages of this book abundantly bear out—that the Muslims had held the sovereignty of India before the advent of the British, was invented and sedulously fostered in order to disrupt Hindu-Muslim relations. The Aga Khan’s deputation of 1906 to die Viceroy was one of the most unfortunate events in Indian history and was naturally hailed by the imperialists and their handymen as epoch-making. Lady Minto, who recorded her glee over the happening in her diary, received an exultant letter from a correspondent in which it was claimed that the episode was “nothing less than the pulling back of sixty-two millions of people from joining the ranks of the seditious opposition”. No less a person, than the Aga Khan has claimed in his Memoirs that concessions to the separatist demands of his community inevitably led to India’s partition and the creation of Pakistan. Pakistan is thus ths fulfilment of a wild dream. The Hindus could not avert the country’s partition, partly because of their weakness and disunity and largely because the major political party, the Indian National Congress, was pledged to fight, not communalism, but the British rule. Now that a new Muslim State has come into existence, although some of its territories constitute the cradle of the ancient Hindu civilization, all fair- minded persons sincerely wish it God speed. But have the problems which made its birth possible ceased to plague the partitioned India? If they have not, does not the life of Shivaji offer us a lesson in solving them? Indeed, no study of great men can be rewarding unless it helps us to understand our present problems and to avoid their recurrence in the future.",

    "text": "Speaking at Poona in June 1961, while unveiling the portrait of Shivaji, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, then President of the Indian Republic called attention to the problems of unity that confronted the country and pleaded with the people to “realize our duty to place India and her interests above everything else”. They could, he said, develop such a broad outlook by studying the life of Shivaji and following his example in patriotism. “Once again,” the President observed, “history has brought India to the cross-roads. We must turn to the right path. If, Heaven forbid, we commit any mistake at this critical, juncture, all our hopes may be belied, our aspirations frustrated and our national unity endangered.” To avert such a calamity and to strengthen the forces of unity in the country, it was, he said, necessary that we should assimilate the ideas and ideals propagated and practised by Shivaji. The supreme elements in the Maratha King’s character were, Dr. Rajendra Prasad declared, “a high personal character, religious tolerance and a burning patriotism”. By virtue of its position and numbers the majority community has an inescapable obligation to set an example in unity and patriotism to the rest of the population. If it gives such a lead, it will have worthily assimilated the message of Shivaji. His life has shown how through unity, strength and patriotism, it was possible for an infant power to supplant a mighty empire resting on iniquity and intolerance. His crusade, as we saw, was not against any individual or community, but against a system which unjustly and arbitrarily denied the people their basic rights and privileges. Shivaji employed tolerance to supplant bigotry and enlightened government to end tyranny. In striving towards this goal he accepted the services of all these who shared his enthusiasm and satisfied his rigorous tests, no matter to what class or community they belonged. He put a Muslim in charge of his navy to fight the Moghuls and the Sultans of Bijapur, without doubting his subordinate’s loyalty or integrity for a moment. Supremely conscious of his own strength and the justice of his cause, he disdained to entertain such ignoble thoughts in his mind. In perpetuating the memory of this illustrious son of India, whose outstanding contribution consists in practising the triple virtues of unity, strength and patriotism, let us recall Burke's famous inscription on Chatham’s tomb. “The means by which Providence raises a nation to greatness are the virtues infused into great men.” Writers of biographies often overwhelm their heroes with superlative praise. Charles XII, King of Sweden (1697-1718), is one such hero who has received more than his measure of adulation. This extraordinary monarch has been described by Voltaire as “the only person in history who was free from all weakness”, while Dr. Johnson has compared him with Hannibal. Even Peter the Great, that untamed genius who defeated Charles, declared that the Swedish ruler was “the most perfect man and hero since the world began”. We need not lavish such flattery on Shivaji, for his eminence, being both towering and massive, can dispense with all exaggerations. A man who was the true incarnation of courage, generosity and statesmanship, could easily do without such flummeries. Maharashtra cherishes Shivaji’s memory with profound respect and affection. His name is enshrined in the hearts of millions of her people who remember and revere it in many ways. That shrewd' political strategist, Lokmanya Tilak, elevated the life-story of the Maratha King into a popular movement. Through the columns of his Marathi weekly, Kesari (Lion), Tilak wrote stirring articles, freely invoking the name of Shivaji, to rouse the dormant energies of his people and to brace them up for purposeful action. In the farflung theatres of the First and the Second World War, his name was heard as a way-cry wherever the Maratha troops fought under the banner of the Allied Powers. The British, who were so meticulous about their prestige and protocol when dealing with Indians, brushed aside both when the Prince of Wales, now the Duke of Windsor, laid the foundation stone of the All-India Shivaji Memorial at Poona during his tour of the country in 1921. Dr. Rajendra Prasad has described Shivaji as “the builder of an epoch in our history”. There cannot be a more appropriate tribute to the Maratha hero than this. Perhaps, we can best perpetuate the memory of this remarkable man by giving wider currency to the ideals of tolerance and magnanimity, both derived from a position of strength, for which he lived and laboured. Let us end this book with our appreciation of this great patriot and national leader in the words of Ramdas Swami: “Remember Shivaji! And count this life as grass. In this world and the next, rely on fame alone. Remember Shivaji! His form, his noble aims. Forget not also all his valiant deeds on earth.”",

He gave the first sign of talents by standing first in the Vernacular Final ^Examination. Then he joined the Multan High School and passed en to the D. A. V. College, Lahore, from where he took his B. A* degree. Then be joined the Government College, Lahore, and passed bis M. A. with high distinction. During the last part of bis College career, be came under the influence of some great Indian political leaders, especially of Lala Lajpatrai, Sardar Ajitsingh and the Honourable Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and in 1908-9 took an active part in politics. But soon after he was drawn more powerfully to the Arya Samaj. His high place in the M. A. examination would have helped him to a promising career under the Government, but he chose differently. He joined Lala Munshiram ( later Swami Shraddha- Btnd ) *s a worker in the Guruk.ul, Kangri. Here he spent over ten years as a Professor of Economics and Politics, as Vice- Principal and as Principal and sometimes acted in the place of Swami Sbraddhanand as the Governor of the Gurukul University* In 1919 he went to^ England and in February 1922 was admitted to the Ph.

The same year he returned to India and in May was appointed Principal of Rajaram College, Kolhapur. He worked in that capacity till his death on 2 1st October, 1940. His term of Office was distinguished (2) by the phenomenal growth of the institution. In 1922 it was an Arts College with only 293 pupils on the roll ; at the time of his death it was a full-fledged Arts and Science College, teaching- post-graduate courses in many subjects, with 920 pupils on its roll* He was also instrumental in developing Kolhapur as an educational centre, the Law and the Teachers' Training Colleges owing their existence to his initiative and efforts.

    "text": "Though they had golden opportunities of talking with Shivaji and closely observing him, yet they did not leave any detailed account of his personality. Stephen Ustick went as an ambassador of the English from Bombay, in 1672, Thomas Niccolls in 1673, II. Oxenden in 1674, Samuell Austin, R. Jones and Edw. Austen in 1675, Lieut. Adames and Mr. Mauleverer in 1676, and John Child in 1678. Each of these envoys had interviews with the Raja. Similarly, the chief of the Dutch Factory at Teganapatam carried rich presents to Shivaji in a pompous procession and secured an interview with him in July 1677. The French envoy Sieur Germain from Pondichery visited the Raja on the bank of the Coleroon river in the same month. It is a pity that no sketch of his person is available from these envoys.\n\nShivaji is described by Escaliot on the evidence of those who had seen him, to be of medium stature and of excellent proportion. He was active in exercise, possessed quick and piercing eyes, and was whiter than any of his people. He seemed to smile whenever he spoke. His was a light weight of 140 Ibs English or at most 160 Ibs Dutch at the time of his coronation in June 1674 at the age of 44 years. According to Thevenot, Shivaji was small in stature and tawny in complexion. \"His eyes are very sharp and fiery, showing a great deal of intelligence. He usually takes one meal a day, and is quite healthy.\"\n\nFather P. J. d'Orleans describes him as 'a little lively, restless man, but with all his impatience he wanted neither decision nor manly bearing.' Cosmo Da Guarda has fully confirmed the preceding remarks. He was not only quick in action but lively in carriage also, for with a clear and fair face, nature had given him the greatest perfections, specially the dark big eyes were so lively that they seemed to dart rays of fire. To these was added a quick, clear and acute intelligence.\n\nWe can form our own ideas on the physique and personality of Shivaji from the several paintings reproduced in these volumes. Manucci had the fullest opportunity to see Shivaji and talk to him in Raja Jaisingh's camp. The picture of Shivaji drawn for him by Pir Muhammad before 1688 should be the most reliable. The one from the Jaipur collection might be contemporary and would have been drawn by order of Raja Jaisingh. It has similarity of dress and features with the painting obtained in the Prince of Wales Museum in Bombay, but the latter has a dark coloured \"face which is incorrect on all the evidence produced in the preceding section. In this picture Shivaji is represented in the court dress, while the Jaipur one depicts him in a homely atmosphere. The portrait from the British Museum and its reproduction given in Orme's Fragments are also contemporary and true to life. The portrait given in Bernier's Travels is a copy of the one in Valentyn's Oud-en Nieuvo Cost-Indian ( 1724 A. D. ). The latter was obtained at the Mogul court in 1712. They all show him possessing a black beard and moustache, long hair at sides, a flowered chint toga with white ground, a purple silk scarf rich in gold embroidery thrown across the left shoulder, a beautifully worked sash, a Muslim paijama and a stylish pair of embroidered shoes. The gold pagri or turban with a jewelled aigrette, black plume and white pearls is peculiar to Shivaji. He can be easily identified by the shape of his turban. He is holding a very long straight sword, probably the well-known Bhavani in his left hand, and a patta or rapier in his right hand. Then on the left side a dagger is sticking out from the waist. One can easily mark out sharp eyes, a long aquiline nose, a neat and trimly cut beard, and small moustaches covering his upper lip. His face is fair, firm, and awe-inspiring.",

His principles were rigid to an extreme degree. His army was not burdened with families of officers and soldiers; no dancing girls or women, no drinking booths, no wine and other intoxicants were allowed in the camps. In all flying expeditions wherein some town was to be surprised, rapidity of movement was achieved by having no equipage and commissariat department. In the Surat expedition of 1664 we find Shivaji sitting under a tree without any tent. Even in the Karnatic expedition we are told that there were two tents, one for himself and another for his ministers. In his dress and meals he was abstemious to an extraordinary degree. He contented himself with only one meal a day. Thus he avoided all the Epicurean ways of life which enslaved many princes in every country.",

    "text": "He led a very austere, stern and sober life. Non-indulgence in drinks and other intoxicants was religiously observed by him. The ancient conquerors like Alexander and Caesar were addicted to hard drinking, even Napoleon was not free from this vice. The Mogul emperors from Baber to Shah Jahan were a prey to excessive drinks and narcotics. But here was a man far above the best generals of the ancient and contemporary world in this respect. He led the life of a saint, and abhorred dissipation of his energy in the pleasures of the flesh.\n\nWhile the Mogul Emperors like Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan indulged in sexual excesses and loved Mina Bazars, Shivaji showed an unusual control of his passions. Though he married several wives for political purposes, he led a pure and noble family life. Even in his youth he refused to accept the hand of the captive beauty of Kalyan. He did not allow women in his military camps and even punished his own son Sambhaji for transgressing moral bounds. A high standard of sexual morality was set before his officers, generals, soldiers and the people. Chivalry was always shown to the weaker sex. Women were not to be killed or made captives of war. Whenever they fell into the hands of his army, they were treated with respect and honourably kept in custody till they were ransomed by their relatives.\n\nA robber and a monster could not be religiously austere. There are numerous evidences of his deep devotional mind, superstitious awe of gods, genuine respect for saints, and a deep faith in the greatness of the classical epics. His mother was responsible for inspiring the young mind with religious ideals, for creating a love for Hindu classics and for sermons of the saints. We are told stories of his attendance at Tukaram's sermons at the risk of his life, of renunciation of the world after hearing a discourse of Tukaram, of self-hypnotization which made him his own oracle, of dedicating his life to the service of the god at Shri Shaila and of his resolve of committing suicide there. He built new temples, repaired old ones, established new gods and goddesses in them, donated large sums for their expenses, made pilgrimage to famous shrines, and revered the holy men of all religions – Hindu, Muslim and Christian.",

    "text": "In his expedition to Barcelore, he made it a point to visit Gokurn. In the Karnatic expedition many old shrines and sacred places were visited by him. Even while his life was in danger and he was pursued by Aurangzeb's soldiers and spies, he did not lose the opportunity of visiting the famous holy places of the Hindus – from Muttra to Jagannathpuri. Before his coronation, he is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to Chiplun and Pratapgarh, and to be engaged in worshipping the deities and in performing other devotional ceremonies for several days in succession. His charities to the Bhawani of Pratapgarh, to the famous Math of Ramdas at Chafal, to the Math of Mauni Baba at Patgaon, to the most sacred shrine of Shri Shaila, to Keshav Swami of Hyderabad, and to the Konheri Math are a few instances of the vast donations given by him for revival and development of the Hindu religion. He was consequently conferred the title of \"the Protector of cows and Brahmans\" which he richly deserves. For the preservation and development of religion he created a new department under a new minister called Panditrao, while for his family guidance he had distinguished scholars like Balam Bhat. There is an order of the Minister Panditrao Moreshwar dated 19 Feb. 1677 to the Deshmukh to give maintenance allowance to all the Brahmans of the districts of Phonda, Dicholi, Mandangad and Bhivgad whether they belonged to Desha or Karad, Chitpawans, Padye Brahmans and Jyotishis after holding an examination to test their learning. At the time of his coronation twenty-thousand Brahmans were present at Raigad. All of them were fed for several days and finally were presented gifts. Therefore he was rightly called the \"Protector of Brahmans.\" His devotion to saints and seers will be shown later on. It will suffice to remark here that he was the cause of renaissance and reformation in the Hindu religion and Hindu society.\n\nHowsoever paradoxical it might appear, it is true that Shivaji was a great mystic. In his early career he is said to have taken the resolve to renounce the world after hearing the sermon of saint Tukaram on renunciation. His mother and friends could not dissuade him from his intention to become a recluse. However, the advice of the saint and the entreaties of the mother induced the youth to give up his resolve. At the end of his career on the march to Madras he visited the magnificent temple of Shri Shaila. There in a fit of devotion and ecstasy he was ready to immolate himself on the altar of the god.",

    "text": "fits wherein he sought the advice of his guardian goddess Bhawani. The words spoken by him during these ecstatic fits were written down by his private secretary Balaji Avaji. In times of crises he used to follow this advice. On many critical occasions such as the invasions of Afzal Khan, Shaista Khan, Jaisingh, or even during his imprisonment at Agra, Shivaji had trances to find out the solution of his difficulties through these intuitions. It is possible that Shivaji might have been dissimulating to impress his colleagues and subjects with the idea that he was in communion with God whose will was being carried out through his instrumentality. The people came to believe that he was the chosen medium of God, His effective instrument to destroy the Mlechhas. The general impression of his devotions and trances, of his being a favourite medium of God if not His incarnation, won him the veneration of all his officers and subjects. They began to look upon him as a superman, as a favourite of fortune, a man of destiny who had been born to avenge and restore Hinduism.\n\n9. Shivaji a fatalist\nHis frequent appeal to God proves him to be a fatalist. He blindly followed the advice obtained in the fits of trance. For instance, he gave up himself and his forts to Jaisingh at the dictates of the so-called divine Bhavani. He went to Agra after he had been given an assurance in an ecstatic fit by this protecting goddess. It is stated that his intellect was clouded and he was highly dejected during his imprisonment at Agra, but the goddess again came to his rescue. Thus he has been shown to be working under the spell of a supernatural power by the writers of the Marathi chronicles. This version places him under the supremacy of a controlling power outside himself. A great conqueror like Shivaji was a master and not a slave of destiny. There is no mention in these Bhakars that he ever consulted astrologers on what he should do and should not do. On the other hand, there is European evidence that he was always cautious to studiously conceal his plans.",

    "text": "Here is the impartial testimony of Jonathan Scott. \"He planned his schemes wisely and executed them with steadiness. He consulted many on every point but acted according to that advice, which after weighing in his own mind he thought best applicable to his designs. No one was ever acquainted with his determinations but by the success of their execution.\" A remarkable confirmation comes from the pen of the historian Scott Waring: \" His talent as a soldier places him above the heroes of the East. His schemes comprehended the option of more than one success ; nor did the accomplishment of his object discover the extent of its advantage, until developed by subsequent acquisitions. His personal activity was astonishing ; no route, however, but had been traversed by his indefatigable patience. His troops, led by himself by the nearest and most secret paths, hardly knew the object of their attack, until they beheld the enemy they were to defeat, or the city they were to pillage. His passions were at his command; and he never betrayed, either by word or gesture, the movements of his mind. No emergency, however sudden, found him without recourse; no danger, however imminent appalled a mind accustomed to the greatest trials.\" Such a master-mind could not be a slave of fate or destiny. He was indeed a favourite child of destiny upon whom she invariably showered successes in all his adventures.\n\n10. Shivaji a diplomat\nHis diplomacy shines forth brilliantly at the early age of eighteen when through Mogul intercession he succeeded in securing the release of his father from the living coffin raised by the Bijapur king to smother him. Shivaji and his men outwitted the Mores, and captured Javli. He took fullest advantage of the death of the Bijapur king and the absence of Aurangzeb from the Deccan by allying himself with the Moguls against Bijapur and thereby winning their friendship. This step resulted in the invasion of Afzal Khan who was outrivalled in diplomacy and treacherous wiles by Shivaji. This 'mountain rat' was, through his superb genius, able to surprise the giant-like Shaista Khan in his bed, thoroughly rape Surat, sear the beard of wily Aurangzeb in his own capital by making a miraculous escape from Agra, tear off the veil of invincibility of the Mogul Empire, and finally eat away its vitals to such an extent that it was left a hollow carcass. His diplomacy reaches its climax in coming to terms with the Hindu Raja Jaisingh whom he wanted to win over to his cause and in wreaking his vengeance upon Bijapur which had stabbed Shivaji in the back by invading the Konkon. But he did not assist the Moguls to such an extent as to really weaken Bijapur and thus permit it to become a morsel to the Moguls. He showed his mailed fist in a velvet glove to the ruler of Bijapur and entered into a secret alliance with him against the invaders. After his release from Agra, he consolidated his kingdom and strengthened his forces with such rapidity that he was able to forcibly retake all the forts which he had been compelled to cede to the Moguls.",

In 1675 Shivaji coaxed Bahadur Khan for a truce, but after a few months when his object of conquering parts of the Konkon from Bijapuris had been realized, he summarily insulted the Mogul commander and the Emperor by rejecting the terms of the treaty. Soon after he again succeeded in making a truce with the Moguls and an alliance with Kutub Shah to conquer the Karnatic. His triumph in annexing the defunct Vijayanagar empire up to Rameshwaram to his kingdom and freeing his younger brother from the suzerainty of Bijapur, sheds glory on his statemanship. At the end of his career he was trying to capture Bijapur itself and in saving it from being absorbed by the Moguls. It was his incomparable statesmanship which was ever vigilant against the conquest of the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golconda by the Moguls. Through his diplomacy he secured financial help from these states for his wars against the Mogul armies. We must not lose sight of the fact that he maintained friendly relations with all the four European nations with whom he came into contact. Yet he defended his shipping, trade, port towns and his people from their onslaughts. The Portuguese, the English, the Dutch and the French were, as far as possible, well treated by Shivaji. He also tried to maintain a balance of power among them. For instance, he did not help the Dutch in capturing Bombay or Goa.\n\n11. He was unique as a constructive statesman\nHis organizing ability is manifest from the very start, since orderly administration went hand in hand with expansion. He took 20,000 Brahmans with him on his Karnatic expedition to organize and consolidate the newly conquered districts. The contemporary European writers have borne testimony to the remarkable skill shown by Shivaji in introducing improved methods of administration in the south. The Moslem administration was oppressive on account of the employment of illiterate, mercenary and foreign adventurers who were working as officers. He did away with all foreigners and uneducated people, but appointed only educated men as officers. He took effective steps to check peculation and corruption, and thus raised the standard of administration to such a high pitch that his subjects were contented, peaceful and prosperous. Whatever fort or territory fell into the hands of Shivaji, was immediately so strengthened and organized, that it could scarcely be recovered by his enemies. Very few instances can be quoted of the reconquest of forts by the Mogul or Adilshahi forces. This fact alone speaks volumes of his organizing capacity, vigilant administration, and faithful devotion of his people.",

    "text": "12. Shivaji as a commander\nShivaji stands foremost in the rank of the great commanders of the world. During the political career of 35 years from 1645 to 1680 there was no commander Hindu or Muslim of the Bijapur kingdom or of the most powerful and prosperous Empire of the Moguls who did not ultimately suffer defeat from Shivaji. Princes of the royal blood, Persians, premiers, Pathans and Rajput rulers like Jaswant Singh Rathor were all helpless against the resources of the Maratha commander. Shivaji stands foremost as an individual warrior, as an organizer and leader of armed forces. He possesses the highest military qualities of chivalrous courage, vigilant precaution and abundant resourcefulness. He took the fullest advantage of his victories and struck effective blows where they were most unexpected. He was always prompt in taking advantage of the enemy's vacillation, and in falling upon him unawares. He was master in the art of diplomacy. No politician, statesman or general of his time can stand comparison to him in this sphere. He never shirked from entering upon desperate attempts with utmost vigour and courage. He risked his life in a duel with Afzal Khan, in his remarkable exploit against Shaista Khan, or in visiting Surat and Prince Muazzam in disguise, and especially in placing himself in the wily clutches of Aurangzeb. Alexander and Frederick had the fortune to inherit armies trained by their fathers, and most of their distinguished generals had served in the army before their times. Here was an adventurer who had himself to create an army and train commanders in the shortest possible time. Scholars, clerks, peasants, rustics, wild tribes, in fact, men of all classes and grades of society were recruited in the army. We see the wonderful phenomenon of the creation of an army which inflicted defeats upon the Muslim warriors of the Deccan, the veteran forces of the Moguls, and the unflinching knights of the Rajput Princes. His claim to greatness lies in training hundreds of commanders and infusing an indomitable military spirit among the masses, so that after his death they could successfully fight a war of independence against the greatest power on earth in those days. They were all animated with religious fervour, courage, patriotism, discipline, self-confidence and hope of success - remarkable qualities inherited from this great leader of men. Contemporary Englishmen compared him with Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar. The Portuguese confirmed the same view. The Hindus compared him with their greatest heroes like Parashuram, Rama, Krishna, Bhima, Balaram, etc.",

His genius seemed to shine brilliantly amidst dangers, and he adopted original means to rescue himself or to destroy his enemies. The release of Shahji, the massacre of Mores, the assassination of Afzal Khan, his escape from Panhala, his ruse near Vishalgad, the rape of Surat, his escape from Agra, his flight through the Mogul Empire, are exploits which appear to be romances. These magnificently illustrate the versatility of his -unique genius. Dpuglas has well said : \" Like all animals that have been hunted ( as he, Shivaji had been ) he was wary and apprehensive to a degree and boundless in stratagem to meet sudden emergencies. In this science he had more in his little finger than Aurangzeb had in his whole body a light sleeper with one eye ever open. And for courage we have Orme's authority and he may have had it from a Jiving representative, that it was the boast of soldiers to have been 14 SHIVAJI THE GREAT -with Shivaji when he rushed sword in band into the midst of the- enemy.\" l 15. The character of Shivaji has been rightly protrayed by Swami Ramdas. His appreciation of the virtues of the young king was the reflection of the popular opinion. Therefore it embodies* the Hindu contemporary view. \" He is like a high mountain in determination. He is th&^ support of many people. He is unflinching in his ideals. He is rich in asceticism. The stream of his good deeds is ever flowing. How can the greatness of his virtues be compared to others ? He is a glorious, victorious, valorous, virtuous, charitable, diplomatic, and wise king. He is devoted to virtue, reason, charity and religion. He is humble, though he is omniscient. He is unwa\\ering, liberal* grave, heroic and ever-ready for action. This best of kings has outdone others in resourcefulness. He is the protector of the gods,, religion, cows and Brahmans. In his heart God has established Himself to inspire him. Scholars, Sadhus, poets, Brahmans devoted to sacrifices, and philosophers are supported by him. There is none like him as a protector of religion in this world. If the religion of Maharashtra is somewhat alive now, it is due to him.\" 16. The Lion of Maharashtra: Such was the saintly king who was spitefully and preversely called a ' Mountain Rat ' and an. unscrupulous villain by his enemies. He was undoubtedly a man of the mountain. His admirers style him the Lion of Maharashtra^ There is no doubt that he turned lambs into lions. The poor,, down-trodden, submissive, fatalistic masses of Maharashtra were galvanized by his magic touch and inspiring personality into a superhuman activity. They were transformed into finest soldiers*, dare-devils, consummate generals, constructive statesmen to match the mighty Moguls, the heroes of a hundred battles. Such was the magic transformation brought by this ' illiterate, uncultured,, despised, robber.' Shivaji can justly be called a magician, a superman whose deeds shall ever emblazen the pages of Indian., history. I. ] Douglas, Bombay and Western India. Vol. I, p, 368.",

    "text": "CHAPTER II Shivaji a Robber 1. European view: The Europeans did not realize that \"Shivaji was fighting for the freedom of the Hindus from the onslaughts of fanatic Muslim kings. They called him a marauder, a robber, a rover, a thief, a freebooter, a plunderer. Contemporary Englishmen condemn him as \" a pirate and universal robber that hath no regard to friend nor foe, God nor man.\" The republican Dutch were specially profuse in calling him a robber. In almost every letter reproduced m these volumes, Shivaji is addressed a robber or rover by them. He has been branded as a monster of atrocious cruelty, a merciless tyrant, an incendiary who indulged in an orgy of plunder and desolation of opulent cities and rich provinces. He was railed a devil, a devil's son, the son of damnation, a hell-dcg by the contemporary Muslims, and the Atila of Asia by the Portuguese. Even Col. Tod was so unsympathetic as to say that \" the Marathas were associations of vampires who drained the very life-blood wherever the scent of spoil attracted them. ' Sir John Seeley bluntly wrote that ' in the Maratha movement there never was anything elevated or patriotic, but that it continued from the first to be an organisation of plunder. 1 V. Smith, a distinguished English historian who spent his whole active career in India, has nothing better to say. \" The Maratha independent rule A* as the rule of professed robbers. In short, the Marathas were robbers by profession.\" Sir J. Sarkar, the learned historian of Shivaji, writes that the object of Shivaji's military enterprises was mere plunder. 2. Plunder ifter an ultimatum: It is asserted that Shivaji freely indulged in lawless plunder and rapine, indiscriminate 16 SHIVAJI THE GREAT destruction, cruelty and tyranny. The plunder of Surat, Rajapur^ Karwar, Hubli, Chhapra, etc, left heaps of ashes and ruins of desolation. We have heart-rending scenes of the destruction of many such places. These volumes provide numerous instances of the horrible scenes of plunder and arson. But we should not forget the circumstances which led to the fiercest retribution. Shiva did not indulge in indiscriminate plunder, but his loot was regulated by humane laws. Every time that the Maratha forces approached Surat, the- authorities and the people \\\\ere given ultimatums to send an adequate present to the invading army within a certain time,, otherwise the city >\\\\ould be given over to the fire and sword. Even in the case of Karwar, Vmgurla, Hubli such ultimatums are unequivocally mentioned. As early as May 1663 the English factors write that \" all the way as he goes along, he gives his Qaul, premising them that neither he nor his souldiers shall in the least do any wrong to any body that takes his Qaul ; which promise he hitherto hath kept\" * Thus plunder was resorted to in places where ransom was not paid. The Dutch while condemning his tyranny, have admitted that he gave an opportunity to the people to ransom their places, *' Nearly all the places he marched through, were set on fire by him if they did not pay the money he demanded and that so hastily that parents could not save their children from the flames.\" * 3. Rules re. Plunder: It was a recognized law of Shivaji that cows, calves, women, children, Brahmans and priests of all religions, were not to be molested in plundering a town. All houses of God, like temples, mosques and churches, even orphanages and convents were sacred, and consequently, exempt from plunder. A millionaire escaped in the disguise of a woman from Karanja as he Jcnew that he would not be molested or questioned in that dress.",

    "section": "Shivaji Compared with Other Conquerors",
    "text": "I, the author of Shahnama, compare Shivaji's generosity in patronizing scholars and saints with that of Mahmud.  While Mahmud wept at his death over lost wealth, Shivaji, despite full treasuries, remained unconcerned, focused on spiritual contemplation.  He seemed more a renunciate than a conquering leader.\n\nShivaji is contrasted with Changez Khan, the \"scourge of God,\" who massacred millions.  Historians like Elphinstone called the Mongol invasion the greatest calamity since the deluge. Shivaji's mercy stands in stark contrast to such conquerors.\n\nCompared with Timur, another Turko-Mongol invader of India, Shivaji again appears merciful. Timur slaughtered inhabitants from Hindukush to Samana, enslaved thousands of Hindus, and mercilessly ordered them executed before his battle with Delhi forces.  Delhi was given to plunder and conflagration, with towers built from the heads of Hindus.  Elphinstone called Timur a \"wily, violent, and perfidious politician.\" Shivaji did not enslave people, even Muslims, though it was customary at the time. He aimed to liberate his people from foreign rule and slavery.\n\nFinally, Shivaji is compared to Nadirshah, who subjected Delhi to fire, sword, and plunder after a few of his soldiers were murdered.  Thirty thousand or more were killed.  Shivaji, however, showed mercy in a similar situation. When a Surat governor's ambassador attempted to assassinate him, Shivaji's guards intervened.  Though the Marathas wanted revenge, Shivaji stopped the massacre of captives and took no further action against the governor or Surat.\n\nUnlike the Asiatic conquerors who indulged in plunder, oppression, tyranny, slavery, and forced conversions to impose foreign rule, Shivaji was a patriotic champion of his people's freedom and independence.  There is no comparison between a liberator and a destroyer of liberties, a slave-driver and a liberator, a fanatic Ghazi and a respecter of all religions.",

    "text": "English factors in India saw Shivaji as a \"grand rebel\" disrupting the Deccan.  While Bijapur forces were idle, Shivaji devastated their kingdom.  Surat letters reported his defeat, imprisonment, and escape.  He was a rebel against the Muslim monarchies, aiming to restore his country's freedom and independence. He ranks with liberators like Washington, Garibaldi, De Valera, and Lenin, who fought against foreign or despotic rule. Shivaji rebelled against political oppression, religious intolerance, social injustice, and cultural suppression. He freed Hindus from foreign rule.\n\nEuropean settlers, focused on their own struggles for religious liberty and independence, failed to appreciate Shivaji's motives. Abbe Carre, however, recognized him as a great warrior comparable to Gustavus Adolphus, admired even by his enemies for his clemency and goodness.  While European powers fought for their faiths, Aurangzeb conquered the Deccan monarchies and executed Sambhaji, believing Hindus would submit to Islam. He underestimated Shivaji's influence, who had prepared many to defend Hinduism and overthrow Islamic rule.\n\nRajaram's army was instructed to attack Muslims in small groups, mirroring Rama's tactics.  The goal was to protect Rajaram's kingdom at any cost. Shivaji transformed the Marathas from a downtrodden people into a conquering nation, willing to die for their religion and country.  He united warring Hindu castes into a nation striving for independence. His work became evident after his death, during a national emergency, as Maratha soldiers were called \"Shivajis.\"",

    "text": "Shahji was anxiously watching and praying for the success of the young dreamer. He had vowed to offer a rich gift to the famous god of Jejuri if his son succeeded in establishing Swaraj. After the murder of Afzal Khan, Shahji began to advance with his troops to assist his son in capturing Bijapur, but the scheme was given up when the old warrior learnt the withdrawal of the Maratha forces. Thus Swaraj and Hindvi Swaraj were ideals before Shivaji from 1645. Nothing succeeds like success. In the beginning, it was a day-dream impossible to be realized. Hence all important persons kept themselves aloof from the arch rebel. But as the dream began to be transformed into a reality, more and more Maratha nobles joined him in this holy cause. Now it is manifest that Shivaji for the first time used the magnetic words \"Hindvi Swaraj\" which have become popular since then. It should be noted that it was not merely Swaraj for Maharashtra, not even Swaraj for the Hindus, but an All-Indian Swaraj. He was against foreign rule and religious persecutions. He even tried to win the Indian Muslims to his cause and made an alliance against the foreign Pathans, Moguls, and Persians. As the Muslim rulers were fanatically engaged in the unholy work of forcible conversions, he was ultimately led to subvert Muslim rule in India and establish Hindu Swaraj in the whole of India. A few evidences are culled below to manifest his noble ideal of Indian independence.\n1. His ambitious programme of conquest is significantly indicated by the motto engraved on his royal seal. It was fixed to each important document, and reminded him and the world the ultimate ideal of the hero. \"This seal of Shivaji, son of Shahji, rules for the welfare of the people. This world-worshipped seal is desirous of growing like the new moon into a full moon.\" This seal can be traced to 1639. Shivaji was merely a boy of 9 years. The ideal was probably put before him by his astute father.\n2. Even in 1665, the letter written by Shivaji to Mirza Raja Jaismgh, puts forth his whole programme and ideal in unequivocal terms.\n3. His conquest of Southern India as far as Tanjore and covering a large part of the Vijayanagar Empire, took him nearer his ideal.\n4. His system of veiled subsidies from the two Muslim Kingdoms of the Deccan, was the recognition of his suzerainty over them. In outward form and in name, it may be a gift made by a friendly power to an aggressor to cease from hostility and also to keep away others from aggression. It was really a tribute, and it has been so called by the Maratha chronicles.\n5. The system of Chauth was a powerful instrument to impose the suzerainty of the Marathas on non-Maratha territories. The successors of Shivaji widely used this instrument of augmenting the empire by bringing in chauth paying protectorates.\n6. Shiva followed the subtle policy of exciting the Rajputs against Aurangzeb for becoming independent. In his letter to Jaisingh he pleaded for a union of northern and southern Hindu rulers, for bringing about the overthrow of the Muslim domination. In pursuit of this policy, he advised Chhatrasal to return to his country and begin the fight for independence in the heart of the empire. This policy was finally crowned with success, since the Bundhelas dealt severe blows to the empire and dissipated its resources.\n7. Shivaji went to seek the blessing of saint Parmanand for the conquest of Rajapur. He offered the saint in gift a village for every fort conquered by him, but the Swami declined to accept the offer and demanded villages in the unconquered provinces of Hyderabad, Berar, Khandesh, Baglan, Malwa and Gujerat. The Maharaja understood the implication of the demand. \"All these provinces are now bestowed upon me,\" said he, \"through your blessing these will be annexed by me.\" A similar offer is said to have been made by Samarth Ramdas. Thus saints encouraged Shivaji in strengthening his imperial idea of conquering the whole of India.",

    "text": "We have H. Gary's evidence that \"Shivaji had vowed to his pagod (Goddess Bhavani) never to sheath his sword till he had reached Delhi and shut up Aurangshah in it.\"\nDr. Fryer too has fortunately recorded the views of Shivaji. 'He tells them, his compeers the Duccanees, he is their champion, and that none of them besides himself has the heart to stand up for their country: and therefore if he chance now and then to rob them, it is but to reward himself and soldiers for his and their pains in endeavouring to free them from a more unnatural slavery.'\nThe 91 Q. Chronicle informs us that during his conversation with Tana Shah, Shivaji observed that if the two kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur assisted him, he would conquer for them the whole of Hindustan.\nThe Chitragupta Chronicle records that Shivaji expressed regret to his son Sambhaji that only one object of his remained unfulfilled and that was the conquest of Delhi by making Aurangzeb absolutely helpless. However, time was to show how far his goddess Amba would favour this design.\nOne more testimony is to be found in Shivaji's letter to Maloji Ghorpade. The latter was persuaded to leave the cause of Bijapur, and join Shivaji and Kutubshah in stamping out foreign rule from the Deccan. \"It is not a good thing that the Pathans came to possess the Padshahi of the Deccan. If they become powerful, they will destroy the families of the Deccani nobles one after the other. They will not allow any one to live. The Pathans should be destroyed, and steps should be taken to keep the Padshahi of the Deccan in the hands of the Deccanees. After an agreement was accepted by both sides, we also thought that whatever Marathas are of our caste, they should be taken into the confederacy and should be introduced to Kutubshah.\"\nThe last will and testament of Shivaji is significant in showing his ideals and ambitious programmes. He exhorted his officers to put forth all their energy for the extension of the Maratha kingdom to the further most confines of India and for capturing the throne of Delhi; to free the sacred Ganges from the yoke of the Muslims; to cross the Indus and implant the Maratha flag in the trans-Indus Himalayas. \"It was my intense desire to conquer the whole of India, but I have not fulfilled it on account of my premature death. You should all attempt to realize this high ideal. The kingdom founded by me should be consolidated and extended \"with more heroism than I have ever exhibited.\"",

He is said to have unscrupulously used all sorts of treachery, duplicity, intrigue, guiles, and frauds to confound and kill his enemies. Even in April 1660, Shivaji is described by the Dutch as a cunning fox who stands ready with all his devilish practices and cunning to buy Siddi Jauhar. The English depict him as one of the most politic princes of those eastern parts. Escaliot describes him as distrustful, secret, subtle, cruel, and perfidious. Instead of condemning Shiva, we should admire him that his sharp genius was ever ready to discover new methods to humiliate and embarrass his enemies and to win as much by diplomacy as by war. All great conquerors had recourse to intrigue and treachery according to the necessities of the moment. Smith concludes that Akbar felt no scruples about removing his enemies by assassination. He adds that the tortuous diplomacy and perfidious action which on several occasions marked the emperor's political proceedings, should not excite surprise or draw excessive censure. Aurangzeb was no less perfidious than Shivaji. He had tracked his unfaltering way through a cloud of mysterious intrigues and a sea of blood to the throne. In him were combined the venomous craft of Louis XI with the merciless ferocity of Caesar Borgia. The Bijapur rulers did not spare clandestine means to do away with their enemies. Napoleon took pride in saying that he knew when to exchange the lion-skin for that of the fox. Though Shiva never shrank from using subtle means to fulfill his ends, it has been proved that he did not practice perfidy in the disposal of the Mores of Javli and Baji Ghorpade of Mudhol. The assassination of Afzal Khan has remained a live issue even up till now. Kincaid, the latest biographer of Shiva, has absolved him from treachery in his recent book 'The Grand Rebel.' I have critically examined the evidence available on the murder of Afzal Khan to throw more light on the controversy.",

    "text": "Chanakya, the Indian Machiavelli, taught numerous means of secretly murdering enemies. We need not recoil at the use of treachery but rather admire Shivaji for outsmarting his foe and ending the war advantageously. His act is justified historically and politically.\n\nTreachery was common: Afzal Khan treacherously murdered the Nayak of Sira after inviting him to a conference. Ali Adil Shah murdered Bahlol Khan treacherously. He and the queen-mother murdered several ministers by treachery up to 1658. Khawas Khan was murdered by Bahlol in 1675 through treachery. Aurangzeb treacherously executed his brothers and relatives. Even Mirza Raja Jaisingh was ready to use treachery against Shivaji. Scores of officers were poisoned by the Mogul Emperors and their Governors. Even Jai Singh was poisoned by Aurangzeb.  Numerous other examples exist, such as the Nizamshahi king murdering Shivaji's grandfather, Malik Ambar's son murdering his master, Alla-ud-din Khilji murdering his uncle and capturing the ruler of Chittor, or Sher Shah capturing Rohitas Fort and conquering Jodhpur.\n\nIn such a climate of political immorality, it's hard to believe Afzal Khan intended no harm to Shivaji. If he was truly so naive as to fall into Shivaji's trap, so much the worse for him. The Maratha rebel is to be admired for his successful stratagems. It is the height of diplomacy and machination that he lulled the enemy into a sense of security and then annihilated him. Shivaji was convinced the general was plotting his death. Therefore, he came prepared to turn treachery against his foe. All preparations were in self-defense.  Khan's death was preventive, not premeditated and treacherous murder. Suppressing Shivaji was considered extremely difficult by Bijapur nobles. Afzal Khan alone volunteered to bring Shivaji alive or dead, but he was doubtful of success. According to Abbé Carre, he secluded himself for days to indulge in worldly pleasures, culminating in an incredible tragedy. Fearing his wives might be taken by others after his death, he killed 120 of them. The Muslim world wasn't stunned by this, which reflects the unlimited power enjoyed by nobles. Instead of punishment, he was honored and given command against Shivaji.  Afzal Khan was determined to conquer or die. He wanted to capture Shivaji diplomatically, but was outwitted.",

If capture wasn't possible, he was to be killed. The Shiva Bharata details the Khan's treacherous plan.\n(3) Sabhasad mentions thrice that Shivaji was to be captured alive and that he was informed of the Queen and General's plans by friendly Bijapur nobles.\n(4) The firman to Kanhoji Jedhe mentions exterminating Shivaji and his followers. Shivaji confirmed this information through his envoy to the Khan's camp.\n(5) A Dutch document corroborates these facts, stating that Afzal Khan was ordered to destroy Shivaji by force or treachery.\n\nShivaji outwitted the Khan in this diplomatic war. Though described as treacherous murder, it was preventive, or self-defense, permitted by ancient and modern laws and Hindu polity.\n\nAfzal Khan was eager for an interview, believing he could easily overpower the young Shivaji. He was warned by astrologers but ignored them. Ill omens during the march to Javli were also disregarded.  He believed he could capture Javli without a fight and seize Shivaji. He accepted Shivaji's terms, convinced by the latter's diplomacy that he would submit. Shivaji, unwilling to be murdered at Wai, planned to trap Afzal and his army in the Javli valley, where his men could ambush them. He succeeded by superior diplomacy, cutting roads through the forests and treating them royally.  A feast was given, and a beautiful Mandap erected for the reception. The Khan, satisfied that no treachery was planned, entered with two attendants, while ten bodyguards were stationed outside.  He initially advanced with 1,000-1,500 men but was told this violated the agreement. They were left on the slope of Pratapgarh, a bowshot away, or stationed at various points along the way (according to Chitnis). He had taken precautions for his safety and a potential coup on the castle.",

But he didn't strike the first blow. The Khan, impatient, wanted to end the war by killing Shivaji. Hindu writers agree Afzal Khan initiated the attack, while Muslim historians and European followers blame Shivaji. No Muslim present survived, so the impression of Afzal Khan's treacherous murder spread.  Afzal Khan seemingly took no precautions, wearing no armor, and his attendants weren't instructed to be ready.  He was overconfident in his ability to kill Shivaji and capture the fort with 1,500 bodyguards, neglecting further precautions. His army was resting, making them vulnerable to the Maratha attack.  Shivaji prepared for defense and the enemy's destruction, even receiving Bhawani's blessing for killing Afzal Khan if attacked. The Khan, proud of his strength, underestimated Shivaji and the Maratha forces hidden in the forests. If Shivaji simply wanted to murder the Khan, he could have done so through hidden men in the Mandap, mentioned in the Chitragupta Ch. Why risk his life in a doubtful interview? He was prepared for the worst, not for treacherous murder.\n\nJ. Kareena records that Afzal Khan grabbed Shivaji's neck and stabbed him. Shivaji retaliated with his tiger-claws, opening his bowels. Similar accounts are found in the Sh. Bharata and Sabhasad Chronicle. The use of tiger-claws is doubtful; he likely used a dagger and sword.",

Extent of Shivaji's Empire: A glance at the map opposite p. 265 of Vol. II will show that Shivaji's kingdom included the following parts:\n(A) Swaraj-\n(1) A long strip of territory on the Western coast of India from the Northern confines of Dharampur or Ramnagar State to the boundary of Bednur with the exception of Bombay, Janjira and the Portuguese possessions.\n(2) All the inland country including Baglan, part of Nasik, the districts of Thana, Kalyan, Kolaba, Poona, Satara, Gadag, Chitaldurg, Balapur, Kolar, Uskota, Vellore, Ginji, Arni, Bangalore and Shrirangpatam.\n(3) On the Eastern or Coromandal Coast his sway extended over Porto Novo, Negapatam, Pondichery, and the territory of Tanjore, while the ruler of Madura acknowledged his suzerainty by paying tribute. Thus his kingdom bounded by the Tapti in the North extended to Rameshwaram in the South, while from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal it included the parts named above.\n(B) Chauth-paying territories: He used to collect the chauth from parts of Khandesh, Berars and the Central Provinces. The extent of this territory varied from time to time and the sums collected too depended upon the force used by his expeditionary army. Aurangzeb did not recognise his right of collecting the chauth. Therefore Shivaji gave Qauls (Written assurances of immunity from Maratha attacks) to the Mogul subjects who agreed to directly pay this contribution to him.\n(C) Tribute-paying states: Then the states of Bijapur and Golconda used to pay him a tribute, but these were in no way feudatories of Shivaji or in any way subject to him. The tribute was really a friendly contribution for keeping the Moguls at an arm's length and for securing immunity from the predatory expeditions of the Marathas in these kingdoms. An indefinite and indefinable overlordship extended over all those parts of the Mogul Empire and the Deccan states which paid chauth, or a tribute to Shivaji.",

His experience was very much limited and he was bitterly prejudiced against the Grand Rebel. One can hardly believe that the Brahman officers tore the flesh of their brother officers with red-hot pincers and applied other tortures to extract money from them. It is possible that some officers guilty of corruption-extortion might have been tortured to extract confession. Otherwise Shivaji did not oppress Brahmans. These were under his special protection, (i) He was therefore given the title of the \"Protector of Cows and Brahmans.\" (ii) He was adored as an Avatar of Vishnu who had taken birth for uprooting the barbarians and for establishing the Hindu religion. (iii) He never molested Brahmans even in his looting expeditions. (iv) At the time of Afzal Khan's murder when Shivaji was attacked by the Brahmin envoy, he refused to use his weapons against him and asked him not to take advantage of his position as a Brahman. (v) Docs. 24 of 1671 and 30 of 1674 in Rajwade VIII bring out the principle of immunity of Brahmans from death. Fryer himself admits that Brahmans alone were put in places of trust and authority. The whole hierarchy of civil officers was composed of Brahmans. Hence it is incredible that these very men would use inhuman means of torture against men of their own class. While Fryer condemns the Maratha administration, he frankly admits that it was not an exception to the general rule. All contemporary governments were of the same type.",

    "text": "Prevalent in the Bijapur state was a system where governors acted like kings, committing robbery, murder, and devastation, only to be praised at court if they bribed the king. This corruption was deeply rooted and the king was unable to prevent it. Travelers like Tavernier, Bernier, and Manucci condemned the Mughal administration, highlighting the superiority of Shivaji's administration due to his significant reforms.\n\nShivaji addressed maladministration by avoiding hereditary jagirs and posts, while respecting existing Watans and religious endowments. He reduced the powers of fief-holders, only granting hereditary positions in exceptional cases for meritorious service. Examples include Krishnaji Bhaskar for Afzal Khan's assassination, Babaji Baji for his father Baji Prabhu's bravery, the Kolis for locating Sindhudurg fort, Ramchandra Pant for conquering Purandar, Balaji Avaji for secretarial service, Koyaji Bandhal for Shaista Khan's surprise, Vyankoji and Dipabai with their minister Raghunathpant in the Karnatic, Brahmans at Karnatic temples, Hambirrao Mohite, Santaji and Bahirji Ghorpade, and Ramdasi Maths. These instances were few over 35 years, proving they were exceptions. Notably, prominent figures like Netaji Palkar and Prataprao Gujar did not receive hereditary lands.\n\nRamchandra Pant argued against new Inams, stating they lead to injustice and potential loss of the entire kingdom. He advised against confiscating existing Vrittis, even in cases of crimes, emphasizing adherence to Shastras. His primary reasons for opposing Vrittis were reduced public revenue, increased taxes, and oppression of the people.\n\nShivaji's officers displayed remarkable devotion despite the absence of hereditary rewards, attracted by his charm, generosity, bravery, and leadership. He personally recruited and dismissed officers, fostering direct responsibility and loyalty. Unlike Aurangzeb's atmosphere of mistrust, Shivaji inspired unwavering faithfulness. He exploited the venality of Mughal and Bijapur generals, while his own officers remained incorruptible.\n\nFurther administrative improvements included frequent officer transfers, inspection tours by Shivaji and his ministers, creating a code of rules, uniting officer families through marriages, employing all classes in state service, Shivaji's exemplary life of discipline and dedication, fostering responsibility and security of tenure, and high salaries to prevent corruption.",

After the death of Gangaji Vaknis, the post was filled by Dattaji Pant, another hero of the romantic flight. He was reckoned as one of the councillors. The royal household troops were put under the able command of Ragho Mitra, the third hero of the thrilling escape. Nilo Sondev was succeeded in his office in 1672 by his two sons Naro Pant and Ramchandra Pant, but the latter alone who was considered to be a thousand times better than his father, was entrusted with the work of Muzumdar. Sometime before the coronation the post of Dharmadhikari was also created. It was filled by the two brothers Raghunath Bhat and Balam Bhat. The number of the councillors was augmented after the coronation by the addition of the two ministers of Vyankoji Raje. They were Raghunath Narayan and Janardhan Narayan. There is no information as to the offices filled by them. They might be ministers without portfolios, as they have been called Sarkarkuns. Shivaji changed their Persian titles to Sanskrit and specified the duties of the eight councillors and other departmental heads. Thus a portfolio system was introduced on the basis of the Sukraniti. The names and duties were largely adopted from Sukra's Polity. In the king's cabinet the Chief Priest and the Chief Justice are included by Sukra and the same was done by the crowned king of the Marathas. These Sanskrit names, however, did not become popular, so that even in the official letters written after the coronation the old names and the old Persian era persisted. The Chronicles make special mention of the council meetings at such crises as the invasions of Afzal Khan, Shaista Khan and Jaisingh, and during Shiva’s imprisonment at Agra. Therefore the council did not come into existence after the coronation. Shivaji used to consult his ministers from the beginning of his rule. It has been seen that the executive council had been growing up from time to time with the extension of administrative needs. It assumed its final form of Eight Councillors (Ashta Pradhans) at the coronation. The old and new names of the posts and the names of their occupants are given in a tabular form.",

The Sachiv (Accountant General) should see that all royal letters were properly drafted. He had to check the accounts of the Mahals and Parganas. He had to put his seal on all royal papers as a sign of his approval. He was also to serve in war and lead armies. The Mantri (Political Secretary) was to conduct the political and diplomatic affairs of the kingdom. The invitation and intelligence departments were under him. He was also to serve in war. His seal was to be put on official documents. The Sumant (Foreign Secretary) was in charge of foreign affairs, war and peace. He was to receive and entertain foreign envoys and maintain the dignity of the state abroad. He was also to serve in war and put his seal on state documents. The Panditrao (the Royal Priest) was to have jurisdiction over all religious affairs. He was to honour scholars, Brahmans and religious men. He was to get all religious ceremonies performed in due time. He was to put his sign of approval on all papers relating to custom, conduct and penances. The Nyayadhish (the Chief Justice) was to righteously decide all disputes about occupations and lands with the co-operation of officers and learned Brahmans. He was to put his signature on all judgment papers. It is worth noting that all ministers were Brahmans, only the Chief Commander was Maratha by caste. But all of them except the last two had to take the command of armies. Besides three of the ministers were Governors in charge of divisions, while the provinces or Subas were under Subedars. These ministers fully enjoyed the confidence of their master and were continued in their posts up to the end of his regime. It speaks volumes of the genius, patience, spirit of compromise of Shivaji that he should have continued the same officers on the same posts for years together. In case of proved inability, he removed the ministers as the Peshwa Mahadeva and the commander-in-chief Netaji Palkar, otherwise Moro Trimbak continued Peshwa for eighteen years up to the death of the great king. No change was made in the chief command of the army except on account of death. There was no re-shuffling of the cabinet from the coronation up to the death of the illustrious king. Secondly, he did not make these offices hereditary as they were done afterwards by the Peshwas. Thirdly, these officers were not given any jagirs, but salaries were paid to them in cash from the treasury. They had nothing to do with revenue collection and could not oppress the ryots on account of their ministerial positions. Justice Rsbade has rightly stated that “none of the great men, who distinguished themselves in Shivaji’s time, were able to hand over to their descendants large landed estates.” Fourthly, each of them was severally responsible for his portfolio, so far so that his secretary had the right to carry on the administration in the name of the chief. Fifthly, they were jointly responsible in carrying on the administration. All important papers required the signatures of the ministers in charge of the civil administration, such as the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Financial Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Foreign Minister. The judicial decisions were signed by the Chief Justice alone and the Ecclesiastical Decisions by the Minister in charge of the department, while the army-papers were submitted to the chief commander. The Law Code (Qanunzfibta) and the Chitragupta Chronicle both lay down this rule of the circulation of important papers and the approval or disapproval of the five ministers. We have no papers on the working of the cabinet, but the ministers and in their absence the secretaries must have been meeting frequently to discuss important matters, so that they could put their seals of approval on them. That the treaty with the English was signed by all the ministers, has been recorded by their envoy, Mr. Oxenden. Grants bore the seals of the Raja and the Prime Minister.",

    "text": "I. Evils of the Moilim Military tyiten\nThe administrative reforms secured peace, prosperity, and progress in the Maratha Swaraj. These could be maintained only by a most efficient military organization. The feudal armies of the Deccan Sultans and the Mogul Emperors were expensive and inefficient instruments of warfare. In these volumes we have sufficient side-lights on the evils of the contemporary military systems.\n(i) The feudal lords were given extensive territories for the upkeep of the armies. Being anxious to enrich themselves in the shortest possible time, they resorted to unbridled terror, oppression and exploitation. The ryots were left to their minions who like vultures ate away the possessions of the poor.\n(ii) The nobles were often disloyal to the ruler and secretly allied themselves with his enemies. The instances of Rustam Zaman, Bahlol Khan, Bahadur Khan and others joining Shivaji are frequently found.\n(iii) These lords were mutually fighting and even secretly murdering each other. The assassination of Jadhavrao, Khaw\nas Khan, Murari Pandit* Siddi Jauhar, Ikhlas Khan, Sher Khan, and another Khawas Khan. Khizar Khan, are some of the instances mentioned in the volumes.\n(iv) The feudal armies did not consist of properly trained and equipped soldiers, but these were levies of haphazardly recruited soldiers, with whatever arms and horses were possessed by them. Such a militia poorly clad, ill armed, badly trained, and full of mercenary spirit did not fight for the defence of the flag, religion or country. These soldiers could be no match to a trained army figbtinff for religious and national ideals.\n(v) *fhe feudal armies were officered by untrained men who were not actuated by bigfaer motives. They wanted to saire their SHIVAji THE GREAT skins. Bernier ' rightly observed that the Mogul Omrahs were mostly adventurers from different nations, and persons of low descent, some having been originally slaves. The king was surrounded by slaves, ignorant and brutal; parasites raised from the dregs of society ; strangers to loyalty and patriotism ; full of insufferable pride, and de$titute of courage, of honour and of decency. Hence these could be easily bought off or defeated by the national armies of Shivaji.\n( vi ) Dependence upon cavalry and elephants was the mainstay of the system. Both these arms were useless in the rugged and mountainous regions of Maharashtra.\n( vii ) The extension of the Jagir system and its concomitant evil of defrauding the state in the strength of the militia to be kept by each mansabdar, adversely affected the efficiency of the army.\n( viii ) An immense amount of money was needed for an incredibly large army which was maintained for keeping the people m subjection. Then an enormous sum was required to maintain the splendour of the royal court. The people were subjected to an indescribable oppression. In the words of Bernier \" in the Indies the gold and silver disappear in consequence of the tyranny of Timariots, Governors, and Revenue contractors a tyranny which even the monarch, if so disposed, has no means of controlling in provinces not contiguous to his capital a tyranny often so excessive as to deprive the peasant and artisan of the necessaries of life, and leave them to die of misery and exhaustion * a tyranny owing to which those wretched people either have not children at all, or 'have them only to endure the agonies of starvation, and to die at a tender age-a tyranny, in fine, that drives the cultivator of the soil from his wretched home to some neighbouring state.\"\n( ix ) The Mogul camps were slowly moving cities with afr the encumbrances of women, children, beasts of burden, and a numerous host ol servants to look to the comforts of the men oC afl ranks from the officers down to the ordinary trooper. Vivid descriptions of the march of the armies are given by Tavernier, Bernier, Manucci, and others. An interesting account of the march of Shaista Khan's army and its plight by the guerilla tactics of the Maratha army bring out the weakness of the Mogul and the strength of the Maratha army. Small kingdoms could be easily conquered by sheer numbers and inexhaustible resources of the Mogul empire. Shivaji had the extraordinary genius to realize the ills of the Muslim armies and to take full advantage of these by his novel and effective military organization. The founder of the Maratha Empire fully realized the serious defects of the feudal levies and therefore he overhauled the whole military machine. His army consisted of the royal guards, cavalry, infantry, militia, elephant corps and camel corps. The forts formed a most crucial factor of the strength of the military machine. Lastly, the navy and merchant marine were added to the land forces. Each one of these will be separately taken up to give a detailed view of the working and of the reforms introduced by Shivaji, the great military genius of the time.",

    "text": "2. Royal Bodyguards\nShivaji soon realized the importance of possessing special troops to protect his body and to be of prime support to him in times of emergency. For this purpose only those who were brave, strong, obedient and faithful were personally selected by him. While inspecting the country, the army or the forts, he was on the lookout for such men that their very name would inspire terror and admiration in the army and the people. These tried men were to be employed for the protection of the Raja's person and as guards at the gates of the royal residence and court They formed a fourfold force of musketeers, spearm\nen, light-armed men, and artillery men in both the cavalry and infantry. The vital importance of this force is pointed out by Ramachandra. in his Polity. Very strict discipline was to be kept among these troops. No weakness was to be shown in punishing indiscipline and treachery in them oat of any consideration. There were six different units of these Patak$ ( Body-guards ) -consisting of 100, 60 A and 60 B, 40, 30, and 20 soldiers acd known by these numbers. The special force consisted of two thousand to two thousand and five hundred men. They were given by the government uniforms consisting of embroidered turbans for the head, jackets of broadcloth for the body, two gold bracelets for the hands, gold and silver rings to be put on their sword-sheaths, silver-rings for the guns and spears, and a pair of ear-rings for themselves. These were put under the charge of Jumledars and a Kazan officer. Whenever the Raja went out, they used to march on four sides of his palanquin or horse. We have a view of these troops in the picture given by Manucci. The Raja is shown on the march. His personal troops are clothed in a uniform of long togas stuffed with cotton. Each one of them has got a Tilak on the forehead probably to signify his readiness to die for the king. The extraordinary alertness and bravery of one of his bodyguards was shown in cutting off the hand and head of the assassin at Surat when he made a dastardly attack on the Raja. Another view of the march of the army is given by the Rajapur Knglishmen when they waited to meet Shivaji on the way. They saw abundance of horse and foot and 150 palanquins carrying him and his officers. It is a pity that the English factors were so much engrossed in their immediate business that they did not at all Describe the Maratha army. A Dutch factor who had the honour of several times speaking with the Golconda Sultan, was an eye-witness of the visit of Shivaji to that city in August 1676. The Raja is said to retire in z. litter embellished on every side with sheets of massive gold rtccompained by eight outriders and 30 chaise-bearers. This Dutchman records that Shivaji had no doubt of the fidelity of his troops and especially of his bodyguards. He testifies to the discipline in the Maratha army in these words : \" Whilst they ( the Sultan and Shivaji ) were thus talking, the place was surrounded by 6,000 cavalry who approached so silently that the buzzing of a fly could have been heard. It was thus that th* brigand made known to the world that like a second Masaniello he was as much beloved as respected by his subjects.\"",

State Cavalry and Militia\nThe cavalry was of two tjpes: (1) the Paga belonging to the state, and (2) the Siledars or horsemen possessing their o^n horses as well as arms, but accepting service under the state for some time. The state-cavalry was organized in units of 25 troopers ^bo were under an expert Maratba Hawaldar. Each unit had a water-carrier and a farrier attached to it. Five Hawalas made up a Jumla and its officer was a Jumledar. Ten Jumlas consisting of 1,250 troopers made up a Hazar ( Thousand ). The commander was styled a Hazari. His office-establishment consisted of a Brahman Mujumdar, a Matatba Secretary, a Prabhu Jamnis and a number of cleiks. A group of five Hazaris was commanded by a Panch Hazari, an officer possessing the title of Five Thousand. Three civil officers of the above- mentioned titles were also attached to him. All the Panch Hazari generals were directly under the Sarnaubat or Ccmmander-in-Chief. Each battalion of 1,250 horsemen had newswriters or Vaknis ( Vaq'navis ), couriers and spies. AH these were appointed by the Commander-in-Chief. The chief officer of the Detectives was the famous Bahirji Jadhav of a thousand exploits",

The emoluments of the Commander-in -Chief are not mentioned anywhere.\nThe organization of the other type of cavalry consisting of Siledars was exactly of the same kind. They were also under the Sarnaubat.\nTraining of the Cavalry: Arrangements were made to keep the cavalry in cantonements during the rainy season. Hence sufficient stores of grains, fodder, medicines, etc., were preserved. Houses for men and stables for horses were provided. Shivaji had a regular cavalry in his service, and he looked to its comforts, efficiency and discipline. It was maintained on a new system in opposition to the feudal system of the Moguls. The nobles of the Delhi Empire were interested in cutting down the expenses of the cavalry under their charge. The troopers were recruited as occasion arose. Hence there was no regular training of troopers, and no regular breeding studs for horses were in existence. All was confusion, corruption and inefficiency. A description of the Mogul cavalry by Tavernier, Bernier, Manned and others clearly brings out these defects.\nThe Infantry: This branch of the army was mainly recruited from the Mawalas. The ascending grades were as follows: One Naik or Corporal over a squad of 10 men. Hawaldar or Sergeant a half company of 5 Naiks or 50 men. One Jumledar or Captain over a company of Hawalas or 100-150 men. One Hazari or Brigade over a battalion. One Sarnaubat or Commander-in-Chief over seven Hazaris.

    "text": "Strength of the army: From the Dutch documents we learn that in 1660 Shivaji had 3,000 soldiers at Panhala. He must have distributed some forces for the protection of conquered places. A force of 4,000 foot and 7,000 horse was dispatched to reinforce the captain who had captured Kudal. The latter must have originally got some three to four thousand soldiers under him. Then a flying army of sixteen thousand picked men under Netaji was harassing the march of the grand army of Shaista Khan. Another flying army was threatening Bijapur and trying to decoy Siddi Jauhar from Panhala. This flying force might be composed of some seven thousand men. We have to take into consideration the garrisons left in such strong fortresses as Purandar, Javli, Pratapgad, Rajgad, Sinhagad, Khelna, Rangana, Chakan, Vasota, Lohgad, etc. It is evident that the whole active army of Shivaji could not be less than sixty thousand in 1660. Shivaji must have increased the army with the expansion of his kingdom and financial resources. The Siledars were raised to 8,000 just after Afzal’s death. Netaji Palkar was sent with 15,000 horse and 12,000 foot to make depredations in the Mogul territory in 1661. Shivaji is said to have 50,000 foot and 10,000 horse in camp during the rainy season of 1664. He must have got about 500 x 35 = 17,500 men more in the thirty-five forts under him at that time. He started with 30,000 soldiers in 1670 against the Moguls. A few months later, he is reported to have marched with 10,000 horse and 20,000 foot to surprise Surat. He marched with 15,000 horse, 14,000 foot, and 10,000 labourers against Phonda in 1675; with 15,000 horse and 30,000 foot against Konkan in 1676, and with 40,000 horse and 40,000 foot in 1677 on the Karnatic expedition. This army was on the whole newly recruited. The best and bravest soldiers were left behind with Moro Pant to defend the kingdom. We have to add the garrisons which were permanently kept for the defence of the forts and the country. In Nov. 1678 he had concentrated 15,000 horse and 20,000 foot at Panhala alone. In 1679 Shivaji was about Malkapnr with 20,000 horse; one of his generals plundered Dharangaon, Chhapra, etc., with 12,000 horse, another force of the same strength appeared near Aurangabad. Thus more than 40,000 horse were in the field in one province. Then Moro Pandit had another force of 20,000 strong, while Shivaji himself returned with another army to his capital. At the end of his life the strength of his cavalry is stated by Sabhasad to be 45,000 regulars and 60,000 irregulars, while Chitnis changes the proportion to 80,000 regulars and only 25,000 irregular Siledars. It is evident now that the figures of the Sabhasad and Chitnis Chronicles are not unreliable; that the infantry preponderated over the cavalry in Shivaji’s army, and that he devoted very great personal attention to the efficiency, discipline, recruitment, payments and rewards of the army.",

    "text": "The relative strength of the cavalry and infantry: The Moguls were in need of more horsemen than foot soldiers, since the former were mostly useful in the distant expeditions to Kabul and Kandahar, to Assam, Gujerat or Sind, and to the Deccan. The infantry was mainly employed on garrison duty in the numerous forts and palaces. The Deccan monarchs, following the Moguls, had a preponderance of cavalry over the infantry. In fact, all the military grades were based upon the number of horses commanded by the officers. The distinguished historian Baldaeus records that the forces of the Bijapur-King consisted of 1,50,000 horse and only 8,000 foot. Shivaji did not require cavalry in the mountainous country and in the inaccessible forests of the Sahyadri range. His numerous forts needed a large force of brave foot soldiers. Moreover, the cavalry was far more costly than the other arm. Besides, horses were difficult to obtain in Maharashtra. For the first fifteen years he was mainly, if not exclusively, devoted to the recruitment, equipping and training of the infantry. His military genius, personal bravery, organizing capacity, charming personality, all combined to produce a self-confident, a loyal, and an almost invincible army from the poor, ignorant, simple, but hardy and sturdy Mawalas and other mountaineers. He specially devoted himself to the recruiting and training of the cavalry after his victory over Afzal Khan. With the enormous wealth captured in his camp and the loot obtained in the subsequent depredations he could swiftly increase his military strength in all arms. The triumph of Shivaji in 1660 was really a turning point in his life. The growth of the cavalry was subsequent to the wealth obtained after the memorable victories over the Bijapur generals. It was necessitated by the invasion of Shaista Khan. In the military forces organized by Shivaji, the infantry predominated over the cavalry. This fact is clear from the figures given in the previous section. At the end of his career, he is said to have a lakh of foot soldiers, recruited, equipped, and paid by the state, though the Chronicle raises the figure to two lakhs.\nThe excellence of his cavalry: The excellence of the light Maratha cavalry has been fully brought out by the numerous wars, expeditions, depredations and guerilla tactics described in this work. The pomp, luxury, magnitude and cumberousness of the camps of the Mogul commanders like Shaista Khan, Diler Khan, Bahadur Khan and the Mogul princes, have also been frequently detailed in the writings of Da Guarda, Abbe Carre, Manucci, etc. It has been truly concluded by Vincent Smith that if Akbar had had the misfortune to encounter the Maratha light horse, it is possible that he might not have fared much better than his great grandson did. Akbar’s military organization had in it the seeds of decay and failure. Without tents and equipage, without provisions and other commissariat encumbrances, without heavy artillery, the light Maratha infantry and cavalry moved with lightning speed from place to place. The soldiers and horsemen gathered their provisions as they went along. Their diet must have been of the poorest kind. They could hardly have time and opportunity to relish dainties and luxuries. These simple rustics subject to all the inclemencies of the climate of different parts in their long expeditions to Khandesh, Berars, and Southern India, performed deeds of heroism, sacrifice, patriotism which won them the admiration of the world.",

But the other will miss of a Booty rather than a Dinner; must mount in state and have their arms carried before them, and their Women not far behind them, with the Masters of Mirth and Jollity ; will rather expect than pursue a Foe ; but then they stand it out better ; for Sevagi’s Men care not much for a pitched Field, though they are good at Surprizing and Ransacking ; yet agree in this, that they are both of stirring spirits.\" The fighting strength of the army was maintained by strict discipline. Dr. Fryer also observed that Shivaji did not permit \"whores and dancing wenches in his army,\" nor did he allow drinks and intoxicants to be taken by his soldiers. Thus all officers as well as men lived a life of Spartan simplicity like the Maharaja himself. Abbe Carre observes that \"he greatly cherished the officers whom he called his brothers and friends, living familiarly with them, and attending to their needs with all distinction, he did not give anything to himself. He conducted himself with such ability, not affecting anything, and proposing through others the things to which he appeared aloof, and (but) which he desired at bottom.\" Further, \"Shivaji who being always at the head of his troops, knew not pleasure.\" The evidence of Dr. John F. G. Careri (1695 A. D.) is worth recording here : \"This Shivaji is so powerful, that he maintains war at one and the same time with the great Mogul and the Portuguese. He brings into the field 50,000 Horse, and as many or more Foot, much better soldiers than the Moguls, for they live a day upon a piece of dry bread, and the Moguls will march on with ease (carrying women, abundance of provisions and tents so that their army looks like a moving city.\"\nTraining of the army: Shivaji was one of those rare rulers who devoted much attention to the regular training of the soldiers. Here is the testimony of Abbe Carre : \"He had in his troops many young men still novices in the business whom he had assembled from all sides. In order to accustom them, he encamped for nearly three months on a level plain, training them to manage horses and to fight, and forming them with care in all the exercises of the military art.\" This confirms the statements of the Marathi chronicles about the training of the soldiers in the cantonments and in the forts. It is said by Carre that the Raja used to choose a most beautiful place, most abounding in forage, for making his army encamp and for giving it leisure and comfort to refresh itself. Shivaji had regular studs in several places. One of these...",

    "text": "Shivaji, a man of forts. Daughlas has aptly said that Shivaji's dwelling was among the rocks, and his strength lay in the everlasting hills. He was a man of forts, born in a fort. The forts made him what he became, and he made the forts what they were—the terror of all India; the cradle of his nation; the basis of his conquests; the steps of his ambition, his home and his joy; many of them he built, all of them he strengthened. Classical names of forts. One was a Lion's Den (Sinhagad), another the Bolt of Indra (Purandar), a third was Bhima's Fort, a fourth was Valour Fort (Pratapgarh). A few other instances are most interesting: Pandavagarh (Pandavas' Fort); Vijayadurg (Victory Fort); Raigarh (Royal Fort); Vishalgarh (Formidable Fort); Panhala (Serpents' Home); Suvarndurg (The Golden Castle); Vishramgarh (The Fort of Rest); Lohgad (Steel Fort); Shrivardhangarh (Enhancer of Prosperity); Manranjangad (Pleasing to the mind); Kanchangad (The Golden Fort); Kamalgad (Lotus Fort); Mayurgad (Peacock Fort); Madangad (Fort of Cupid), Mitragad (Friendly Fort); Rajhansagad (dander Fort); Sundargad (Beautiful Fort); Naladurg (King Nala's Fort); Devagad (God's Fort); Bhaskargad (Sun-Fort); Gajendragad (Elephant Fort); Chandragad (Moon-Fort); Satara (Star-Fort). Only inspiring names were not given to the fortified places, but some pleasing titles were chosen to create appreciation of their natural beauty. A few instances have been given at random above. All these are Sanskrit names. This fact furnishes an incontestible testimony of his literacy and love for Sanskrit.",

    "text": "every officer appointed in the army. Finally, he did not keep the same officers long in a fort, but used to transfer them from place to place. There was also no hereditary enjoyment of a post, as it was prevalent in the Bijapur kingdom. The fighting forces were composed of musketeers, spear-men, swordsmen, archers, and light-armed men. There were others who used to throw rockets, hand-grenades and stones. Sometimes huge boulders were rolled down the slopes to crush the ascending soldiers and horses.\n\nShivaji used to often inspect the forts either himself or through responsible ministers. He had a code of regulations which were to be strictly followed by the officers of the forts. There is a fine anecdote narrated by Chitnis of the tests held by Shivaji. One night he approached the entrance of the Panhala fort and demanded it to be opened. The sentry at the gate consented to inform his officer of the Raja's arrival. After a time the Hawaldar appeared on the rampart and regretted his inability to permit him in against the rules. The Maharaja told him that he was hotly pursued by enemies and his life was in danger. Thereupon the officer gave him assurance that he and his soldiers will stand guard on the rampart, and defend the gate against the enemy during the night. In the meantime he let down a bedstead and bedding for the king to sleep in the porch under the watch and guns of the fort. In the morning when the gate was opened according to the regulations, the officer appeared before the king with all humility for not complying with his wishes at night and hoped to be excused for disobedience. But Shivaji was much delighted at the bold conduct of the officer, so he munificently awarded him for fearlessly performing his duty. He paid such surprise visits to many forts before going to Agra. At other times he sent his commanders for inspection. Abaji Pant and Annaji Dutto were appointed to visit and inspect every fort, and to report upon the strength of its fortifications and the stock of materials and provisions. The views of Shivaji are given in a chronicle thus : \" Forts are for the protection of the land and the people. Just as ships and boats are strengthened with nails of iron, so by means of forts and redoubts the kingdom is strengthened, and the ryots safeguarded. I have an enemy like the Emperor Aurangzeb. If, God forbid it, he decides on active hostility and spends his whole life in warfare with me, the conquest of these forts would be beyond his power. In fact, forts are the defendants and guardians of the kingdom and the royal power.\" From that time forward he laid down the rule that in the larger forts enough munitions and grain should be stored to last for 12 years, and in the smaller forts for two years, and that reliable men whose words could be depended on, should be posted in the forts and kept contented and attached to their master by all means, so that they might not hesitate to sacrifice their lives in time of need. These ideas were actually put into practice as has been strangely confirmed by Father Friere. \" With this prevision, Shivaji applied all the energy of his mind and all the resources of his dominion to the fortifications of the principal towns. He constructed new ramparts around Gingi, dug ditches, erected towers, created basins, and executed all these works with a perfection which European art would not have denied. He did as much for the other citadels, whose position promised real advantages, destroyed all those which he considered useless, constructed a large number of new ones in the plains and hills, and put all these fortresses in a state of preparedness for a siege of several years.\"",

    "text": "The rule was to keep intact the walls of towers by repair, to strengthen the gates, and to keep stores, munitions and provisions of the forts ready for every emergency. There used to be a Sarnaubat or Hawaldar in charge of the public works. His duties were to look to the repair and construction of all buildings and ramparts in a fort. Among the reforms introduced by Shivaji one was the establishment of the P. W. D. Moropant and Hiroji Farzand were appointed to the post of the chief superintendent of buildings. In the beginning Brahmans, but afterwards Marathas too, were put in charge of this department. We have instances of such appointments at Ginji, Rudraj, Salvi and Utlur.\n\nA visit to one of the principal forts like Sinhagad, Raigad, or Panhala is an eye-opener. The tourist will find that everything is lying in a dilapidated condition; ramparts and gates are crumbling to dust ; the tanks and granaries are in ruins ; old guns and iron balls are lying scattered among heaps of stones; old mansions have scarcely more than bare walls or foundations. Yet forts like Toma, Rajgad, Raigad, Sinhagad, Purandar, Pratapgad, Shivneri, Vishalgad, Panhala, Satara, Sindhudurg, present evidence of a very systematic government. These have very big granaries, so that for years they could sustain a siege even without receiving provisions from without. Though many of these were hill-forts, sufficient care was taken to procure an adequate supply of water for human and animal purposes. Gunpowder and munitions of war were kept in underground cellars. They had secret tunnels or passages to effect escape in times of difficulty. Several of them had drawbridges to join and sever the connection with the land. They could be absolutely cut off by a ditch of water and yawning chasms of ravines. Their slopes were chiselled very steep, so that they were inaccessible even to the light-footed Mavalas. The weak points of defence were artificially strengthened with redoubts and fortifications. After capturing the impregnable castle of Ginji which included seven fortifications upon hills, Shivaji rebuilt it very strongly. Manucci has recorded that the Raja could foresee the emergency of Aurangzeb investing this castle. Therefore, he kept a great store of money, munitions, provisions, etc. to resist the Mogul armies during a long siege. Shivneri has seven gates on the way which winds up the slopes within the ramparts. There are about fifty tanks both large and small there. Even the gates are doubled or trebelled in defence. One gate led to the other and to the third before one could enter the fort. At each gate a guard of soldiers was stationed and adequate arrangements for offence and defence were made. Two such gates are to be seen at Panhala, known as the \" Three Gates \" and the \" Tiger's Gate.\" The masonry work is done in lead and lime. The gate has escaped the ravages of time for three hundred years. The old palace of Shivaji at by the rulers of Kolhapur even now, is preserved in its original form. Similarly, the tower of the time of is kept in good condition there. It gives a panoramic view of the whole of the Konkan and the surrounding districts. There were market places for the sale of all articles required by the soldiery and the officers. At Raigad we have the ruined shops of the great bazar of 25 ft. wide and a mile in length. In Panhala too, many shops must have existed. Barracks for the soldiers, and houses and offices for officers, temples, mosques, gardens, open spaces for military drills were to be had within the forts. Outside the ramparts the circumventing area of the slopes was generally divided into seven Petas or villages named after the week-days, such as Monday Pet, Tuesday Pet, Friday Pet, and so on. Each one of these was inhabited by Gadkaries or \"Guardians of the Fort\" consisting of different castes. They spent their time in cultivating the lands allotted to them on the slopes and at the foot of the hill, but in time of war, they defended the outskirts of the fort. Every day they had to keep watch, so that no hostile army should pass through the intervening spaces for surprising the fort.",

    "text": "Shivaji had no time to go in for superb art in architecture. Many of his structures were hastily raised to defend the land against the constant raids of the Bijapuri or Mogul forces. Yet the stone arch constituting the great entrance to his palace and court at Raigarh is a marvellous specimen of architectural beauty and skill. The gateways of the Sindhudurg and Vijayadurg are of no mean quality. Similarly, the ramparts of these forts and of Shivaneri or of Satara are admirable pieces of workmanship. The works of Ginji, as already pointed out, were executed with a perfection which European art would not have denied. A very interesting description of the construction of the Smdhudurg at Malwan is given in the Chitragupta Chronicle ( Pp. 113-136). We get a vivid idea of the difficulties experienced in such undertakings by Shivaji from the purchase of 200 khandis of iron to the manufacture of tools for the masons, the supply of lead and lime for joining stones, or from the collection of 3,000 men for the works including 100 Portuguese experts from Goa to the provisioning of gunpowder, balls and guns for the fort. It took three years to complete this fort under his own instructions and the able superintendence of Gobmd Vishwanath Prabhu, Shivaji generously awarded the services of all at the completion of this fort which was expected to keep in awe both the Europeans and the Moguls. It has withstood the onslaughts of time and tide for two hundred and seventy years. Even now though it has been lying in a neglected condition for several decades, it elicits our admiration for the master-builder Shivaji. The present prospect of the fort can be had from the picture opposite p. 145, while the views of two sea forts with Maratha navies about them in 1755 are given in a picture opposite p. 372 of Part III.\n\nThe navy was considered to be an independent limb of the state. It was essential to have a strong navy, because in the words of Ramachandra ' mastery of the sea is in the hands of him who possesses the strongest navy.' Yet he advised kings not to have very large ships as these were not useful without the help of the wind. However, he favoured the construction of a few men-of-war to create dread in the enemy. He was an advocate of having a navy consisting of brave and efficient soldiers and fully equipped with heavy guns, short-guns, match-locks, grenades, ammunition, and other material for naval use. The Maratha navy was composed of a light crew and was no match to a European fleet on the open sea. The largest ships were frigates, called Gurabs of about 200 to 300 tons. These were looked down with contempt by the Europeans, because their ships were of bigger tonnage and though merchant vessels they carried guns and soldiers to protect themselves from hostile attacks. An English Company's ship of 500-600 tons was generally equipped with 36 guns and carried about 120 soldiers, and a ship of 400-500 tons had 30 guns and 90 soldiers. Smaller ships required less guns and soldiers. In short, every merchant ship was armed with guns to save itself and to guard the trade of its country. The Marathas had no experts for casting big cannon, and were dependent upon the European nations for the same. The Mogul Emperor and Europeans were liberally helping the Siddis of Janjira in their war against Shivaji. The result was that that fort was at one time defended with 500 big cannon. Hence the capture of Janjira, even after enormous sacrifices of men and money, was not affected by Shivaji up to the end of his life. As he was dependent upon the Europeans for ammunition and ordnance, he treated all of them with much consideration. He showed special clemency to them at Surat, Vingurla, Madras, Negapatam and Pondichery. With the English too he continued to have friendly relations up to the end of his life, and did not ally himself with the Dutch against the English in 3673 even in time of emergency. He was a terror to them all. The Bombay settlement, being in its infancy, could not have been able to defend itself against his hordes, but he had realized the importance of every European nation which was carrying on commerce with India. He occasionally threatened the English, but actually did not give them any trouble, though they were affording refuge to the Siddi's fleet. Only at the end of 1679 he occupied Khanderi, and successfully kept its possession against the united fleets of the English and the Siddi. Suffice it to say that the prestige of the English was very much lowered in this war with Shivaji.",

Types of ships: Sabhasad t has given six types: 1. Gurabs are grabs in English. These had rarely more than two masts. They were generally of 100 tons. Some with three masts were of 300 tons. 2. Galbats are named gallivats in English. Such a vessel is described by Orme as a large row-boat with two masts rarely exceeding seventy tons. By Vaupell it is said to be of 100 to 150 candies. On the evidence of R. Orme these used to carry six to eight pieces of cannon fiom two to four pounders; they had 40 to 50 oars and were rowed at the speed of four miles an hour. 3. Shibads written as Shibars in English, were large vessels like half galleys of Spain. 4. Taratides were sailing vessels of large dimension. 5. Tarns were sailing vessels generally used by merchants. 6. Pagars were well-smoothed canoes. 7-10. Dubarc, Vabhor, Tirkati and Pal are four names added to the list by Chitnis and Chitragupta. The following types were in common use on the western coast. 11. Manchua is Machhava in Hindustani. It was a small vessel often of twelve candies. It had a main sail, 12 oars and four small guns. The Maratha fleet is said to have once lost 50 Manchuas. 12. Galleons were large ships generally sailing between Portugal and the East. * Shivaji, Part III, p. 492. t Sen-Sh. Chh, 93. 1-6. Sen, Sh.

He could not hope to get any European engineers to build his ships or pilots to manage them, nor could he ever get the necessary guns and munition for the hip s-hips. The situation of his forts, the rocky character of the coast, and the limitations mentioned above must have obliged him to have small ships. These were looked down with contempt by Englishmen ' as pitiful things that one good ship \\ould destroy a hundred of them without running herself into any great danger.' ' 32. Organization of the marine: Op /'the evidence of Ramachandra ^ant the fighting fleet was ^rpanized in separate units, each unit \\gnsisting of five grabs, 15 gallivats, and some small or light cnRi\" 1- Thse were organised into two squadrons each under a separate admiral. One was Mai'Naik so often mentioned in the Maratha chronicles and the European documents. 1 The other officer was styled Daria Sarang. From a Bombay letter of November 1670 we learn that a Hindu Vyankatji Sarangji was Daria Sarang or Admiral of the fleet. 3 This general who was going to Surat with a fleet of 160 vessels small and great, was personally known to the Deputy Governor of Bombay, Mr. Philips Gyffard, who had been in correspondence with him fo,r the last seven or eight years. It appears that Vyankatji had been general of the fleet from at least 1663. A Dutch letter informs us that in 1664 the Maratha fleet was -commanded by two admirals. 0ne had the title of Daria Sarang and the other of Mai Naik whq^gfs also a Hindu of Malsi caste.?

He continued to occupy that post up to the death of the Raja. Under him two Muslim officers, Siddi Sambal and Siddi Misri by name began to serve from 1676. According to the , ^aratha chronicles Ibrahim Khan was one of the admirals probably before Daulat Khan. ^ The English records bear out that there were two generals of the Maratha navy. In a letter of 23rd July of 1678 \" we read of Daulat Khan and Daria Sarang, both generals of his fleet/\" 1 Khanderi was occupied by Mai Naik Bhandan in Aug. 1679, and Daulat Khan was the other admiral in charge of the fleet. Therefore he should be Dana Sarang, 8 whilst from the preceding reference it appears that Daulat Khan did not hold the post of Daria Sarang. In Oct.-Nov. 1678 the Dana Sarang and his son were imprisoned by order of Shivaji. It is probable that this post was then given to Daulat Khan. 3 In spite of the tangle this much is certain that there were two fleets, each under an admiral, one Mia Naik and the other Dana Sarang. The former was generally a Hindu Bhandari and the other a Muslim after 1670. The crew mainly consisted of Bhandaris, Kolis and Malabaris-hardy fishermen of the western coast. These hereditary lascars, well-known for their adventure, courage and endurance, were also engaged by the Siddis of Janjira and the English of Bombay. The Bhandaris who had settled down in Bombay were considered to be loyal to Shivaji.. *' If he should have any design against us, they would be snakes in our bosom.\" 4 Therefore the English were thinking of expelling them from Bombay. Besides the Hindus a good many Muslims and a few Portuguese were also employed in the fleets. Ramachandra Pant has consequently strnck this note of warning: \" The sheltering should be done only in fortified ports. Still it is possible that men of the fleet who are many and who are generally Muhammedans and arrogant would quarrel and cause injuries amongst themselves. Sometimes in secretly fixed places treachery may take place 1- 3. Shiraji, Part III, pp. 359, ttft, 379, 381-2. 4. Ibid. Part II, pp. l35% 384. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 95 without one's knowledge. This is not desirable. For these reasons the sheltering of the navy should be done every year in a different port which has got a fort facing the sea.\"! 33.

It was not composed of small vessels only. Three thousand soldiers were being conveyed by ' it to Surat. It was victualled for 40 days, and equipped with extraordinary provision of tools such as pickaxes, showels, crows of iron, etc., in the creek of Nagothana. It sailed along Thull, Bombay and Mahim, but was unexpectedly called back. During its return journey it captured a great ship of the Portuguese off Daman, while the Portuguese armada took twelve of these vessels. Dr. Fryer saw a small fleet of 30 ships and vessels belonging to the Maratha navy at Shriwardhan. Only a white flag was flying over the Admiral or Flagship. 1 1 is clear that the navy did not then use the Bhagava Banner. 9 Even in 1664-65 the strength of the Maratha navy had so much frightened Aurangzeb who had adopted the title of Alamgir the Lord of the World, that he instructed the Governor of Surat to induce the Dutch with promises of a substantial reward to destroy the fleet of Shivaji, but they did not consent to do so since the Raja had promised them to give facilities in the Konkan. They decided to remain neutral. 3 The English were commanded by the Mogul authorities not to supply arms and ammunition to Shivaji. Then negotiations were conducted with the Europeans at Surat to guard the Mecca fleets",

    "text": "against the Maratha navy. When in 1670 he could lead a fleet of 160 vessels, the actual strength of his navy must have been much higher. A large number of ships must have been kept to guard more than twenty ports and sea-forts under Shivaji. Then it must have gone on increasing with the growth of his power, resources and kingdom. Therefore the fighting vessels great and small might approximate four hundred. The number of light craft to victual the fleet or to serve as mercantile boats can not be reliably stated.\n\n34. The Merchant fleet of Shivaji: In 1664 Shivaji is said to possess eight or nine ports which were most considerable in the Deccan. From every port he used to send two, three or more trading vessels to Persia, Bassora, Mocha, etc. Even his Subedar Raoji Somanath Pandit, following the example of his master, made eight or nine ships ready to sail to Mocha, Congo, Persia, Muscat, etc. However the English factors made up their mind not to issue permits to them. Two ships were being fitted out by Shivaji at Jaitapur for Mocha in February 1663. In 1670 Daria Sarang's three vessels went to Bombay to take in salt. Shivaji used to send a fleet in May for bringing salt. In 1672 the English were planning to surprise this May fleet which would have been a vast loss to him. Ramachandra Pant has mentioned several facilities to be given to foreign merchants visiting the Konkan ports. For instance:\n1. Naval and civil authorities should conciliate the merchants in many ways. They should be allowed to take whatever wood and water they want.\n2. They should be permitted to buy their provisions. They ought to have full freedom to bring and purchase goods after paying the custom dues.\n3. Hospitality should be shown to important merchants.\n4. Full security should be given to them for their person and goods.\n5. Enemy vessels should be captured. An inventory of their goods be made and the king be informed of the whole affair. Thus encouragement was to be given to merchants of all creeds to settle in the ports. He has truly advised the rulers to encourage trade which would bring about an increase in the revenue from customs. A large fleet should not be made to depend on the income from customs alone. We have the testimony of Abbe Carre that along the sea where Shivaji was master, no vessel from Europe came to which the Maratha Governors did not send provisions. Then he gives an example from his personal experience of the year 1668 when he accompanied two vessels of the French Co. and visited several Maratha ports. They were treated in a way which they had never hoped for. The Maratha statesmen of the time of Shivaji had fully understood the policies and character of the Europeans, and therefore a note of warning was struck by Ramachandra Pant in these words: \" The hat-wearers ( Topikars ) are not like other merchants. Their masters, every one of them, are ruling kings. By their orders and under their control these people come to trade in these provinces. How can it happen that rulers have no greed for territories? These hat-wearers have full ambition to enter into these provinces, to increase their territories and to establish their own religions. Accordingly at various places they have already succeeded in their ambitious undertakings. Moreover, this race of people is obstinate. Where a place has fallen into their hands, they will not give it up even at the cost of their lives. Their intercourse should therefore be restricted to the extent of only their coming and going for trade. They should never be given any places to settle, nor should they be allowed to visit any sea-fort.\"",

    "text": "were of no mean description. In the beginning of his victorious career about the year 1657, he wrested from the Portuguese who were the sovereigns of the Indian ocean in those days, the right of free navigation for his own armada; he captured the maritime ports like Rajapur, Dabhol, etc. from Bijapur in 1660; he reduced Danda Rajpuri along with several other sea-coast towns of the Siddis; he carried on a life-long struggle with them for the possession of their sea-girt rock-castle of Janjira; he built the Ocean Fort (Sindhudurg), the Victory Fort (Vijayadurg), the Golden Fort (Suvarndurg), the Lotus Fort (Padmadurg), the Jewel-Hill (Katnagiri) and the Royal Fort (Rajkot); he occupied the important fort of Colaba near Bombay and made it his principal arsenal; he collected Chauth from the Portuguese for Daman, and plundered Sunda, Bardes, and Salsette; he personally led a naval expedition with 85 frigates and three great ships for the sack of the port town of Barcelore in 1665; he increased the strength of his navy to such an extent within five years that in 1670 he made a naval demonstration with 160 vessels in the Back Bay of Bombay to strike terror into the hearts of Englishmen and the Bombay people; he captured a large Portuguese ship off Daman on his return voyage from Bombay; he refused to enter into an alliance with the Dutch for the capture of Bombay in 1673 and thus gave an incontestable proof of his friendship with the English; he sacked Carwar and Wingurla in 1675; he brought the Dutch town of Negapatam and the French town of Pondichery into his kingdom which, in 1678, extended from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal; and finally, a few months before his death, he fortified Khanden, \"so that from it, like another Tenedos, he might watch the Bombay shipping before it entered our Hellespont.\" Even in 1664 he had terrified the Mogul subjects on the one hand and the Bijapuri people of the Konkan on the other. The Dutch factors at Surat record that the Moors 'think that they will be attacked by him although he never before sailed the sea. If he has inspired, would enable him to inflict still, Mogul with robbing and plundering. He conceptions and designs which he knows execute with ingenuity.' The Englishmen of Surat wrote that expect him by sea. He was to waylay the Surat vessels returning from Bassora and Persia, or to transport an army to Cambay for plundering Ahmedabad. The Dutch at Wingurla were afraid of Shivaji who had enough ships and had always opportunity by night and at unforeseen times to surprise and capture their ships with his armed 4 thousand legs (?). Thus by 1664 he had succeeded to terrorize not only the Mogul subjects but even the three European nations who had monopolized the sovereignty of the sea from a long time. Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha navy, could rightly be proud of such an achievement. The Englishmen in India must have heaved a sigh of relief on his premature death. Mr. Douglas has aptly expressed his nation's sentiments regarding the maritime exploits of Shivaji. \"It was a great mercy that Shivaji was not a seaman, otherwise he might have swept the sea, as he did the land, with the besom of destruction. Even as it was he was very nearly doing it. He liked the sea, but the sea did not like him. So strong was his love of the salt-sea wave that when a young man he took up his abode at Mahar, on the Bankot Creek; at Malwan, he is said to have worked with his own hands at the fortifications of Sindhudurg. His foot-prints are still shown here, not on \"the sands of time,\" but in the solid rock; and the \"erring brother,\" meaning no harm, worships him as an avatar—silver mask for every day: gold mask for bara din or big days: Poor Shivaji, who is now worshipped as a god, was sea-sick like ordinary mortals; and though he arrayed himself in red fez with jewelled tasses, a big- green wave off the Chaul Kudu would have no mercy on him, but bowl him, into the lee-scruppers; and then—bilge-water and mat de mer. \"The victor overthrown; The arbiter of others' fates, A suppliant for his own.\"",

    "section": "36. Shivaji's Naval Achievements",
    "text": "The creation of the naval and mercantile marine was a remarkable achievement of Shivaji. The Muslim rulers of the north and the south did not possess any navies to defend their kingdoms from foreign invasion or to encourage coastal and maritime trade. Jahangir, Shah Jahan or Aurangzeb Alamgir—each one of these mighty emperors, was nominally 'king of the world,' yet not sovereign of the sea. None of them could create a navy for political and mercantile purposes. The Nizam Shahi and Bijapur kings too did not possess national navies. The Portuguese, the Dutch and the English shared the sovereignty of the Indian seas and fully controlled the foreign trade of this country. Its kings and merchants had to frequently suffer humiliations from the arrogant Europeans. No Indian ship could stir out on the open sea without buying the Portuguese permit and without fulfilling the conditions mentioned therein. With the decline of the Portuguese power, the Dutch and the English began to issue permits. An Indian ship holding a Portuguese cartaz could be captured by the English or the Dutch if these were at war with the Portuguese. Thus the Indian rulers and their subjects did not enjoy freedom of the sea. Though the founder of the Maratha empire was fighting a life and death struggle with the Deccan states and the Mogul Empire, yet he conceived the idea of having an Indian navy to rule the waves after his conquest of Kalyan a great ship-building centre of those days. Amidst adverse circumstances he had the time, energy and determination to give practical shape to this original idea. In 1659, the year of his triumph over Afzal Khan, he had built ships at Kalyan, Bhivandi and Panvel. The Portuguese ordered their captain not to allow these to go out of the ports. No documents are available to throw light on the early struggles of Shivaji with his Portuguese neighbours, but evidently they soon recognized the right of his fleet to navigate the sea without any hinderance from them. Consequently, Shivaji richly deserves the titles of 'the Father of the Maratha navy' and 'the Creator of the Indian mercantile marine.'\nThis navy was national to its composition and ideals. The soldiers and sailors were Bhandaris, Kolis, peasants, Malabars, Marathas, Muslims and Christians. These were inspired by national spirit and unshakable loyalty to their great ruler. We cannot share the view of the learned scholar, Dr. Sen when he says that Shivaji's navy accomplished very little excepting some fighting with the Siddis. The naval achievements of the Raja can be summed up as under:\n1. His navy effectively protected the maritime possessions in the Konkan against the raids of the Europeans, the Moguls and the Siddis.\n2. It protected his own merchant fleet and mercantile vessels of his subjects sailing along the coast and even on the open sea.\n3. It gave him the power to impose his rights of sovereignty over territorial sea and thus claim the wrecks of all ships in his ports.\n4. It enabled him to wrest from the Portuguese the right to send out his vessels without obtaining any permits from them.\n5. He kept the Portuguese in awe by entering into alliance with the Arabs, the Dutch and the English according to the needs of the time.\n6. He captured Khanden and kept its possession against the naval might of the English and the Siddi.\n7. He plundered the pilgrim ships of the Mogul Emperor. Then he looted the port-towns of Jival, Pabal and others near Surat. Thus he proved his strength both on the sea and the land.\n8. His land-forces could be helped in their expeditions to Surat or to Barcelore by the navy.\n9. He could keep watch over the activities of the Europeans and reduce their power in his ports. His officers used to issue permits to every merchant ship after inspecting it on the sea for coming into his ports. Thus every port of his kingdom was defended against surprise by an enemy.\n10. It kept open the sea for Shivaji to escape to an inaccessible fort or to obtain war materials and provisions in time of emergency.\n11. It created a naval spirit among his people, and provided employment to thousands of sailors and soldiers.\n12. The ship-building industry was immensely encouraged. Kalyan, Panvel, Colaba, Kharepatan, Malvan, Wingurla and other places had ship-building yards",

This led to conflict with the English at Rajapur in 1660 over their sale of weapons to Siddi Jauhar.  Shivaji retaliated by imprisoning the English, plundering their factory, and demanding ransom. The English East India Company, initially keen to sell guns, became hesitant as Shivaji's power grew, fearing he would use them against them. They often cited prohibitions from the Mughal Emperor as excuses. Shivaji, also wanting to avoid trouble for the English, arranged gun purchases through Portuguese agents. He attempted to buy guns directly in 1671 and 1673, but the English insisted on peace negotiations as a precondition. Despite granting the English favorable trade terms, they continued to refuse him arms. Negotiations dragged on for years, revealing the English reluctance to arm a potential adversary. The French, unlike the English, readily supplied Shivaji with guns and lead. The Portuguese and Dutch also supplied munitions to various rulers in the region.",

Dadaji largely followed Malik Ambar's system, offering concessions for new villages. Ambar's system involved land classification based on fertility, produce assessment, setting the government's share, collecting rents in kind or money, and eliminating intermediary revenue farmers. Kond Deva’s rates encouraged land reclamation. However, the rates under Malik Ambar, possibly around Rs. 25-30 per Bigha, appear excessive compared to modern standards.  Lack of documentation obscures Moropant's revisions, leading us to Annaji Datto’s 1678 settlement.",

Introduction of the Rayatwari system: The share of the government was two-fifths of the gross produce to be taken direct from the ryot. \"In every village, from each individual ryot, the karkun should according to the assessment, realize the rent in grains from the crops at the time of harvest.\" The Zamindari system was replaced by the Rayatwari. The ryots enjoyed freedom from extortion by officials and had the facility to pay the revenue in the form of grain at the harvest time. Though the share of the government, being 2/5, was high, yet it was lower than what was exacted before. Adil Shah first took one-third of the average produce, and eventually one-half. In the reign of Aurangzeb, 50 percent of the gross produce was the general standard. Thus the Maratha ruler gave relief, security, prosperity, and happiness to the rack-rented peasantry in the Swaraj.\n\n7. Classification of lands (a) Arable lands were distinguished from uncultivable areas. These were divided into three kinds, and each kind of land was subdivided into four classes, (b) There was a further distinction between Jirayat and Bagayat lands, i.e., those meant for ordinary crops and for fruit gardens, (c) Then another classification was on the basis of irrigation; unirrigated lands, tracts irrigated with canal water (Patsthal) and with well-water (motsthal). (d) A further sub-division was made from the viewpoint of the kind of crops raised. Each major and minor crop was to be estimated.\n\n8. Basis of Assessment: The old unit of assessment was the plough. In this system, an inquiry into the yield of crops was not necessary. The cultivator was assessed on the basis of the ploughs he worked with irrespective of the quality of the land and the crop he raised on it. Even Aurangzeb did not abolish this system of plough-assessment in 1652 but kept it on for backward tracts. He introduced the sharing system and also that of cash-payments after measurement of good and middling lands. In the Maratha survey, uncultivable wastelands were excluded from assessment. The people were, however, encouraged to bring them under cultivation. Such lands remained exempt from taxes for some time but were ultimately subjected to a light assessment.",

Wari at 3 maunds and 2 ½ maunds. Hank at 3 maunds. Other inferior produce at 1 ½ maunds. We find that Shivaji introduced both the differential method of sharing the crops and of charging cash-rates on the estimated produce of cultivated lands. The preceding statements regarding the survey are fully confirmed by Major Jervis. Says he, \"It is commonly believed indeed, that he (Shivaji) measured and classified all the lands, and then ascertained the amount of their produce from one or two villages in each Muhal of the Ouchitgurh, Rajpooree, Rygurh, Soowurndroog, Unjunvel, Rutnagiri and Veejydroog districts, for three successive years, from which data he established the rates, half in kind, -half at a fixed commutation rate differing in each Talooka, to be paid by the beegah of each sort of land. The classification of the rice lands, mule or dhernp, under 12 heads; the four first still retaining their former well-known distinctions.\" The twelve sorts of rice lands were assessed at 12 ½ maunds per bigha for the best land and 5 maunds for the worst. The second crops on first-class lands were assessed at different rates, such as turmeric and hemp at 5 maunds per bigha and 1-2, sugarcane at 6 ¼ to 3 ¼ maunds of jagaree per bigha. Thus the rates differed with crops and the quality of lands. For the first time, an attempt was made to have a scientific survey of all lands in every village of the Swaraj. Though the work must have remained unaccomplished, the adoption of such a scheme was highly creditable to Annaji Datto. He lightened the burden of the cultivators and yet increased the income of the state by carefully fixing the crop-share and cash rents to be given by them. The crucial problem of collecting the revenue remained to be tackled. The general practice of those days was to collect it through farmers, and not by state-officials directly.\n\n9. Prevalence of the farming system: Sabhasad has briefly described the old system of farming revenue and the evils accruing from it: \"In the Adilshahi, Nizam-Shahi and Mogul territories conquered by Shivaji, the ryots used to be under the Patils, Kulkarnis and Deshmukhs. They used to collect the revenue and pay an unspecified sum to the state. For instance, for a village yielding 2,000 Hons as revenue, the Mirasdars used to pay only 200 or 300 Hons to government. Therefore these Mirasdars grew wealthy and powerful by building bastions, castles, and strongholds and enlisting troops. They did not care to wait upon the revenue officers, rather they used to resist them whenever more revenue was demanded from them. They grew unruly, and forcibly misappropriated the lands.\" Ramchandra Pant too has strongly condemned the Watandari system. \"They fortify their places, rob travellers, loot territories and fight desperately. They make peace with a foreign invader with a desire to protect their Watans and help him in every possible manner.\" These statements are buttressed by contemporary evidence from the Dutch records on the oppressive and deplorable system of the Bijapur government.",

This office of governor is often let on lease by the lords for want of money, because they have no capital. This system does not work well, as it gives rise to abuses, extortion and grinding down of the population. The King favours a lord by means of firmans with large territories of which the revenue is reserved for him in exchange for some services. His office is not a hereditary one, but a mere favour on the part of the King. Some lords practically conduct themselves as if they were independent.\" \"Each takes the appearance of being a king, and after having committed divers crimes by robbing, murdering, burning and devastating the land to their hearts' content, they appear at court, where they are praised for being brave soldiers, if they know how to oil His Majesty's palm. This practice is daily increasing more and more and has taken so very deep a root that the king (who is simply adorned with the crown) is unable to prevent this, for if he deprives some Lords of their dignities, they instantly take refuge with Shivaji, Bahlol Khan or some other of the afore-mentioned subjects, by whom they are at once favoured with some dignities.\" In Golconda the oppressions on the peasants were no less destructive of prosperity and humanity. According to William Methwold 'the government is farmed immediately from the King by some eminent man, who to other inferiors farmeth out the lesser ones, and they again to the country-people, at such excessive rates that it is most lamentable to consider what toil and misery the wretched souls endure. For if they fall short of any part of their rent, what their estates cannot satisfy, their bodies must, so it sometimes happens they are beaten to death, or, absenting themselves, their wives, children, fathers, brothers, and all their kindred are engaged in the debt, and must satisfy or suffer. And sometimes it so happens that the Principal, failing with the King, receives from him the like punishment, as it befell to one Basbell Raw (Governor at Masulipatam since the English traded thither), who, for defect of full payment, was beaten with canes upon the back, feet, and belly, until he died. Yet hold they not these their governments by lease, for yearly in July all are exposed in sale unto him that bids most; from whence it happeneth that every Governor, during his time, exacts by tolls taken in the way and other oppressions whatsoever they can possibly extort from the poorer inhabitants, using what violence within their governments they shall think fit; for in them, during their time, they reign as petty kings.\"\n\n10. Watans: From ancient times the custom of holding hereditary Watans was prevalent in the Deccan. Hundreds of village officers and high government servants were given lands, rights and privileges for a certain service performed in the past or being performed in the interest of the village or the government. Such grants were known as Watans. In the villages the Patil, Kulkarni, Mahar, Chougula, Chaudhari, Kamoshi, black-smith, gold-smith, carpenter, washerman, watchman, barber, potter, shoe-maker, tailor, oilman, Joshi, Kazi, Mahajan, etc., were the Watandars, while Desais, Deshmukhs, Deshpandes, Desh-kulkarnis, etc., were the district officers who held hereditary Watans. Grants of rent-free lands or share of the government revenue were given to these. If the rent of a tract of land was given over to a state-servant for the maintenance of troops and forts it was called Fauj Saranjam, but if it was meant for the support of the family or dignity of the grantee, it was known as Jat Saranjam. The holders of both kinds of Inams formed the landed aristocracy enjoying rights, dues and perquisites which gave them power to oppress the ryots on the one hand and to weaken the central government on the other. Shivaji deprived the fief-holdiers of their administrative powers. Though he did not confiscate their estates, he discontinued the system of granting Inam lands or estates, and displaced them by cash payments.",

Shivaji, for example, provided Mauni Baba of Patgaon with an annual donation of provisions for a thousand visitors, funds for assistants, and support for a musician and palanquin bearers. Physicians sometimes received concessions for serving the poor. A Brahman physician family received Inam land grants from Muslim rulers and Shivaji.  Ramchandra Pant, however, condemned land grants even for religious purposes, arguing that a wise king should avoid such donations to maintain and expand his kingdom.  Consequently, Shivaji preferred cash donations, exemplified by his gifts to numerous saints.",

Peter Mundy confirms this rate in Bijapur in 1655. The English seemingly secured exemptions from export duties on unsold goods and duty-free export of provisions, timber, and firewood. They also sought relief from transit duties on imports or at least equal privileges to those enjoyed under Bijapur. Shivaji likely granted these, presenting them as established practice. A clause in the English Sanad suggests customs officers harassed merchants for money and gifts. Dr. Fryer criticizes the dishonesty and greed of Maratha customs officers, accusing them of prioritizing personal gain over public good and honest trade, thus hindering trade development. Other European travelers like Sir Thomas Roe, Bernier, and Manucci echo these complaints about extortion and harassment by customs officials in Surat and elsewhere. Contemporary documents are rife with complaints about delays in clearing goods and overvaluation. Despite Shivaji's espionage system, supervision, and decent officer salaries, corruption persisted, possibly due to customs farming, which incentivized officers to inflate prices and harass merchants. A Daiogha (customs superintendent) likely oversaw each major port, resolving disputes. If Shivaji adopted the Mughal practice of farming customs, the corruption becomes understandable. Moreland’s summary of Akbar’s taxation system notes that even a seemingly low ad valorem tax could become crushing due to uncertainty, range, greed, frequency, multiplicity, and weak protection of life and property, stifling trade.",

Transit duties were collected, with exemptions for certain cattle. Forest revenue came from the sale of various products like trees, herbs, and spices, as well as grazing fees.  Mintage profits were likely modest, as the right was often granted to goldsmiths for a royalty, though a royal mint seemingly established after Shivaji's coronation might have boosted this income.  The sale of offices, a common practice in Muslim kingdoms, doesn't appear to have been widely adopted by Shivaji.  Presents given to Shivaji by various parties, including the English, officers, the public at his coronation, Europeans during his Karnatic expedition, and the ruler of Golconda, constituted another revenue source.  Bijapur and Golconda paid annual tribute and contributions, plus special war subsidies.  Shivaji also received tribute from Sunda and Madura.  A notable example is the daily 3,000 Hons subsidy from Golconda during the Karnatic war, and the annual one lakh Hons tribute from 1677 onwards.  From the Portuguese, Shivaji demanded 'choutry' (chauth), or a fourth of their revenue, not just for Daman, but for all their territories.",

Plunder and ransoms from cities like Rajapur, Surat, Hubli, and Portuguese territories, as well as from Shahpur, Dharangaon, Chhapra, and Ahmednagar, significantly enriched Shivaji's treasury.  The thorough plunder of the Karnatic, the capture of Baji Ghorpade's treasures, and the loot of Shaista Khan's camp are particularly noteworthy.  Ransoms from prisoners of war and gifts from newly conquered territories further augmented his coffers.  While the principle of escheat (state ownership of unclaimed property) was prevalent, Shivaji adopted a liberal approach. He granted merchants the right to dispose of property of issueless individuals according to their panchayat's decision and allowed individuals to bequeath property to relatives, thus encouraging trade and fostering contentment.  Forfeitures of Watans and Inams occurred for disloyalty, but Shivaji generally favored conciliation to gain the support of the aristocracy.  Nazar (a present) functioned as a succession duty. Harki or Sherni were charged upon grant or confirmation of watans.  Piracy and the capture of ships, especially Mogul pilgrim vessels and Portuguese ships, yielded considerable revenue, and Maratha naval depredations were ongoing. The English sought agreements regarding the return of goods on captured ships.  Shivaji's ministers refused to return shipwrecked goods, citing established laws from the Nizamshahi kingdom.",

The history of Chauth (a 25% tax levied for protection) is intertwined with Shivaji's reign.  Aurangzeb himself had demanded Chauth from Daman in 1639, after a failed siege, receiving 60,000 Muhmudis, equivalent to a quarter of the region's revenue. Shivaji, after conquering Ramnagar in 1672, claimed this Chauth from the Portuguese rulers of Daman and Bassein.  Shivaji expanded the Chauth system to mitigate war's impact and fund his army, offering immunity from raids in exchange for this payment.  Manucci suggests Shivaji collected Chauth in Mughal Deccan as early as 1658, based on a purported grant by Aurangzeb, later rescinded. During Shah Alam's rebellion, Shivaji pledged to limit revenue collection to Aurangzeb's concession.  He had evidently been aware of Chauth before 1664, as he demanded it from Aurangzeb to protect Surat from raids.",

The latter bided his time, till in 1670 he was able to re-plunder Surat. On his departure he sent a letter to the officers and chief merchants demanding twelve lacs of rupees as an annual tribute. It is now evident that the tribute demanded from the authorities of Surat in 1664 and 1670 was no other than Chauth. The sum claimed in different years as 'Chauth' varied considerably. In 1670 it was 12 lakhs; and two years later, it was reduced to 3 lakhs annually, so that nine lakhs were demanded by Moro Pant as 'Chauth' for the past three years. In 1672 after a successful invasion of Ramnagar, Moro Pant advanced towards Surat and once more \"demanded the Chouthy or ith part of the king's revenues under this government which amounts to four lakhs.\" The same news is conveyed by the Surat Factors to Bombay with an additional information for showing the cause of collecting the contribution. Shivaji declared that \"as their king (Aurangzeb) had forced him to keep an army for the defence of his people and country, so that army must be paid and if they sent him not the money speedily, he bid them make ready a large house for him.\" There are several evidences available from the English records that Shivaji gave immunity from plunder to all those places which agreed to pay him the Chauth. During his plundering expedition in the Berars and Khandesh in 1670, he refrained from looting towns and villages near Karanja and Nandurbar as these gave him writings for payment of Chauth of the revenues thereof. Kolhapur and Saagaon redeemed themselves from the fury of the Maratha forces by paying presents in 1675. The Governor of Hubli made peace with Shivaji by paying him ith part of the revenues of the Hubli Vilayat in 1678. A few months after, the Governor of Karwar gave a present to the Maratha Subedar, otherwise the latter would have burnt and ransacked the town. Finally, there is the most irrefutable testimony of the Chhapra letter dated 24th February 1680 that the Maratha forces \"plundered and burnt most of these parts, excepting the towns which pay Jth part, those he meddles not.\" Thus the demand for 1th part of the revenue of Surat was first made by Shivaji in 1664 and renewed in 1670. In this year it was actually imposed for the first time on the territory immediately subject to the Moguls and was extended to the various districts which were liable to Maratha excursions.",

    "section": "Wrong Notions Regarding Chauth and its Economic Impact",
    "text": "The first pretension of Shivaji was to levy from the Rayats as Sar Deshmukhi, ten rupees for every hundred levied by the Government. This was afterwards followed by a demand of the fourth of the collections, which at length was yielded by the Moghuls. The fourth thus acquired is called by the Marathas the Chauth: it was immediately divided by the prince with his ministers and Sardars.' This view is erroneous with regard to facts and chronology. The name 'Chauth' was not given by the Marathas, but as shown previously, was extant long before their rise to power. Shivaji did not divide the Chauth income with his ministers and Sardars. This practice began with Rajaram. The Mogul Emperor Aurangzeh never consented to pay Chauth to Shivaji, but it was his successor who conceded the grant to Shahu. Then there is no evidence to show that Shivaji forcibly collected Sardeshmukhi previous to his demand for Chauth in 1664.  The history of Chauth given in the 'Rise of the Maratha Power' is also not based on facts. The Bakhafs use the word 'Khandani,' subsidy or tribute. There is no mention of either Chauth or Sardeshmuki at this time. Dr. Sen has rightly observed that the Chauth paid to Ramnagar was not a tribute, but a pension, and the 'Chauthia' Raja was a vassal of the Portuguese. It was a subsidy like the one which the Indian Government has been paying to the tribes for keeping peace and order on the frontier. Shivaji merely got the idea from this practice, but he gave it a different connotation and used it on an extensive scale. He made it an impost, collected it at the point of the sword, extended it to all those places which were to be plundered and thus afforded an opportunity to the people to buy off immunity from his raids by the payment of the Chauth. Hence this levy assumed a new form and, in time, became an essential part of the Maratha financial system. For this reason Shivaji can be called the originator and organizer of the Chauth system. Moreover, this contribution had no features common to the subsidiary system introduced by the British in India, because this was generally levied by force; it was not a voluntary payment in return for military protection. This was collected from the people directly and against the will and order of the rulers, while the contribution under the subsidiary system was made to the British under an agreement with the ruler himself. The suzerain was bound to defend the ruler from internal disorder and external aggression. Under the system of Chauth Shivaji only undertook not to raid the territory himself. Further, there was no binding on the ruler not to enter into correspondence or alliance with other rulers—indigenous or foreign. Lastly, there was no stipulation by the rulers not to employ foreigners in their civil or military service. It is evident that no similarity exists between the Chauth and the subsidiary system. Lastly, it may be pointed out that in theory Chauth was not a claim for one-fourth of the land revenue but 'of all the incomes.' In practice it would have been impossible to estimate the total 'incomes of villages and towns within the short time of a lightning raid. Therefore the Maratha officers had to be satisfied with whatever they could extort from the people. While the forcible levy of Chauth by the Marathas enriched Shivaji and his subjects, it soon brought about the economic bankruptcy of the Mogul Empire. Surat, though defended by a wall and well-fortified in 1669, was plundered a second time as the Chauth was not paid. From that year onwards the Marathas were often threatening the town, because they did not receive the contribution. These raids destroyed the trade and prosperity of the richest port and created a sense of insecurity among the people. The rich and the poor left for the growing city of Bombay, and Surat began to decline. The territories of Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Khandesh and Berars were often pillaged, burnt and destroyed by the Marathas. Trade, industry and agriculture were dislocated. The people were reduced to abject poverty and the government to financial bankruptcy by a sharp decline in revenue. The fall in the income of the Deccan Subas and the continuous wars against Shivaji compelled Aurangzeb to increase the burden of taxes on his subjects and to revive the levy of the poll-tax or Jazia on the Hindus. The economic and political consequences to the decline of the Mogul Empire are thus directly tied to the system of Chauth.",

    "section": "Sardeshmukhi: A Hereditary Right",
    "text": "We learn from a document containing the judicial order of Shivaji himself that Mavlangkar be given the right of collecting from the districts of Prabhavali and Dabhd. As this right had been enjoyed for generations by that family, it was evidently a very ancient one. From the Sardesai Family History it appears that one Krishnaji Narsingh who was a contemporary of the Shilahar King Vijayaditya of Kolhapur (1142-1154 A.D.), obtained the Deshmukhi and Sardeshmukhi of seventy villages. Thus the system of giving grants for Sardeshmukhi can be traced to the 12th century A.D. Besides the Mavlangkars, Khem Savant was Sardesai of Kudal as is evident from a document of the year 1635-36. A generation later in 1659, a treaty was made between Shivaji and Lakham Savant Sardesai Bahadur. But the hereditary title and office were not limited to the Konkan.  Sardeshmukhi in Maharashtra: One Deshmukh of Kanadkhore was given Inam of Sardeshmukhi of Anturli village by Dadaji Kond Deva, the Subedar of Kondana, in 1645. That there were Sardeshmukhs in the Mavals different from Deshmukhs, is seen from a letter written by Shivaji in 1652 to the Karkuns, Sardeshmukhs, Deshmukhs, Desh Kulkarnis, etc., of Turf Mosekhore. A letter was written in 1668 by Shivaji to the Subedar and \"Skrttun of Poona wherein he was also addressed as Sardeshmukh. Aurangzeb himself conferred Sardeshmukhi of Nusratabad in 1658. Letters are addressed to the Sardesai of (Dabhol) and Muzafarabad (Prabhavali), Turf Sangameshwar in 1659. There are two Adilshahi letters confirming the Sardesai's right in a place in their territory and a third from Shivaji continuing the Adilshahi rights to one Nagoji Naik Sardesai, wherein the Sardeshmukhi dues are stated. An arbitration was held in 1636 at some place in the Mamla of Mazafarabad and Fort Khelna. Therein three Sardesais were present along with other officers. From a letter of 1642, it appears that Sardeshmukhi had been prevalent in the Poona district for several generations. Exemption from the cess of Sardeshmukhi along with other cesses was given to the grantee in Jejuri. There is a mention of another traditional grant of Sardeshmukhi in letters of 1696 and 1712 A.D., in the district of Supa. In the grants to the Gosavi of Margaon in the district of Poona exemption from several cesses then current in the Deccan and especially in that district, has been given. Among the cesses one for Sardeshmukhi was fully recognized in Maharashtra. Another arbitration was held in 1652 at Khanapur in the Mamla of Walwa. Among the numerous officers one Sardesai was also present. We read of Sardesai's shares in the two documents of 1685, giving various cesses in that year.",

    "text": "Shivaji himself conferred the Sardeshmukhi of Dabhol on Balaji Avaji. The Bijapur Sultan issued an order to the Deshmukh of Thana Mudhol in 1670. There was a Desai in Athni in 1658, Desai of Wai, Shirwal and of Karad in 1642, Kanhoji Jedhe Desai of Fort Rohida in 1638 and Kedarji Khopade Desai of Turf Bhor in 1648, and Desai of Kharepatan in 1658. Letters to the Desai of Pargana Kolhapur in 1660 and 1661 from Bijapur are available. Desai Kanhoji Jedhe is called Deshmukh of Rohida in a Sanad of 1660. It is, therefore, evident that the title Desai was also known as Deshmukh, and Sardesai was synonymous with Sardeshmukh even under the Adilshahi and Mogul regimes. These officials were not limited to Sawantwadi or even to the other parts of the Konkan, but were found in several parts of Maharashtra. Sardeshmukbs were common in the Konkan, the Mawals, Poona, Bankapur, Dharwar, etc., under the Bijapur government and even in the Mogul provinces. Desai officers functioned in such parts of the Karnatic as Terdal, Mudhol, Manglage, Athni, Torga), Tawargiri, etc. Similarly, Deshmukhs flourished also in Khandesh and the Berars, but Sardeshmukbs were not so common.\n\nSardeshmukhi was not one-tenth part of the land-revenue, but it was only a cess like so many other cesses to be paid by the cultivator over and above the land revenue. In a grant by Shahji Raje dated 1625 the Sardeshmukhi cess is counted along with the cesses given to goldsmiths, payposhi, etc. There is an important grant of 1671 endorsed by the Sardeshmukh of Poona as representative of Shivaji himself wherein the contribution given to the Sardeshmukh is insignificant, being only 4½ out of 532 Takas. Similarly, in the revenue account of village Khore in the district of Poona the Sardeshmukhi cess is mentioned as four out of 500 Takas. This nature of Sardeshmukhi is shown by several other grants. The Deshmukh's rights were many and quite different from those of Sardeshmukbs. The claim of ⅒th part of the land-revenue as Sardeshmukhi must have been started, if at all, by Shivaji in the latter part of his regime. It can be definitely said that even in Shivaji's time and before him Sardeshmukhi was only a cess. Now it should be noted in passing that Shivaji had demanded the Deshmukhi and not Sardeshmukhi of Junnar and Ahmednagar from Prince Muradbux in 1649, though he was granted Sardeshmukhi as he had himself made several Deshmukhs were well-known throughout Maharashtra hence there was nothing novel in the request of Shivaji for being granted Deshmukhi of the two districts. There is no mention of Sardeshmukhi here. Moreover, it was a small cess, not worth having. Deshmukhi alone gave him substantial rights of collecting land-revenue.",

    "section": "Conclusions on Sardeshmukhi and Supplementary Revenue Sources",
    "text": "The study of numerous documents leads us to the following conclusions:\n(1) Shivaji was not the originator of the Sardeshmukhi tax which afterwards came to mean one-tenth of the land-revenue.\n(2) Sardeshmukhi was only a small cess and it existed long before the days of Shivaji. In fact, it is traceable to the twelfth century A.D.\n(3) It was not limited to the Konkan but was found in the Karnatic and Maharashtra.\n(4) The Bijapur rulers, Aurangzeb and Shivaji himself conferred or confirmed the Sardeshmukhi right during the forty years of 1640-80 A.D.\n(5) All writers like Duff, Elphinstone, Ranade and a host of others who attribute the origin or the collection of Sardeshmukhi to Shivaji, are incorrect.\n\nSupplementary Sources\nCesses or Abwab: In addition to the main sources of revenue there were many minor taxes levied from the people of villages and towns. These were known as Swat Jama or supplementary collections. We will call them cesses, though some of them are taxes, fees, fines and even loans. A few of these were surtaxes for imperial purposes, but many cesses provided funds for local objects. It is difficult to distribute the latter into urban and rural heads of income, because some of them were collected in both the areas, while regarding others we do not possess definite information. A rough classification is proposed in this section.\nImperial Revenue consisted of surtaxes charged by the government as Meeraspatti, Inantpatti, Duhuhpatti, Hahar Mahili, Hakpatti on the incomes of the persons named in each case. Dr. Sen has explained Meeraspatti as an additional tax levied once in three years on Meerasdars; Inampatti as an emergency tax on Inamdars; Duhukpatti as a special tax on Deshmukhs or Deshpandes; Mahar Mahili as a tax on holding Inams, and Hakpatti as one-fourth of the fees levied every year. Besides these, the following cesses might have been collected for imperial use:\n(i) Hutnayun Patti is explained by Dr. Sen as a tax levied for celebrating the royal birthday.\n(ii) Marriage cess known as Lagnapati and Patpati in Marathi was much prevalent from ancient times. It was continued like many other cesses by Shivaji and his successors. It was levied even during the reigns of Akbar and Aurangzeb.\n(iii) A tax on documents was collected probably for central purposes.\n(iv) Jangampatti - A tax on the Shaiva Lingayats was levied by the Vijayanagar monarchs and might have been continued by the Maratha rulers. In the grants of 1646 and 1647 given by Shivaji himself this cess is mentioned.\n(v) Jang pan by its meaning seems to be a war cess, but Mohimpatti or expedition cess is separately stated. Therefore this cess might have been collected for defensive wars.\n(vi) Mohimpatti was levied to meet the expenses of special expeditions for defensive or offensive purposes.\n(vii) Gad patti or a fort-cess used to be levied. Shivaji imposed this tax on the villages in the district of Belgaum to build 360 forts there.\n(viii) Nazar or succession duty was paid by Inamdars and government servants.",

    "section": "Town and Rural Levies in the Maratha Empire",
    "text": "Town levies were probably the following. Shete Mahajan was an officer of Market towns as the Patil was in a village. He had his Watan or hereditary rights and perquisites. For instance, he had the right to take at stated periods fixed portions of each and every article sold in the market. Thus the government did not pay him much. The citizens paid for the maintenance of their leader, and he, in return, took every care to promote the interests of the town. Shete, Mahajan, Sar Shete, Patansheti, Mutsadvani, etc. had also their shares in some market-towns. Octroi duty (Jakat) or toll was levied on the entry of goods in towns. Then cesses on the purchase and sale of certain goods and were included under the octroi duty. There were special octroi officers or Kamavisdars in this department. In some places there was a cess called Khot Jakat paid to the hereditary landlords called Khots. Mohtarfa was a tax on trades and occupations. Shopkeepers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, oilmen, potters, shoemakers, etc. had to pay it. A tax called Mohtarfa Kul might have been levied on families like a poll-tax. Sales tax: A cess on the sale of oils, ghee, fodder, etc. was quite common. These taxes formed part of the old Hindu system as these are allowed by Manu, Kautilya and other law-givers. Police cess called Thanapatti or Kotwaleepatti, was collected to meet the expenses of Thana or police stations in villages and towns. Guest cess might have been collected to meet the expenses of touring officers. Tutpatti was a cess to cover some loss, as in measuring liquids and cloths, etc. Bat-Chhapai was a fee on the annual examination of weights and measures. A somewhat similar cess is often mentioned. There was an allied fee called Tag or Tagadi on scales for weighing bulky articles. Stamping of cloths (Chhap) manufactured for sale was a rule. Sellers of unstamped cloths were fined. For examining the cloth and putting a stamp on it, a fee was charged by the government.\n\nThe rural cesses levied from time to time were so numerous and so varied that it is not possible to give a detailed account in this section. A cursory glance on the names and nature of the manifold levies will reveal an oppressive burden on the poor cultivator. From the time that he cut his crop to the time that he sold it, he was subject to so many exactions that he could hardly have any decent living for himself and his family. The one relieving feature was the customary nature of the cesses. Their number and the amount to be given in a particular locality were fixed by custom. Some of these were levied in kind, and a few in cash. The cultivators must have been living in extreme poverty and in constant awe of the myrmidons of government who like locusts were to devour his crop. Sometimes these rights were disputed. Grievances of the people were removed by the decisions of the arbitration courts or by the orders of the king. Perquisites and fees to officers: Various officers used to take some articles or money from the villagers and townspeople.",

These officers often received shares of crops and held Watans (lands) granted by the state. Non-agriculturists supporting the village community also received shares and sometimes land. These workers were divided into twelve Balutas and twelve Alutas. The Balutas were hereditary workers crucial to village life, including carpenters, smiths, cobblers, Mangs, potters, barbers, washermen, Guravs, Joshis, Bhats, Maulanas, and others. Instead of monetary taxes, they provided services or goods to villagers and officers.  The system of twelve Balutas is documented from the 13th century onwards. An arbitration document from 1675 lists the Balutas of a Mawal village, some described as Mirasi (hereditary).  Shivaji granted a Patalki Watan to Bakaji Pharzand in 1675, with the Sanad signed by village headmen and witnessed by Balutas. The Patil, as head of village administration, allotted lands, fixed rents, collected revenue, promoted agriculture, and represented the village to the government and vice-versa. This hereditary office could be sold or purchased, sometimes resulting in multiple Patils sharing the rights and privileges. The Kulkarni (accountant) managed village records, assisted villagers with accounts, and ensured payment of dues. The Chaugula assisted village officers, the Potdar tested coins, and the Mahar, despite being an untouchable, served as a peon, watchman, and messenger. Ramoshis sometimes served as watchmen.  Each village also had an astrologer (Joshi), a Brahman or Upadhaya for religious ceremonies, and a Kazi or Dhannadhikari for legal matters. Other officials served as local and central agents.",

His subsequent reconquest efforts further destabilized any potential for a structured monetary policy. Consequently, he adopted a laissez-faire approach, allowing subjects to accept any preferred coinage, maximizing popular satisfaction.  Evidence suggests Shivaji lacked a state mint before his coronation, intending to establish one afterward.  Khafi Khan and Marathi chronicles indicate copper and Hon coinage beginning around 1664, likely utilizing existing currency forms for profit.  The state mint likely commenced operations post-June 1674, issuing pagodas and pice in Shivaji's name.  Prior to this, he presumably minted existing pagoda, larin, and pice forms, as corroborated by the Anglo-Maratha treaty's provision for free circulation of coins from Shivaji's dominion in Bombay. Contemporary practice involved licensing goldsmiths for minting, subject to government oversight, royalty payments, and quality control. Shivaji likely adhered to this system, explaining variations in his name's spelling on pice.  Government treasuries held diverse pagodas from various mints and rulers, reflecting the prevalent currency variety. Chronicles list numerous pagoda and fanam types, illustrating this diversity. Silver currency comprised rupees, Mahmudies, Ashrafis, Lans, and Rials.  Precise valuations for these coins between 1630 and 1680 are elusive, though scattered references exist. Estimating Shivaji's treasury value remains challenging.",

It came to be minted of silver and base gold in the 17th century. Its value varied from place to place. According to Fryer, the Madras pagoda was worth 8 s., the Fanam, 3d. and Cash id\n. in 1673. It follows that 32 F. were equivalent to a pagoda, and six Cash to one Fanam. But the nominal exchange was 36 Fanams to a pagoda. The Cash referred to by Dr, Fryer was only an imaginary coin of accounts, the actual Cash was different. In 1678, 74 to 78 Cash were equal to a fanam. There were sometimes double Cash 43, or single Cash 86 to a Fanam. 80 cash generally went to a fanam. It was merely a coin of account, while a 4 Cash-piece was the smallest coin struck. The number of fanams to a pagoda varied at different places at the same time. For instance, one pagoda was equal to 12 fanams at Golconda, 18 at Porto Novo, 24 at Pulicat and 36 at Madras. We also read of pagodas and jetts.* Captain Thomas Bowrey 4 who visited the Eastern Coast of India several times between 1669 and 1688, gives the prices of a pagoda from 6 to 12 s. in various places. 1.

Bowrey, The Countries Round the Bay ! Beaga 154 SmvAji THE GREAT The names of the Fanams of different types are mentioned in the Marathi chronicles. Some of these are similar in the Sabhasad and the Chitragupta chronicles ; others are different. Some coins are named after the kings and others after the mint towns. Ramarai, Hanamantrai, Katerai or Vyankatrai and Muhammad Shahi belong to the former group, while Trivaluri, Vellori, Devanhalli, Chandavari, etc. fall in the second category. The total number of the fourteen kinds of Fanams named in the Chitragupta chronicle is about 25 lakhs, while Sabhasad gives the value as 3 lakh Rons. In some mints both pagodas and fanams must have been coined, while others must have minted only one kind of coin* The text is defective and therefore exact names can not be decisively given. Trivaluri pagodas were the current coin of the Karnatic up to 1736 at least. 1 There were pagodas of Vellore and Tanjore mints too. Other types can not be traced.",

    "text": "8. Tbe Bombay Mint Englishmen used to make a large profit by coining money at Bombay and using it in the Maratha territory. They hoped that the copper pice and budgrooks would be demanded in larger quantities by the support of the Maratha government. In their treaty with Shivaji the> desired to insert a stipulation that the coins struck at Bombay should be made current by law throughout the Maratha kingdom, but the Raja deemed the article to be unnecessary, because he did not wish to force his subjects to accept those coins whereby they would be losers. His reply was very significant. He pointed out that in case the English coins were as fine and weighty as the Mogul's money, they would go current in his country. He gave them the assurance of not prohibiting their currency. The Englishmen acknowledged that Shivaji was true to his word and that the Bombay pice was quite popular, but tin budgrooks were not accepted by the people. The latter were old Goa coins struck at different times of copper, lead, tin, etc. The English at Bombay coined budgrooks of tin and desired to make much profit thereby. In 1671 sixteen budgrooks went to one pice. We have seen that the pice coined by Shivaji and the English were current in Maharashtra. The Bombay pice was so popular in the Maratha and Portuguese territories that the English proposed to use 1,500 chests of copper in minting pice in 1675. 9. The Hoarded Treasures of Shiiaji The Sabhasad and Chitragupta Chronicles and the Tarikh-i-Shivaji have presented detailed information on the wealth left by Shivaji at his death. The list is indicative of the distant expeditions which brought a vast treasure in cash and kind through plunder, chauth, tribute and gifts. Pagodas numbered about ten millions ; gold and silver in bullion weighed 250 maunds and 1,000 maunds respectively; jewels, ornaments and costly clothing were valued at more than three crores of Hons, while the total value of the arms, weapons and stores of numerous articles is estimated at two crores of Hons. The aggregate number of all the pagodas, Mohars, Putlies, Gambars and Fanams by being converted into Hons was more than a crore. There were nine crore rupees and five crore Hons worth of other goods. This seems to be a poor collection after a regime of 30 years 1 pillage and conquest. As Shivaji followed the system of paying salaries in cash to all the employees and as he had to maintain very large armies, the treasury probably showed poor balances. * The treasures amassed by Shah Jahan 3 at Agra and removed by Auraugzeb to Delhi, comprised 43 lakh gold Mohars and 2.6 crore rupees. At the capture of Golconda by Aurangzeb, its treasury * had only 68 lakh Hons, two crore rupees and 115 crore dams left in it. The wealth of Shivaji compares favourably with the fabulous wealth amassed by Akbar the Great. At his death the Mogul Emperor is said to have left 10 maunds of uncoined gold; 70 maunds of silver, 60 maunds of copper, one crore of tankas, and Ilahis worth 11 crores of rupees/ According to Smith, Akbar left forty million pounds sterling in coined money. 1.

    "text": "1. The traditioMl Hiodn system conferred a great deal of judicial autonomy upon the people. All civil and even ordinary criminal casts were decided by peoples' courts. Law-givers like Manu, Narada, Brihaspati, Yajnavalkya and Sukra have given us glimpses of the universal practice of trial by peers. According to Sukra, cultivators, artisans, artists, usurers, corporations, dancers, ascetics and thieves should decide their disputes according to the usage of their profession. The reason advanced for this practice is that it is impossible to detect them through the help of others, so they are to be found out with the assistance of persons born of them. Similarly, the foresters, merchants and soldiers were to be tried by men of their own occupation. Further, in every village cases were to be tried by the neighbours. The families ( Kulas ) , corporations { Srenis ) and communities ( Ganas ) were to try cases excepting robbery and theft. Appeals from tht, Kula lay with the Sreni and from this to the Gana. King's Court According to Sukra, the judicial officers were to try cases not decided by the Ganas. The highest court of appeal was the King's Council consisting of the king, three to seven Brahmans well-versed in law and Veda, and of judicious merchants who were made assessors. The king presided, the councillors served as investigators, while the chief justice acted as the speaker. In another place Sukra says that the imperial court should consist of the king, the chief justice, the Amatya, a Brahman and the chie priest. It was a law that the king should never singly try cases, nor were suits to be heard in secret. The king who did not perform his judicial duties well, was threatened with the dire punishment of being thrown into the darkest hell. It is evident that cheap, prompt, and impartial justice was available to the people in the villages and towns of their residence. In a few important cases the* had to go out. Even the king was THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM not allowed to try cases alone, but Only fa company with the law-lords and assessors. The fundamental rule was not to try -cases in secret but in public, an&then too with the help of experts in law and the neighbours of the parties in a suit. 2.

    "text": "The rulers recognized the decisions of the Panchayats, superimposed certain courts or invested officers with judicial powers in criminal cases. The suits between Muslims and Hindus, and between Muslims were heard by the Kazi, an expert in Muslim law. Besides local Kazis, there were Kazis at the provincial capitals and the imperial metropolis. In the Mogul Empire the Kotwals, the Governors and the Emperors took over more and more judicial powers with the strengthening of the Muslim rule, so that the people were deprived of their powers and they suffered from denial of justice during the long rule of Aurangzeb. Prof. A. S. Altekar, after a thorough study of the village communities, has arrived at the conclusion that in the north these communities lost their vitality by the introduction of the Zamindari system there. The landlords became the most influential members of the Panchayats, and thereby the headmen were deprived of their powers and position. Then the Panchayats too lost much of their power, because their decrees could not be enforced by the state. Further, certain social changes were introduced among the Hindus by the dominance of Muslims in northern India. But in the Deccan these changes could not be affected. Thus during the long Muslim rule village communities continued to exist and perform judicial and political functions in southern India. However, these grew weaker and weaker under the Muslim dominance, so that some functions were performed by the headmen of villages. They had, however, to consult the elders on important matters. The Panchayats enjoyed judicial autonomy and as such these continued to exist in villages after the fall of the Ihfaratha Empire.\nThat the peoples' courts in those days were known as Panchayats, is confirmed by a document of 1622. These were of different types. The most popular one was the Got Council consisting of the Patil, Kulkarni, the castemen, or relatives and kindreds of the disputants. Other Panchayats could be composed of the Mokadam and Twelve Balutas of the village to which the disputants belonged, or of the Makadams and Mukhtsars of the neighbouring villages. The Panchayat also consisted of the Patil, the accountant, the Twelve Balutas, and landlords of the village. In towns Shete, Mahajan, merchants and Balutas took part in the Panchayat. Thus the number of its members was not fixed. The disputants had the option to choose any form of the village Panchayat. Shivaji himself offered such an option to the parties in 1668 for the decision of a suit.",

    "text": "An arbitration held in 1669 at Tandli deserves a special notice. Therein Mokadams, the Twelve Balutas, all elders (Bap-bhaus) and hereditary peasants were present. One man was aged 115 years, several were septuagenarians, while there were also present young men only 20 years old. It must have been a wonderful sight to have a venerable old man of 115 years walking into the Council Hall and sitting for hours there. The young and the old, the rich and the poor took part in the Panchayats on a basis of equality, and thus enjoyed the threefold blessings, of equality, fraternity and liberty. Men of various castes, religions, occupations were not represented on it by election. The Panchayat was not dominated by men of any one community, religion, caste, occupation or interest. In this sense it was a democratic institution enjoying the confidence of the villagers and the towns-people. Still it was open to the parties to demand the transference of their cases to some-other village or town Panchayat, or to a higher authority.\n(a) There was a quarrel regarding the Joshiship of Kasba Shirwal. Both the parties agreed to have an arbitration in the city of Ahmednagar. The Shetes, Mahajans, etc. of that city formed a court and gave their decision. Then the victory document was issued by the authorities and the Jeshi-ship was given over to the winning party in 1577 A. D.\n(b) In an arbitration of 1613 A. D. the neighbours of town Shirwal, and the Deshmukhs and the Deshpandes of Poona, Wai, Saswad and Gunjan Maval were called as witnesses. The Deshak Council then gave its judgment.\n(c) In 1638 a case regarding division of property was decided by a Panchayat in which Dadaji Kond Dev, Subedar of Kondana, was present along with the Deshmukh, Desh Kulkarni and Gots. This decision was reversed by another Panchayat in 1657 wherein Shivaji Raje himself, his ministers and officers, Deshmukhs, Desh Kulkarnis, Gots and others were present. Thus important cases were decided by councils attended by many high dignatories of the state along with the representatives of the villages concerned. It was quite natural for the people to repose complete confidence in the impartiality of such councils. The Hindu maxim that 'the panchas are representatives of God' is similar to the Latin saying 'the voice of the people is the voice of God.'\n(d) Another famous decision was given by a Got Council in which Kond Dev was himself present. This Council is said to have based its judgment on the authority of the Mitakshara.",

The deed was endorsed by a Patil, Mokadam, all the family elders (Bap-bhau), the Balutas and hereditary cultivators. Their names and seals are put on the document. The words (Bap-bhau) 'fathers and brothers' -show that the elderly relatives of both the parties were also invited to take part in hearing the case. In ancient times there was the Kuia or Family Council, but the Panchayat of the Maratha times included the family elders, village officers, artisans and hereditary cultivators.\nThe Deshak Sabha was generally composed of Deshmukhs, Deshpandes, Patils, Balutas of the villages, and Shete-Mahajans of the towns included in the Pargana. From a document of 1652 it appears that the Deshaks included Desais, Sardesai, Desh Kulkarni, Naiks Pataks, etc. of a particular territory. Another document of 1682 shows that the Deshakas and Gots formed a Panchayat presided over by the officer of the town called Rajmudra, because he was to put his seal on the victory certificate after the decision. Officers of the Pargana like Hawaldar, Thanedar, Sarnaubat, Karkun, Sabnis, Chitnis, Karkhanis, Sargrohs, Naikwadis, etc. used to be members of this council. Its membership was not fixed, and it is not certain whether attendance in it was compulsory or not, yet this court had original and appellate jurisdiction. A case relating to several villages was decided by it. If a party was dissatisfied with the decision of the Gots, it could request the re-hearing of the case by the Deshak Sabha. Even disputes regarding the rights of Jyotishi, Dharmadhikari, etc. were decided by a Deshak Council.\nThe Brahmin Sabha was composed of one or more Brahmans who were well-known as distinguished scholars of high character. These were reputed to be fearless, impartial, God-fearing and incorruptible men. Such people were known as Dharmadhikaris. Karad, Wai, Kolhapur, Nasik, Mahuli, Paithan,. etc. were reputed to be the places of the residence of such Brahmans. Sometimes scholars from Benares were invited for deciding complicated cases. One of these councils was called by Shivaji to decide his Kshatriya origin and the right to have coronation with Vedic ceremonies.",

    "text": "1. Shivaji incarnated for the protection of Hindu religion. In the words of saint Ramdas 'there is no protector of religion like Shiva in this world. It is due to you that the Maharashtra religion has been saved.' The first and foremost ideal put by the elders before the young Shivaji was the protection of his religion from the onslaughts of the Muslims who were styled Mlechhas. For instance, his preceptor Kond Deva impressed upon his receptive mind that ' the whole earth is trampled down by the foreigners. All places, forts and towns are full of their forces. Important places should be possessed by you. Hindu kings and Hindu forces should be secured by you for your assistance. You should perform difficult deeds by supreme industry and daring. Then you will obtain the blessings of saints and the approval of God for your success.' His father Shahaji asked the blessing of the god of Jejuri for the establishment of Shivaji's rule to relieve the sufferings of gods, cows and Brahmans and to revive the ancient religion. In his famous letter to Shivaji, Shahaji expressed satisfaction at the extension of Swaraj for such a noble and high ideal. All the Marathi chronicles also emphasize the same ideal in so many places that it is impossible to reproduce all the evidences here. The Chitnis Chronicle opens with the introduction that \" the Mlechha rule uprooted the Hindu religion from the earth. Gods, Brahmans, places of pilgrimage, cows and the people, all were undergoing oppressions of various kinds. Shivaji was born as an Avatara or Incarnation for the re-establishment of religion.\" The same thing is repeated in other sections. The court poet Bhushan has given expression to the same belief in unequivocal words. His lyric poetry is full of spirit and he is at his best in extolling the work of Shivaji as the restorer and preserver of the Hindu religion. This famous poet was neither a Maratha nor a resident of Maharashtra, but a Brahman of the United Provinces. He eloquently expressed the feelings of the millions of Hindus on the superhuman work performed by Shivaji. He has described him as an incarnation of Shiva, Vishnu and Indra. The Raja is likened to Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Narsinha and Buddha of the days of yore for the establishment of religion and the destruction of irreligion. He is said to have been born for the total annihilation of the Mlechhas, whose sword was a shield for the Deccan, a wall for the Hindus, and death for the Turks. Just as the Muslim rulers took pride in calling themselves Ghazis, similarly Bhushan has given Shivaji the title of Ghazi, as he was the guardian of the Hindu religion. He has been likened to a hydra who swallowed the armies of the Moguls, or to Narsinha, the Man-lion incarnate who tore to pieces the forces of his foes. \"Shiva preserved Hinduism and the emblems on the foreheads of the Hindus. By protecting the Puranas and Smritis, he preserved the Vedic rites. He it was who prevented the capitals of the Rajput kings from falling into the hands of the Moguls. He preserved religion on this earth. He patronized men of genius. By his sword he dealt death-blows to the Moguls and kept peace in the world. He spread the Maratha fame by conquering countries after countries. Moreover, he preserved the Vedas and Puranas; nay, the name of Rama could be called out by the Hindus only through the political force of Shivaji. He was the preserver of the sacred bunch of hair on the heads of Hindus, the sacred thread on their shoulders and of the rosary in their hands. The Moguls in general and their emperor in particular were laid low. All the foes were reduced to ashes. By means of his sword Shivaji kept safe the frontiers of his kingdom. He preserved gods, temples and the family-deities. In short, he struck terror into the heart of Aurangzeb himself.\"",

    "text": "Such are the sentimental out-pourings of the famous poet Bhushan. Let us now turn to the passive saint Tukaram. He too described Shivaji as an Avatara who performed the duty of preserving religion and uprooting irreligion. The Maratha Raja was only twenty years old in 1650, when Tukaram is said to have died. Yet the saint is represented to have been so much impressed by the successes of the young dreamer that he declared him to be an Avatara or omniscient incarnation of God Shiva himself. But the militant and patriotic saint Ramdas was so deeply charmed with the personality of this struggling adventurer that he more than once described him as an incarnation of God in his inimitable language. It is not necessary to reproduce the noble sentiments expressed in the Dasabhodha—the Magnum Opus of Ramdas, but a few lines will not be out of place here. \"The power of the Mohamedans is gone The Mother Goddess who had bestowed a boon upon Shivaji has come with a bludgeon in her hand, and has killed the sinners of old in the Region of Bliss. I see the Goddess walking in the company of the King, intent upon devouring the wicked and the sinners. She has protected her devotees of old, and she will again protect them today.\" Finally, we may bring in the important evidence of Ramchandra Pant on the work of his master. Says he, \"Shivaji rescued the Dharma, and established gods and Brahmans in their due places. He created a new type of administration for his territories, forts and armies, and conducted the government without hindrance and brought it under one system of co-ordination and control. He created wholly a new order of things. He forced Aurangzeb to immerse in a sea of agony and sorrow, and acquired for himself a world-wide and well-acknowledged fame.\" \"This kingdom is for the good of the gods and Brahmans.\" It did not exist either for the selfish ends of Shivaji or for the welfare of the foreigners. All the resources of the state could be dedicated to the preservation of religion. It is now evident that Shivaji was not actuated by the selfish and devilish motive of amassing wealth by plunder, but by the highest and holiest aim of restoring and regenerating the Hindu religion and of establishing Swaraj. Shivaji considered himself a servant of religion. Consequently he had adopted a life of mendicancy and humble service for its propagation. Though he did not become a monk like Asoka, yet he did his best to protect, patronize and promulgate the Hindu religion. Like the great Asoka who made a gift of his empire to the Baudha Sangha, Shivaji is said to have made a gift of his kingdom to saint Ramdas, who returned the same to the Raja with the advice that the kingdom was not for his benefit but for the glorification of Dharma. Shivaji was required to spend his whole energy and wealth for the welfare of the Hindu religion. Thus from the beginning of his political career to the end of his life, Shivaji devoted himself heart and soul to the protection and propagation of his religion under the inspiration of his parents, his preceptor, the poets and the saints of the time.",

    "text": "2. Muslim persecution of the Hindus. The Hindus were persecuted in the Muslim states of the Deccan, though in the north on account of the political and military power of the Rajput princes, their blood relationship with the Mogul Emperors, and the commendable policy of toleration begun by Akbar and partially continued by his two successors, the Hindus escaped from persecution for about a century. The papers collected by Mr. Parasnis include a long document containing the following instructions of Muhammad Adil Shah to his successors. \"All the high posts should be reserved for the Muslims; none of these should be given to Hindus, but clerkships may be filled by them. Even the richest Hindu should not be able to claim equality with a poor Muslim. In a quarrel between a Muslim and a Hindu the former should not be punished by the Kazi for doing a wrong to the Hindu. All classes of Hindus should be subjected to the Jazia. The clerk who is to receive this tax, should remain sitting, while the tax-paying Hindu, howsoever rich he may be, should remain standing before him till the tax is paid.\" The duties of a judge (Kazi) are mentioned in two documents. In each of these he is instructed to break the Hindu idols in the temples of the Maratha people. 3. Lament of the saints. A succession of thinkers, poets and saints from the mystical Dnyandeva to the militant Ramdas lamented the decline of the Hindu religion during more than three centuries. Mr. Bhat has brought together the passages in his famous Marathi book entitled Maharashtra Dharma. It is not necessary to refer to a summary of the laments of the saints here, since sidelights have already been given in the preceding pages from the writings of Tukaram, Ramdas and Bhushan. Such is the incontestible evidence of oppressions committed upon the Hindus by the Muslim rulers in the south. Even when there was no actual persecution, the very indifference of the state to the religious, moral, intellectual and artistic activities of their subjects, led to their rapid decline. 4. Shivaji's policy of religious equality. We have seen how the Hindus had to pass their lives in the suffocating atmosphere of religious persecutions, temple-destruction, desecration of images, iconoclasm, social and communal inequalities, crushing taxes and the impoverishing ostracism from political life. In fact, they were helots in their own country. Oppression of centuries had made them fatalistic, unambitious and unprogressive. Shivaji saw the tide of persecution and oppression advancing from Delhi to the Deccan in the reign of Aurangzeb. He would have been justified in retaliating the fanaticism of the Muslim rulers and paying them in their own coins. But he was not a product of his times. He rose far above the contemporary rulers of India and Europe in following a liberal policy of religious harmony, tolerance and equality. Herein lies his claim to greatness. 5. Shivaji's protest against Aurangzeb's fanaticism. The letter written by Shivaji to Aurangzeb has been rightly described by Sir J. Sarkar as a masterpiece of clear logic, calm persuasion, and political wisdom. It enunciates certain universal principles and policies followed by the enlightened Mogul monarchs for the guidance of Aurangzeb and men of his creed. For instance, it is said that all men created by God are living examples of the nature of diverse creeds and temperament; that kingdoms prosper and the subjects become happy only when they repose in the cradle of peace and security; that Islam and Hinduism are only terms of contrast; and that in every place of worship whether it be called a mosque or a temple, the same God is worshipped by all.",

It was improper for the richest emperor on earth to covet the beggar’s bowl and levy Jazia from monks, paupers, Brahmans, mendicants, famine-stricken and ruined wretches. It was no heroism on his part to oppress ants and flies. If he possessed any valor at all, he should first collect the tax from Udaipur or from the writer of this letter. Aurangzeb had already lost many forts and provinces, and Shivaji would leave no stone unturned in further ravaging and devastating his territories in case the Emperor persisted in the policy of continuing the Jazia. The Lord of the Peacock Throne—blinded by fanaticism and imperial might, paid no heed to these convincing arguments. But Shivaji had lighted a fire which could not be easily extinguished. He had succeeded in creating an indomitable spirit of resistance, a sense of honor, an intense feeling of patriotism and an irrepressible will of independence amongst the unified Marathas, so that Aurangzeb could not suppress them with his myriads of mercenaries. The Raja set a noble example of perfect security and religious equality.",

Even former adversaries, such as Siddi Sambal and his son-in-law Siddi Misri, joined Shivaji's ranks.  Key positions within his military and naval forces were held by Muslims, including admirals like Ibrahim Khan and Daulatkhan.  Quazi Haider, a high-ranking officer under Shivaji, later became chief justice under Aurangzeb.  A Muslim governor was appointed to the strategically important Phonda after its capture.  A story from the Bakhars recounts the unwavering loyalty of a Muslim page who accompanied Shivaji to Agra and refused to betray him even under duress. Shivaji's inclusive policies extended to all branches of his administration, demonstrating his pragmatic and meritocratic approach to governance.",

They worked to reintegrate Hindus who had converted, notably Bajaji Nimbalkar, whose son was married to Shivaji's daughter.  Netaji Palkar, a prominent commander, was also welcomed back after converting to Islam. Shivaji took strong measures to prevent forced conversions by the Portuguese, including military action.  He demanded the conversion of Christian priests to Hinduism as punishment for their proselytizing activities.  A proclamation to the Hindus of Goa urged resistance against cow slaughter, temple destruction, and religious disrespect, appealing to their sense of honor and cultural preservation. Historical accounts suggest Shivaji's actions influenced the Portuguese to moderate their conversion efforts. He also intervened to secure the release of Brahmins kidnapped by the Siddis, showing his commitment to protecting his co-religionists.  Shivaji's actions in promoting reconversion were ahead of his time, given the continuing resistance to such practices even centuries later.",

    "text": "Under the free atmosphere of the Devagiri Yadavas towards the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century, there arose a galaxy of saints who were the founders and propagators of mysticism in Maharashtra. Dnyandeva, a Brahman ( 1271-1294 ); Namadeva, a tailor; Gora,. a potter; Samvata, a gardener; Narahari, a goldsmith; Choka, an untouchable; Sena, a barber; Janabai, a maid-servant; Kanhopatra, a dancing girl; these form a group of teachers who were working: together for the spread of democratic mysticism. It has been aptly remarked that ' the gates of the Bhakti school were ever open. Whoever entered was hailed as a brother, nay more, was honoured as a saint. All were santas. Age and sex, caste and class, breathed not in this equalising air. For five successive centuries, Maharashtra was the abode of that noblest and truest of all Democracies, the Democracy of the Bhakti School.' ' 2. Results of religions persecution The fall of the Yadava Empire, the foundation of the Bahamani kingdom and the aggressions of Muslims in the Deccan, smothered the light of Bhakti lit up by the said saints. With the spread of Islam, oppression grew apace. The Muslim rulers in India demolished the temples of the Hindus and Jains; built mosques instead; burnt libraries ; abolished Mathas or religious houses and monasteries; discouraged education, literature and art; and tried numerous means to tempt and force Hindus into their fold. The process of conversion went on increasing with the growth and deepening of the Muslim rule in India. The Aryan culture and social structure found no place in the new polity. Classical literature bad a rapid decline. Thousands of schools died out or were forcibly closed down. The masses began to sink deeper and deeper into illiteracy and ignorance. In fact, the study of letters had perished for alt except a few Brahmans, merchants and upper classes.",

    "text": "The lamp of Bhakti remained flickering for two centuries. (a) During the 16th century the dissensions of the Deccani and foreign Muslims led the kings and the court parties to depend upon the good-will of their Hindu subjects and the Hindu nobility. Persecution and intolerance naturally declined in the Muslim states. (b) The presence of high Hindu officials and lords in the Deccan states blunted the edge of persecution, (c) Then there arose a constant danger of Mogul invasion of the Deccan from the close of the 16th century. The rulers of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Oolconda were naturally anxious to win the sympathy of their subjects and thereby continue the existence of their states, otherwise these were in danger of being absorbed in the Mogul Empire. All these political causes produced an atmosphere of freedom of thought and of religious liberty. In such a liberal atmosphere, Ekanatha, Tukaram and their disciples preached mysticism, condemned caste, and expounded means for the purification of the Hindu religion. This movement received special impetus from Shahji and his son Ekoji in the Karnatic and by Shivaji and his successors in Maharashtra. While on one side the reformation movement served to further the cause of Swaraj, on the other, it was strengthened and advanced by the Swaraj. In fact, reformation and Swaraj are causally related to each other. 4. The Renaissance With the establishment of Swaraj a new era dawned upon Maharashtra. The patronage shown to scholars and saints by Shahji and Shivaji produced a renaissance here. No other period of history can be said to be so rich in saints, seers and scholars, poets, prophets and philosophers as that of Shahji and Shivaji. They released forces of life in all spheres. The minds of Hindus were filled with the joy of political liberty and religious freedom from foreign oppression. The elevating spirit of security -of religion and property permeated the people. Released from the shackles of centuries, the Hindu mind could have free flights in the spiritual sphere, and in the realms of poetry and literature. There was a real quickening of intellectual, literary and religious life in the whole of Maharashtra, when persecution was replaced by encouragement and indifference by patronage. The period became amazingly remarkable for the flowering of the genius, so that seers, scholars and saints achieved such a fame that they have left their glory to our own day.",

    "text": "These saints began to shed spiritual light by speaking to the people in their own tongue, instead of in the Sanskrit language which was an all-India medium for the- learned alone. During the 16th century pious men well-known for their saintly character, devotional spirit, spiritual gifts and a forceful literary style, preserved Hinduism by popularizing such classics as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita and the Puranas. They stimulated men's minds for spiritual culture, created a love for their ancient religion and polity; and finally blunted the edge of Muslim intolerance. Thus this reformation movement was miraculously effective in safeguarding the Hindu religion and neutralizing the aggressions of Islam. It created a valuable literature in Marathi; served to unify the nation by removing caste-distinctions; raised the Shudras and the outcastes to the social status and spiritual power of the Brahmans ; improved the status of women and sanctified family life ; brought about a reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims and thus made the whole nation more tolerant than before; it checked the excesses of polytheism ; it condemned all external forms of religion by emphasizing love and faith as the means of realizing God. In the words of the late Justice Ranade,. \" it tended in all these ways to raise the nation generally to a higher level of capacity both of thought and action, and prepared it, in a way no other nation in India was prepared, to take the lead in re-establishing a united native power in the place of foreign domination.\" 1 C.

Thereby the cult of Vithoba was revived and strengthened by him in Maharashtra.

No work of Narasinha Saraswati is so far known, but he was responsible mainly for the spread of devotion to Dattatreya in Maharashtra, The Guru-Charitra is the sacred book of this sect. Janardan Swami ( 1504-1575 ), the famous Guru of Ekanatha, was in the service of a Muhammedan officer in the fort of E)evagiri. He was a great devotee of Dattatreya, and is known in Maharashtra, more on account of his numerous disciples than by any literary work.",

    "text": "Even Muslims were so much inspired by the new spiritual atmosphere that they became worshippers of Vithal or Vishnu. Shekh Muhammad of Chambhargonda is one of those recluses. His Marathi works in poetry like Pavana Vijaya, Dnyanasagar, etc. possess a real merit. His followers observe the Ramzan an4 Ekadashi fasts up to this day. Shekh Sultan and Shekh Farid were the other Muslim saints of the period. . Bawa Yaqut of Kelstii near Janjira, a Muslim saint of repute* was approached by the Raja for blessings to capture the fort of Rajatrar.\n\nShivaji came into special contact with a few prominent saints. Mauni Bawa or ' the silent saint ' of Maharashtra who had established himself at Patgaon near the formidable fort of Rangna in the inaccessible hills of the Sahyadri, was one of them. His fame for piety spread all over Maharashtra. Shivaji went to him to seek benediction fdr his success in the Karnatic expedition. This saint gave him an assurance of victory. Therefore on his return Shivaji made SL donation of Rs. 400 per annum for distributing free meals to all visitors of the Math. It still continues under the patronage of the Kolhapur rulers. Sitalpuri, a very pious Sanyasi of Benares, was invited and made his preceptor by Shivaji. He was allowed to stay at the holy town of Sangameshwar, afterwards famous for the capture of Sambhaji by the Moguls. He is named Achalpuri by Chitnis (78). Parmanand Gosavi of Poladpur and 'Narain Ashram of Trimbakeshwsr were highly honoured and served by Shivaji. Similarly, another Hindu saint Parmanand was also approached by Shivaji ' for benedictions. The famous Hindu poet Bhushan has earned a great reputation by writing stirring heroics on the Raja. He was along with his elder brother first in the service of Aurangzeb, but he left the latter in disdain and accepted the patronage of the Maratha ruler whom he immortalized in his ' Shiva Bhushan ' and ' Shiva Bhavani.'",

He was first patronized by Sbahji in the Karnatic, and then by Shivaji in Maharashtra. He planned a historical Purana of 100 chapters on the life of Shivaji and his ancestors. Only 31 chapters are now available of this epic, and these bring the story of Shivaji's life up to 1660. The remaining chapters are not yet available* The poet was intimately connected with the court and politics of Shivaji's time. He accompanied or followed his master to Agra and was arrested by the Moguls in Dec. 1666. Nothing further is known of his life and work, but his sons and grandsons were gifted with poetic genius and these were patronized by the successors of Shivaji. Gafabhat who was known as the Brahmadeva and Vyas of his age, wrote a historic poem entitled the \" Rise of the Sun Shiva.\" It was a work on religious and social duties. Another work of his on polity called \" Samayanaya \" is traced by Aufrecht in the MSS. Library of Florence. Krishna Jyetisbi was entrusted with the work of correcting the Calendar, so that he wrote out ' Karna-Kaustubha.' i Taka, a disciple of Brahmanand, used to live at Satara. This Sanskrit scholar translated Sanskrit works into Marathi. Raghanath Haaamote wrote the ' Vyavahara Kosha ' wherein the Persian and Arabic words then current in Muslim India were translated into Marathi and Sanskrit. All the words then current in political circles for administrative, legal, judicial, financial and military affairs have been rendered into Sanskrit or contemporary Marathi. It is indeed a most useful contribution. He also wrote a Marathi work on Nala and Damayanti. Then Gorfod lanre, the author of \" Shiva-Rajyabhisheka -Kalpataru \" and the rival of Gagabbat, deserves a passing notice. Even at the Tanjoce court in the Karnatic there were contemporary scholars who wrote works in Saaskrftor Marathi 494 SHIVAJJ THE GREAT Besides Rfighunarh Pandit, Madfcav, Bhimaswami, Afta&d Taaaya, and Gosavi Nandaq were well-known amongst them. 1 ' This large number of saints purified the spiritual atmosphere bf their time from 1640 to 1690 with their sublime writings and preachings. Besides these celebrities, there must have been a great many ordinary poets. AH these produced a vast literature on a variety of subjects. An idea of their literary activity can be had from the fact that Dasopant's works cover two lakh couplets, while Ekanatha, Shivakalyan, Krishna Yadnyavalki contributed approximately sixty thousand couplets each. 17. Shi?aji inpplied the urge to reformation : Mr. Justice E. Abbot has partially stated the truth by remarking that ' the light spreads all through that century; and it cannot be thought that Shivaji escaped from being touched by it, while seeking to carry out what he considered his life's work.' Shivaji was not merely an on -looker or a passive subject to receive these religious and spiritual influences, but he was supplying the necessary urge by various means, so that the wonderful flowering of genius and outburst of spiritualism were mainly due to him. By starting the new department of religion under a minister he encouraged scholars and religious men to devote themselves to study and spiritual unfoldment. Hundreds of religious men were relieved of worldly cares by his munificent gifts* He gave five lakh pagodas to Keshav Swami at Hyderabad.* The holy men were protected, encouraged and enthused by the royal patron to carry on their religious propaganda free from Muslim persecution. There was a universal feeling of joy and pride in the country that a saviour of Hindu religion was born in the person of Shivaji. Numerous saintly persons devoted themselves to revive with unusual enthusiasm the dethroned and detested religion of the Hindus.

    "section": "18. The contribution of saints to Swaraj",
    "text": "18, tfce cmrtfftitiea ef saioU to Swaraj Ekanath*, Tukarain; and their disciples form a long series of saints who boldly protested against the decline in Hinduism and passionately taught Bhakti ot devotion to God as the source of a true religion. They encouraged Hindu unity by denouncing caste and Brahman ascendency, by creating racial pride, love for ancient heroes, a strong sentiment of the superiority of Hindu culture and religion, and by a detestation of foreign rule. The preparation of such a background by 1650 was of no small value to the cause of Swaraj. But a new spirit was infused by Ramdas who should be styled as the father of aggressive and victorious Hinduism. He was the founder of the new order known after him. He popularized the worship of Rama the epic conqueror of Havana, of Balabhim who may be said to be an incarnation of physical force, and of Maruti Rama's devoted servant ever-ready to serve him at the risk of his own life. Victory* virility and service were the three principles of his new religion which was to save Hinduism from foreign tyrants. He inspired numerous disciples with this new cult, made them heads of Mathas or monasteries for the propagation of the creed, established new gods and-built new temples. He was first and foremost a saint devoted to mysticism, Vedanta, social and religious reforms. It was his Bhakti and saintly character which attracted thousands of men and women to him. Occasionally, during his talks, sermons and poems he gave harrowing accounts of the persecution of the Hindus, and thereby prepared the people for overthrowing the Muslim yoke and establishing their own kingdom instead. Riv. Deming has rightly remarked that \" in this respect the teaching of Ramdas does differ from that of Tukaram and the other Bhaktas.\" Ramdas was veritably a saint of unique originality, mystic vision and superhuman energy. By dint of saintly cfanfecter and charming eloquence, he attempted to create among the people- ^patriotic sentiments and a martial spirit to avenge the wrongs done by the alien rulers and to defend their own religion and country Jrom the Mlechhas. The politicaj propaganda was, however. Iff SmvAji Tut GREAT * secondary ideal. In summing up his mission, he has unequivocally stated that the foremost ideal was the exposition of God and the second object of the cult was the explanation of political policies. 1 Thus he was not merely a great mystic like Ekanatha or Tukaram, but an inspiring patriot of bis time with a wonderful power of organization. The establishment of numerous mathas throughout the length and breadth of the country gives him a definitely distinctive role from the mystic saints preceding him. He taught to his followers that \" political activities should be carried out secretly and carefully, and associations, wherever possible, should be organized upon a basis of equality.\"* Rev. Deming has aptly observed that Ramdas entered heart and sou) into the task of reviving the work of Shivaji in this regard and evidently approved of the secret political activities which helped to free Maharashtra from the Moslem yoke. The relation of Shivaji and Ramdas and their mutual influence upon each other have been discussed by several scholars. Here it will suffice to say that Shivaji used to pay respect to all saints. He came into personal contact with a few prominent Bhaktas, and Ramadas was one of them. During the last eight years of his life he was more in touch with this Swami than with any other saint. Hence he must have been influenced to some extent in his religious and political ideals by the advice of saint Ramdas.",

    "section": "Early Maratha Warfare and Shivaji's Rise",
    "text": "pass through inaccessible jungles, hide in the trees, live for days on Bajri bread and forest fruits. The Mogul forces were no match for such hardy people. Dr. Fryer, Khafi Khan, the Portuguese and contemporary writers have borne testimony to the fact that the precipitous and soaring hills favoured the success of Shivaji. His strength lay in the everlasting hills, but he took care that their peaks and spurs were crowned with a multitude of forts. \"He made these forts the terror of all India; the cradle of his nation; the basis of his conquests ; the steps of his ambition, his home and his joy ; many of them he built, all of them he strengthened.\" We must not exaggerate the importance of these physical features. The impregnability of forts and the inaccessibility of the mountainous regions could not help the Marathas against the English. Several empires have risen and died in the Deccan inspite of these physical advantages. Heroes like Shivaji took advantage of the physical strength of the country and founded empires, while their successors did not have the genius and nerve to maintain the same.\n\nNext to the natural advantages, the character of the people and their institutions are said to have played an important role in the movement of Swaraj. The system of village communities and Panchayats coupled with the Ryotwari tenure of land held in full ownership by small peasant proprietors maintained democratic tendencies in the people. They cultivated habits of mutual helpfulness and independence which had stood them to good account in past times. But it is ignored that these institutions were in existence for many centuries during which several empires saw the light of day and ceased to be. Consequently there is no inherent power in these institutions and habits to give independence and self-government to the people. The magic power of a Shivaji is needed to utilize these forces in the establishment of an independent kingdom.\n\nThe third contributory factor was the reformation. We have already shown that the religious revival in Maharashtra really began from the 17th century, and became effective from about 1630, the time when Shahji led the movement of Swaraj. It gathered strength only under the inspiration and patronage of Shivaji. The Swadharma and Swaraj movements are inter-related, each contributing its strength to the other. The influence of the reformation should not be exaggerated.\n\nThe dominance of the Hindu element in the Muslim monarchies is represented to have formed a potent factor in the revolutionary movement. Thousands of Hindu officers were no doubt employed in the civil and military departments. There were numerous feudal lords and chieftains who could bring retainers for the service of the Sultan. But we should not forget that the Ghorpades, Mohites, Mores, Ghatges, Shirkes, Gujars, Dalvis, Savants, and a host of other Hindu chiefs were opposed to the revolutionary Shivaji. They were faithful to the Bijapur government and were, naturally afraid of the loss of their estates and offices by the failure of the revolution. The Hindu gentry was not a source of strength but of weakness and opposition to Shivaji. He conquered them one by one, and thus by force of arms brought them under his sway. A few families were won over by his conciliatory policy and marital connections. Nothing succeeds like success. His wonderful exploits must have ultimately drawn thousands of warriors and officers, but in the beginning of his career he had to face strong opposition from the Hindu lords and chiefs.",

    "text": "The main causes of the rise and progress of Shivaji may be said to be (1) misgovernment in the Adil Shahi state, (2) continuous wars, the financial drain, and internal weakness of this Deccan kingdom, (3) the incompetence and corruptibility of Muslim officers, and (4) the conquest of its exports by the Marathas. (5) Guerilla tactics and the lightning speed of the Maratha armies were the most potent causes of the hero's success. (6) Moreover, there was the commanding genius of the adventurer exploiting every weakness of the enemy. Each one of these factors will be briefly explained hereafter.\n\nMisgovernment in the Bijapur kingdom: The Dutch from Wingarla write that the government of this country is so unsettled and tyrannous that it is impossible to commit it to paper. On other occasion it is remarked that 'the feudal system gave rise to abuse, extortion and grinding down of the population.' Tyranny, oppression and corruption of lords, governors and officials inflicted untold miseries on the people. Their suffering was deepened by the frequent plundering and devastation caused by constant wars with Shivaji and the Moguls. Both had to be given tributes and contributions. This economic drain depleted the state-treasure and bled the people white by oppressive taxes.\n\nVenality of officers: Shivaji clearly observed that every man had his price. He lavishly squandered wealth in corrupting the greatest generals and highest officials of the Bijapur and Mogul Empires. How Raja Jaswant Singh was won over with rich presents, has been humorously expressed by Da Guarda. \"With these marvellous cannons Sevagy fought and reduced that fortress.\" The incompetence and venality of the Mogul and Bijapur generals were frequently noticed by the contemporary writers. The unequivocal evidence of the Bombay Council deserves notice: \"Bahadur Khan, the king's foster brother who remained in Deccan many years, attending Sevajee's motions, but effected little materially against him, by reason of being corrupted by him, feeding frequently his most insatiable avarice with gold.\" \"They lie effiminately at house fearful of wetting their tender skinns, our Maharajah plays his game soe wisely as to destroy, robb, plunder, devastate and ruiae the major and best part of their kingdom.\"\n\nShivaji's conquest of sea-ports in the Konkan deprived Bijapur Kingdom of the benefits of the sea-borne trade, and specially stopped the coming of the Arabian steeds which were the life of its cavalry. Only a distant town Porto Novo beyond Tuticorin was left to Bijapur for the import of horses, but even this place was captured by the Marathas during the Karnatic expedition. Thus an irreparable damage was inflicted upon the military strength of the Adil Shahi kingdom.",

    "text": "He consolidated the kingdom by putting down the feudal nobles by partially depriving them of their powers and incomes, and by razing down their castles. He was the creator of an invincible national army, and the father of the Maratha navy. He encouraged maritime commerce by various means. He reformed the administrative system by creating a cabinet and allotting various departments to the eight ministers. His administrative, financial, revenue, military reforms place him in the rank of the greatest statesmen. He quickened the pace of the reformation and renaissance through his inspiration and generous patronage. His foreign policy compels admiration: (a) He maintained friendly relations with the European nations for the defence of his navy and merchant-shipping, for the protection of his coast, for encouraging maritime trade, and for obtaining war-materials. (b) He was extremely far-sighted in his policy towards the two Muslim states of the Deccan. He protected them from the inroads of the Mogul by invading the imperial territory, and often rendered military assistance to the Deccan rulers whenever they were threatened by the Moguls. Thus the latter were unable to conquer either the Muslim states or the newly created Maratha kingdom on account of his military power, foresight and diplomacy. He was the introducer of the Chauth system which later on became so universal as an indication of Maratha supremacy. This blackmail collected by the Maratha officers and troops from the people at the point of the lance established an imperium in imperio in the Mogul provinces. The people lived in constant fear of destruction of their crops and devastation of their towns and villages by the Maratha looters. Thus this system struck a mortal blow at the allegiance of the Mogul subjects and the integrity of the empire. Shivaji was highly religious, devotional to the point of renunciation, stoically simple, reverential to Brahmans, saints and scholars. He was free from all the vices of wealth and power. He was a most devoted son, a loving husband, a compassionate father and a benevolent brother. He was not only chivalrous to women, but championed their honour throughout his life. In short, his piety, benevolence and wisdom captivated the hearts of all. Mr. Kincaid has emphasized the nobility of his personal character as the main cause of his signal success. “Such was the “Liberator” of the Maratha nation a man of talents so varied, of life so regular, of disposition so tolerant, that it is little wonder that his countrymen came to regard him not as one of themselves but as the incarnation of God. His kingdom has long passed away; but the Maratha people still worship his image at Rajgad and Malwan; just as the Athenians, long after their empire had ceased to exist, continued to worship with pathetic devotion the memory of Theseus.” He had a charming personality which compelled admiration and devotion of all those who came into his magnetic circle, so that they were ever ready to sacrifice their lives for him and his sacred cause. The magic of his personality is excellently proved by the fact that not a single officer or general betrayed him. His men could not be corrupted by the wily Aurangzeb, while the Maratha hero was constantly corrupting the Mogul generals. Even when Shivaji and his son were prisoners at Agra or when he was absent for more than a year in the Karnatic, there was not a single person who turned traitor to the country.",

    "text": "He so consolidated the kingdom and instilled such an intense loyalty spirit amongst his officials that even after his death, they could successfully defy the monstrous efforts of Aurangzeb, the greatest monarch of his time on earth, during the twenty years’ war of liberation. He awakened such a patriotic spirit and created such a deep sense of splendid unity among the people that with leonine courage and grim determination they took up the great challenge to their independence, a challenge embodied in the ghastly tangible reality of the vast Mogul armies, continuously pouring into Maharashtra for twenty years, and fighting under the personal guidance of the mighty Emperor himself. Hundreds of consummate commanders, brilliant statesmen, master politicians, undaunted soldiers trained in the school of Shivaji foiled all the Herculean efforts of the Great Mogul by such deeds of heroism, sacrifice, loyalty, political sagacity, patriotism as are scarcely equalled in the annals of the world. They emerged triumphant from this titanic struggle, and shook the majestic fabric of the extensive empire of the Great Mogul to its very foundations. His greatness lies in creating a new Hindu kingdom against innumerable odds. From the fall of the Yadavas of Devagiri, the Hindus of Maharashtra had been under Muslim domination for three hundred years. The foreign rule became more and more deeply rooted, and threatened to swallow the whole of the Southern Peninsula by the disintegration of the Hindu Empire of Vijayanagar. The Hindus of the Deccan made no efforts for three centuries to throw off the Muslim yoke. In Northern India several Hindu kingdoms survived in Rajputana but all of them had become vassals of the Delhi Empire. Even the Solar Dynasty of Udaipur bowed to the inevitable and accepted the suzerainty of the Great Mogul. The large resources of Jodhpur, Jaipur and many other Rajput states were utilized in subjugating the Deccan, in destroying Shivaji, and in swallowing the Muslim states. Thus the Maratha rebel had no predecessor to show him an example of an independent kingdom, nor had he any assistance from the Hindu rulers of the day. On the contrary, every important Hindu ruler of southern and northern India allied with his enemies to crush him. Under such circumstances, the creation of Hindu Swaraj appeared to be an extraordinary feat of a superhuman genius. “His native genius, alone and unaided, enabled him to found a compact kingdom, an invincible army, and a grand and beneficent system of administration.” The Hindus naturally looked upon this founder of the Maratha empire, the restorer of their religion, the defender of their ancient culture as a superman, or an incarnation of God. Many heroes are deified and paid divine honours after their death, but here was a man who in his lifetime was looked upon by his people as God incarnate. The Sabhasad Chronicle, written only ten years after his death, may be considered to be contemporary. The evidence of Tukaram and Ramdas is concerned with the threshold of his career. The saints propagated this belief among the masses to help the national movement of Swaraj and Swadharma. No one can doubt the crucial importance of the saintly assertions to deify Shivaji in his early career. The young rebel must have captured the imagination of the saints and the masses with his noble ideals of freeing Maharashtra from the foreign yoke and of relieving the Hindu religion from Muslim oppression. Shivaji, the liberator of Maharashtra from the Muslim rule, the deliverer of the Hindus from the oppressions of their rulers, the saviour of the Hindu religion, the apostle of religious freedom, the founder of the Maratha kingdom, the successor of the Vijayanagar Emperors, the father of the Maratha navy, the creator of reformation in the Deccan, has rightly been the idol of every Hindu home. This political prophet, this grand rebel against Mogul domination, this lion of Maharashtra, this creator of Indian nationalism, this pole-star of India’s freedom will for ever remain a source of inspiration to all. Such a remarkable personality does not belong to any one nation and time. He occupies a high place in the galaxy of the great conquerors of the world, of remarkable nation-builders, of the greatest patriots, and of the immortal fighters for the independence of their mother-lands.",
