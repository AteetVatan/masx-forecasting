    "text": "This thesis examines George F. Kennan’s coherence and consistency in formulating the containment strategy. Kennan’s work evolved through different stages depending on the political context and his position.  The aim is not to criticize but to understand his consistency and the reasons for any changes.  Initially, during the Long Telegram and National War College lectures, containment was an idea, not a structured strategy. The Long Telegram allowed him to develop this idea at the National War College.  His 1947 appointment as Director of the Policy Planning Staff provided the opportunity to build his advocated strategy: containing Soviet expansion through the economic rehabilitation of Western Europe, Germany, and Japan.  Kennan consistently recommended political-economic containment, specifically avoiding military intervention. The “X” article distorted his views, creating a perception of contradiction. Kennan tried to counter this by emphasizing political-economic policies, but his influence waned, and implementing a coherent strategy became difficult. Extending containment beyond strategic areas, rejecting his Program A, the continued division of Europe, and the increasing militarization of containment all hindered Kennan’s strategy. By 1953, Kennan and his vision of containment had been defeated.  Kennan’s Long Telegram gained attention in Washington, offering an analysis of Soviet behavior and a suggested US strategy.  It significantly impacted senior officials and marked a shift in the State Department’s perspective.  James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy, supported the approach and circulated the telegram.  Kennan further developed the strategy at the National War College.  His lectures there represent his early views on the Soviet Union and US objectives.",

    "text": "Kennan’s 1947 appointment as Director of the Policy Planning Staff allowed him to influence policy directly.  The Policy Planning Papers, often blueprints for NSC documents, reveal Kennan’s intended structure and implementation of containment. Analyzing these papers, alongside the Long Telegram and National War College lectures, clarifies his early thinking. The “X” article, published in July 1947, drew criticism and was seen as conflicting with Kennan’s recommendations and problematic for his containment strategy.  The question is whether the article marked a significant shift in the strategy’s implementation and focus. A criticism of the “X” article was its failure to limit containment to vital strategic areas, potentially overextending US resources. This connects to Kennan’s strategy for Germany and Japan, identified in 1947 as key to long-term US security. Their reconstruction was deemed crucial for a stable balance of power and protecting US interests from Soviet expansionism. Examining the policies and recommendations for these countries will assess their consistency with the outlined strategy and overall coherence.",

    "text": "The containment strategy's progression saw an increasing militarization, a significant departure from Kennan’s original vision.  Policies like the Truman Doctrine, the Atlantic Pact (NATO), and NSC-68 reflect this shift.  Events like the Berlin Crisis, the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Korean War likely contributed to an exaggerated perception of Soviet aggression, leading to a military focus. This militarization intensified, moving further from Kennan's political-economic approach.  This thesis will analyze this militarization, examining its impact on US foreign policy and its divergence from Kennan’s initial recommendations.",

    "text": "proliferation of nuclear weapons and the explosion of the first Soviet atomic bomb. There will be an examination of Kennan‟s response to these changes and the militarised response to perceived Soviet aggression; it will enable us to assess how this affected his overall consistency and coherence. It leads to the argument that the changes made to the containment strategy appeared to be a rejection of his ideas and policy recommendations, which finally led to his resignation from the Policy Planning Staff in 1949. Following his resignation, Kennan continued to work for the administration and it was during this period in the January of 1950 that he made a vital contribution to the debate on nuclear weapons, where he drafted a paper on the International Control of Atomic Weaponry. The containment strategy had become complex with the introduction of nuclear weapons, especially with the US development of the Hydrogen bomb; these developments changed the world situation. Kennan recognised the changes occurring within the containment strategy and refocused his attention on the growing issue of nuclear weapons. It is this subject that is the focus of the next part of the examination. The strategy of containment continued to be the dominant focus throughout the Cold War despite the change in administrations; the differences became noticeable in the direction that the strategy was moving in. The militarised tone was a reaction to the heightened tensions that had been created by developments made in atomic weaponry and US intervention in the Korean War. It meant that the new administration under Eisenhower had to make a decision on which approach they would take in US foreign policy. It is this subject that this assessment will examine because this was the final time that Kennan had an active role in developing and recommending a strategy. This role was carried out under the Eisenhower administration, where Kennan was requested to participate in a project called „Operation Solarium.‟ Operation Solarium was a project Eisenhower had requested to be carried out to collate information and provide recommendations on how the US should respond to the Soviet threat. It is important to examine the approach that Kennan took whilst leading Task Force A because it will show whether his ideas were consistent after he had resigned from his official role in the administration. Kennan‟s most influential years were between the years of 1946 and 1949 due to his direct involvement in the formulation of strategy, however the work that he was involved in after this period is important to our overall assessment of Kennan‟s approach to strategy. This part of the examination will give a complete picture of whether he maintained the same views and made recommendations that were following those he had originally outlined from 1946. The aim of this thesis is to assess how coherent and consistent Kennan was toward the strategy of containment. It involves examining a large amount of evidence to provide a researched and balanced argument.",

    "text": "There is no doubt that Kennan had a vital and direct influence on Policy Planning between 1947 and 1949. The Policy Planning Papers had the largest direct impact on the direction of foreign policy and it is from these recommendations and policies introduced by Kennan‟s staff that we will be able to assess if it followed a coherent approach. The issues surrounding European and Japanese recovery, the division of Europe, German reunification and atomic weaponry remained high on his list of priorities, and he continued to discuss the issues and concerns on these subjects throughout the Cold War. The aim is to develop an understanding of Kennan‟s strategy of containment. The thesis will conclude that at the start of his role as a Policy Planner he was able to influence the implementation of a coherent strategy that was consistent with his earliest work. Problems occurred with the publication of the X Article which received a significant amount of criticism due to the ambiguous language used that led to what Kennan considered to be misinterpretations. The role of a Policy Planner required Kennan to assess other areas of concern that fell outside the borders of those specified as vitally strategic areas. It was impossible for other areas to be easily dismissed, providing an explanation as to why US foreign policy became involved in issues that were not previously classified as vital to the containment strategy. Each situation was examined on an individual basis and therefore meant that the US would undoubtedly become involved in many international situations. Kennan‟s lack of influence began to show as the direction of the strategy began to change. Kennan openly opposed the Truman Doctrine and NATO; his disagreements with the Secretary of State Dean Acheson on Germany and NSC-68 were the main issues that finally led to his resignation. The change to the focus of the containment strategy and the continued division of Germany and therefore Europe formalised the final rejection of his strategy. By 1949 his influence was notably declining and his voice no longer appeared to carry the same weight it had back in 1946, suggesting this was one reason for his inability to implement a consistent and coherent strategy. Kennan started with a consistent approach as he began developing the containment strategy; the thinking behind his strategy remained consistent during and after his time in the State Department. It is clear how he thought it should be implemented, but misinterpretations, perceptions and changes in his own thinking contributed to an incoherent strategy. As the strategy was constantly developed, it became clear that his ideas were slowly being rejected by higher officials most notably Dean Acheson, this again made it difficult for Kennan to implement the strategy in a coherent manner. CHAPTER ONE: THE EARLY YEARS 1946-1947 George Kennan had not yet created a new strategy; the Long Telegram was the key document that brought Kennan to the attention of Senior Policymakers. It was this document that assisted Kennan‟s return to Washington where he was in a position at the National War College where he would have direct contact with policymakers and officials who were responsible for structuring and formulating US foreign policy. The position he accepted at the National War College provided the opportunity to develop his work without the pressure of being mandated to create a set strategy.",

    "text": "the Soviet threat and how he thought the US should counter that threat. The lectures Kennan delivered established him as a leading expert on the Soviet Union; it was during this period that his influence started to grow. Consistent with the Long Telegram, the lectures show that he still believed that it was ideology which had a key role to play in Soviet policy. In one particular lecture he argued that “the role of ideology in Soviet political psychology, while of tremendous importance, is not primarily that of a basic determinant of political action. It is rather a prism through which Soviet eyes must view the world.” This had been one of the dominant themes in the telegram and he continued this in these lectures. Following the discussion in the Long Telegram, which focused on military strength, Kennan gave a lecture in September 1946 entitled “Measures Short of War”. During this lecture he discussed the view that the US needed to use economic, psychological and political measures, to counter the Soviet threat and along with these measures the US needed to show a preponderance of strength. Its focus was on measures short of war, providing great insight into his continued thinking, which was consistent with the telegram. The focus of this lecture centred on US strength and how this strength needed to be a combination of political, economic and moral strength. Kennan did not suggest that the US should implement a military policy to counter communist expansion; he wanted the US to achieve economic recovery in key regions to combat this threat. What he did advocate was the need to maintain US strength because there was a requirement to maintain a strong military to ensure that key objectives could be met. My personal conviction is that if we keep up our strength, if we are ready to use it, and if we select the measures short of war with the necessary wisdom and co-ordination, then these measures short of war will be all the ones that we will ever have to use to secure the prosperous and safe future of the people of this country. This indicates Kennan was not advocating for the Truman Administration to implement a military policy against the Soviet Union, but he accepted the need for the visibility of a strong military to show the Soviet Union that they were prepared to meet any of their threats to limit the likelihood of direct conflict. Kennan believed the US needed to implement a policy that would encourage change in the Soviet Union that was in the interests to both countries. There are similarities between the Long Telegram and these lectures and they show that there was consistency. There is no evidence to suggest that Kennan thought that Truman needed to follow a military policy. The main point that is clear in all of these sources is that the US possessed the power and ability to solve the issues without resorting to direct military conflict. What they needed to do was to show their readiness to use force against Soviet pressure if necessary. Even though Kennan did not want the containment strategy to have a military focus, there is no doubt that he believed that these policies needed to be supported by the strength of the military. The establishment of the military was important so that US strength could be shown to act as a deterrent. At no time whilst positioned at the National War College did he argue that the foreign policy of the US should be focused exclusively on the military. The dominant focus in Kennan‟s early thinking was the belief that the Soviets were not looking to begin another war and did not intend on resorting to war to achieve their objectives. This was shown when he delivered the lecture on “Measures Short of War”. The early lectures indicate that Kennan did not want the main focus of US foreign policy to be purely on military measures, because war was not the immediate threat. Instead he focused on Soviet intentions in which he opposed the idea that what the Soviets wanted was another war. This was a subject that he would later return to in his Memoirs. Kennan developed his thinking to a certain stage by 1947 where he was convinced that it was the Economic rehabilitation of Western Europe which should be the primary focus of foreign policy, and to achieve this Germany had to feature in the main plan. These lectures prove that Kennan did not expect the outbreak of war and consistently maintained that the US needed to meet the Soviet threats through political and economic measures, supported by the strength of the military. What these lectures help to demonstrate is the coherent thinking in Kennan‟s developing views on the Soviet threat. The lectures were a continuation of the Long Telegram and therefore show consistency in his approach. The early work of Kennan‟s was coherent as both of these opportunities were used to provide a full analysis of the Soviet threat where he was able to shape officials perceptions, encouraging them to follow the strategy he had started to develop. There was a transition in Kennan‟s approach when he was invited to join the administration in an official capacity as the Director of the Policy Planning Staff. This role made him responsible for recommending strategy.",

    "text": "Kennan‟s work at the National War College during 1947 was not a representation of US foreign policy, but an analysis of his view towards US-Soviet relations. The position he held enabled him to influence officials and re-shape the perceptions held within the administration. On May 5th 1947, the Secretary of State, General George Marshall invited Kennan to join the administration as the Director of the Policy Planning Staff. The change in roles placed Kennan in an official position within the bureaucracy, with the responsibility of leading a team of officials who would assess, analyse and submit recommendations. The scope of the role was not intended to task Kennan with creating and outlining strategy, however he used the opportunity provided by the Policy Planning Papers to discuss specific international problems. It was this opportunity that led to the formulation of a new strategy which was structured around Containment. As the director of this team, it was Kennan who was able to directly influence foreign policy decisions as he submitted foreign policy recommendations through the use of telegrams, lectures and debates which marked a significant change from his previous non-official roles. Planners under the leadership of Kennan were tasked with analysing information and submitting Policy Planning Papers which had a direct impact on the formulation and implementation of official US foreign policy. There was no one particular document that fully outlined the complete strategy of containment; it was developed through the recommendations made through many of these different papers. Consistent with the analysis in the Long Telegram, Kennan would continue to argue that the Soviets aim was to see the destruction of US strength. It was concluded that the Soviet Union would aim to achieve this objective through the exploitation of weaknesses within the Western world. Therefore, the immediate task of the Policy Planners was to assess the economic and political conditions of Western Europe and recommend methods short of war which would aim to achieve its economic rehabilitation. The long term aim was to restore the balance of power, whilst protecting US security and prestige. This became a key focus for the planners, which started the formulation of a new strategy. On May 23rd 1947, the Policy Planners made their first official recommendations on Western Europe. These were focused on a short-term and long term plan, short term because the US were required to act immediately to prevent the communists exploiting the current situation. The long term plan was an extended plan that was aimed at complete European reconstruction and recovery. Kennan wanted US aid to be directed at restoring the economic health of the West, rather than combating the spread of communism. There needed to be a clear structure that would lead to an overall goal. The recommendations made for Western Europe had a significant influence which led to the creation of the Marshall Plan. This was intended to be implemented as a political element of the strategy that focused on containing the spread of communism within Europe. This area had been devastated by war, and this plan offered the stability needed by restoring the region economically and politically. Kennan used the influence held by his team as a means of implementing the strategy which he had developed whilst lecturing at the National War College in 1947. The plan was revealed to the public through a carefully drafted speech that was delivered by the Secretary of State General Marshall. The key features of this speech were taken directly from Kennan‟s recommendations, enabling the administration to make public a plan that was already well under development by Kennan and his Policy Planning Staff. The key objective was to ensure that this policy had a psychological impact on Western Europe, providing them with the confidence and strength to meet potential threats. Kennan‟s official transition into the administration did not change the focus or determination about how he thought the US should implement the containment strategy. As an official he to used his position and influence to ensure that the Marshall Plan remained consistent with the approach he wanted strategy to take, using the opportunity to outline and direct a political and economic strategy. A consistent approach was crucial to enable the Policy Planning Staff to formulate the containment strategy. Their recommendations, under Kennan‟s influence, show they wanted strategy to go beyond the objective of opposing communism. The result of these recommendations was the Marshall Plan, which attempted to go beyond this objective. The aim was to provide the stability needed to establish a balance of power, which would protect the security of both the US and its Western allies. The European Recovery Program was one of the most important policies that Kennan and his staff implemented during this period. It represented the economic and political containment that Kennan had wanted the administration to follow. The strategy remained coherent with a continued review and assessment of their approach, ensuring that as the policy developed the objective remained focused on supporting the restoration of Western Europe rather than taking direct control of the region themselves. It was hoped that a political and economic strategy would have the most significant impact in strengthening the West to prevent communism from exploiting the weaker areas; Our objective is to strengthen the determination of the free nations to resist the aggression of Soviet-directed world Communism, to increase their confidence that they can successfully do so, and to confront the Soviet Union with sufficient organized force to deter it from attempting further aggression. There was a structured approach to this phase of the strategy; their focus on Western Europe ensured that it was moulded as economic containment which Kennan had intended. It provided the opportunity for Kennan to show that the US could achieve its objective by creating economic policies that would strengthen the confidence to of their allies, which would result in their allies resisting opposition without resorting to military intervention.",

At the beginning of his official career within the State Department, Kennan had argued that “The danger of war is vastly exaggerated in many quarters. The Soviet government neither wants nor expects war with us in the foreseeable future.” Kennan continued this discussion suggesting that Soviet moves to consolidate their power within the East were signs of a defensive move. During official meetings the discussions concluded that the Russians were war weary and would aim at achieving their objectives through ideological rather than militarily means. This enabled them to conclude that the Soviets were not working to a fixed timetable.",

    "text": "acknowledged by the West. The analysis carried out by the Policy Planners provided them with an understanding that another war was unlikely, meaning the Soviet Union would attempt to achieve their objectives through political means. Official papers concluded that another war would be devastating for all, and argued that “the policies of the United States should be directed to the promotion of conditions of peace, the prevention of armed aggression, and the countering of indirect aggression.” These conclusions remained consistent with Kennan’s early views on the real nature of the Soviet threat. The issue surrounding the nature and focus of this threat was a reoccurring theme during the period he worked within the Policy Planning Staff and it remained a subject of continued discussion. The approach was always the same; they preferred the implementation of an economic strategy because of the benefits offered by this type of policy. The papers produced by the staff concluded that a foreign policy with a primary focus on military objectives was not the most effective and efficient way of meeting their key objectives, because the Soviets did not want to risk causing another war. There was acceptance that events such as the Berlin Crisis had created situations which made the possibility of war much greater. Kennan maintained that if the US highlighted its potential strength, the communist position within Europe would deteriorate making war unnecessary. It was understood that war could be caused through internal conflicts, but it was not inevitable. Kennan was required to clarify this point on several occasions because it appeared his message was not clearly understood in the context that it was intended.\nThe minutes of one meeting that Kennan attended show the attempts he made to rectify this misunderstanding: Mr Kennan wished to clarify a point concerning previous statements made by Mr Bohlen and himself about the danger of war in Europe. They had not meant to imply that there was no danger of war nor threat of war. What they had meant to was that they did not consider that the Soviet Union had deliberately drawn up a program of aggression. There was a difference between planning aggression as a deliberate step of policy, and aggression as something following upon a situation from which it was impossible to withdraw. Misunderstanding became a source of frustration for Kennan when the US and its allies in the West perceived the threat from the Soviet Union to be one that was focused on military aggression to achieve its objectives. It led to discussions and arguments regarding Soviet intentions and capabilities, which became a continuous theme throughout the Cold War. Kennan’s opinions differed to many of his colleagues, as he wanted strategy to be focused on Soviets intentions. Kennan found that he was in dispute with senior members of the administration, regularly objecting to the assumptions that were outlined by the military who argued that war with Russia was necessary. Despite these clashes, Kennan remained consistent with the policy planning conclusions reached between 1947 and 1950, continuing to argue, in 1950 that “They will continue to conduct against us in the coming period the most intensive and savage type of political warfare, interspersing political, psychological, covert subversive, and limited military means as may seem to them suitable and advisable.” Detailed analysis carried out showed that the Soviet intention was not to use military aggression to achieve their key objectives and for this reason the Policy Planners went on to use every means available to emphasise the economic threat and how economic policies were key to the success of Containment. The Policy Planning Papers did not suggest the implementation of a military strategy; they were developing a political and economic strategy.",

    "section": "Chapter 3: Kennan and the X Article",
    "text": "This was a major concern for US foreign policy, because a global strategy would have potentially involved the US in issues that occurred all over the world. X portrayed the Soviet Union as an aggressive nation, something that Kennan had previously disagreed with. Whether Kennan intended to or not, this article implied that the US would need to take the role as the world leader in opposing communism. It suggested that any policy would be a long term global military policy; because it would need to meet the threat wherever it appeared which would need to be achieved over a long period of time. There was also no explanation or further discussion following the use of the term “counter-force”. This article appears to represent an example of Kennan‟s lack of coherence in formulating strategy, however with Containment being introduced into the public arena it needed to be seen to project a strong stance against communist expansion which would act as a deterrent. In their official capacity, Kennan and his Policy Planners did not need to over-emphasise the Soviet threat, the Long Telegram had already provided the justification required by senior officials and the strategy of containment had been accepted in official circles. The purpose of the publication of X was to draw on public support and mould public perception. This had an opposite effect from what had been achieved by the Long Telegram, X‟s publication trapped Kennan and his strategic vision. The Lippmann critique of the X article made valid arguments and highlighted serious deficiencies within the article. The article significantly changed public perceptions, as the public viewed this as the official strategic vision. The language used within the article and the lack of a definition or explanation of the main points allowed misunderstanding to occur and the ambiguous tone of the words made Kennan vulnerable to a significant amount of criticism. The article appeared to advocate an extension to the Truman Doctrine which Kennan had opposed due to its universal and military focus making it difficult to understand why Kennan would have recommended a global military foreign policy in this article. He also failed to provide a detailed explanation of the points made in the article and this led to misrepresentation and misunderstanding. Kennan became trapped by the publication of X after it was revealed that he was the author because of his official position as the Director of the Policy Planning Staff within the State Department. He was unable to respond to the criticisms without official approval, which did little to rectify the damage of the article and allowed further misinterpretation. X was not a true reflection of his view of the Soviet threat or his vision for a strategic policy, and he was unable to rectify public perceptions. Kennan used his memoirs as the opportunity he needed to comment on the deficiencies in the article which had led to the misinterpretations made by critics, such as Lippmann. Kennan argued that one of the main failures of his article was to define what he meant by the term Containment, in reflection he admits that he should have provided an explanation which showed he was trying to portray a strategy that would be seen as the “political containment of a political threat.” There was recognition of his failure to distinguish between the key strategic geographical areas which he felt was a fundamental flaw in the article. He had previously objected to the Truman Doctrine for the same reason that it did not draw these distinctions. In the Memoirs, Kennan also comments that he never intended X to be a doctrine. Scholars such as Miscamble have defended Kennan on this maintaining that the X Article was not a detailed prescription of policy and it did not outline what the US should do. The article was not outlining official strategic policy; however the consequences of its publication contributed to an exaggerated perception of the Soviet threat, which encouraged a universal and more militarised tone toward strategy. The X article trapped Kennan and misrepresented his strategic vision for the containment strategy, making it appear as though he was inconsistent and incoherent in his approach. The problem with the article was in its public presentation, it significantly impacted public perception of Containment and Soviet-American relations. Kennan was restricted by the official position he held within the bureaucracy, which prevented him from publicly responding to the criticism making it impossible to rectify until he left the official role. The major problem for Kennan was that the damage had already been done; the article appeared to publicly contradict the economic- political strategy Kennan had recommended in his lectures and Policy Planning Papers. The main points were publicly distorted in the article and had a lasting effect on shaping public perception of an aggressive Soviet nation, highlighting this as an immediate threat to the US and its allies. Senior officials preferred this perception, as it provided the rationale needed to implement an aggressive containment strategy. The consequences as a result of the publication of this article went on to limit the political-economic strategy Kennan wanted policy to focus on. This proved to be a source of frustration for Kennan as it continued to prevent the consistent implementation of his recommendations.",

    "section": "Chapter 4: Strategic Areas",
    "text": "Lippmann had critiqued the X article, interpreting the language used within it to view Kennan‟s containment strategy as a global policy that did not distinguish between the vital areas. The consequence of this criticism led to a conscious effort from Kennan and the Policy Planning Staff to keep foreign policy focused on all the areas that were considered the most immediate vital interests to the US. Closer analysis has shown that the Policy Planning Staff was concerned with creating a structured foreign policy for Western Europe. In May 1947, during a speech entitled “Problems of US Foreign Policy after Moscow”, Kennan argued that US involvement in policies that provided support to Greece, Turkey, France, Italy and Central Europe did not mean that the US were or should be committed to providing help and support to the rest of the world. The strategy moulded by Kennan and his staff had a direct impact on Western Europe, being unable to respond publicly to the critics of X, they went on to used official channels to fight back against the misunderstanding and misperceptions created by X. Kennan believed there were five regions that were vital to maintain the balance of power and US security. The areas outlined included the United States, the United Kingdom, the Rhine Valley, due to its industrial areas, the Soviet Union and Japan. The first focus for the Policy Planning Staff was to assess the conditions in Western Europe, Germany and Japan. These were considered to be strategic regions and show there was a coherent and consistent structure in his thinking. The strategy for Western Europe was to include the elements of a political, military and economic union to work towards a European Unity without which the plan proposed would have failed. There were problems throughout Western Europe, in countries such as Italy, where they were pressured from communist groups, who were exploiting the weak economic conditions. It was viewed that the loss of this area would undermine and weaken the position of the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean. The strategy recommended followed a methodical approach where they examined countries on an individual basis providing evidence of their structured approach. The objective was to make recommendations that would work towards a containment strategy that would be directed at restoring the balance of power in Europe and Asia. A key comment made by the Policy Planners was that “the most important and urgent element in foreign policy planning is the question of restoration of hope and confidence in Western Europe and the early rehabilitation of the economies of that area.” The implications and impact that a policy could have on the West provides an explanation of Kennan‟s opinion that this region needed to be considered first. The time and resources that were allocated to make an assessment of each of these key areas show there was coherence to the overall strategy. The papers formulated show an understanding that to rehabilitate Western Europe and Japan it was important that they ensured that US resources were not overextended in other areas. The US was already overextended in parts of the Far East and the Policy Planners attempted to carry out a study on regions that had been listed as vital where they highlighted Japan as an area at the top of their agenda. Examination of the policy recommendations support the argument that despite the errors that led to the misinterpretation in the X article, the key focus of the Policy Planning Staff was on the five vital regions. There was more detail and description in the policy papers than in the X article due to their intended audiences. Western Europe, Germany and Japan were considered to be the most important areas of foreign policy, losing these regions to communism would have had such damaging consequences on their entire strategy. Primary emphasis was always placed on the most strategic areas that were considered at risk because the domino effect would have impacted on the balance of power and the overall security of the Western world. Strategic areas were the key focus which was shown in 1948 when the Policy Planning Staff discussed US policy toward China, which could have seen resources extended much further. They did agree that they needed to create a policy in relation to the present course of events in China, however it was understood that “while the growing power of the Chinese Communists represents an important political development and a serious deterioration, from our standpoint, of the general situation in Asia, it is not likely to be catastrophic to United States interests.” It was understood by the Policy Planners that the means for influencing events in China were limited. This was a key example of distinguishing between the areas that were vital to US interests, China was not considered to be one of these. It was a structured approach which led to a consistency in the overall strategy. Even though there were issues arising in many different regions, the Policy Planning Staff kept their focus on Western Europe and Japan, ensuring that their assessments were a true reflection of the international situation. The recovery of Western Europe was centred on two key countries; Germany and Japan, these were viewed as the cornerstones to the overall restoration of stability within Europe and East Asia. “Their recovery was essential to the restoration of stability in Europe and East Asia.” The end of the Second World War had created a threat that the Russians would attempt to take advantage of the power vacuum that had been left by their collapse. The war had resulted in Germany being split into zones controlled by the Soviet Union and the US. In 1947, Kennan argued that the occupational policy in Germany needed to be reshaped to enable the Western zones to make a maximum contribution to the economic restoration of the West. This country was seen by Kennan to be the key to European reconstruction, and the role of the German people in a European Union was considered to be of prime importance. Germany needed to be kept free from communist control and integrated into the West. The strategy consistently saw Germany as the key element in the recovery of the West. Recovery could not happen without its participation.",

Some day Soviet forces must leave.” He recognized that a European Recovery Program would not be possible without resolving the German issue, viewing Germany as vital to any such European proposal.  However, he found it difficult to persuade the Truman Administration and the rest of Europe. Britain and France, scarred by war, agreed that Germany needed to be split into zones to prevent it from rebuilding its military strength.  This strategy shifted in 1948, with Kennan and the Policy Planners recommending a new approach focused on German reunification, arguing that this required the complete removal of both Soviet and US military forces from central Europe.  They prioritized ending the division of Europe, deeming it detrimental to economic recovery, and believed resolving the German issue was crucial to achieving this.",

The international situation further accelerated this change in strategy.  Kennan and the Policy Planners presented Program A, designed to open negotiations with the Soviet Union. While acknowledging its difficulties, they understood its long-term strategic value.  Program A called for a German government to oversee reunification, complete German disarmament and demilitarization, mutual troop withdrawal, and an end to reparations.  Kennan believed this could achieve the long-term goal of ending the division of Germany and Europe.  However, Program A was undermined by bureaucratic opposition, particularly from Secretary of State Dean Acheson.  Leaks to the public caused backlash from Britain and France, further hindering its implementation.  This policy highlighted differing views within the administration and prevented a coherent strategy for Germany, impacting the development of containment.

Even in his 1957 BBC Reith Lectures, Kennan reiterated his belief that the Soviet threat was primarily political and that German reunification through mutual withdrawal was essential for resolving the European deadlock. He consistently emphasized Germany's centrality to the wider European problem, arguing that the presence of Western forces in West Germany directly linked Eastern European issues to the overall military balance between Russia and the West.

Kennan developed a strategic vision for protecting Japan, with a key objective being its stabilization and integration into the Pacific economy. He expressed concern about the Truman Administration's plans for a peace treaty with Japan, arguing that premature relinquishment of Allied control risked communist penetration due to Japan's political and economic instability. Kennan and the Policy Planners advocated for continued occupation, recommending against a peace treaty and maintaining US forces until Japan's internal stability improved and the Russian situation changed positively. Kennan's direct engagement with General MacArthur led to significant changes in occupation policy, a contribution he later considered highly significant.  He believed that delaying the peace treaty and ensuring continued US presence were crucial for preventing Japan from falling under communist influence.",

    "text": "to sign the peace treaty. This part of the strategy was consistent with the approach that Kennan took toward German rehabilitation, Japan like Germany was deemed as vital to US security and the balance of power. It was not ready to be left without protection, as it would leave it vulnerable to possible communist expansion. The problem with the discussions surrounding the Japan issue was that they could not agree to what should happen next, so the policy recommendations did not progress any further. The key focus of the strategy in Japan was to be economic, it was seen that “Economic Recovery should be the prime objective of United States policy in Japan for the coming period.” They believed they could achieve this by improving its trade to include the Far Eastern countries. Consistent with the German policy, Kennan went on to argue that the US should not take any reparations from Japan and should oppose any future plans to do this under any new peace treaty. The strategic plan was coherent with the overall containment strategy; they recommended and put plans in place to build on their confidence and strength. In the long term he wanted the US to achieve this, so that they could then resolve the greater issue of occupation. This continued to be an issue that was unresolved, commenting in 1950 that; As for Japan, we have here the most important single factor in Asia. We cannot, in the long run, continue successfully to keep Japan resistant to Soviet pressures by using our own strength as the main instrument in this effort… If we insist of keeping troops in Japan, their presence there will inevitably be a bone of contention, and the communists will vigorously make capital of it. The policies that Kennan recommended for Germany and Japan show that his strategy was coherent as it was an extension of his early work. Discussions focused on these two countries, as these areas were seen as key to containing the Soviets. He particularly favoured following plans that would be focused on achieving the economic recovery of both of these countries because the economic rehabilitation of each of these was a continuation of the European Recovery Program. If they achieved this they could then attempt to reduce the occupational control. Kennan wanted the US to put confidence back into these strategic areas, to stop them falling to communist pressure. These areas were vital to US security and prestige, losing their sphere of influence was not an option, these areas had a large industrial potential, one which they did not want to fall into the hands of the communists. The strategy was also trying to fight against the propaganda which was being publicised by the Soviet government. Kennan continued his work after he left the administration and we can see that he remained consistent and worked on developing his key ideas. We can see from the examination that Kennan ensured that his Policy Planners were coherent and structured when recommending policies for the containment strategy. However, as a Policy Planner he was unable to influence a fully coherent strategy because Program A and recommendations for Germany were rejected by Dean Acheson and key allies meaning he was unable to remove the division of Europe. Kennan was able to bring about some changes in Japan, but was unable to introduce a policy on the same scale as the Marshall Plan. Despite this the examination of Germany and Japan has shown that these two areas were picked out as strategic areas where the economic recovery of each of these was seen as the key to provide strength and confidence which would protect US interests. It is understood that each of these was considered the key to a successful containment strategy.",

    "text": "One key criticism made regarding the X article was its failure to distinguish between vital strategic regions. The Policy Planning Staff were under constant pressure, making it difficult for them to keep focus on the specific strategic regions. This is where Kennan’s containment strategy appeared to be contradictory and inconsistent at times because the strategy was required to extend beyond these vital areas. This was caused through the fear of the domino effect and the repercussions of this on US security and credibility, which created problems for Kennan, as he made attempts to stop the containment strategy moving toward a global commitment. The key objective for Western Europe was to prevent the region falling victim to communist pressure, however this did not resolve issues beyond these borders and Kennan as the Director of the Policy Planning Staff was expected to assess all international problems not only those considered as a strategic interest. The containment strategy moved beyond Western Europe with the need for the US to show its strength, knowing they could not publicly be seen to back down to what many perceived to be Soviet pressure. In early 1947, it was argued that Greece and Turkey should be considered a critical area for the US and that any failure of the US to act would have serious consequences. The problems subsequently worsened, which led to President Truman’s announcement in March 1948 that the US would provide support to Greece. A communist success in the face if US aid to Greece would have serious widespread political repercussions in addition to its significance as one more advance under the limited objective strategy now pursued by the Soviets toward their objective of world-wide domination. This was an indication of the difficulties faced by the administration, which prevented them from limiting strategy to key areas. The Middle East became another region that was viewed as important to the US; the problems faced in this area were assessed and discussed at great length by the Policy Planning Staff. They recommended that the US should remain united with the British to keep the area free from Soviet control. In 1948, following these conclusions Kennan outlined that the security of the Middle East was vital to US security. Palestine occupies a geographic position of great strategic significance to the US. It is important for the control of the eastern end of the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. It is an outlet for the oil of the Middle East; which in turn, is important to US security. Like Western Europe, the Middle East was considered an important region. Kennan and his Policy Planners wanted to maintain the political, economic and social stability within this region. The situation in the Middle East had forced the Policy Planning Staff to review the military and political policies already in place. The US interest in the region meant extending the strategy, committing US resources to an additional area of the world. There were additional extensions to the containment strategy, which included US policy toward the satellite states in Eastern Europe. The Policy Planning Staff concluded that “Our overall aim with respect to satellite states should be the gradual reduction and eventual elimination of preponderant Soviet power from Eastern Europe without resort to war.” This was another inconsistency as it contrasted with the strategy where the US would only involve its policies and resources in areas specified as vital. The direction of foreign policy had begun to change as policymakers moved toward a strategy that would work towards achieving the rollback of Soviet power and liberate areas of Eastern Europe. A meeting attended by Kennan in 1949 recorded the following comments; Mr Kennan explained that when we studied the European situation two years ago the decision was to put into effect the Marshall Plan to help save Western Europe from communism. This objective has been achieved to a great extent. Our objective now must be to obtain the retraction of Soviet power from Eastern Europe. If we can do this, war should not be necessary. The success of the Marshall Plan had achieved the containment of the Soviets in Western Europe, enabling the Policy Planners to look at future objectives. By 1949, the containment strategy was moving toward a new policy of liberation.",

    "text": "The containment strategy moved away from Kennan’s control as US policy began to be dictated by the possible occurrence of the domino effect following concern that a communist takeover in any region would result in the loss of US credibility and prestige. It was believed that when one country fell to communism others would follow. With the pressure mounting, the Truman Administration did not want to be viewed as being „soft on communism.‟ The concerns surrounding security and credibility continued to surface having a significant impact on Kennan’s inability to put limitations on the regions that the US needed to provide protection and support, forcing strategy to move beyond the strategic areas. The strategy was intended to focus on Western Europe, Germany and Japan, but the Policy Planning Staff provided recommendations on situations occurring within Greece, Turkey, the Middle East and other Eastern European satellite countries, their analysis concluded that each were important to US interests due to the individual circumstances. Security, the domino effect, the balance of power and US credibility were thrust to the top of foreign policy concerns; each of these ensuring that Kennan’s strategy was limited. On closer examination this did not reflect an incoherent or inconsistent strategy. As the Director of the Policy Planning Staff, Kennan was required to review and present recommendations on any issue which could potentially affect the security of US interests. Kennan was in a position where he was required to respond to the issues as they happened. This assessment agrees with Gaddis who argues that the five regions specified as vital were not the only interests. Kennan’s intention was to recommend and implement a coherent strategy that would focus on the regions considered the vital interests of the US. It was unrealistic to think that a country like the US with its superpower status would not become involved in issues beyond these regions. This led to the creation of policies that went beyond the original strategy intended for containment. This ultimately led to inconsistency that was beyond Kennan’s control.",

    "section": "Chapter Five: The Militarization of Containment",
    "text": "As the containment strategy developed, military considerations were prioritized in all decision making situations in US foreign policy. This concerned Kennan because he argued that if the US continued to place military policies at the heart of Soviet-American relations, there was a greater possibility it could cause the war that they wanted to avoid. This chapter will examine what became known as the militarization of containment. An assessment will be made to gain a full understanding of how this led to inconsistencies in the containment strategy and how it restricted the impact that Kennan was to have. The containment strategy that was implemented by the Truman Administration did not reflect the strategy recommended by Kennan. In March 1947, the announcement of the Truman Doctrine marked a change in the focus of foreign policy. The administration had adopted Kennan’s ideas as outlined in the Long Telegram and his lectures, but this was the end of the similarities. The language used in President Truman’s speech was sweeping, indicating a universal approach to the concerns of communist expansion, suggesting that they would meet the threat wherever it appeared. This doctrine was created prior to the formulation of the Policy Planning Staff and its creation was in response to the situation in Greece and Turkey. Kennan was still lecturing at the National War College during this time and was not an official member of the administration; he was however invited to contribute to the early discussions, where he agreed that the US needed to provide support to Greece and Turkey. Later comments made in his memoirs show that he thought that the main aim of any policy formulated for these two countries would be primarily economic, but this was not to be the case. Kennan interpreted the doctrine to be one that would provide mainly military aid. I suspected that what was intended primarily was military aid, and that what had happened was that the pentagon had exploited a favourable set of circumstances in order to infiltrate a military aid program for Turkey into what was supposed to be primarily a political and economic program for Greece. Kennan did not want foreign policy to evolve into a military program. Harper has commented that Kennan’s notion of containment was conditioned by his desire to bring military power under political control. The sweeping and universal focus of the speech led to his immediate rejection of the doctrine, particularly its implications because it was not consistent with the approach he had advocated. The doctrine appeared military in nature, and when it is compared with Kennan’s lectures it went against the recommendations he was advocating. He particularly did not view the Soviet threat as militarily aggressive and concluded that a military policy was unnecessary. When the Policy Planning Staff were created in May 1947, Kennan wanted to ensure that the first objective was to correct the misconception created by the announcement of the Truman doctrine. The recommendations made by the Policy Planners stated that the US needed to take specific steps to rectify this misconception. The doctrine had left an impression in some minds",

    "text": "Kennan was opposed to the military having the leading role in the strategy of containment. The Policy Planning Papers were structured carefully to ensure they did not suggest that the threat faced needed to be met with primarily military force. Kennan carefully composed these papers to ensure they did not lead to further misinterpretation. He remained in opposition with the creation of the Truman Doctrine, insisting that it represented a military universal doctrine. The administration continued to have a different view to Kennan’s Long Telegram on how to resolve the problems in Greece, they planned to utilise military methods to meet the Communist pressure. Kennan in contrast to their approach remained consistent with his earlier comments questioning whether this approach was the most suitable way to meet their objectives. Kennan would continually emphasise that the US should avoid a military union, it was accepted that military aspects had a vital part to play in US foreign policy, but it was not intended to be the key focus. Whilst the possibility of creating a union with the US allies was being considered, Kennan advised the Secretary of State that a “Military union should not be the starting point. It should flow from the political, economic and spiritual union-not vice versa.” Like the Truman Doctrine, the plan to introduce the Atlantic Pact was in contrast to his earlier recommendations. There was concern as the Atlantic Alliance marked another change in the direction that foreign policy appeared to be taking, adding to the representation that a different strategy was being implemented by the Truman Administration. The decisions taken by the administration ensured that strategy was focused on military objectives, something that Kennan was openly opposed to.",

    "text": "During the early negotiations, Kennan voiced his reservations to the implications and impact that it would have on foreign policy. For Kennan, the Atlantic Pact and the Arms Program misled the public as he believed it provided a false representation of what the US really wanted to achieve. It forced people to view “the Russian threat as just a military problem rather than as a part of a broad political offensive.” Consistently he maintained that the Russians wanted to achieve their objectives by political means arguing that the military alliance should only be used to play a role of intimidation stating; A North Atlantic Security Pact will affect the political war only insofar as it operates to stiffen the self-confidence of the Western Europeans in the face of Soviet pressures. Such stiffening is needed and desirable. But it goes hand in hand with the danger of a general pre-occupation with military affairs, to the detriment of economic recovery and of the necessity for seeking a peaceful solution to Europe’s difficulties. It was in the same paper that he concluded that the most viable option was through economic recovery and internal political stability. A military policy needed to exist to a certain extent, but Kennan did not want it to be the main aspect of foreign policy. He did not want the pact to appear as though it suggested that war was inevitable. This would undermine everything that the Policy Planning Staff wanted to achieve in Western Europe.",

    "section": "Kennan's Diminishing Influence and the Shift to Militarization",
    "text": "The creation of this alliance shows that Kennan could not exert the same influence that he had on the direction and implementation of the Marshall Plan. The events that occurred impacted on decisions made which led to the creation of the Atlantic Pact. This allowed the Soviet Union to be seen as aggressive, willing to use military force to achieve their objectives. However, in opposition to this view, Kennan remained certain that events in Czechoslovakia and Berlin were a reaction to the success of the Marshall Plan and the future plans to set up a separate German government; therefore he argued that the proposed alliance was unnecessary. For Kennan, this was proof that the containment strategies put in place were working as intended. The eventual establishment of this alliance represented Kennan’s lack of influence in the decision making process. However, Kennan did remain coherent with his original thinking which had been careful to avoid a military focus. It is understandable that he disagreed with the creation of this alliance because it was allowing the strategy to take a more militarised tone, just as the Truman Doctrine had done previously. The Truman Doctrine and the establishment of the Atlantic alliance showed the disagreement between the strategy favoured by Kennan and the strategy favoured by the department. His ideas had started to clash with the military branches of the government and this was making him and his opinions unpopular. This was a change to the influential position he had built up whilst at the National War College and at the beginning of his role as the Director of the Policy Planning Staff. Kennan did not feel that the alliance was needed as the political economic containment strategy he had implemented was showing signs of success. The proposal of this alliance, along with the Truman Doctrine, showed that Kennan could only exert so much influence; the final decisions did not rest with him. The proposal and decisions to implement a new alliance for the overall strategy was out of Kennan’s control. It was here that the strategy was showing significant signs of inconsistencies, but it is understood that this was something that he could not prevent. The strategy that Kennan had been attempting to implement, that of a political, economic strategy were starting to resemble something else completely.",

    "text": "by Kennan and the Policy Planning Staff, this would have had a direct impact on how decisions were made, the inconsistency between earlier papers and NSC 20/4 explain the possible reasons for the change in direction of strategy. The exaggerations made by the US administration, led people to perceive the threat coming from the Soviet Union as an aggressive threat. Kennan had wanted to avoid this perception and one of the reasons he eventually decided to resign from the State Department was due to the change in the direction and implementation of the containment strategy. Containment had become more militarised and his objections and suggestions regarding certain policies had begun to a clash with his colleagues. Kennan did have a specific strategy in mind whilst he was part of the Policy Planning Staff and the objections he raised on the military aspects of the strategy show this was not what he had wanted to be implemented. The issue with this argument is that Kennan showed an inconsistency when he wrote NSC 20/4. By 1950, the strategy no longer resembled the economic political containment strategy Kennan had wanted, it was this change along with constant clashes in views with the Secretary of State Dean Acheson which brought about his resignation. Despite the incoherency in some of the official analysis Kennan carried out, he insisted that military containment was not the right strategy for the US because he was convinced that events and circumstances meant war was not wanted by the Soviets. The problems Kennan experienced did not rest with his own inconsistencies but with his lack of influence in his official role. Kennan would continue to argue that the Soviet Union did not want war but the militarisation of containment continued to increase with new developments made in atomic weaponry. It was nuclear weaponry that turned out to be one of the most important issues that Kennan would discuss.",

    "text": "In examining his work, it is easy to think that his opposition to nuclear weapons started after he left the State Department, however this has shown not to be the case. In his memoirs he comments on his early years in the National War College, where he mentions that “There could be no greater protection for our own people against atomic attack then the deterrent effect of overwhelming retaliatory power in the hands of this country.” The containment strategy that had been formulated and implemented had begun to evolve in to something different as perceptions and capabilities began to inevitably change. For Kennan, the containment strategy was evolving, and needed to look to contain the use and development of nuclear weapons. The question here is how much of an impact he made on the administration regarding this issue. By 1950, NSC-68 had been created and the hydrogen bomb was in development. For Kennan, the proliferation of nuclear weapons intensified the focus on military policies and objectives. This signified a change in the thinking that Kennan had originally held on nuclear weapons, but this had been a gradual change, that had occurred consistently with development. After the atomic bomb was tested by the US at the end of the Second World War, it became clear that the US now held the superior force because no one else had developed this type of weaponry. Kennan commented in 1946 that the US now held a monopoly on atomic weapons, but argued that “atomic energy has changed nothing in the basic attitude and objectives of the Soviet Union with respect to us.” His opinions would change whilst he was a member of the Policy Planning Staff, when witnessing the changes that occurred in the international situation. The approach taken by Kennan on the issue of atomic weapons in the early days as a Policy Planner show that he was not alarmed by the existence of these weapons. They were not considered an immediate risk or threat to the US as they were the only ones to hold this capability. A change occurred in 1949 to the views and approach toward the issue of atomic weapons.",

    "text": "The perception was that the US had fallen behind the Russians in conventional weaponry, due to this there was concern that the US was in danger of allowing their policy to become tied to the development and use of the atom bomb. The change in these views on developing atomic weapons had been caused by the public announcement in 1949 that the Soviets had been successful in the explosion of their first atomic bomb. The decision had also been taken from the recommendations in NSC-68 that the US would develop the Hydrogen bomb. These developments and change in capabilities were to spark a new debate regarding the international control of atomic weaponry. Kennan wrote a report on this issue in the January of 1950, the aim of which was to assess the situation with the constant development of these weapons, he commented that he considered “it to have been in its implications one of the most important, if not the most important, of all the documents I ever wrote in government.” The paper was coherent, as it gave a clear and precise view of what kind of threat the US now faced. The paper was different to the previous Policy Planning Papers he had written, as its intention was not to provide the final recommendations or resolution to this issue. What the document did was provide a detailed discussion on this subject. One of the key points made in this paper was that “it is not questioned that some weapons of mass destruction must be retained in the national arsenal for purposes of deterrence and retaliation.” It was accepted that some needed to be retained because not retaining them would have left the US in a vulnerable position. If the Soviets continued developing the weapons at the same time that the US was removing them from its arsenal. As he had previously insisted in all other policies aimed at containing the Soviets, Kennan continued to argue that for ideological and practical reasons the Soviets wanted to avoid nuclear war. There was little change in his thinking; he knew that the deterrent effect placed the US into a strong position. This document was detailed, arguing that US policy should not become dependent on these weapons, and this meant that the US needed to rethink its levels of conventional weaponry. In the document there was not a call to remove these weapons completely, he wanted to prevent their use unless absolutely necessary, but there was an acceptance that the US could not abandon these weapons altogether. One of the main concerns was whether the balance of power for the US had been significantly altered because the Soviet Union now possessed the nuclear capability. Kennan argued that “The probability of the eventual development of the weapon by others was not only one of the basic postulates of the original US position but actually its entire motivation.” For Kennan the concern now lay with the H-bomb because it now complicated an already intense situation.",

    "text": "The threat of a possible attack where atomic weapons would be used became greater and the administration showed more of a willingness to rely on these weapons much more than they had done previously. Kennan‟s conviction was coherent as he continued to persuade the government to only stock this type of weaponry for deterrent reasons whilst ensuring that a policy of no first-use was implemented. Kennan was passionate about the increased danger that came from the stockpiling of nuclear weaponry. The problem that he experienced was that he was unable to convince the administration that these concerns needed greater attention. As had happened with his objections toward the strategies for Germany, NATO and NSC-68, they rejected his opinions. Kennan had considered the paper on the International Control of Atomic Weaponry to be one of the most important papers he had written, but he was unable to get them to introduce a consistent and coherent policy on nuclear weapons. The administration had reacted to the idea that the Soviets now had the capability to attack using nuclear weapons. Kennan had a coherent approach to discussions on nuclear weapons, much of his work on this subject was written when he became a scholar and critic of US foreign policy. In this position he was consistent with the opinion that war was not inevitable. During the BBC Reith Lectures he was to discuss this; What flows from what I have said is not that one should give up unilaterally the nuclear deterrent, or even that one should desist from the effort to strengthen the NATO forces in Europe. What flows from what I have said is only that war must not be taken as inevitable; that one must not be carried away by the search for absolute security; that certain risks must be assumed in order that greater ones may be avoided, and that NATO must not be strengthened in such a way as to prejudice the chances for an eventual reduction, by peaceful negotiation, or the danger of an all out war. The BBC Reith lectures provided Kennan with the public forum in which to air his opinions and discuss the real threat of such weapons. However, despite these lectures Kennan was unable to have a direct impact or influence government thinking. Instead the lectures had a negative impact for Kennan as they created a large amount of criticism. This was another rejection, but this rejection did not prevent Kennan from voicing his concerns. The issues surrounding the development of nuclear weapons became a continuous feature of his work, showing he had a consistent view about how the US should approach the situation. The problem was with his inability to directly influence US strategy, but his lectures ensured that this subject was still at the top of the agenda. As his work continued to discuss this issue he worried that nuclear war could be started by accident or miscalculation. With the military now relying on the nuclear weapon it was thought that this could potentially bring destruction through the proliferation of such weapons or by accident. The explosion of the Soviet atomic bomb and US decision to develop the H-bomb changed American-Soviet relations. As the threat grew more immediate; Kennan focused much of his work on atomic weaponry. There was a consistency with his opinions, but he failed to make a direct impact on the official decision making. Kennan was coherent and consistent with how the US should meet this growing threat; however the militarisation of containment and the introduction of nuclear weapons as the key military focus stood to acknowledge another firm rejection of his ideas and opinions.",

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Kennan had an important impact on US foreign policy between 1946 and 1949 and it was during this period that he had the most influence on the implementation of the containment strategy. There have been many assessments and interpretations of Kennan‟s strategy of containment. This assessment has attempted to examine the overall coherence and consistency of this strategy and has been able to conclude there was not a single George Kennan which was dependent on the different roles he had during the Cold War. This affected the consistency and coherency of his containment strategy. In 1946, the Long Telegram attracted the attention of Senior Policymakers within Washington such as the Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal, because the document gave them the reason and motivation to alter their foreign policy objectives towards the Soviet Union. This assessment has outlined that Kennan saw the expansion of Soviet communism as a threat to the interests and security of the United States. The evidence that has been examined has shown that Kennan was not outlining a specific strategy when he wrote the Long Telegram. The telegram did however bring him to the attention of officials in Washington, paving the way for his return and eventual move into the official bureaucracy. Even when he delivered lectures at the National War College, his ideas were still in the earliest stages of development. It was through these lectures that he outlined his thoughts and views on the direction of US foreign policy. At this time Kennan started to develop what would soon become known as the containment strategy. It is important to understand that his ideas were not the official line of strategy within the State Department; however they had a significant impact on his audience. The Long Telegram and the lectures delivered at the National War College help us to understand some of Kennan‟s earliest ideas and enable us to assess the early development of Kennan‟s analysis and how effective he was at reshaping perceptions of the Soviet threat. These documents were essential to this assessment, because they enabled us to understand the views that Kennan had prior to entering the State Department as an official Policy Planner. The Long Telegram and the lectures delivered at the National War College are examples of consistency with Kennan‟s ideas and arguments. The political circumstances and context had changed and from here Kennan was able to begin developing and setting out strategy. Kennan consistently argued that ideology provided the Soviet Union with the reason they needed to fear the outside world and to justify their rule under a dictatorship, it did not drive their foreign policy. It was determined that the threat from the Soviet Union was a political-economic threat; therefore the US needed to meet this threat using political and economic methods, as it was reasoned that like the US the Soviet Union did not want to become involved in another war. From this coherent thinking, Kennan suggested that the US should focus its main efforts on the rehabilitation of Western Europe, Germany and Japan. These were the main issues affecting his line of thought and it was from here that he began to develop a strategy. The official audiences that Kennan was able to influence whilst working at the National War College led to an invitation to become the Director of the Policy Planning Staff. Kennan was not mandated to create strategy, but used the opportunity when assessing specific problems to develop the",

    "text": "A new containment strategy was developed to ensure an economic and political approach. The Policy Planners initially focused on Western Europe's economic rehabilitation, leading to the Marshall Plan, aligning with Kennan's ideas. This economic policy aimed for psychological impact while avoiding military conflict. The program's success exemplified a coherent strategy. However, the X article seemingly revealed contradictions in Kennan's thinking. Its ambiguous language caused widespread misinterpretation. Kennan hadn't intended it as official policy or a global military strategy. Drafted before his directorship, the problem lay in its presentation, not conception. Publicly issued, its attribution to Kennan led to criticism, perceived as the official plan. It contributed to perceptions of an aggressive Soviet threat, distorting Kennan's vision of containment through economic and political means. Critics argued Kennan didn't prioritize strategic areas, but he did focus on Western Europe's vital areas. The public article needed a strong anti-communist stance, not reflecting Kennan's vision. Concerns over the domino effect, US security, and credibility persisted. The X article trapped Kennan, hindering his vision. He countered misunderstandings by focusing on strategic areas like Germany and Japan, crucial for Western Europe and Asia's rehabilitation. The European Recovery Program, implemented during Kennan's peak influence, was highly successful.",

    "text": "German policy appeared incoherent due to Kennan's 1948 shift towards demilitarization and reunification. However, this aligned with the Marshall Plan, adapting his thinking for further rehabilitation. He recognized Europe's division hindered full recovery, requiring resolving Germany's division. Dean Acheson rejected Program A, maintaining division and impeding Kennan's strategy. Losing influence impacted his coherent strategy. Kennan consistently advocated for Germany's reunification even after leaving Washington, evident in the BBC Reith Lectures. Japan, like Germany, remained central to his strategy, consistently emphasized by the Policy Planners. Kennan's strategy became trapped by universalism, extending containment beyond intended strategic regions. The Policy Planning Papers addressed issues in the Middle East, Greece, Turkey, and Eastern European satellite countries. Kennan, expected to consider broader interests, faced incoherence and inconsistency. The strategy expanded to counter communism's advance, reinforced by the X article. Containment's militarization, evident in the Truman Doctrine, Atlantic Pact, NSC-68, and nuclear weapons development, undermined Kennan's vision. He contributed to this shift with NSC 20/4 recommendations, showing contradictions, but consistently opposed militarized strategies, unable to prevent their implementation. His ideas remained consistent, but he couldn't sustain his advocated political-economic containment.",

    "text": "After leaving the State Department, Kennan continued discussing containment, Soviet-American relations, and nuclear weapons. President Eisenhower requested his involvement in Operation Solarium, assessing foreign policy approaches. The Eisenhower administration sought a structured foreign policy aligned with key objectives, inheriting the Truman administration's containment focus. Though no longer in a leading role, Kennan's influence remained, leading Task Force A. The administration aimed to evaluate all methods for the most suitable strategy. Task Force A recommended continuing Truman's containment strategy, despite Kennan's opposition to its implementation between 1949 and 1950. Eisenhower and Dulles combined recommendations from all groups for a new strategy. Task Force A's objectives aligned with Truman's, prioritizing US security and preventing Soviet expansionism. Kennan consistently emphasized war's non-inevitability, though acknowledging risks from misunderstanding. They recommended exploiting Soviet vulnerabilities covertly and overtly, advocating German reunification for broader European implications. A stable German policy, they argued, would lead to European reunification, consistent with Kennan's 1947-1948 views on economic expansion for the war-torn region.  They called for a program extending the European Recovery Program, promoting economic expansion. The Task Force pushed for a stronger stance on German unification, citing lack of direction due to government disagreement.",

    "text": "The Task Force argued that Germany's future determined Europe's, recommending a new approach to reunification exploiting Soviet internal stresses and achieving a rollback of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe. This aligned with Kennan's 1948 views, consistently emphasizing Germany's importance for European stability, advocating reunification, a military force, and removing occupational forces.  However, unlike Kennan's earlier containment strategy, the Task Force suggested rolling back Soviet power, a shift from containment to liberation, contradicting the original strategy of preventing expansion, not pushing Soviets from satellite areas.  Their language, again, was open to misinterpretation, possibly referring to East Germany or broader Eastern Europe. As a Policy Planner, Kennan focused on protecting vital interests, with Germany remaining crucial. The Task Force, like Kennan, highlighted Japan's importance. Discussions on communist China continued, consistent with the Truman administration's hostile view. To bolster China's power, they suggested making Japan a free world bulwark in the Western Pacific, acknowledging Japan's need to trade with China for economic strength. Preventing communist control of Southeast Asia was deemed vital for US security. The Task Force questioned NSC 153/1, interpreted as committing US intervention everywhere.  They advocated maintaining armed forces for US security and defending strategic areas, building economic and military strength, and exploiting Soviet vulnerabilities through political, economic, and psychological means, aiming to avoid general war. Maintaining US and free world strength, they expected Soviet power to deteriorate, echoing Kennan's Long Telegram and X article.",

    "text": "Kennan consistently argued that Soviet ideology aimed to destroy Western capitalism. Thus, the Task Force recommended protecting US security and preventing further Soviet expansionism, largely consistent with Kennan's earlier thinking. One difference was assuming a strategic offensive for increased confidence and flexibility. The Task Force's recommendations aimed to continue Kennan's containment strategy under Eisenhower, focusing on German reunification and Japan's economic recovery, protecting US vital interests. Kennan remained consistent, but lacked influence over senior policymakers.  He attempted consistency with his containment strategy, developed in the Long Telegram and National War College lectures. As Director of Policy Planning, he implemented his recommended political-economic containment. Later scholarly work and critiques of US foreign policy remained consistent, evident in Project Solarium and the Reith lectures.  Economic-political containment, Western Europe, Germany, Japan, nuclear weapons, and exaggerated Soviet threat perceptions remained continuous themes. However, Kennan ultimately failed to implement a coherent strategy due to obstacles like the X article's misinterpretation, trapping him and hindering political-economic containment. He couldn't convince senior officials to limit containment to strategic areas vital for US security. These contradictions led to incoherent policy, extending beyond containment. Program A's rejection, Europe's continued division, and containment's militarization prevented his coherent strategy, lacking influence and facing internal opposition, marking the end of his official role.",
