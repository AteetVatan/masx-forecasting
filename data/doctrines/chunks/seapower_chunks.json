Historians generally have been unfamiliar with the conditions of the sea, having as to it neither special interest nor special knowledge ; and the profound determining in- fluence of maritime strength upon great issues has con- sequently been overlooked. This is even more true of particular occasions than of the general tendency of sea power. It is easy to say in a general way, that the use and control of the sea is and has been a great factor in the history of the world ; it is more troublesome to seek out and show its exact bearing at a particular juncture. Yet, unless this be done, the acknowledgment of general importance remains vague and unsubstantial ; not resting, as it should, upon a collection of special instances in which the precise effect has been made clear, by an analysis of the conditions at the given moments.\nA curious exemplification of this tendency to slight the bearing of maritime power upon events may be 863243 iv PREFACE. drawn from two writers of that English nation which more than any other has owed its greatness to the sea. \" Twice,\" says Arnold in his History of Eome, \" Has there been witnessed the struggle of the highest indi- vidual genius against the resources and institutions of a great nation, and in both cases the nation was victo- rious. For seventeen years Hannibal strove against Rome, for sixteen years Napoleon strove against Eng- land ; the efforts of the first ended in Zama, those of the second in Waterloo.\" Sir Edward Creasy, quoting this, adds : \" One point, however, of the similitude be- tween the two wars has scarcely been adequately dwelt on ; that is, the remarkable parallel between the Roman general who finally defeated the great Carthaginian, and the English general who gave the last deadly over- throw to the French emperor. Scipio and Wellington both held for many years commands of high importance, but distant from the main theatres of warfare. The same country was the scene of the principal military career of each. It was in Spain that Scipio, like Wel- lington, successively encountered and overthrew nearly all the subordinate generals of the enemy before being opposed to the chief champion and conqueror himself. Both Scipio and Wellington restored their countrymen's confidence in arms when shaken by a series of reverses, and each of them closed a long and perilous war by a complete and overwhelming defeat of the chosen leader and the chosen veterans of the foe.\" Neither of these Englishmen mentions the yet more striking coincidence, that in both cases the mastery of the sea rested with the victor.

Throus!:hout the war the legions passed by water, unmolested and un- wearied, between Spain, wdiich was Hannibal's base, and Italy ; while the issue of the decisive battle of the Me- taurus, hinging as it did upon the interior position of the Roman armies with reference to the forces of Has- drubal and Hannibal, was ultimately due to the fact that the younger brother could not bring his succor- ing reinforcements by sea, but only by the land route through Gaul. Hence at the critical moment the two Carthaginian armies were separated by the length of Italy, and one was destroyed by the combined action of the Roman o-enerals. On the other hand, naval historians have troubled themselves little about the connection between general history and their own particular topic, limiting them- selves generally to the duty of simple chroniclers of naval occurrences. This is less true of the French than of the English ; the genius and training of the former people leading them to more careful inquir}^ into the causes of particular results and the mutual relation of events. There is not, however, within .the knowledge of the author any work that professes the particular object here sought : namely, an estimate of the effect of sea power upon the course of history and the prosperity of vi PREFACE. nations. As other histories deal with the wars, politics, social and economical conditions of countries, touching upon maritime matters only incidentall}'' and generally unsympathetically, so the present work aims at putting maritime interests in the foreground, without divorcing them, however, from their surroundings of cause and effect in general history, but seeking to show how they modified the latter, and were modified hy them. The period embraced is from 1660, when the sailing- ship era, with its distinctive features, had fairly begun, to 1783, the end of the American Revolution. While the thread of general history upon which the successive maritime events is strung is intentionally slight, the effort has been to present a clear as well as accurate outline. \"Writing as a naval officer in full sympath}'- with his profession, the author has not hesitated to di- gress freely on questions of naval policy, strategy, and tactics ; but as technical language has been avoided, it is hoped that these matters, simply presented, will be found of interest to the unprofessional reader.\nA.

    "text": "The history of Sea Power is largely, though by no means solely, a narrative of contests between nations, of mutual rivalries, of violence frequently culminating in war. The profound influence of sea commerce upon the wealth and strength of countries was clearly seen long before the true principles which governed its growth and prosperity were detected. To secure to one's own people a disproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to exclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of monopoly or prohibitory regulations, or, when these failed, by direct violence. The clash of interests, the angry feelings roused by conflicting attempts thus to appropriate the larger share, if not the whole, of the advantages of commerce, and of distant unsettled commercial regions, led to wars. On the other hand, wars arising from other causes have been greatly modified in their conduct and issue by the control of the sea. Therefore the history of sea power, while embracing in its broad sweep all that tends to make a people great upon the sea or by the sea, is largely a military history; and it is in this aspect that it will be mainly, though not exclusively, regarded in the following pages.\nA study of the military history of the past, such as this, is enjoined by great military leaders as essential to correct ideas and to the skilful conduct of war in the future. Napoleon names among the campaigns to be studied by the aspiring soldier, those of Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar, to whom gunpowder was unknown; and there is a substantial agreement among professional writers that, while many of the conditions of war vary from age to age with the progress of weapons, there are certain teachings in the school of history which remain constant, and being, therefore, of universal application, can be elevated to the rank of general principles. For the same reason the study of the sea history of the past will be found instructive, by its illustration of the general principles of maritime war, notwithstanding the great changes that have been brought about in naval weapons by the scientific advances of the past half-century, and by the introduction of steam as the motive power. It is doubly necessary thus to study critically the history and experience of naval warfare in the days of sailing-ships, because while these will be found to afford lessons of present application and value, steam navies have as yet made no history which can be quoted as decisive in its teaching. Of the one we have much experimental knowledge; of the other, practically none. Hence theories about the naval warfare of the future are almost wholly presumptive; and although the attempt has been made to give them a more solid basis by dwelling upon the resemblance between fleets of steamships and fleets of galleys moved by oars, which have a long and well-known history, it will be well not to be carried away by this analogy until it has been thoroughly tested. The resemblance is indeed far from superficial. The feature which the steamer and the galley have in common is the ability to move in any direction independent of the wind. Such a power makes a radical distinction between those classes of vessels and the sailing-ship; for the latter can follow only a limited number of courses when the wind blows, and must remain motionless when it fails. But while it is wise to observe things that are alike, it is also wise to look for things that differ; for when the imagination is carried away by the detection of points of resemblance,—one of the most pleasing of mental pursuits,—it is apt to be impatient of any divergence in its new-found parallels, and so may overlook or refuse to recognize such. Thus the galley and the steamship have in common, though unequally developed, the important characteristic mentioned, but in at least two points they differ; and in an appeal to the history of the galley for lessons as to fighting steamships, the differences as well as the likeness must be kept steadily in view, or false deductions may be made. The motive power of the galley when in use necessarily and rapidly declined, because human strength could not long maintain such exhausting efforts, and consequently tactical movements could continue but for a limited time; and again, during the galley period offensive weapons were not only of short range, but were almost wholly confined to hand-to-hand encounter.",

Whatever may prove to be the worth of this opin- ion, it cannot claim an historical basis in the sole fact that galley and steamship can move at any moment directly upon the enemy, and carry a beak upon their prow, regardless of the points in which galley and steamship differ. As yet this opinion is only a presumption, upon which final judgment may well be deferred until the trial of battle has given fur- ther light. Until that time there is room for the opposite ^ Thus Hermocrates of S3-r.'icuse, advocating the policy of thwarting the Atlienian expedition against his city (b.c. 413) by going bohlly to meet it, and keeping on the flank of its h'ne of advance, said : \"As their advance must be slow, we shall have a thousand opportunities to attack them ; but if they clear their ships for action and in a body bear down expeditiously upon us, they must ply hard at their oars, and when spent icith toil we can fall upon them.\" 4 INTRODUCTORY. view, — that a melee between numerically equal fleets, in which skill is reduced to a minimum, is not the best that can be done with the elaborate and mighty weapons of this age. The surer of himself an admiral is, the finer the tactical develop- ment of his fleet, the better his captains, the more reluctant must he necessarily be to enter into a melee with equal forces, in which all these advantages will be thrown away, chance reign supreme, and his fleet he placed on terms of equality with an assemblage of ships which have never before acted together.! History has lessons as to when melees are, or are not, in order. The galley, then, has one striking resemblance to the steamer, but differs in other important features which are not so im- mediately apparent and are therefore less accounted of. In the sailing-ship, on the contrary, the striking feature is the difference between it and the more modern vessel ; the points of resemblance, though existing and easy to find, are not so obvious, and therefore are less heeded. ■ This impression is enhanced by the sense of utter weakness in the sailing-ship as compared with the steamer, owing to its dependence upon the wind ; forgetting that, as the former fought with its equals, the tactical lessons are valid. The galley was never reduced to impotence by a calm, and hence receives more respect in our day than the sailing-ship ; yet the latter dis- placed it and remained supreme until the utilization of steam. The powers to injure an enemy from a great distance, to manoeuvre for an unlimited length of time without wearing out the men, to devote the greater part of the crew to the offensive weapons instead of to the oar, are common to the sailing vessel and the steamer, and are at least as important, tactically considered, as the power of the galley to move in a calm or against the wind.",

He believes that a fleet seeking a decisive result must close with its enemy, but not until some advantage has been obtained for the collision, wliich will usually be gained by manoeuvring, and will fall to the best drilled and managed fleet. In truth, barren results have as often followed upon headlong, close encounters as upon the most timid tactical trifling. INTRODUCTORY. 5 In tracing resemblances there is a tendency not only to overlook points of difference, but to exaggerate points of like- ness,— to be fanciful. It may be so considered to point out that as the sailing-ship had guns of long range, with compar- atively great penetrative power, and carronades, which were of shorter range but great smashing effect, so the modern steamer has its batteries of long-range guns and of torpedoes, the latter being effective only within a limited distance and then injuring by smashing, while the gun, as of old, aims at penetration. Yet these are distinctly tactical considerations, which must affect the plans of admirals and captains ; and the analogy is real, not forced. So also both the sailing-ship and the steamer contemplate direct contact with an enemy's vessel, — the former to carry her by boarding, the latter to sink her by ramming ; and to both this is the most difficult of their tasks, for to effect it tlie ship must be carried to a single point of the field of action, whereas projectile weapons may be used from many points of a wide area. The relative positions of two sailing-ships, or fleets, with reference to the direction of the wind involved most important tactical questions, and were perhaps the chief care of the seamen of that age. To a superficial glance it may appear that since this has become a matter of such indifference to the steamer, no analogies to it are to be found in present con- ditions, and the lessons of history in this respect are value- less. A more careful consideration of the distinguishing characteristics of the lee and the weather \" gage,\" ^ directed to their essential features and disregarding secondary details, will show that this is a mistake. The distinguishing feature of the weather-gage was that it conferred the power of giving 1 A ship was said to have the weather-gage, or \" the advantage of the wind,\" or \"to be to windward,\" when the wind allowed her to steer for her opponent, and did not let the latter head straight for her. The extreme case was when the wind blew direct from one to the other ; but there was a large space on either side of this line to which the term \" weather-gage \" applied. If the lee ship be taken as the centre of a circle, there were nearly three eighths of its area in which the other might be and still keep the advantage of the wind to a greater or less degree.

    "text": "Conformity with the principles of war; and the seaman who carefully studies the causes of success or failure will not only detect and gradually assimilate these principles, but will also acquire increased aptitude in applying them to the tactical use of the ships and weapons of his own day. He will observe also that changes of tactics have not only taken place after changes in weapons, which necessarily is the case, but that the interval between such changes has been unduly long. This doubtless arises from the fact that an improvement of weapons is due to the energy of one or two men, while changes in tactics have to overcome the inertia of a conservative class; but it is a great evil. It can be remedied only by a candid recognition of each change, by careful study of the powers and limitations of the new ship or weapon, and by a consequent adaptation of the method of using it to the qualities it possesses, which will constitute its tactics.\n\nHistory shows that it is vain to hope that military men generally will be at the pains to do this, but that the one who does will go into battle with a great advantage, — a lesson in itself of no mean value. We may therefore accept now the words of a French tactician, Morogues, who wrote a century and a quarter ago: \"Naval tactics are based upon conditions the chief causes of which, namely the arms, may change; which in turn causes necessarily a change in the construction of ships, in the manner of handling them, and so finally in the disposition and handling of fleets.\" His further statement, that \"it is not a science founded upon principles absolutely invariable,\" is more open to criticism. It would be more correct to say that the application of its principles varies as the weapons change. The application of the principles doubtless varies also in strategy from time to time, but the variation is far less; and hence the recognition of the underlying principle is easier. This statement is of sufficient importance to our subject to receive some illustrations from historical events.",

    "text": "The battle of the Nile, in 1798, was not only an overwhelming victory for the English over the French fleet, but had also the decisive effect of destroying the communications between France and Napoleon's army in Egypt. In the battle itself the English admiral, Nelson, gave a most brilliant example of grand tactics, if that be, as has been defined, \"the art of making good combinations preliminary to battles as well as during their progress.\" The particular tactical combination depended upon a condition now passed away, which was the inability of the lee ships of a fleet at anchor to come to the help of the weather ones before the latter were destroyed; but the principles which underlay the combination, namely, to choose that part of the enemy's order which can least easily be helped, and to attack it with superior forces, has not passed away. The action of Admiral Jervis at Cape St. Vincent, when with fifteen ships he won a victory over twenty-seven, was dictated by the same principle, though in this case the enemy was not at anchor, but under way. Yet men's minds are so constituted that they seem more impressed by the transiency of the conditions than by the undying principle which coped with them. In the strategic effect of Nelson's victory upon the course of the war, on the contrary, the principle involved is not only more easily recognized, but it is at once seen to be applicable to our own day. The issue of the enterprise in Egypt depended upon keeping open the communications with France. The victory of the Nile destroyed the naval force, by which alone the communications could be assured, and determined the final failure; and it is at once seen, not only that the blow was struck in accordance with the principle of striking at the enemy's line of communication, but also that the same principle is valid now, and would be equally so in the days of the galley as of the sailing-ship or steamer. Nevertheless, a vague feeling of contempt for the past, supposed to be obsolete, combines with natural indolence to blind men even to those permanent strategic lessons which lie close to the surface of naval history. For instance, how many look upon the battle of Trafalgar, the crown of Nelson's glory and the seal of his genius, as other than an isolated event of exceptional grandeur? How many ask themselves the strategic question, \"How did the ships come to be just there?\" How many realize it to be the final act in a great strategic drama, extending over a year or more, in which two of the greatest leaders that ever lived, Napoleon and Nelson, were pitted against each other? At Trafalgar it was not Villeneuve that failed, but Napoleon that was vanquished; not Nelson that won, but England that was saved; and why? Because Napoleon's combinations failed, and Nelson's intuitions and activity kept the English fleet ever on the track of the enemy, and brought it up in time at the decisive moment. The tactics at Trafalgar, while open to criticism in detail, were in their main features conformable to the principles of war, and their audacity was justified as well by the urgency of the case as by the results; but the great lessons of efficiency in preparation, of activity and energy in execution, and of thought and insight on the part of the English leader during the previous months, are strategic lessons, and as such they still remain good.",

The two together numbered two hundred and twenty ships. On its station each met and defeated a Carthaginian squadron with an ease which may be inferred from the slight mention made of the actions, and which indicates the actual superiority of the Roman fleet. After the second year the war assumed the following shape: Hannibal, having entered Italy by the north, after a series of successes had passed southward around Rome and fixed himself in southern Italy, living off the country—a condition which tended to alienate the people, and was especially precarious when in contact with the mighty political and military system of control which Rome had there established. It was therefore from the first urgently necessary that he should establish, between himself and some reliable base, that stream of supplies and reinforcements which in terms of modern war is called \"communications.\" There were three friendly regions which might, each or all, serve as such a base—Carthage itself, Macedonia, and Spain. With the first two, communication could be had only by sea. From Spain, where his firmest support was found, he could be reached by both land and sea, unless an enemy barred the passage; but the sea route was the shorter and easier. In the first years of the war, Rome, by her sea power, controlled absolutely the basin between Italy, Sicily, and Spain, known as the Tyrrhenian and Sardinian Seas. The sea-coast from the Ebro to the Tiber was mostly friendly to her. In the fourth year, after the battle of Cannae, Syracuse forsook the Roman alliance, the revolt spread through Sicily, and Macedonia also entered into an offensive league with Hannibal. These changes extended the necessary operations of the Roman fleet, and taxed its strength. What disposition was made of it, and how did it thereafter influence the struggle? The indications are clear that Rome at no time ceased to control the Tyrrhenian Sea, for her squadrons passed unmolested from Italy to Spain. On the Spanish coast also she had full sway till the younger Scipio saw fit to lay up the fleet. In the Adriatic, a squadron and naval station were established at Brindisi to check Macedonia, which performed their task so well that not a soldier of the phalanxes ever set foot in Italy. \"The want of a war fleet,\" says Mommsen, \"paralyzed Philip in all his movements.\" Here the effect of Sea Power is not even a matter of inference. In Sicily, the struggle centred about Syracuse. The fleets of Carthage and Rome met there, but the superiority evidently lay with the latter; for though the Carthaginians at times succeeded in throwing supplies into the city, they avoided meeting the Roman fleet in battle. With Lilybaeum, Palermo, and Messina in its hands, the latter was well based in the north coast of the island. Access by the south was left open to the Carthaginians, and they were thus able to maintain the insurrection.",

    "text": "Putting these facts together, it is a reasonable inference, and supported by the whole tenor of the history, that the Roman sea power controlled the sea north of a line drawn from Tarragona in Spain to Lilybaeum (the modern Marsala), at the west end of Sicily, thence round by the north side of the island through the straits of Messina down to Syracuse, and from there to Brindisi in the Adriatic. This control lasted, unshaken, throughout the war. It did not exclude maritime raids, large or small, such as have been spoken of; but it did forbid the sustained and secure communications of which Hannibal was in deadly need. On the other hand, it seems equally plain that for the first ten years of the war the Roman fleet was not strong enough for sustained operations in the sea between Sicily and Carthage, nor indeed much to the south of the line indicated. When Hannibal started, he assigned such ships as he had to maintaining the communications between Spain and Africa, which the Romans did not then attempt to disturb. The Roman sea power, therefore, threw Macedonia wholly out of the war. It did not keep Carthage from maintaining a useful and most harassing diversion in Sicily; but it did prevent her sending troops, when they would have been most useful, to her great general in Italy. How was it as to Spain? Spain was the region upon which the father of Hannibal and Hannibal himself had based their intended invasion of Italy. For eighteen years before this began they had occupied the country, extending and consolidating their power, both political and military, with rare sagacity. They had raised, and trained in local wars, a large and now veteran army. Upon his own departure, Hannibal intrusted the government to his younger brother, Hasdrubal, who preserved toward him to the end a loyalty and devotion which he had no reason to hope from the faction-cursed mother-city in Africa. At the time of his starting, the Carthaginian power in Spain was secured from Cadiz to the river Ebro. The region between this river and the Pyrenees was inhabited by tribes friendly to the Romans, but unable, in the absence of the latter, to oppose a successful resistance to Hannibal. He put them down, leaving eleven thousand soldiers under Hanno to keep military possession of the country, lest the Romans should establish themselves there, and thus disturb his communications with his base. Cnaeus Scipio, however, arrived on the spot by sea the same year with twenty thousand men, defeated Hanno, and occupied both the coast and interior north of the Ebro. The Romans thus held ground by which they entirely closed the road between Hannibal and reinforcements from Hasdrubal, and whence they could attack the Carthaginian power in Spain; while their own communications with Italy, being by water, were secured by their naval supremacy. They made a naval base at Tarragona, confronting that of Hasdrubal at Cartagena, and then invaded the Carthaginian dominions. The war in Spain went on under the elder Scipios, seemingly a side issue, with varying fortune for seven years; at the end of which time Hasdrubal inflicted upon them a crushing defeat, the two brothers were killed, and the Carthaginians nearly succeeded in breaking through to the Pyrenees with reinforcements for Hannibal. The attempt, however, was checked for the moment; and before it could be renewed, the fall of Capua released twelve thousand veteran Romans, who were sent to Spain under Claudius Nero, a man of exceptional ability, to whom was due later the most decisive military movement made by any Roman general during the Second Punic War. This seasonable reinforcement, which again assured the shaken grip on Hasdrubal's line of march, came by sea—a way which, though most rapid and easy, was closed to the Carthaginians by the Roman navy.",

    "text": "arms would cause any great modifications in the way of making war. I replied that they would probably have an influence upon the details of tactics, but that in great strategic operations and the grand combinations of battles, victory would, now as ever, result from the application of the principles which had led to the success of great generals in all ages ; of Alexander and Caesar, as well as of Frederick and Napoleon.\" This study has become more than ever important now to navies, because of the great and steady power of movement possessed by the modern steamer. The best-planned schemes might fail through stress of weather in the days of the galley and the sailing-ship ; but this difficulty has almost disappeared. The principles which should direct great naval combinations have been applicable to all ages, and are deducible from history ; but the power to carry them out with little regard to the weather is a recent gain. The definitions usually given of the word \" strategy \" confine it to military combinations embracing one or more fields of operations, either wholly distinct or mutually dependent, but always regarded as actual or immediate scenes of war. However this may be on shore, a recent French author is quite right in pointing out that such a definition is too narrow for naval strategy. \" This,\" he says, \" differs from military strategy in that it is as necessary in peace as in war. Indeed, in peace it may gain its most decisive victories by occupying in a country, either by purchase or treaty, excellent positions which would perhaps hardly be got by war. It learns to profit by all opportunities of settling on some chosen point of a coast, and to render definitive an occupation which at first was only transient.\" A generation that has seen England within ten years occupy successively Cyprus and Egypt, under terms and conditions on their face transient, but which have not yet led to the abandonment of the positions taken, can readily agree with this remark ; which indeed receives constant illustration from the quiet persistency with which all the great sea powers are seeking position after position, less noted and less noteworthy than Cyprus and Egypt, in the different seas to which their people and their ships penetrate. \" Naval strategy has indeed for its end to found, support, and increase, as well in peace as in war, the sea power of a country;\" and therefore its study has an interest and value for all citizens of a free country, but especially for those who are charged with its foreign and military relations. The general conditions that either are essential to or powerfully affect the greatness of a nation upon the sea will now be examined ; after which a more particular consideration of the various maritime nations of Europe at the middle of the seventeenth century, where the historical survey begins, will serve at once to illustrate and give precision to the conclusions upon the general subject.",

    "text": "The first and most obvious light in which the sea presents itself from the political and social point of view is that of a great highway ; or better, perhaps, of a wide common, over which men may pass in all directions, but on which some well-worn paths show that controlling reasons have led them to choose certain lines of travel rather than others. These lines of travel are called trade routes ; and the reasons which have determined them are to be sought in the history of the world. Notwithstanding all the familiar and unfamiliar dangers of the sea, both travel and traffic by water have always been easier and cheaper than by land. The commercial greatness of Holland was due not only to her shipping at sea, but also to the numerous tranquil water-ways which gave such cheap and easy access to her own interior and to that of Germany. This advantage of carriage by water over that by land was yet more marked in a period when roads were few and very bad, wars frequent and society unsettled, as was the case two hundred years ago. Sea traffic then went in peril of robbers, but was nevertheless safer and quicker than that by land. A Dutch writer of that time, estimating the chances of his country in a war with England, notices among other things that the waterways of England failed to penetrate the country sufficiently ; therefore, the roads being bad, goods from one part of the kingdom to the other must go by sea, and be exposed to capture by the way. As regards purely internal trade, this danger has generally disappeared at the present day. In most civilized countries, now, the destruction or disappearance of the coasting trade would only be an inconvenience, although water transit is still the cheaper. Nevertheless, as late as the wars of the French Republic and the First Empire, those who are familiar with the history of the period, and the light naval literature that has grown up around it, know how constant is the mention of convoys stealing from point to point along the French coast, although the sea swarmed with English cruisers and there were good inland roads. Under modern conditions, however, home trade is but a part of the business of a country bordering on the sea. Foreign necessaries or luxuries must be brought to its ports, either in its own or in foreign ships, which will return, bearing in exchange the products of the country, whether they be the fruits of the earth or the works of men's hands ; and it is the wish of every nation that this shipping business should be done by its own vessels. The ships that thus sail to and fro must have secure ports to which to return, and must, as far as possible, be followed by the protection of their country throughout the voyage. This protection in time of war must be extended by armed shipping. The necessity of a navy, in the restricted sense of the word, springs, therefore, from the existence of a peaceful shipping, and disappears with it, except in the case of a nation which has aggressive tendencies, and keeps up a navy merely as a branch of the military establishment. As the United States has at present no aggressive purposes, and as its merchant service has disappeared, the dwindling of the armed fleet and general lack of interest in it are strictly logical consequences. When for any reason sea trade is again found to pay, a large enough shipping interest will reappear to compel the revival of the war fleet. It is possible that when a canal route through the Central-American Isthmus is seen to be a near certainty, the aggressive impulse may be strong enough to lead to the same result. This is doubtful, however, because a peaceful, gain-loving nation is not far-sighted, and far-sightedness is needed for adequate military preparation, especially in these days. As a nation, with its unarmed and armed shipping, launches forth from its own shores, the need is soon felt of points upon which the ships can rely for peaceful trading, for refuge and supplies. In the present day friendly, though foreign, ports are to be found all over the world ; and their shelter is enough while peace prevails. It was not always so, nor does peace always endure, though the United States have been favored by so long a continuance of it. In earlier times the merchant seaman, seeking for trade in new and unexplored regions, made his gains at risk of life and liberty from suspicious or hostile nations, and was under great delays in collecting a full and profitable freight. He therefore intuitively sought at the far end of his trade route one or more stations, to be given to him by force or favor, where he could fix himself or his agents in reasonable security, where his ships could lie in safety, and where the merchantable products of the land could be continually collecting, awaiting the arrival of the home fleet, which should carry them to the mother-country. As there was immense gain, as well as much risk, in these early voyages, such establishments naturally multiplied and grew until they became colonies ; whose ultimate development and success depended upon the genius and policy of the nation from which they sprang, and form a very great part of the history, and particularly of the sea history, of the world. All colonies had not the simple and natural birth and growth above described. Many were more formal, and purely political, in their conception and founding, the act of the rulers of the people rather than of private individuals ; but the trading-station with its after expansion, the work simply of the adventurer seeking gain, was in its reasons and essence the same as the elaborately organized and chartered colony. In both cases the mother-country had won a foothold in a foreign land, seeking a new outlet for what it had to sell, a new sphere for its shipping, more employment for its people, more comfort and wealth for itself.",

    "text": "The voyages were long and dangerous, the seas often beset with enemies. In the most active days of colonizing there prevailed on the sea a lawlessness…almost lost, and the days of settled peace between maritime nations were few and far between. Thus arose the demand for stations along the road, like the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and Mauritius, not primarily for trade, but for defence and war; the demand for the possession of posts like Gibraltar, Malta, Louisburg…— posts whose value was chiefly strategic, though not necessarily wholly so. Colonies and colonial posts were sometimes commercial, sometimes military in their character…as New York was.\n\nIn these three things — production, with the necessity of exchanging products, shipping, whereby the exchange is carried on, and colonies, which facilitate and enlarge the operations of shipping and tend to protect it by multiplying points of safety — is to be found the key to much of the history, as well as of the policy, of nations bordering upon the sea…by what are called, in a word, natural conditions. It must however be admitted…that the wise or unwise action of individual men has at certain periods had a great modifying influence upon the growth of sea power in the broad sense…and on which it securely rests.\n\nThe principal conditions affecting the sea power of nations may be enumerated as follows:\nI. Geographical Position.\nII. Physical Conformation, including, as connected therewith, natural productions and climate.\nIII. Extent of Territory.\nIV. Number of Population.\nV. Character of the People.\nVI. Character of the Government, including therein the national institutions.\n\nI. Geographical Position. — It may be pointed out…that if a nation be so situated that it is neither forced to defend itself by land nor induced to seek extension of its territory by way of the land, it has, by the very unity of its aim directed upon the sea, an advantage as compared with a people one of whose boundaries is continental. This has been a great advantage to England over both France and Holland as a sea power…while the policy of France was constantly diverted, sometimes wisely and sometimes most foolishly, from the sea to projects of continental extension. These military efforts expended wealth; whereas a wiser and consistent use of her geographical position would have added to it. The geographical position may be such as of itself to promote a concentration, or to necessitate a dispersion, of the naval forces. Here again the British Islands have an advantage over France…The eastern and western French fleets have only been able to unite after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, in attempting which they have often risked and sometimes suffered loss.",

The seaboard of a country is one of its frontiers; and the easier the access offered by the frontier to the region beyond, in this case the sea, the greater will be the tendency of a people toward intercourse with the rest of the world by it. If a country be imagined having a long seaboard, but entirely without a harbor, such a country can have no sea trade of its own, no shipping, no navy. This was practically the case with Belgium when it was a Spanish and an Austrian province. The Dutch, in 1648, as a condition of peace after a successful war, exacted that the Scheldt should be closed to sea commerce. This closed the harbor of Antwerp and transferred the sea trade of Belgium to Holland. The Spanish Netherlands ceased to be a sea power. Numerous and deep harbors are a source of strength and wealth, and doubly so if they are the outlets of navigable streams, which facilitate the concentration in them of a country's internal trade; but by their very accessibility they become a source of weakness in war, if not properly defended. The Dutch in 1667 found little difficulty in ascending the Thames and burning a large fraction of the English navy within sight of London; whereas a few years later the combined fleets of England and France, when attempting a landing in Holland, were foiled by the difficulties of the coast as much as by the valor of the Dutch fleet. In 1778 the harbor of New York, and with it undisputed control of the Hudson River, would have been lost to the English, who were caught at disadvantage, but for the hesitancy of the French admiral. With that control, New England would have been restored to close and safe communication with New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and this blow, following so closely on Burgoyne's disaster of the year before, would probably have led the English to make an earlier peace. The Mississippi is a mighty source of wealth and strength to the United States; but the feeble defences of its mouth and the number of its subsidiary streams penetrating the country made it a weakness and source of disaster to the Southern Confederacy. And lastly, in 1814, the occupation of the Chesapeake and the destruction of Washington gave a sharp lesson of the dangers incurred through the noblest water-ways, if their approaches be undefended; a lesson recent enough to be easily recalled, but which, from the present appearance of the coast defences, seems to be yet more easily forgotten. Nor should it be thought that conditions have changed; circumstances and details of offence and defence have been modified, in these days as before, but the great conditions remain the same.",

She then still retained, as remnants of her past greatness, the Netherlands (now Belgium), Sicily, and other Italian possessions, not to speak of her vast colonies in the New World. Yet so low had the Spanish sea power fallen, that a well-informed and sober-minded Hollander of the day could claim that \"in Spain all the coast is navigated by a few Dutch ships; and since the peace of 1648 their ships and seamen are so few that they have publicly begun to hire our ships to sail to the Indies, whereas they were formerly careful to exclude all foreigners from there. ... It is manifest,\" he goes on, \"that the West Indies, being as the stomach to Spain (for from it nearly all the revenue is drawn), must be joined to the Spanish head by a sea force; and that Naples and the Netherlands, being like two arms, they cannot lay out their strength for Spain, nor receive anything thence but by shipping,—all which may easily be done by our shipping in peace, and by it obstructed in war.\" Half a century before, Sully, the great minister of Henry IV., had characterized Spain \"as one of those States whose legs and arms are strong and powerful, but the heart infinitely weak and feeble.\" Since his day the Spanish navy had suffered not only disaster, but annihilation; not only humiliation, but degradation. The consequences briefly were that shipping was destroyed; manufactures perished with it. The government depended for its support, not upon a widespread healthy commerce and industry that could survive many a staggering blow, but upon a narrow stream of silver trickling through a few treasure-ships from America, easily and frequently intercepted by an enemy's cruisers. The loss of half a dozen galleons more than once paralyzed its movements for a year. While the war in the Netherlands lasted, the Dutch control of the sea forced Spain to send her troops by a long and costly journey overland instead of by sea; and the same cause reduced her to such straits for necessaries that, by a mutual arrangement which seems very odd to modern ideas, her wants were supplied by Dutch ships, which thus maintained the enemies of their country, but received in return specie which was welcome in the Amsterdam exchange. In America, the Spanish protected themselves as best they might behind masonry, unaided from home; while in the Mediterranean they escaped insult and injury mainly through the indifference of the Dutch, for the French and English had not yet begun to contend for mastery there.",

    "text": "III. Extent of Territory.—The last of the conditions affecting the development of a nation as a sea power, and touching the country itself as distinguished from the people who dwell there, is Extent of Territory. This may be dismissed with comparatively few words. As regards the development of sea power, it is not the total number of square miles which a country contains, but the length of its coast-line and the character of its harbors that are to be considered. As to these it is to be said that, the geographical and physical conditions being the same, extent of sea-coast is a source of strength or weakness according as the population is large or small. A country is in this like a fortress; the garrison must be proportioned to the enceinte. A recent familiar instance is found in the American War of Secession. Had the South had a people as numerous as it was warlike, and a navy commensurate to its other resources as a sea power, the great extent of its sea-coast and its numerous inlets would have been elements of great strength. The people of the United States and the Government of that day justly prided themselves on the effectiveness of the blockade of the whole Southern coast. It was a great feat, a very great feat; but it would have been an impossible feat had the Southerners been more numerous, and a nation of seamen. What was there shown was not, as has been said, how such a blockade can be maintained, but that such a blockade is possible in the face of a population not only unused to the sea, but also scanty in numbers. Those who recall how the blockade was maintained, and the class of ships that blockaded during great part of the war, know that the plan, correct under the circumstances, could not have been carried out in the face of a real navy. Scattered unsupported along the coast, the United States ships kept their places, singly or in small detachments, in face of an extensive network of inland water communications which favored secret concentration of the enemy. Behind the first line of water communications were long estuaries, and here and there strong fortresses, upon either of which the enemy's ships could always fall back to elude pursuit or to receive protection. Had there been a Southern navy to profit by such advantages, or by the scattered condition of the United States ships, the latter could not have been distributed as they were; and being forced to concentrate for mutual support, many small but useful approaches would have been left open to commerce. But as the Southern coast, from its extent and many inlets, might have been a source of strength, so, from those very characteristics, it became a fruitful source of injury. The great story of the opening of the Mississippi is but the most striking illustration of an action that was going on incessantly all over the South. At every breach of the sea frontier, war-ships were entering. The streams that had carried the wealth and supported the trade of the seceding States turned against them, and admitted their enemies to their hearts. Dismay, insecurity, paralysis, prevailed in regions that might, under happier auspices, have kept a nation alive through the most exhausting war. Never did sea power play a greater or a more decisive part than in the contest which determined that the course of the world's history would be modified by the existence of one great nation, instead of several rival States, in the North American continent. But while just pride is felt in the well-earned glory of those days, and the greatness of the results due to naval preponderance is admitted, Americans who understand the facts should never fail to remind the over-confidence of their countrymen that the South not only had no navy, not only was not a seafaring people, but that also its population was not proportioned to the extent of the sea-coast which it had to defend.",

    "section": "IV. Number of Population (Partial)",
    "text": "IV. Number of Population.—After the consideration of the natural conditions of a country should follow an examination of the characteristics of its population as affecting the development of sea power; and first among these will be taken, because of its relations to the extent of the territory, which has just been discussed, the number of the people who live in it. It has been said that in respect of dimensions it is not merely the number of square miles, but the extent and character of the sea-coast that is to be considered with reference to sea power; and so, in point of population, it is not only the grand total, but the number following the sea, or at least readily available for employment on ship-board and for the creation of naval material, that must be counted. For example, formerly and up to the end of the great wars following the French Revolution, the population of France was much greater than that of England; but in respect of sea power in general, peaceful commerce as well as military efficiency, France was much inferior to England. In the matter of military efficiency this fact is the more remarkable because at times, in point of military preparation at the outbreak of war, France had the advantage; but she was not able to keep it. Thus in 1778, when war broke out, France, through her maritime inscription, was able to man at once fifty ships-of-the-line. England, on the contrary, by reason of the dispersal over the globe of that very shipping on which her naval strength so securely rested, had much trouble in manning forty at home; but in 1782 she had one hundred and twenty in commission or ready for commission, while France had never been able to exceed seventy-one. Again, as late as 1840, when the two nations were on the verge of war in the Levant, a most accomplished French officer of the day, while extolling the high state of efficiency of the French fleet and the eminent qualities of its admiral, and expressing confidence in the results of an encounter with an equal enemy, goes on to say: \"Behind the squadron of twenty-one ships-of-the-line which we could then assemble, there was no reserve; not another ship could have been commissioned within six months.\" And this was due not only to lack of ships and of proper equipments, though both were wanting. \"Our maritime inscription,\" he continues, \"was so exhausted by what we had done [in manning twenty-one ships], that the permanent levy established in all quarters did not supply reliefs for the men, who were already more than three years on cruise.\" A contrast such as this shows a difference in what is called staying power, or reserve force, which is even greater than appears on the surface; for a great shipping afloat necessarily employs, besides the crews, a large number of people engaged in the various handicrafts which facilitate the making and repairing of naval material, or following other callings more or less closely connected with the water and with craft of all kinds. Such kindred callings give an undoubted aptitude for the sea from the outset. There is an anecdote showing curious insight into this matter on the part of one of England's distinguished seamen, Sir Edward Pellew. When the war broke out in 1793, the usual scarceness of seamen was met. Eager to get to sea and unable to fill his complement otherwise than with landsmen, he instructed his officers to seek for Cornish miners; reasoning from the conditions and dangers of their calling, of which he had personal knowledge, that they would quickly fit into the demands of sea life.",

    "text": "The result showed his sagacity, for, thus escaping an otherwise unavoidable delay, he was fortunate enough to capture the first frigate taken in the war in single combat; and what is especially instructive is, that although but a few weeks in commission, while his opponent had been over a year, the losses, heavy on both sides, were nearly equal. It may be urged that such reserve strength has now nearly lost the importance it once had, because modern ships and weapons take so long to make, and because modern States aim at developing the whole power of their armed force, on the outbreak of war, with such rapidity as to strike a disabling blow before the enemy can organize an equal effort. To use a familiar phrase, there will not be time for the whole resistance of the national fabric to come into play; the blow will fall on the organized military fleet, and if that yield, the solidity of the rest of the structure will avail nothing. To a certain extent this is true; but then it has always been true, though to a less extent formerly than now. Granted the meeting of two fleets which represent practically the whole present strength of their two nations, if one of them be destroyed, while the other remains fit for action, there will be much less hope now than formerly that the vanquished can restore his navy for that war; and the result will be disastrous just in proportion to the dependence of the nation upon her sea power. A Trafalgar would have been a much more fatal blow to England than it was to France, had the English fleet then represented, as the allied fleet did, the bulk of the nation's power. Trafalgar in such a case would have been to England what Austerlitz was to Austria, and Jena to Prussia; an empire would have been laid prostrate by the destruction or disorganization of its military forces, which, it is said, were the favorite objective of Napoleon. But does the consideration of such exceptional disasters in the past justify the putting a low value upon that reserve strength, based upon the number of inhabitants fitted for a certain kind of military life, which is here being considered? The blows just mentioned were dealt by men of exceptional genius, at the head of armed bodies of exceptional training, esprit-de-corps, and prestige, and were, besides, inflicted upon opponents more or less demoralized by conscious inferiority and previous defeat. Austerlitz had been closely preceded by Ulm, where thirty thousand Austrians laid down their arms without a battle; and the history of the previous years had been one long record of Austrian reverse and French success, Trafalgar followed closely upon a cruise, justly called a campaign,",

    "text": "of almost constant failure ; and farther back, but still recent, were the memories of St. Vincent for the Spaniards, and of the Nile for the French, in the allied fleet. Except the case of Jena, these crushing overthrows were not single disasters, but final blows ; and in the Jena campaign there was a disparity in numbers, equipment, and general prepara- tion for war, which makes it less applicable in considering what may result from a single victory. England is at the present time the greatest maritime nation in the world ; in steam and iron she has kept the superiority she had in the days of sail and wood. France and England are the two powers that have the largest military navies ; and it is so far an open question which of the two is the more powerful, that they may be regarded as practically of equal strength in material for a sea war. In the case of a collision can there be assumed such a difference of personnel, or of preparation, as to make it probable that a decisive inequality will result from one battle or one campaign ? If not, the reserve strength will begin to tell ; organized reserve first, then reserve of seafaring population, reserve of mechanical skill, reserve of wealth. It seems to have been somewhat forgotten that England's leadership in mechanical arts gives her a reserve of mechanics, who can easily familiarize them- selves with the appliances of modern iron-clads ; and as her commerce and industries feel the burden of the war, the sur- plus of seamen and mechanics will go to the armed shipping. The whole question of the value of a reserve, developed or undeveloped, amounts now to this : Have modern conditions of warfare made it probable that, of two nearly equal adver- saries, one will be so prostrated in a single campaign that a decisive result will be reached in that time ? Sea warfare has given no answer. The crushing successes of Prussia against Austria, and of Germany against France, appear to have been those of a stronger over a much weaker nation, whether the weakness were due to natural causes, or to offi- cial incompetency. How would a delay like that of Plevna have affected the fortune of war, had Turkey had any reserve of national power upon which to call ? If time be, as is everywhere admitted, a supreme factor in war, it behooves countries whose genius is essentially not military, whose people, like all free people, object to pay for large military establishments, to see to it that they are at least strong enough to gain the time necessary to turn the spirit and capacity of their subjects into the new activities which war calls for. If the existing force by land or sea is strong enough so to hold out, even though at a disadvantage, the country may rely upon its natural resources and strength coming into play for whatever they are worth, — its numbers, its wealth, its capacities of every kind. If, on the other hand, what force it has can be overthrown and crushed quickly, the most magnificent possibilities of natural power will not save it from humiliating conditions, nor, if its foe be wise, from guarantees which will postpone revenge to a distant future. The story is constantly repeated on the smaller fields of war : \" If so-and-so can hold out a little longer, this can be saved or that can be done ; \" as in sickness it is often said : \" If the patient can only hold out so long, the strength of his constitution may pull him through.\" England to some extent is now such a country. Holland was such a country ; she would not pay, and if she escaped, it was but by the skin of her teeth. \" Never in time of peace and from fear of a rupture,\" wrote their great states- man, De Witt, \" will they take resolutions strong enough to lead them to pecuniary sacrifices beforehand. The character of the Dutch is such that, unless danger stares them in the face, they are indisposed to lay out money for their own de- fence. I have to do with a people who, liberal to profusion where they ought to economize, are often sparing to avarice where they ought to spend.\" That our own country is open to the same reproach, is pa- tent to all the world. The United States has not that shield of defensive power behind which time can be gained to develop its reserve of strength. As for a seafaring population ade- quate to her possible needs, where is it ? Such a resource, proportionate to her coast-line and population, is to be found only in a national merchant shipping and its related industries, which at present scarcely exist. It will matter little whether the crews of such ships are native or foreign born, provided they are attached to the flag, and her power at sea is sufficient to enable the most of them to get back in case of war. \"When foreigners by thousands are admitted to the ballot, it is of little moment that they are given fighting-room on board ship. Though the treatment of the subject has been somewhat discursive, it may be admitted that a great population follow- ing callings related to the sea is, now as formerly, a great element of sea power ; that the United States is deficient in that element ; , and that its foundations can be laid only in a large commerce under her own flag.",

    "section": "II. Discussion of the Elements of Sea Power: National Character",
    "text": "National Character. — The effect of national character and aptitudes upon the development of sea power will next be considered. If sea power be really based upon a peaceful and extensive commerce, aptitude for commercial pursuits must be a dis- tinguishing feature of the nations that have at one time or another been great upon the sea. History almost without exception affirms that this is true. Save the Romans, there is no marked instance to the contrary. All men seek gain and, more or less, love money ; but the way in which gain is sought will have a marked effect upon the commercial fortunes and the history of the people inhabit- ing a country. If history may be believed, the way in which the Spaniards and their kindred nation, the Portuguese, sought wealth, not only brought a blot upon the national character, but was also fatal to the growth of a healthy commerce ; and so to the industries upon which commerce lives, and ultimately to that national wealth which was sought by mistaken paths. The desire for gain rose in them to fierce avarice ; so they sought in the new-found worlds which gave such an impetus to the commercial and maritime development of the countries of Europe, not new fields of industry, not even the healthy excitement of exploration and adventure, but gold and silver. They had many great qualities ; they were bold, enterprising, temperate, patient of suffering, enthusiastic, and gifted with intense national feeling. When to these qualities are added the advantages of Spain's position and well-situated ports, the fact that she was first to occupy large and rich portions of the new worlds and long remained without a competitor, and that for a hundred years after the discovery of America she was the leading State in Europe, she might have been ex- pected to take the foremost place among the sea powers. Exactly the contrary was the result, as all know. Since the battle of Lepanto in 1571, though engaged in many wars, no sea victory of any consequence shines on the pages of Spanish history ; and the decay of her commerce sufficiently accounts for the painful and sometimes ludicrous inaptness shown on the decks of her ships of war. Doirbtless such a result is not to be attributed to one cause only. Doubtless the govern- ment of Spain was in many ways such as to cramp and blight a free and healthy development of private enterprise ; but the character of a great people breaks through or shapes the character of its government, and it can hardly be doubted that had the bent of the people been toward trade, the action of government would have been drawn into the same current. The great field of the colonies, also, was remote from the centre of that despotism which blighted the growth of old Spain. As it was, thousands of Spaniards, of the working as well as the upper classes, left Spain ; and the occupa- tions in which they engaged abroad sent home little but specie, or merchandise of small bulk, requiring but small tonnage. The mother-country herself produced little but wool, fruit, and iron ; her manufactures were naught ; her industries suffered ; her population steadily decreased. Both she and her colonies depended upon the Dutch for so many of the necessaries of life, that the products of their scanty in- dustries could not suffice to pay for them. \"So that Holland merchants,\" writes a contemporary, \" who carry money to most parts of the world to buy commodities, must out of this single country of Europe carry home money, which they receive in payment of their goods.\" Thus their eagerly sought emblem of wealth passed quickly from their hands. It has already been pointed out how weak, from a military point of view, Spain was from this decay of her shipping. Her wealth being in small bulk on a few ships, following more or less regular routes, was easily seized by an enemy, and the sinews of war paralyzed ; whereas the wealth of England and Holland, scattered over thousands of ships in all parts of the world, received many bitter blows in many exhausting wars, without checking a growth which, though painful, was steady. The fortunes of Portugal, united to Spain during a most critical period of her history, followed the same downward path ; although foremost in the begin- ning of the race for development by sea, she fell utterly behind. \" The mines of Brazil were the ruin of Portugal, as those of Mexico and Peru had been of Spain ; all manufac- tures fell into insane contempt ; ere long the English sup- plied the Portuguese not only with clothes, but with all mer- chandise, all commodities, even to salt-fish and grain. After their gold, the Portuguese abandoned their very soil ; the vineyards of Oporto were finally bought by the English with Brazilian gold, which had only passed through Portugal to be spread throughout England.\" We are assured that in fifty years, five hundred millions of dollars were extracted from \" the mines of Brazil, and that at the end of the time Portugal had but twenty -five millions in specie,\" — a striking example of the difference between real and fictitious wealth. The English and Dutch were no less desirous of gain than the southern nations. Each in turn has been called \" a na- tion of shopkeepers ; \" but the jeer, in so far as it is just, is to the credit of their wisdom and uprightness. They were no less bold, no less enterprising, no less patient. Indeed, they were more patient, in that they sought riches not by the sword but by labor, which is the reproach meant to be implied by the epithet ; for thus they took the longest, instead of what seemed the shortest, road to wealth. But these two peoples, radically of the same race, had other qualities, no less impor- tant than those just named, which combined with their sur- roundings to favor their development by sea. They were by nature business-men, traders, producers, negotiators. There- fore both in their native country and abroad, whether settled in the ports of civilized nations, or of barbarous eastern rulers, or in colonies of their own foundation, they every- where strove to draw out all the resources of the land, to develop and increase them. The quick instinct of the born trader, shopkeeper if you will, sought continually new articles to exchange ; and this search, combined with the industrious character evolved through generations of labor, made them necessarily producers. At home they became great as manu- facturers ; abroad, where they controlled, the land grew richer continually, products multiplied, and the necessary exchange between home and the settlements called for more ships. Their shipping therefore increased with these demands of trade, and nations with less aptitude for maritime enterprise, even France herself, great as she has been, called for their products and for the service of their ships. Thus in many ways they advanced to power at sea. This natural tendency and growth were indeed modified and seriously checked at times by the interference of other governments, jealous of a prosperity which their own people could invade only by the aid of artificial support, — a support which will be considered under the head of governmental action as affecting sea power. The tendency to trade, involving of necessity the produc- tion of something to trade with, is the national characteristic most important to the development of sea power. Granting it and a good seaboard, it is not likely that the dangers of the sea, or any aversion to it, will deter a people from seeking wealth by the paths of ocean commerce. Where wealth is sought by other means, it may be found; but it will not ne- cessarily lead to sea power. Take France. France has a fine country, an industrious people, an admirable position. The French navy has known periods of great glory, and in its lowest estate has never dishonored the military reputation so dear to the nation. Yet as a maritime State, securely resting upon a broad basis of sea commerce, France, as compared with other historical sea-peoples, has never held more than a respectable position. The chief reason for this, so far as national character goes, is the way in which wealth is sought. As Spain and Portugal sought it by digging gold out of the ground, the temper of the French people leads them to seek it by thrift, economy, hoarding. It is said to be harder to keep than to make a fortune. Possibly ; but the adventurous temper, which risks what it has to gain more, has much in common with the adventurous spirit that conquers worlds for commerce. The tendency to save and put aside, to venture timidly and on a small scale, may lead to a general diffusion of wealth on a like small scale, but not to the risks and de- velopment of external trade and shipping interests.

With us a large number of people take one share or a very few. When these were in the market my wife said to me, ' You take two shares, one for you and one for me.' \" As regards the stability of a man's personal fortunes this kind of prudence is doubtless wise ; but when excessive prudence or financial timidity becomes a national trait, it must tend to hamper the expansion of commerce and of the nation's ship- ping. The same caution in money matters, appearing in an- other relation of life, has checked the production of children, and keeps the population of France nearly stationary. The noble classes of Europe inherited from tlie Middle Ages a supercilious contempt for peaceful trade, which has exer- cised a modifying influence upon its growth, according to the national character of different countries. The pride of the Spaniards fell easily in with this spirit of contempt, and co- operated with that disastrous unwillingness to work and wait for wealth which turned them away from commerce. In France, the vanity which is conceded even by Frenchmen to be a national trait led in the same direction. The numbers and brilliancy of the nobility, and the consideration enjoyed by them, set a seal of inferiority upon an occupation which they despised. Rich mercliants and manufacturers sighed for the honors of nobility, and upon obtaining them, abandoned their lucrative professions. Tlierefore, while the industry of the people and the fruitfulness of the soil saved commerce from total decay, it was pursued under a sense of humiliation which caused its best representatives to escape from it as soon as they could. Louis XIV., under the influence of Colbert, put forth an ordinance \" authorizing all noblemen to take an interest in merchant ships, goods and merchandise, without being considered as having derogated from nobility, ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 55 provided they did not sell at retail ; \" and the reason given for this action was, \" that it imports the good of our subjects and our own satisfaction, to efface the relic of a public opin- ion, universally prevalent, that maritime commerce is incom- patible with nobility.\" But a prejudice involving conscious and open superiority is not readily effaced by ordinances, especially when vanity is a conspicuous trait in national char- acter ; and many years later Montesquieu taught that it is contrary to the spirit of monarchy that the nobility should engage in trade. In Holland there was a nobility ; but the State was repub- lican in name, allowed large scope to personal freedom and enterprise, and the centres of power were in the great cities. The foundation of the national greatness was money — or rather wealth. Wealth, as a source of civic distinction, car- ried with it also power in the State ; and with power there went social position and consideration. In England the same result obtained. The nobility were proud ; but in a repre- sentative government the power of wealth could be neither put down nor overshadowed. It was patent to the eyes of all, it was honored by all ; and in England, as well as Holland, the occupations which were the source of wealth shared in the honor given to wealth itself. Thus, in all the countries named, social sentiment, the outcome of national character- istics, had a marked influence upon the national attitude toward trade.",

    "text": "In yet another way does the national genius affect the growth of sea power in its broadest sense ; and that is in so far as it possesses the capacity for planting healthy colonies. Of colonization, as of all other growtlis, it is true that it is most healthy when it is most natural. Therefore colonies that spring from the felt wants and natural impulses of a whole people will have the most solid foundations ; and their sub sequent growth will be surest when they are least trammelled from home, if the people have the genius for independent action. Men of the past three centuries have keenly felt the value to the mother-country of colonies as outlets for the 56 DISCUSSION OF THE home products and as a nursery for commerce and shipping ; but efforts at colonization have not had tlie same general origin, nor have different systems all had the same success. The efforts of statesmen, however far-seeing and careful, liave not been able to supply the lack of strong natural im- pulse ; nor can the most minute regulation from home pro- duce as good results as a happier neglect, when the germ of self-development is found in the national character. There has been no greater display of wisdom in the national ad- ministration of successful colonies than in that of unsuc- cessful. Perhaps there has been even less. If elaborate system and supervision, careful adaptation of means to ends, diligent nursing, could avail for colonial growth, the genius of England has less of this systematizing faculty than the genius of France ; but England, not France, has been the great colonizer of the world. Successful colonization, with its consequent effect upon commerce and sea power, depends essentially upon national character ; because colonies grow best when they grow of themselves, naturally. The char- acter of the colonist, not the care of the home government, is the principle of the colony's growth. This truth stands out the clearer because the general atti- tude of all the home governments toward their colonies was entirely selfish. However founded, as soon as it was recog- nized to be of consequence, the colony became to the home country a cow to be milked ; to be cared for, of course, but chiefly as a piece of property valued for the returns it gave. Legislation was directed toward a monopoly of its external trade ; the places in its government afforded posts of value for occupants from the mother-country ; and the colony was looked upon, as the sea still so often is, as a fit place for those who were ungovernable or useless at home. The mili- tary administration, however, so long as it remains a colony, is the proper and necessary attribute of the home government. The fact of England's unique and wonderful success as a great colonizing nation is too evident to be dwelt upon ; and the reason for it appears to lie chiefly in two traits of the ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 57 national character. The English colonist naturally and readily settles down in his new country, identifies his interest with it, and though keeping an affectionate remembrance of the home from which he came, has no restless eagerness to re- turn. In the second place, the Englishman at once and in- stinctively seeks to develop the resources of the new country in the broadest sense. In the former particular he differs from the French, who were ever longingly looking back to the delights of their pleasant land ; in the latter, from the Spaniards, whose range of interest and ambition was too narrow for the full evolution of the possibilities of a new country. The character and the necessities of the Dutch led them naturally to plant colonies ; and by the year 1650 they had in the East Indies, in Africa, and in America a large number, only to name which would be tedious. They were then far ahead of England in this matter. But though the origin of tliese colonies, purely commercial in its character, was natural, there seems to have been lacking to them a principle of growth. \" In planting them they never sought an extension of empire, but merely an acquisition of trade and commerce. They attempted conquest only when forced by the pressure of circumstances. Generally they were content to trade under the protection of the sovereign of the country.\" This placid satisfaction with gain alone, unaccompanied by political ambi- tion, tended, like the despotism of Fr .k 3 and Spain, to keep the colonies mere commercial dependencies upon the mother- country, and so killed the natural principle of growth. Before quitting this head of tlie inquiry, it is well to ask how far the national character of Americans is fitted to de- velop a great sea power, should other circumstances become favorable. It seems scarcely necessary, however, to do more than appeal to a not very distant past to prove that, if legislative hindrances be removed, and more remunerative fields of enterprise filled up, the sea power will not long delay its appearance. The instinct for commerce, bold enterprise in 58 DISCUSSION OF THE the pursuit of gain, and a keen scent for the trails that lead to it, all exist ; and if there be in the future any fields calling for colonization, it cannot be doubted that Americans will carry to them all their inherited aptitude for self-government and independent growth.",

    "text": "VL Character of the Government. — In discussing the ef- fects upon the development of a nation's sea power exerted by its government and institutions, it will be necessary to avoid a tendency to over-philosophizing, to confine attention to obvious and immediate causes and their plain results, without prying too far beneath the surface for remote and ultimate influences. Nevertheless, it must be noted that particular forms of government with their accompanying institutions, and the character of rulers at one time or another, have exercised a very marked influence upon the development of sea power. The various traits of a country and its people which have so far been considered constitute the natural characteristics with which a nation, like a man, begins its career ; the con- duct of the government in turn corresponds to the exercise of the intelligent will-power, which, according as it is wise, energetic and persevering, or the reverse, causes success or failure in a man's life or a nation's history. It would seem probable that a government in full accord with the natural bias of its people would most successfully advance its growth icl every respect ; and, in the matter of sea power, the most brilliant successes have followed where there has been intelligent direction by a government f«lly imbued with the spirit of the people and conscious of its true general bent. Such a government is most certainly secured when the will of the people, or of their best natural exponents, has some large share in making it ; but such free govern- ments have sometimes fallen short, while on the other hand despotic power, wielded with judgment and consistency, has created at times a great sea commerce and a brilliant navy with greater directness than can be reached by the slower processes of a free people. The difficulty in the latter case ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 59 is to insure perseverance after the death of a particular despot. England having undoubtedly reached the greatest height of sea power of any modern nation, the action of her government first claims attention. In general direction this action has been consistent, though often far from praiseworthy. It has aimed steadily at the control of the sea. One of its most arrogant expressions dates back as far as the reign of James I., when she had scarce any possessions outside her own islands ; before Vii-ginia or Massachusetts was settled. Here is Richelieu's account of it : — \" The Duke of Sully, minister of Henry IV. [one of the most chivalrous princes that ever lived], having embarked at Calais in a French ship wearing the French Hag at the main, was no sooner in the Channel than, meeting an English despatch-boat which was there to receive him, the commander of the latter ordered the French ship to lower her flag. The Duke, considering that his quality fi-eed him from such an affront, boldly refused ; but this refusal was followed by three cannon-shot, which, piercing his ship, pierced the heart like- wise of all good Frenchmen. Might forced him to yield what right forbade, and for all the complaints he made he could get no better reply from the English captain than this : ' That just as his duty obliged him to honor the ambassador's rank, it also obliged him to exact the honor due to the flag of his master as sovereign of the sea.' If the words of King James himself were more polite, they neverthe- less had no other effect than to compel the Duke to take counsel of his prudence, feigning to be satisfied, while his wound was all the time smarting and incurable. Henry the Great had to practise mod- eration on this occasion ; but with the resolve another time to sustain the rights of his crown by the force that, with the aid of time, he should be able to put upon the sea.\" This act of unpardonable insolence, according to modern ideas, was not so much out of accord with the spirit of nations in that day. It is chiefly noteworthy as the most striking, as well as one of the earliest indications of the purpose of Eng- land to assert herself at all risks upon the sea ; and the insult was offered under one of her most timid kinffs to an ambassa- 60 DISCUSSION OF THE dor immediately representing the bravest and ablest of French sovereigns. This empty honor of the flag, a claim insignifi- cant except as the outward manifestation of the purpose of a government, was as rigidly exacted under Cromwell as under the kings. It was one of the conditions of peace yielded by the Dutch after tlieir disastrous war of 1654. Cromwell, a despot in everything but name, was keenly alive to all that concerned England's honor and strength, and did not stop at barren salutes to promote them. Hardly yet possessed of power, the English navy sprang rapidly into a new life and vigor under his stern rule. England's rights, or reparation for her wrongs, were demanded by her fleets throughout the world, — in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, against tlie Bar- bary States, in the West Indies ; and under liim the conquest of Jamaica began that extension of her empire, by force of arms, which has gone on to our own days. Nor were equally strong peaceful measures for the growth of English trade and shipping forgotten. Cromwell's celebrated Navigation Act de- clared that all imports into England or her colonics must be conveyed exclusively in vessels belonging to England herself, or to the country in which the products carried were grown or manufactured. This decree, aimed specially at the Dutch, the common carriers of Europe, was resented throughout the com- mercial world ; but the benefit to England, in those days of national strife and animosity, was so apparent that it lasted",

Charles II, though treacherous in his dealings with Louis XIV to become independent of Parliament, recognized England's reliance on commerce and naval force. He warned Louis that French maritime expansion would perpetuate jealousy between them.  During negotiations for an attack on the Dutch Republic, Charles insisted on English command of the combined fleets, stating, \"It is the custom of the English to command at sea.\" He reserved maritime plunder controlling the Scheldt and Meuse rivers for England in the planned partition of the Dutch Republic.  The navy under Charles initially retained Cromwell's discipline, though later declining. Monk, despite a strategic blunder, engaged a superior Dutch force for three days in 1666, prioritizing England's naval prestige. James II, a seaman and veteran of sea battles, succeeded Charles. Under William III, England and Holland united against Louis XIV until the Peace of Utrecht in 1713. England consciously expanded her sea dominion.  While openly opposing France at sea, she also undermined Dutch naval power. The treaty stipulated Holland provide three-eighths of the sea forces while England provided five-eighths, effectively burdening Holland with the naval war. The peace settlement granted England Gibraltar, Port Mahon, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Hudson's Bay, further diminishing Dutch naval strength.  Positioned in America, the West Indies, and the Mediterranean, England progressed towards becoming the British Empire.",

In the Baltic, her fleets checked Peter the Great's ambitions on Sweden, preserving a balance of power and protecting her trade and naval stores. England and Holland thwarted Denmark's attempt to establish an East India company, viewing it as a threat to their sea interests. They similarly stifled the Ostend East India Company, backed by Austria, aiming to restore trade to the Low Countries. In the Mediterranean, England supported Austria's claim to Sicily, leading to the destruction of the resurgent Spanish navy and dockyards. England exploited trade privileges in Spanish America through smuggling, further demonstrating its focus on maritime interests.  European powers failed to recognize the threat of England's growing sea power.  France, for twelve years after Utrecht, sided with England against Spain due to its rulers' personal interests.  Even when this policy reversed in 1726, the French navy remained neglected. The outbreak of war with Spain in 1739 saw the English navy numerically superior to the combined forces of Spain and France, a disparity that widened during the subsequent 25 years of near-continuous warfare. During this time, England consciously built her colonial empire, leveraging her sea power. Her wealth, derived from this sea power, enabled her to subsidize continental allies, giving her a prominent role in European politics.",

Despite substantial gains, including securing rule in India and North America east of the Mississippi, the American Revolution proved a strategic error from a sea power perspective. The colonies, large and distant, presented a challenge to control by force, especially with potential foreign support. Their size and population, coupled with the distance from England, made them difficult to hold against determined resistance.  The government's failure to recognize this led to the loss of a significant portion of British sea power.  The consistent pursuit of naval dominance was facilitated by England's political structure, which placed power in the hands of a landed aristocracy.  This class, proud of national glory and less sensitive to the costs of war, readily bore the financial burdens of military preparedness.

    "text": "67 keeps up a spirit of military honor, which is of the first importance in ages when military institutions have not yet provided the sufficient substitute in what is called esprit-de-corps. But although full of class feeling and class prejudice, which made themselves felt in the navy as well as elsewhere, their practical sense left open the way of promotion to its highest honors to the more humbly born; and every age saw admirals who had sprung from the lowest of the people. In this the temper of the English upper class differed markedly from that of the French. As late as 1789, at the outbreak of the Revolution, the French Navy List still bore the name of an official whose duty was to verify the proofs of noble birth on the part of those intending to enter the naval school.\nSince 1815, and especially in our own day, the government of England has passed very much more into the hands of the people at large. Whether her sea power will suffer therefrom remains to be seen. Its broad basis still remains in a great trade, large mechanical industries, and an extensive colonial system. Whether a democratic government will have the foresight, the keen sensitiveness to national position and credit, the willingness to insure its prosperity by adequate outpouring of money in times of peace, all which are necessary for military preparation, is yet an open question. Popular governments are not generally favorable to military expenditure, however necessary, and there are signs that England tends to drop behind. It has already been seen that the Dutch Republic, even more than the English nation, drew its prosperity and its very life from the sea. The character and policy of its government were far less favorable to a consistent support of sea power. Composed of seven provinces, with the political name of the United Provinces, the actual distribution of power may be roughly described to Americans as an exaggerated example of States Rights. Each of the maritime provinces had its own fleet and its own admiralty, with consequent jealousies. This disorganizing tendency was partly counteracted by the great preponderance of the Province of Holland, which alone contributed five sixths of the fleet and fifty-eight per cent of the taxes, and consequently had a proportionate share in directing the national policy. Although intensely patriotic, and capable of making the last sacrifices for freedom, the commercial spirit of the people penetrated the government, which indeed might be called a commercial aristocracy, and made it averse to war, and to the expenditures which are necessary in preparing for war. As has before been said, it was not until danger stared them in the face that the burgomasters were willing to pay for their defences. While the republican government lasted, however, this economy was practised least of all upon the fleet; and until the death of John De Witt, in 1672, and the peace with England in 1674, the Dutch navy was in point of numbers and equipment able to make a fair show against the combined navies of England and France. Its efficiency at this time undoubtedly saved the country from the destruction planned by the two kings. With De Witt's death the republic passed away, and was followed by the practically monarchical government of William of Orange. The life-long policy of this prince, then only eighteen, was resistance to Louis XIV. and to the extension of French power.",

    "text": "This resistance took shape upon the land rather than the sea, — a tendency promoted by England's withdrawal from the war. As early as 1676, Admiral De Ruyter found the force given him unequal to cope with the French alone. With the eyes of the government fixed on the land frontier, the navy rapidly declined. In 1688, when William of Orange needed a fleet to convoy him to England, the burgomasters of Amsterdam objected that the navy was incalculably decreased in strength, as well as deprived of its ablest commanders. When king of England, William still kept his position as stadtholder, and with it his general European policy. He found in England the sea power he needed, and used the resources of Holland for the land war. This Dutch prince consented that in the allied fleets, in councils of war, the Dutch admirals should sit below the junior English captain; and Dutch interests at sea were sacrificed as readily as Dutch pride to the demands of England. When William died, his policy was still followed by the government which succeeded him. Its aims were wholly centred upon the land, and at the Peace of Utrecht, which closed a series of wars extending over forty years, Holland, having established no sea claim, gained nothing in the way of sea resources, of colonial extension, or of commerce. Of the last of these wars an English historian says: \"The economy of the Dutch greatly hurt their reputation and their trade. Their men-of-war in the Mediterranean were always victualled short, and their convoys were so weak and ill-provided that for one ship that we lost, they lost five, which begat a general notion that we were the safer carriers, which certainly had a good effect. Hence it was that our trade rather increased than diminished in this war.\" From that time Holland ceased to have a great sea power, and rapidly lost the leading position among the nations which that power had built up. It is only just to say that no policy could have saved from decline this small, though determined, nation, in face of the persistent enmity of Louis XIV. The friendship of France, insuring peace on her landward frontier, would have enabled her, at least for a longer time, to dispute with England the dominion of the seas; and as allies the navies of the two continental States might have checked the growth of the enormous sea power which has just been considered. Sea peace between England and Holland was only possible by the virtual subjection of one or the other, for both aimed at the same object. Between France and Holland it was otherwise; and the fall of Holland proceeded, not necessarily from her inferior size and numbers, but from faulty policy on the part of the two governments. It does not concern us to decide which was the more to blame. France, admirably situated for the possession of sea power, received a definite policy for the guidance of her government from two great rulers, Henry IV. and Richelieu. With certain well-defined projects of extension eastward upon the land were combined a steady resistance to the House of Austria, which then ruled in both Austria and Spain, and an equal purpose of resistance to England upon the sea. To further this latter end, as well as for other reasons, Holland was to be courted as an ally. Commerce and fisheries as the basis of sea power were to be encouraged, and a military navy was to be built up.",

    "text": "Richelieu left what he called his political will, in which he pointed out the opportunities of France for achieving sea power, based upon her position and resources; and French writers consider him the virtual founder of the navy, not merely because he equipped ships, but from the breadth of his views and his measures to insure sound institutions and steady growth. After his death, Mazarin inherited his views and general policy, but not his lofty and martial spirit, and during his rule the newly formed navy disappeared. When Louis XIV. took the government into his own hands, in 1661, there were but thirty ships of war, of which only three had as many as sixty guns. Then began a most astonishing manifestation of the work which can be done by absolute government ably and systematically wielded. That part of the administration which dealt with trade, manufactures, shipping, and colonies, was given to a man of great practical genius, Colbert, who had served with Richelieu and had drunk in fully his ideas and policy. He pursued his aims in a spirit thoroughly French. Everything was to be organized, the spring of everything was in the minister's cabinet. \"To organize producers and merchants as a powerful army, subjected to an active and intelligent guidance, so as to secure an industrial victory for France by order and unity of efforts, and to obtain the best products by imposing on all workmen the processes recognized as best by competent men. … To organize seamen and distant commerce in large bodies like the manufactures and internal commerce, and to give as a support to the commercial power of France a navy established on a firm basis and of dimensions hitherto unknown,\"—such, we are told, were the aims of Colbert as regards two of the three links in the chain of sea power. For the third, the colonies at the far end of the line, the same governmental direction and organization were evidently purposed; for the government began by buying back Canada, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the French West India Islands from the parties who then owned them. Here, then, is seen pure, absolute, uncontrolled power gathering up into its hands all the reins for the guidance of a nation's course, and proposing so to direct it as to make, among other things, a great sea power. To enter into the details of Colbert's action is beyond our purpose. It is enough to note the chief part played by the government in building up the sea power of the State, and that this very great man looked not to any one of the bases on which it rests to the exclusion of the others, but embraced them all in his wise and provident administration. Agriculture, which increases the products of the earth, and manufactures, which multiply the products of man's industry; internal trade routes and regulations, by which the exchange of products from the interior to the exterior is made easier; shipping and customs regulations tending to throw the carrying-trade into French hands, and so to encourage the building of French shipping, by which the home and colonial products should be carried back and forth; colonial administration and development, by which a far-off market might be continually growing up to be monopolized by the home trade; treaties with foreign States favoring French trade, and imposts on foreign ships and products tending to break down that of rival nations,—all these means, embracing countless details, were employed to build up for France (1) Production; (2) Shipping; (3) Colonies and Markets,—in a word, sea power.",

    "text": "The study of such a work is simpler and easier when thus done by one man, sketched out by a kind of logical process, than when slowly wrought by conflicting interests in a more complex government. In the few years of Colbert's administration is seen the whole theory of sea power put into practice in the systematic, centralizing French way; while the illustration of the same theory in English and Dutch history is spread over generations. Such growth, however, was forced, and depended upon the endurance of the absolute power which watched over it; and as Colbert was not king, his control lasted only till he lost the king's favor. It is, however, most interesting to note the results of his labors in the proper field for governmental action—in the navy. It has been said that in 1661, when he took office, there were but thirty armed ships, of which three only had over sixty guns. In 1666 there were seventy, of which fifty were ships of the line and twenty were fire-ships; in 1671, from seventy the number had increased to one hundred and ninety-six. In 1683 there were one hundred and seven ships of from twenty-four to one hundred and twenty guns, twelve of which carried over seventy-six guns, besides many smaller vessels. The order and system introduced into the dock-yards made them vastly more efficient than the English. An English captain, a prisoner in France while the effect of Colbert's work still lasted in the hands of his son, writes:—\n“When I was first brought prisoner thither, I lay four months in a hospital at Brest for care of my wounds. While there I was astonished at the expedition used in manning and fitting out their ships, which till then I thought could be done nowhere sooner than in England, where we have ten times the shipping, and consequently ten times the seamen, they have in France; but there I saw twenty sail of ships, of about sixty guns each, got ready in twenty days’ time; they were brought in and the men were discharged; and upon an order from Paris they were careened, keeled up, rigged, victualled, manned, and out again in the said time with the greatest ease imaginable. I likewise saw a ship of one hundred guns that had all her guns taken out in four or five hours’ time; which I never saw done in England in twenty-four hours, and this with the greatest ease and less hazard than at home. This I saw under my hospital window.”\nA French naval historian cites certain performances which are simply incredible, such as that the keel of a galley was laid at four o'clock, and that at nine she left port, fully armed. These traditions may be accepted as pointing, with the more serious statements of the English officer, to a remarkable degree of system and order, and abundant facilities for work. Yet all this wonderful growth, forced by the action of the government, withered away like Jonah's gourd when the government's favor was withdrawn. Time was not allowed for its roots to strike down deep into the life of the nation. Colbert's work was in the direct line of Richelieu's policy, and for a time it seemed there would continue the course of action which would make France great upon the sea as well as predominant upon the land.",

    "text": "The Anglo-Dutch War of 1672, though seemingly against England's natural inclinations, proved less detrimental to her than to France, particularly regarding sea power. France aided in destroying a potential, if not essential, ally, while England weakened her greatest maritime rival. France, financially recovering under Colbert's reforms, suffered immensely from the six-year war. Agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and colonies were all affected, undoing much of Colbert's progress. Louis XIV's focus on territorial expansion exhausted France's commercial and maritime resources. Though maintaining a strong military navy initially, it eventually dwindled due to the neglect of its supporting elements: peaceful shipping and related industries.  This policy forced England and Holland into an alliance, pushing France from the sea and indirectly diminishing Holland's maritime power.  Louis XIV's reign saw the decline of French sea power due to a weakened economic foundation. Subsequent governments, especially under the Regency, further undermined French maritime interests by allying with England and assisting in the destruction of the Spanish navy, a natural French ally.  This short-sighted policy continued until 1760, despite a brief period of commercial growth under Law's free-trade initiatives. By 1756, France possessed only 45 ships-of-the-line compared to England's nearly 130.  Furthermore, France lacked essential naval supplies, experienced personnel, and effective leadership.  Nepotism, corruption, and a defensive naval strategy further hampered French maritime capabilities, contrasting sharply with England's aggressive approach.",

    "section": "The Resurgence and Decline of French Naval Power (1760-1778)",
    "text": "France's humiliation between 1760 and 1763 spurred a public outcry for naval restoration.  Donations and widespread shipbuilding efforts revitalized the navy. Arsenals were restocked, materials procured, artillery reorganized, and gunners trained.  This public enthusiasm invigorated naval officers who, despite the decline, had been studying and developing naval tactics.  Bigot de Morogues' treatise on naval tactics, intended to replace Paul Hoste's work, exemplified this intellectual activity.  Concurrently, England lacked a comparable text, highlighting French naval theory's advancement.  The Académie de Marine’s research and the renewed focus on officer training contributed to the French navy's improved state at the start of the American Revolutionary War.  This war presented a stark contrast in policy. England, overconfident, diverted resources to a distant land war, while France, allied with Spain and enjoying American support, focused on naval strength. This wise strategy allowed France to challenge England’s maritime dominance and ultimately contribute to the loss of England's American colonies. Despite some operational shortcomings stemming from inexperience and internal rivalries, the French navy performed respectably.  However, lingering effects of past policies, including an emphasis on ship preservation over aggressive action, hampered French admirals from fully capitalizing on opportunities for decisive victory.  The contrast with England's aggressive doctrine, epitomized by Monk's dictum to always attack, underscores the impact of national policy on naval success.",

    "section": "The Influence of Government upon Sea Power",
    "text": "At its birth, the French navy of the late 18th century faced significant challenges, not due to inherent weakness, but rather due to the prevailing governmental policies and strategic thinking of the time. French officers serving during the American Revolutionary War observed a lack of accountability for senior officers, hindering the development of a strong naval culture. A prevailing attitude of excessive caution and aversion to decisive engagements, driven by a desire to preserve material resources over achieving decisive victories, hampered the effectiveness of the French fleet. This 'deplorable system', characterized by defensive war and prioritizing material over morale, contributed to disciplinary issues and defections throughout the subsequent periods of the French Revolution and the First Empire. Despite changes in government, these deeply ingrained traditions persisted. The example of Villeneuve at the Battle of the Nile, where he failed to engage while part of his fleet was destroyed, highlights the detrimental effects of this cautious approach. This pattern repeated itself at Trafalgar, where, despite a substantial naval buildup, the French government refrained from deploying its fleet decisively, instead focusing on exhausting British finances through blockades. This defensive mindset, criticized by the British as a path to ruin, had permeated French naval doctrine, weakening their ability to seize opportunities and achieve decisive victories. Post-empire, France possessed a large navy, yet its potential remained unrealized due to strategic misdirection. Shifting focus to the broader influence of government on sea power, two key aspects emerge: peacetime and wartime policies. In peace, the government can either promote or hinder maritime industries and the seafaring inclinations of its people, directly impacting the foundation of a strong navy, which is a thriving commercial sector. In war, the government's role lies in maintaining a navy proportionate to its shipping interests, fostering a healthy naval spirit, and ensuring rapid wartime expansion through reserves of men and ships. Crucial to this is the establishment of suitable naval stations in distant locations to support commercial and military vessels. These stations can be secured through direct military force or through the support of a friendly local population, such as the relationship between England and its colonies. Colonies provide vital support for sea power, offering secure bases and lines of communication. The government should foster strong ties between the colonies and the mother country, ensuring mutual benefit and shared responsibility in defense. In contrast to colonial powers, the United States lacks such foreign establishments, making its warships reliant on their own shores. Establishing overseas bases for coaling and repairs is therefore essential for projecting American sea power. Analyzing the post-Civil War era, the US government has prioritized internal development and self-sufficiency, neglecting the development of a merchant fleet and overseas bases, leaving the nation with only one of the three essential elements of sea power. Changes in naval warfare, such as the protection of neutral shipping and the abolition of paper blockades, have altered the dynamics of maritime conflict, raising questions about the necessity of sea power for the US. However, the vulnerability of US trade to blockades remains a concern. Even without directly attacking ships, an enemy could effectively blockade major ports with a relatively small force, disrupting trade and potentially causing significant economic damage.",

    "text": "but to resist military attempts to break the blockade, need not be within sight, nor in a posi- tion known to the shore. The bulk of Nelson's fleet was fifty miles from Cadiz two days before Trafalgar, with a small detachment watching close to the harbor. The allied fleet began to get under way at 7 a.m., and Nelson, even under the conditions of those days, knew it by 9.30. The English fleet at that distance was a very real danger to its enemy. It seems possible, in these days of submarine telegraphs, that the blockading forces in-shore and off-shore, and from one port to another, might be in telegraphic communication with one another along the whole coast of the United States, readily giving mutual support ; and if, by some fortunate military combination, one detachment were attacked in force, it could warn the others and retreat upon them. Granting that such a blockade off one port were broken on one day, by fairly driving away the ships maintaining it, the notification of its being re-established could be cabled all over the world the next. To avoid such blockades there must be a military force afloat that will at all times so endanger a blockading fleet that it can by no means keep its place. Then neutral ships, except those laden with contraband of war, can come and go freely, and maintain the commercial relations of the country with the world outside. It may be urged that, with the extensive sea-coast of the United States, a blockade of the whole line cannot be effec- tively kept up.",

    "text": "No one will more readily concede this than officers who remember how the blockade of the Southern coast alone was maintained. But in the present condition of the navy, and, it may be added, with any additions not ex- ceeding those so far proposed by the government, the attempt to blockade Boston, New York, the Delaware, the Chesapeake, and the Mississippi, in other words, the great centres of export and import, would not entail upon one of the large maritime nations efforts greater than have been made before. England has at the same time blockaded Brest, the Biscay coast, Toulon, and Cadiz, when there were powerful squadrons lying within the harbors. It is true that commerce in neutral ships can then enter other ports of the United States than those named ; but what a dislocation of the carrying traffic of the country, what failure of supplies at times, what inadequate means of transport by rail or water, of dockage, of lighterage, of warehousing, will be involved in such an enforced change of the ports of entry ! Will there be no money loss, no suffering, consequent upon this ? And when with much pain and expense these evils have been partially remedied, the enemy may be led to stop the new inlets as he did the old. The people of the United States will certainly not starve, but they may suffer grievously. As for supplies which are con- traband of war, is there not reason to fear that the United States is not now able to go alone if an emergency should arise ? The question is eminently one in which the influence of the government should make itself felt, to build up for the nation a navy which, if not capable of reaching distant countries, shall at least be able to keep clear the chief approaches to its own. The eyes of the country have for a quarter of a cen- tury been turned from the sea ; the results of such a policy and of its opposite will be shown in the instance of France and of England. Without asserting a narrow parallelism be- tween the case of the United States and either of these, it may safely be said that it is essential to the welfare of the whole country that the conditions of trade and commerce should remain, as far as possible, unaffected by an external war. In order to do this, the enemy must be kept not only out of our ports, but far away from our coasts. Can this navy be had without restoring the merchant ship- ping? It is doubtful.",

    "section": "The State of Europe in 1660: France, Spain, and the Dutch Republic",
    "text": "Issued after eighty years of near-constant war, the independence of the European powers ushered in an era of shifting alliances and priorities. France, deeply affected by internal religious conflicts, experienced a gradual shift from religiously motivated policies to those driven by political and economic interests.  This transformation was spearheaded by rulers like Henry IV and Richelieu, who prioritized internal unity and resistance against the Habsburg empire.  Their strategy involved alliances with Protestant German states and Holland, eastward expansion at Spain's expense, and the development of a strong navy to counter England. Sea power became a critical element in France's pursuit of external greatness, with England and Austria identified as the primary rivals at sea and on land, respectively. By 1660, France had achieved internal peace, centralized authority, and quelled religious dissent, though its navy, commerce, and finances were in a weakened state.\n\nSpain, once a dominant power, was in decline by 1660. While retaining vast territories, including the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, and American possessions, its central administration was weakened.  Its navy, once formidable, had severely deteriorated, as evidenced by a 1639 encounter with the Dutch fleet where a smaller Dutch force decisively defeated a much larger Spanish fleet. This naval decline mirrored Spain's overall weakening position in European politics. The Spanish Netherlands were poised to become a point of contention between France and its ally, the Dutch Republic.\n\nThe Dutch Republic, officially the United Provinces, had reached its zenith in power and influence by 1660. Its strength stemmed from its maritime prowess, commercial ingenuity, and vast colonial holdings.  Dutch dominance in trade was facilitated by its control of key shipping routes, its large merchant fleet, and its access to markets across Europe and beyond.  The Dutch East India Company had established a powerful presence in Asia, controlling trade routes and territories.  The West India Company had also expanded Dutch influence, though its rise was shorter-lived.  The United Provinces acted as a central hub for global commerce, accumulating wealth and power through its sea-based empire. However, its reliance on the sea and its vulnerability to land-based attacks foreshadowed its eventual decline.",

    "text": "The war with England had exposed a surprising lack of preparedness in the Dutch navy, a force that had previously humbled Spain's maritime dominance. However, by 1657, the Provinces had effectively countered French aggression against their commerce. A year later, their intervention in the Baltic conflict between Denmark and Sweden prevented Sweden from establishing a detrimental dominance in the North. They secured access to the Baltic, remaining its masters due to their superior naval power. The valor of their troops and the astute diplomacy of their government further enhanced their prestige. Despite being weakened by the recent war with England, the Dutch had reclaimed their position as a major European power. This coincided with the restoration of Charles II in England. The Dutch government was a loose confederation led by a commercial aristocracy, inherently cautious due to their vulnerability to war's disruptions. This, combined with sectional jealousies, negatively impacted their navy. Peacetime neglect, inter-fleet rivalries, and a deficiency of true military spirit among officers were detrimental. While Dutch sailors displayed remarkable bravery and resilience in sea battles, instances of defection and misconduct revealed a lack of professional pride and training, a common issue in navies of that era. The government was further weakened by the deep division between the ruling merchant/burgomaster faction and the pro-monarchy Orange party. The Republicans favored a French alliance and a strong navy, while the Orange party leaned towards England and a powerful army.  In 1660, the United Provinces, despite their vast wealth and external activities, resembled a nation sustained by stimulants.  This small nation, significantly outnumbered by both England and France, remarkably withstood attacks from each individually and even a two-year alliance against them, maintaining its European standing primarily due to its sea power.",

    "section": "England's Naval Power and Foreign Policy Under Charles II (1660)",
    "text": "England's situation differed from both Holland and France. While a monarchy, Charles II couldn't dictate policy entirely due to the influence of popular opinion. Unlike Louis XIV, whose gains directly benefited himself, Charles had to balance personal ambitions with England's interests, mindful of his father's fate and his own exile. He personally disliked the Dutch Republic for its political system, its opposition to the House of Orange, and its expulsion of him during his exile.  He was drawn to France by political sympathies with Louis's absolutist tendencies, possibly by shared Catholic leanings, and significantly by French financial support, which reduced his dependence on Parliament.  However, Charles also had to consider the strong anti-Dutch sentiment among the English people, fueled by commercial rivalry and the Dutch East India Company's monopolistic practices in the East Indies.  Initially, this popular animosity supported the king's inclinations, particularly as France hadn't yet become a major continental threat. However, as Louis XIV's aggressive policies became apparent, the English recognized the danger, recalling past struggles against Spanish dominance. The potential transfer of the Spanish Netherlands to France posed a threat to both Dutch and English sea power, particularly due to the likely reopening of Antwerp's port, a blow to both Amsterdam and London. This revived historical opposition to France, strengthened by ties of kinship with the Dutch and shared religious beliefs.  Furthermore, Colbert's efforts to bolster French commerce and naval power alarmed both maritime powers, driving them closer together.  Yielding to public pressure, Charles ceased hostilities with Holland, leading to a close alliance after his death. In 1660, England's navy, though smaller commercially, surpassed Holland's in organization and efficiency, a legacy of Cromwell's rule.  However, this advantage eroded under Charles's reign due to court corruption. While England initially outperformed the Dutch at sea in 1665, Holland successfully resisted the combined English and French fleets in 1672.",

    "text": "Regarding naval material, French ships had greater displacement relative to artillery and stores, allowing for a higher battery. Their hulls also had superior lines, reflecting the systematic rebuilding of the French navy. Dutch ships, designed for their shallow coastal waters, were flatter-bottomed with less draught, allowing refuge in shoals, but were less weatherly and generally lighter than English or French vessels. This summarizes the conditions, power, and aims of the four primary maritime powers: Spain, France, England, and Holland.  While this history focuses on these powers, other states significantly influenced events.  Germany, divided into smaller states and the Austrian empire, was subject to French influence against Austria. Austria also faced the threat of the Ottoman Empire.  Prussia, not yet a kingdom, was developing under the Elector of Brandenburg. Poland's unstable government created anxiety among other states.  Russia was not yet a major European player.  Baltic powers like Sweden and Denmark were rivals, often aligning with opposing sides in prevailing conflicts. Louis XIV held the key to European politics.  His resources, absolute power, personal abilities, and capable ministers gave him significant influence.  He prioritized land-based expansion, aiming to exploit the expected end of the Austrian line of Spanish kings.  He sought to isolate Spain diplomatically, but made two errors impacting French sea power. To prevent a resurgence of Spanish power through the reacquisition of Portugal, he encouraged a marriage between Charles II and the Portuguese Infanta.  This led to Portugal ceding Bombay and Tangiers to England, thus strengthening England's presence in the Mediterranean and its alliance with Portugal.",

    "text": "more curious, as Louis already foresaw the failure of the Spanish royal house, and should rather have wished the union of the peninsular kingdoms. As a matter of fact, Portugal became a dependent and outpost of England, by which she readily landed in the Peninsula down to the days of Napoleon. Indeed, if independent of Spain, she is too weak not to be under the control of the power that rules the sea and so has readiest access to her. Louis continued to support her against Spain, and secured her independence. He also interfered with the Dutch, and compelled them to restore Brazil, which they had taken from the Portuguese. On the other hand, Louis obtained from Charles II. the cession of Dunkirk on the Channel, which had been seized and used by Cromwell. This surrender was made for money, and was inexcusable from the maritime point of view. Dunkirk was for the English a bridge-head into France. To France it became a haven for privateers, the bane of England's commerce in the Channel and the North Sea. As the French sea power waned, England in treaty after treaty exacted the dismantling of the works of Dunkirk, which it may be said in passing was the home port of the celebrated Jean Bart and other great French privateersmen. Meanwhile the greatest and wisest of Louis' ministers, Colbert, was diligently building up that system of administration, which, by increasing and solidly basing the wealth of the State, should bring a surer greatness and prosperity than the king's more showy enterprises. With those details that concern the internal development of the kingdom this history has no concern, beyond the incidental mention that production, both agricultural and manufacturing, received his careful attention; but upon the sea a policy of skilful aggression upon the shipping and commerce of the Dutch and English quickly began, and was instantly resented. Great trading companies were formed, directing French enterprise to the Baltic, to the Levant, to the East and West Indies; customs regulations were amended to encourage French manufactures, and to allow goods to be stored in bond in the great ports, by which means it was hoped to make France take Holland's place as the great warehouse for Europe, a function for which her geographical position eminently fitted her; while tonnage duties on foreign shipping, direct premiums on home-built ships, and careful, rigorous colonial decrees giving French vessels the monopoly of trade to and from the colonies, combined to encourage the growth of her mercantile marine. England retaliated at once; the Dutch, more seriously threatened because their carrying-trade was greater and their home resources smaller, only remonstrated for a time; but after three years they also made reprisals. Colbert, relying on the great superiority of France as an actual, and still more as a possible producer, feared not to move steadily on the grasping path marked out; which, in building up a great merchant shipping, would lay the broad base for the military shipping, which was being yet more rapidly forced on by the measures of the State. Prosperity grew apace. At the end of twelve years everything was flourishing, everything rich in the State, which was in utter confusion when he took charge of the finances and marine. \"Under him,\" says a French historian, \"France grew by peace as she had grown by war. . . . The warfare of tariffs and premiums skilfully conducted by him tended to reduce within just limits the exorbitant growth of commercial and maritime power which Holland had arrogated at the expense of other nations; and to restrain England, which was burning to wrest this supremacy from Holland in order to use it in a manner much more dangerous to Europe. The interest of France seemed to be peace in Europe and America; a mysterious voice, at once the voice of the past and of the future, called for her warlike activity on other shores.\"",

    "section": "Leibnitz's Proposition and the Second Anglo-Dutch War",
    "text": "This voice found expression through the mouth of Leibnitz, one of the world's great men, who pointed out to Louis that to turn the arms of France against Egypt would give her, in the dominion of the Mediterranean and the control of Eastern trade, a victory over Holland greater than the most successful campaign on land; and while insuring a much needed peace within his kingdom, would build up a power on the sea that would insure preponderance in Europe. This memorial called Louis from the pursuit of glory on the land to seek the durable grandeur of France in the possession of a great sea power, the elements of which, thanks to the genius of Colbert, he had in his hands. A century later a greater man than Louis sought to exalt himself and France by the path pointed out by Leibnitz; but Napoleon did not have, as Louis had, a navy equal to the task proposed. This project of Leibnitz will be more fully referred to when the narrative reaches the momentous date at which it was broached; when Louis, with his kingdom and navy in the highest pitch of efficiency, stood at the point where the roads parted, and then took the one which settled that France should not be the power of the sea. This decision, which killed Colbert and ruined the prosperity of France, was felt in its consequences from generation to generation afterward, as the great navy of England, in war after war, swept the seas, insured the growing wealth of the island kingdom through exhausting strifes, while drying up the external resources of French trade and inflicting consequent misery. The false line of policy that began with Louis XIV. also turned France away from a promising career in India, in the days of his successor. Meanwhile the two maritime States, England and Holland, though eying France distrustfully, had greater and growing grudges against each other, which under the fostering care of Charles II. led to war. The true cause was doubtless commercial jealousy, and the conflict sprang immediately from collisions between the trading companies. Hostilities began on the west coast of Africa; and an English squadron, in 1664, after subduing several Dutch stations there, sailed to New Amsterdam (now New York), and seized it. All these affairs took place before the formal declaration of war in February, 1665. This war was undoubtedly popular in England; the instinct of the people found an expression by the lips of Monk, who is reported to have said, \"What matters this or that reason? What we want is more of the trade which the Dutch now have.\" There is also little room to doubt that, despite the pretensions of the trading companies, the government of the United Provinces would gladly have avoided the war; the able man who was at their head saw too clearly the delicate position in which they stood between England and France. They claimed, however, the support of the latter in virtue of a defensive treaty made in 1662. Louis allowed the claim, but unwillingly; and the still young navy of France gave practically no help. The war between the two sea States was wholly maritime, and had the general characteristics of all such wars. Three great battles were fought, — the first off Lowestoft, on the Norfolk coast, June 13, 1665; the second, known as the Four Days' Battle in the Straits of Dover, often spoken of by French writers as that of the Pas de Calais, lasting from the 11th to the 14th of June, 1666; and the third, off the North Foreland, August 4 of the same year. In the first and last of these the English had a decided success; in the second the advantage remained with the Dutch. This one only will be described at length, because of it alone has been found such a full, coherent account as will allow a clear and accurate tactical narrative to be given. There are in these fights points of interest more generally applicable to the present day than are the details of somewhat obsolete tactical movements.",

Small vessels are inherently slower, especially in heavy weather.  Modern torpedo boats face similar speed limitations in moderate seas, dropping from twenty knots to fifteen or less, allowing faster cruisers to escape or maintain a distance while using heavier weaponry. Though considered sea-going, the conditions on small torpedo boats in rough seas are challenging, with intense heat, noise, and vibration making rest and cooking difficult.  Larger torpedo boats are planned, but unless size increases significantly, leading to armament beyond torpedoes, the speed issue will persist.  Like fire-ships, small torpedo-cruisers complicate fleet maneuvers.  The introduction of shell firing hastened the demise of fire-ships, and similarly, transferring torpedoes to larger ships may end the standalone torpedo-cruiser. Fire-ships remained useful against anchored fleets into the American Civil War, and torpedo boats will always be valuable near their ports.",

Today, grouping ships into units of two, three, or four is favored in England but opposed in France. Such debates require time and experience to resolve. In a well-organized fleet, two command levels are essential: overall fleet command and individual ship command.  Large fleets necessitate subdivision, effectively becoming two fleets with a common goal, as demonstrated by Nelson at Trafalgar.  Modern ironclads' size and cost make large fleets less likely, but the group formation question remains.  Disregarding the tactical clumsiness of specific group proposals, the question is whether to introduce an artificial third command level between the admiral and ship captains, potentially hindering both.  The group system's emphasis on support for specific ships could complicate a captain's duties in the heat of battle, especially when signals are obscured. Group formations were tried and abandoned historically; their modern revival's success remains to be seen.  A loose group formation might be useful as a sailing order, akin to an army's route-step during marches, offering order without rigid positioning, but only for highly trained fleets.",

A French officer's analysis of Anglo-Dutch battles reveals that the increased order and coordination in squadron movements actually favored fire-ships.  In the earlier, confused battles of 1652, fire-ships acted alone, vulnerable and prone to mistakes. By 1665, with improved fleet maneuvers, fire-ships had clear targets, benefited from artillery support, and had better chances of success, though still inherently risky.  This highlights the advantage of maintaining order amidst enemy confusion.  The officer further explains that fire-ships declined as naval artillery improved in range, accuracy, and speed; ships became faster and more maneuverable; and fleets adopted more cautious tactics, relying on cannons at longer ranges.  This period also marks the definitive adoption of the close-hauled line-of-battle, crucial for maximizing fleet firepower and mutual support. While seemingly obvious, this development took time, highlighting the importance of decisive conflict in driving tactical innovation.",

Simultaneously, friendly ships obstructing the line of fire became undesirable. The line-ahead formation uniquely satisfies these conditions, becoming the definitive battle order and the foundation of fleet tactics. To ensure the line's strength, ships of comparable firepower are needed, leading to the distinction between 'ships of the line' and lighter vessels.

    "text": "\"We come now to the justly celebrated Four Days' Battle of June, 1666, which claims special notice, not only on account of the great number of ships engaged on either side, nor yet only for the extraordinary physical endurance of the men who kept up a hot naval action for so many successive days, but also because the commanders-in-chief on either side. Monk and De Ruyter, were the most distinguished seamen, or rather sea-commanders, brought forth by their respective countries in the seventeenth century. Monk was possibly inferior to Blake in the annals of the English navy ; but there is a gen- eral agreement that De Ruyter is the foremost figure, not only in the Dutch service, but among all the naval officers of that age. The account about to be given is mainly taken from a recent number of the \" Revue Maritime et Coloniale,\" ^ and is there published as a letter, recently discovered, from a Dutch gentleman serving as volunteer on board De Ruyter's ship, to a friend in France. The narrative is delightfully clear and probable, — qualities not generally found in the description of 1 Gougeard : Marine de Guerre. 2 Vol. Ixxxii. p. 137. 118 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. those long-ago fights ; and the satisfaction it gave was in- creased by finding in the Memoirs of the Count de Guiche, who also served as volunteer in the fleet, and was taken to De Ruyter after his own vessel had been destroyed by a fire-ship, an account confirming the former in its principal details.^ This additional pleasure was unhappily marred by recognizing certain phrases as common to both stories ; and a comparison showed that the two could not be accepted as independent narratives. There are, however, points of internal difference which make it possible that the two accounts are by different eye-witnesses, who compared and corrected their versions be- fore sending them out to their friends or writing tliem in their journals. The numbers of the two fleets were : English about eighty ships, the Dutch about one hundred ; but the inequality in numbers was largely compensated by the greater size of many of the English. A great strategic blunder by the government in London immediately preceded the fight. The king was informed that a French squadron was on its way from the Atlantic to join the Dutch. He at once divided his fleet, sending twenty ships under Prince Rupert to the westward to meet the French, while the remainder under Monk were to go east and oppose the Dutch. A position like that of the English fleet, threatened with an attack from two quarters, presents one of the subtlest tempta- tions to a commander. The impulse is very strong to meet both by dividing his own numbers as Charles did ; but unless in possession of overwhelming force it is an error, exposing both divisions to be beaten separately, which, as we are about to see, actually happened in this case.",

Tromp was now in great danger, separated [by his own act first and then by the conduct of the van] from his own fleet by the English, and would have been destroyed but for Ruyter, who, seeing the urgency of the case, hauled up for him,\" the van and centre thus standing back for the rear on the oppo- site tack to that on which they entered action. This pre- vented the English from keeping up the attack on Tromp, lest 1 Plate I., June 12, Fig. 1, V, C, R. BATTLE OF THE FOUR DAYS. 123 Ruyter should gain the wind of them, which they could not afford to yield because of their very inferior numbers. Both the action of Tromp and that of the junior flag-officers in the van, though showing very different degrees of warlike ardor, bring out strongly the lack of subordination and of military feeling which has been charged against the Dutch officers as a body ; no signs of which appear among the English at this time. How keenly Ruyter felt the conduct of his lieutenants was manifested when \" Tromp, immediately after this partial ac- tion, went on board his flagship. The seamen cheered him ; but Ruyter said, ' This is no time for rejoicing, but rather for tears.' Indeed, our position was bad, each squadron acting differently, in no line, and all the ships huddled together like a flock of sheep, so packed that the English might have sur- rounded all of them with their forty ships [June 12, Fig. 2]. The English were in admirable order, but did not push their advantage as they should, whatever the reason.\" The reason no doubt was the same that often prevented sailing-ships from pressing an advantage, — disability from crippled spars and rigging, added to the inexpediency of such inferior num- bers risking a decisive action. Ruyter was thus able to draw his fleet out into line again, although much maltreated by the English, and the two fleets passed again on opposite tacks, the Dutch to leeward, and Ruyter's ship the last in his column. As he passed the English rear, he lost his maintopmast and mainyard. After another partial rencounter the English drew away to the northwest toward their own shores, the Dutch following them ; the wind being still from southwest, but light. The English were now fairly in retreat, and the pursuit continued all night, Ruyter's own ship dropping out of sight in the rear from her crippled state.",

One of the largest and finest of the English fleet, the \" Royal Prince,\" of ninety guns, ran aground on the Galloper Shoal and was taken by Tromp (Plate II. a) ; but Monk's retreat was so steady and orderly that he was otherwise unmolested. This shows that the Dutch had suffered very severely. Toward evening Ru- pert's squadron was seen ; and all the ships of the English fleet, except those crippled in action, were at last united. The next day the wind came out again very fresh from the southwest, giving the Dutch the weather-gage. The English, instead of attempting to pass upon opposite tacks, came up from astern relying upon the speed and handiness of their ships. So doing, the battle engaged all along the line on the port tack, the English to leeward.^ The Dutch fire-ships were badly handled and did no harm, whereas the English burned two of their enemies. The two fleets ran on thus, exchang- ing broadsides for two hours, at the end of which time the bulk of the English fleet had passed through the Dutch line.^ All regularity of order was henceforward lost. \" At this mo- ment,\" says the eye-witness, \" the lookout was extraordinary, for all were separated, the English as well as we. But luck would have it that the largest of our fractions surrounding the admiral remained to windward, and the largest fraction of the English, also with their admiral, remained to leeward [Figs. 1 and 2, C and C']. This was the cause of our victory and their ruin. Our admiral had with him thirty-five or forty ships of his own and of other squadrons, for the squadrons were scattered and order much lost. The rest of the Dutch ships had left him. The leader of the van. Van Ness, had gone off' with fourteen ships in chase of three or four English ships, which under a press of sail had gained to windward of the Dutch van [Fig. 1, V].

Tromp, having carried sail, overtook Van Ness, and returned bringing the van back with him (V, R') ; but owing to the constant plying to windward of the English main body he came up to leeward of it and could not rejoin Ruyter, who was to wind- ward (Fig. 3, V\", R \"). Ruyter, seeing this, made signal to the ships around him, and the main body of the Dutch kept away before the wind (Fig 3, C \"), which was then very strong. \" Thus in less than no time we found ourselves in the midst of the English ; who, being attacked on both sides, were thrown into confusion and saw their whole order de- stroyed, as well by dint of the action, as by the strong wind that was then blowing. This was the hottest of the fight [Fig. 3]. We saw the high admiral of England separated from his fleet, followed only by one fire-ship. With that he gained to windward, and passing tlirough the North Holland squadron, placed himself again at the head of fifteen or twenty ships that rallied to him.\" Thus ended this great sea-fight, the most remarkable, in some of its aspects, that has ever been fought upon the ocean. Amid conflicting reports it is not possible to do more than estimate the results. A fairly impartial account says: \"The States lost in these actions three vice-admirals, two thousand men, and four ships. The loss of the English was five thou- sand killed and three thousand prisoners ; and they lost besides seventeen ships, of which nine remained in the hands of the victors.\" 1 There is no doubt that the English had much the worst of it, and that this was owing wholly to the original blunder of weakening the fleet by a great detachment sent in another direction. Great detachments are sometimes neces- sary evils, but in this case no necessity existed. Granting the approach of the French, the proper course for the English 1 Lefcvre-Pontalis : Jean de \"Witt. 126 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. was to fall with their whole fleet upon the Dutch before their allies could come up. This lesson is as applicable to-day as it ever was. A second lesson, likewise of present application, is the necessity of sound military institutions for implanting correct military feeling, pride, and discipline. Great as was the first blunder of the English, and serious as was the disas- ter, there can be no doubt that the consequences would have been much worse but for the high spirit and skill with which the plans of Monk were carried out by his subordinates, and the lack of similar support to Ruyter on the part of the Dutch subalterns. In the movements of the English, we hear noth- ing of two juniors turning tail at a critical moment, nor of a third, with misdirected ardor, getting on the wrong side of the enemy's fleet. Their drill also, their tactical precision, was remarked even then. The Frenchman De Guiche, after witnessing this Four Days' Fight, wrote : — \" Nothing equals the beautiful order of the English at sea. Never was a line drawn straighter than that formed by their ships ; thus they bring all their fire to bear upon those who draw near them. . . . They fight like a line of cavalry which is handled according to rule, and applies itself solely to force back those who oppose ; whereas the Dutch advance like cavalry whose squadrons leave their ranks and come separate!}\" to the charge.\" ^ The Dutch government, averse to expense, unmilitary in its tone, and incautious from long and easy victory over the degenerate navy of Spain, had allowed its fleet to sink into a mere assembly of armed merchantmen. Things were at their worst in the days of Cromwell.",

Of the three great battles fought two were decided victories ; and the third, though adverse, had but increased the glory of her seamen. This was due to the intelligent boldness of Monk and Rupert, the talents of part 1 Memoires, pp. 249, 251, 266, 267. SOLDIERS COMMANDING SHIPS. 127 of the admirals and captains, and the skill of the seamen and soldiers under them. The wise and vigorous efforts made by the government of the United Provinces, and the undeniable superiority of Ruyter in experience and genius over any one of his opponents, could not com- pensate for the weakness or incapacity of part of the Dutch officers, and the manifest inferiority of the men under their orders.\" ^ England, as has been said before, still felt the impress of Cromwell's iron hand upon her military institutions ; but that impress was growing weaker. Before the next Dutch w^ar Monk was dead, and was poorly replaced by the cavalier Rupert. Court extravagance cut down the equipment of the navy as did the burgomaster's parsimony, and court corrup- tion undermined discipline as surely as commercial indiffer- ence. The effect was evident when the fleets of the two countries met again, six years later. There was one well-known feature of all the military navies of that day which calls for a passing comment ; for its correct bearing and value is not always, perhaps not -generally, seen. The command of fleets and of single vessels was often given to soldiers, to military men unaccustomed to the sea, and ignorant how to handle the ship, that duty being intrusted to another class of officer. Looking closely into the facts, it is seen that this made a clean division between the direction of the fighting and of the motive power of the ship. This is the essence of the matter ; and the principle is the same whatever the motive power may be. The inconvenience and inefficiency of such a system was obvious then as it is now, and the logic of facts gradually threw the two functions into the hands of one corps of officers, the result being the modern naval officer, as that term is generally understood.^ Unfortunately, in this process of blending, the less important function was allowed to get the upper hand ; the naval officer came to feel more 1 Chabaud-Arnault : Eevue Mar. et Col. 1885 2 The true significance of this change lias often been misunderstood, and hence erroneous inferences as to the future have been drawn.

The bad effects of this lack of interest in military science became most evident when the point of handling fleets was reached, because for that military skill told most, and previous study was most necessary ; but it was felt in the single ship as well.",

    "text": "English naval officers prioritized seamanship over military aspects, unlike their French counterparts who, due to the military nature of their government and nobility, valued military prowess.  English officers came from diverse backgrounds, leading to a divide between gentlemen with military experience and seamen with practical sailing skills.  This contrast is highlighted by Macaulay's observation about Charles II's navy. The issue wasn't simply the presence or absence of gentlemen, but the prevailing societal view of gentlemen as military figures, gradually displacing the seaman and the maritime focus within the navy.  Even aristocratic officers like Herbert and Russell had to adopt the rough manners of sailors to maintain their positions.  These national differences made the French superior military strategists at sea, even if less skilled seamen. This trend continues, with Latin navies prioritizing military function over seamanship. The French, known for their methodical nature, focused on tactical development and fleet handling from a military perspective. This resulted in their tactical superiority during the American Revolutionary War, despite their lesser experience at sea compared to the British. Their strategic aims, however, were often flawed.",

Evidence points to their merchant seaman origins, initially lacking military sensibilities. However, severe punishments for failures seem to have instilled military discipline and loyalty, leading to a significant improvement in their performance between 1666 and 1672.  The Four Days' Battle marked a turning point in naval tactics, shifting from prioritizing the weather gage to maintaining fleet order and cohesion for combined squadron maneuvers.  Ruyter's actions during the battle and his criticism of squadron separation at the North Foreland demonstrate this evolving tactical understanding. Although the commentary highlights these advancements, the impact wasn't immediate or complete. The English, despite significant losses, quickly returned to sea, defeating the Dutch at the North Foreland and raiding their harbors. By the end of 1666, war-weariness led to peace negotiations. Charles II, overconfident from victories and anticipating a breakdown of the Franco-Dutch alliance, made unreasonable demands.",

This strategy, based on disrupting enemy trade with cruisers and privateers, was appealing due to its low cost and potential for economic damage.  However, commerce raiding is unsustainable without a strong supporting base – either home ports or secure outposts backed by a powerful fleet. Lacking this, cruisers are limited in their range and impact. Cromwell's powerful fleets, not the 1667 commerce raiding strategy, effectively crippled Dutch trade. The Dutch, learning from this, maintained large fleets, enabling them to endure prolonged wars. Louis XIV, facing exhaustion, resorted to commerce raiding during the War of the Spanish Succession.  While French privateers inflicted damage on English trade, it did not cripple England's overall prosperity. Conversely, during the earlier war (1689-1697), when France deployed large fleets, England suffered far greater economic damage.  This demonstrates the limitations of commerce raiding without a powerful naval presence to control the seas.",

    "section": "Commerce-Destroying and its Limited Effectiveness",
    "text": "In 1693, English Mediterranean trade was severely disrupted by French privateers.  Merchant ships couldn't safely reach the Strait of Gibraltar without naval protection, which was scarce because the English navy was preoccupied with the French fleet. This diversion of naval resources to fleet engagements was essential for commerce raiding to succeed. A French historian notes the dire financial situation in England in 1696, with high insurance rates, suspension of the Navigation Act, and English ships resorting to foreign flags.  Half a century later, France again resorted to commerce raiding due to naval neglect. While French privateers captured many English merchantmen between 1756 and 1761, English shipping continued to grow.  An English naval historian highlighted the contrasting fortunes: French commerce was nearly destroyed, while England's thrived, demonstrating that capturing merchant ships, while causing individual losses, didn't cripple the overall prosperity of a nation with a strong economy.  Conversely, when France focused on maintaining large battle fleets, English merchant ships were forced to use foreign flags. Martinique and Guadeloupe served as bases for French privateers in the Seven Years' War, inflicting significant losses on English merchant shipping in the West Indies. However, the English navy's capture of these islands ultimately harmed French trade more than privateering hurt English trade. This historical analysis suggests that commerce raiding alone is not decisive, causing more irritation than lasting damage.  It does not strike at the core of a nation's economic power. True economic damage requires control of the seas, driving the enemy's flag from the ocean and closing off trade routes to their shores. This dominance can only be achieved by powerful navies.",

    "text": "Examining the broader impact of commerce raiding on war outcomes reveals its limitations.  During the reign of Charles II, commerce raiding allowed the French to insult the English coast and burn ships near its capital. In the War of the Spanish Succession, while France focused on commerce raiding, the Anglo-Dutch navies secured Spain's coasts, blockaded Toulon, and kept sea lanes open, neutralizing France's geographical advantage. They also captured key strategic locations like Gibraltar, Barcelona, and Minorca. In the Seven Years' War, the English navy seized valuable French and Spanish colonies and raided the French coast. The American Revolutionary War offers limited insights due to the relatively equal naval strength.  The War of 1812 saw American privateers disrupting English commerce, supported by the French fleet which kept the British navy occupied with blockades. However, once the French threat diminished, the US coast was vulnerable to attacks, highlighting the importance of a strong navy for coastal defense.  The American Civil War demonstrated that while Confederate commerce raiders caused economic damage, they didn't significantly impact the war's outcome. The Union's superior naval power, which blockaded Southern ports and conducted coastal operations, played a far more decisive role. These examples demonstrate that commerce raiding, while potentially disruptive, is not a substitute for a powerful navy capable of controlling the seas and projecting power.",

Spain's weakness was exposed by the swift fall of its territories. Holland's policy towards France was ambivalent; they valued the alliance but feared her as a neighbor. English popular opinion, unlike the King's, leaned towards the Dutch, recognizing the threat of Louis's expansion to all of Europe, especially if his continental dominance allowed him to develop a powerful navy.  English ambassador Temple warned that a French-controlled Flanders would reduce Holland to a French maritime province, advocating for resistance against France and an alliance with the Dutch. He viewed French dominance in the Low Countries as a threat to all of Europe. These shared concerns led to the Triple Alliance, temporarily halting Louis's advance.  However, the recent Anglo-Dutch wars, England's humiliation in the Thames, and inherent rivalries made a lasting alliance difficult.

That route had lost much of its value by the discovery of the way round the Cape of Good Hope, and yet more by the unsettled and piratical conditions of the seas through which it lay; but with a really strong naval power occupying the key of the position it might have been largely restored. Such a power posted in Egypt would, in the already decaying condition of the Ottoman Empire, have controlled the trade not only of India and the far East, but also of the Levant; but the enterprise could not have stopped there. The necessity of mastering the Mediterranean and opening the Red Sea, closed to Christian vessels by Mohammedan bigotry, would have compelled the occupation of stations on either side of Egypt; and France would have been led step by step, as England has been led by the possession of India, to the seizure of points like Malta, Cyprus, Aden, in short, to a great sea power.",

After pointing out the weakness of the Turkish Empire, and the readiness with which it might be further embarrassed by stirring up Austria and Poland, the latter the traditional ally of France; after showing that France had no armed enemy in the Mediterranean, and that on the other side of Egypt she would meet the Portuguese colonies, longing to obtain protection against the Dutch in India, the memorial proceeds: — \"The conquest of Egypt, that Holland of the East, is infinitely easier than that of the United Provinces. France needs peace in the west, war at a distance. War with Holland will probably ruin the new Indian companies as well as the colonies and commerce lately revived by France, and will increase the burdens of the people while diminishing their resources. […] Should she wish to oppose the designs of France upon Egypt, she would be overwhelmed with the universal hatred of Christians; attacked at home, on the contrary, not only could she ward off the aggression, but she could avenge herself sustained by universal public opinion, which suspects the views of France of ambition.\" The memorial had no effect. \"All that the efforts of ambition and human prudence could do to lay the foundations for the destruction of a nation, Louis XIV. now did.",

To this course they were forced by the desperate odds under which they were fighting; but they did not use their shoals as a mere shelter,—the warfare they waged was the defensive-offensive.

    "section": "The Battle of Solebay",
    "text": "If this can be accepted, it gives a marked evidence of Ruyter's high qualities as a general officer, in advance of any other who appears in this century. The results of the battle, considered simply as an engagement, were indecisive; both sides lost heavily, but the honors and the substantial advantages all belonged to the Dutch, or rather to De Ruyter. He had outgeneralled the allies by his apparent retreat, and then returning had surprised them wholly unprepared. The false move by which the English, two thirds of the whole, stood to the northward and westward, while the other third, the French, went off to the east and south, separated the allied fleet; Ruyter threw his whole force into the gap, showing front to the French with a division probably smaller in numbers, but which, from its position to windward, had the choice of coming to close action or not, while with the remainder he fell in much superior strength upon the English (Plate III., B). Paul Hoste says that Vice-Admiral d'Estrées, commanding the French, had taken measures for tacking and breaking through the Dutch division opposed to him so as to rejoin the Duke of York, the allied commander-in-chief. It may be so, for D'Estrees was a very brave man, and not enough of a seaman to appreciate the dangers of the attempt; but no such move was begun, and both the English and Ruyter thought that the French rather avoided than sought close action. Had D'Estrees, however, gone about, and attempted to break through the line of experienced Dutchmen to windward of him with the still raw seamen of France, the result would have been as disastrous as that which overtook the Spanish admiral at the battle of St. Vincent a hundred and twenty-five years later, when he tried to reunite his broken fleet by breaking through the close order of Jervis and Nelson. (See Plate III., a.) The truth, which gradually dawns through a mass of conflicting statements, is, that the Duke of York, though a fair seaman and a brave man, was not an able one; that his fleet was not in good order and was thus surprised; that his orders beforehand were not so precise as to make the French admiral technically disobedient in taking the opposite tack from the commander-in-chief, and so separating the squadrons; and that Ruyter profited most ably by the surprise which he had himself prepared, and by the further opportunity given him by the ineptness of his enemies. Unless for circumstances that are not stated, the French admiral took the right tack, with a northeast wind, for it led out to sea and would give room for manoeuvring; had the Duke of York chosen the same, the allied fleet would have gone out together, with only the disadvantage of the wind and bad order. In that case, however, Ruyter could, and probably would, have done just what he did at the Texel a year later, — check the van, the French, with a small containing force, and fall with the mass of his fleet upon the centre and rear. It is the similarity of his action in both cases, under very different conditions, that proves he intended at Southwold Bay merely to keep the French in check while he destroyed the English. In this battle, called indifferently Southwold Bay and Solebay, Ruyter showed a degree of skill combined with vigor which did not appear upon the sea, after his death, until the days of Suffren and Nelson. His battles of the war of 1672 were no \"affairs of circumspection,\" though they were fought circumspectly; his aim was no less than the enemy's total overthrow, by joining good combinations to fury of attack. At Solebay he was somewhat, though not greatly, inferior to his enemies; afterward much more so. The substantial results of Solebay fight were wholly favorable to the Dutch. The allied fleets were to have assisted the operations of the French army by making a descent upon the coast of Zealand. Ruyter's attack had inflicted an amount of damage, and caused an expenditure of ammunition, which postponed the sailing of the fleet for a month; it was a diversion, not only important, but vital in the nearly desperate condition to which the United Provinces were reduced ashore. It may be added, as an instructive comment on the theory of commerce-destroying, that after this staggering check to the enemy's superior forces, Ruyter met and convoyed safely to port a fleet of Dutch merchantmen.",

    "section": "The French Campaign in Holland",
    "text": "The progress of the land campaign must now be briefly described. Early in May the French army in several corps moved forward, passing through the outskirts of the Spanish Netherlands, and directing their attack upon Holland from the south and east. The republican party which was in power in Holland had neglected the army, and now made the mistake of scattering the force they had among many fortified towns, trusting that each would do something toward delaying the French. Louis, however, under the advice of Turenne, simply observed the more important places, while the second-rate towns surrendered nearly as fast as they were summoned; the army of the Provinces, as well as their territory, thus passing rapidly, by fractions, into the power of the enemy. Within a month the French were in the heart of the country, having carried all before them, and with no organized force remaining in their front sufficient of itself to stop them. In the fortnight following the battle of Solebay, terror and disorganization spread throughout the republic. On the 15th of June the Grand Pensionary obtained permission of the States-General to send a deputation to Louis XIV., begging him to name the terms on which he would grant them peace; any humiliation to the foreigner was better in the eyes of the politician than to see the opposite party, the House of Orange, come into power on his downfall. While negotiations were pending, the Dutch towns continued to surrender; and on the 20th of June a few French soldiers entered Muyden, the key to Amsterdam. They were only stragglers, though the large body to which they belonged was near at hand; and the burghers, who had admitted them under the influence of the panic prevailing throughout the land, seeing that they were alone, soon made them drunk and put them out. The nobler feeling that animated Amsterdam now made itself felt in Muyden; a body of troops hurried up from the capital, and the smaller city was saved. \"Situated on the Zuyder Zee, two hours distant from Amsterdam, at the junction of a number of rivers and canals, Mujden not only held the key of the principal dykes by which Amsterdam could surround herself with a protecting inundation, it also held the key of the harbor of this great city, all the ships which went from the North Sea to Amsterdam by the Zuyder Zee being obliged to pass under its guns. Muyden saved and its dykes open, Amsterdam had time to breathe, and remained free to break off her communications by land and to maintain them by sea.\" It was the turning-point of the invasion; but what would have been the effect upon the spirit of the Dutch, oppressed by defeat and distracted in council, if in that fateful fortnight which went before, the allied fleet had attacked their coasts? From this they were saved by the battle of Solebay. Negotiations continued. The burgomasters — the party representing wealth and commerce — favored submission; they shrank from the destruction of their property and trade. New advances were made; but while the envoys were still in the camp of Louis, the populace and the Orange party rose, and with them the spirit of resistance. On the 25th of June Amsterdam opened the dykes, and her example was followed by the other cities of Holland; immense loss was entailed, but the flooded country and the cities contained therein, standing like islands amid the waters, were safe from attack by land forces until freezing weather. The revolution continued. William of Orange, afterward William III. of England, was on the 8th of July made stadtholder, and head of the army and navy; and the two De Witts, the heads of the republican party, were murdered by a mob a few weeks later. The resistance born of popular enthusiasm and pride of country was strengthened by the excessive demands of Louis XIV. It was plain that the Provinces must conquer or be destroyed.",

The battle took on several distinct phases, which it is instructive to follow. M. do Martcl, commanding the van of the French, and consequently the leading sub- division of the allied fleet, was ordered to stretch ahead, go about and gain to windward of the Dutch van, so as to place it between two fires. This he did (B) ; but as soon as Bankert — the same who had manoeuvred so judiciously at Solebay the year before — saw the danger, he put his helm up and ran through the remaining twenty ships of D'Estrees' squadron with his own twelve (C), — a feat as creditable to him as it was discreditable to the French ; and then wearing round stood down to De Ruyter, who was hotly engaged with Rupert (C). He was not followed by D'Estrees, who suf- fered him to carry this important reinforcement to the Dutch main attack undisturbed. This practically ended the French share in the fight. Rupert, during his action with De Ruyter, kept off con- tinually, with the object of drawing the Dutch farther away from their coast, so that if the wind shifted they might not be able to regain its shelter. De Ruyter followed him, and the consequent separation of the centre from the van (B, B') was one of the reasons alleged by D'Estrees for his delay. It does not, however, seem to have prevented Bankert from joining his chief. In the rear an extraordinary action on the part of Sir Edward Spragge increased the confusion in the allied fleet. For some reason this officer considered Tromp, who com- manded the Dutch rear, as his pei'sonal antagonist, and in order to facilitate the latter's getting into action, he hove- to (stopped) the whole English rear to wait for him. This ill-timed point of honor on Spragge's part seems to have sprung from a promise he had made to the king that he would bring back Tromp alive or dead, or else lose his own life. The stoppage, which recalls the irresponsible and insub- ordinate action of the junior Dutch flag-officers in the former war, of course separated the rear (A\", B\", C\"), which also drifted rapidly to leeward, Spragge and Tromp carrying on a 154 THE BATTLE OF THE TEXEL. hot private action on their own account. These two junior admirals souglit each other personally, and the battle be- tween their flags was so severe that Spragge twice had to shift his own to another ship; on the second occasion the boat in which he was embarked was sunk by a shot, and he himself drowned.",

It is not creditable to the gunnery of the day that more substantial results did not follow ; but it is to be remembered that all Ruyter's skill could secure, except for probably a very short time, was an action on equal terms with the English ; his total inferi- ority in numbers could not be quite overcome. The damage to the English and Dutch may therefore have been great, and was probably nearly equal. Rupert finally disengaged himself, and seeiug that the English rear (C) was not replying well to its immediate opponents, ran down toward it, Ruyter following him ; the two opposing centres steering pai'allel courses, and within cannon-shot, but by mutual consent, induced perhaps by ammunition running short, refraining from firing. At four p. M. the centres and rears united, and toward five a fresh engagement began, which continued till seven, when Ruyter withdrew, probably because of the approach of the French, who, by their own accounts, rejoined Rupert about that time. This ended the battle, which, like all that preceded it in this w^ar, may be called a drawn fight, but as to which the verdict of the English naval historian is doubtless cor- rect : \" The consequences which the Dutch, through the prudence of their admiral, drew from this battle were ex- ceedingly great ; for they opened their ports, which were entirely blocked up, and put an end to all thoughts, by re- moving the possibility, of an invasion.\" ^ 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. TILE BATTLE OF TLIE TEXEL. 155 The military features of the action have sufficiently ap- peared in the account that has heen given, — the skill of Do Ruyter ; the firmness and promptness of Baukert, first in checking and then in passing through the French division ; the apparent disloyalty or, at the hest, inefficiency of the lat- ter; the insubordination and military blundering of Spragge ; the seeming lack of everything but hard fighting on Rupert's part. The allies indulged in bitter mutual recriminations. Rupert blamed both D'Estrecs and Spragge ; D'Estr^iCs found fault with Rupert for running to leeward ; and D'Estrees' own second, Martel, roundly called his chief a coward, in a letter which earned him an imprisonment in the Bastille. The French king ordered an inquiry by the intendant of the navy at Brest, who made a report ^ upon which the account here given has mainly rested, and which leaves little doubt of the dishonor of the French arms in this battle.",

    "text": "The withdrawal of England, which remained neutral during the remaining four years of the war, necessarily made it less maritime. The King of France did not think his navy, either in numbers or efficiency, able to contend alone with that of Holland; he therefore withdrew it from the ocean and confined his sea enterprises to the Mediterranean, with one or two half-privateering expeditions to the West Indies. The United Provinces, for their part, being freed from danger on the side of the sea, and not having, except for a short time, any serious idea of operating against the French coast, diminished their own fleets. The war became more and more continental, and drew in more and more the other powers of Europe. Gradually the German States cast their lot with Austria, and on May 28, 1674, the Diet proclaimed war against France. The great work of French policy in the last generations was undone, Austria had resumed her supremacy in Germany, and Holland had not been destroyed.\n\nOn the Baltic, Denmark, seeing Sweden inclining toward France, hastened to make common cause with the German Empire, sending fifteen thousand troops. There remained in Germany only Bavaria, Hanover, and Wurtemberg faithful still to their French alliance. The land war had thus drawn in nearly all the powers of Europe, and, from the nature of the case, the principal theatre of the conflict was beyond the eastern boundary of France, toward the Rhine, and in the Spanish Netherlands; but while this was raging, a maritime episode was introduced by the fact of Denmark and Sweden being engaged on opposite sides. Of this it will not be necessary to speak, beyond mentioning that the Dutch sent a squadron under Tromp to join the Danes, and that the united fleets won a great victory over the Swedes in 1676, taking from them ten ships. It is therefore evident that the sea superiority of Holland detracted greatly from Sweden's value as an ally to Louis XIV. Another maritime strife arose in the Mediterranean by the revolt of the Sicilians against the Spanish rule. The help they asked from France was granted as a diversion against Spain, but the Sicilian enterprise never became more than a side issue. Its naval interest springs from bringing Ruyter once more on the scene, and that as the antagonist of Duquesne, the equal, and by some thought even the superior, of Tourville, whose name has always stood far above all others in the French navy of that day. Messina revolted in July, 1674, and the French king at once took it under his protection. The Spanish navy throughout seems to have behaved badly, certainly inefficiently; and early in 1675 the French were safely established in the city.",

    "text": "During the year their naval power in the Mediterranean was much increased, and Spain, unable to defend the island herself, applied to the United Provinces for a fleet, the expenses of which she would bear. The Provinces, \"fatigued by the war, involved in debt, suffering cruelly in their commerce, exhausted by the necessity of paying the emperor and all the German princes, could no longer fit out the enormous fleets which they had once opposed to France and England.\" They however hearkened to Spain and sent De Ruyter, with a squadron of only eighteen ships and four fire-ships. The admiral, who had noted the growth of the French navy, said the force was too small, and departed oppressed in spirit, but with the calm resignation which was habitual to him. He reached Cadiz in September, and in the mean time the French had further strengthened themselves by the capture of Agosta, a port commanding the southeast of Sicily. De Ruyter was again delayed by the Spanish government, and did not reach the north coast of the island until the end of December, when head winds kept him from entering the Straits of Messina. He cruised between Messina and the Lipari Islands in a position to intercept the French fleet convoying troops and supplies, which was expected under Duquesne. On the 7th of January, 1676, the French came in sight, twenty ships-of-the-line and six fire-ships; the Dutch had but nineteen ships, one of which was a Spaniard, and four fire-ships; and it must be remembered that, although there is no detailed account of the Dutch ships in this action, they were as a rule inferior to those of England, and yet more to those of France. The first day was spent in manoeuvring, the Dutch having the weather-gage; but during that night, which was squally and drove the Spanish galleys accompanying the Dutch to take refuge under Lipari, the wind shifted, and coming out at west-southwest, gave the French the weather-gage and the power to attack. Duquesne resolved to use it, and sending the convoy ahead, formed his line on the starboard tack standing south; the Dutch did the same, and waited for him. An emotion of surprise must be felt at seeing the great Dutch admiral surrender the choice of attack on the 7th. At daybreak of that day he saw the enemy and steered for him; at three p. m., a French account says, he hauled his wind on the same tack as themselves, but out of cannon-shot to windward. How account for the seeming reluctance of the man who three years before had made the desperate attacks of Solebay and the Texel? His reasons have not been handed down; it may be that the defensive advantages of the lee-gage had been recognized by this thoughtful seaman, especially when preparing to meet, with inferior forces, an enemy of impetuous gallantry and imperfect seamanship. If any such ideas did influence him they were justified by the result. The battle of Stromboli presents a partial anticipation of the tactics of the French and English a hundred years later; but in this case it is the French who seek the weather-gage and attack with fury, while the Dutch take the defensive. The results were very much such as Clerk pointed out to the English in his celebrated work on naval tactics, the accounts here followed being entirely French.",

In doing this, two ships in the French van were seriously disabled. \"M. de la Fayette, in the 'Prudente,' began the action; but having rashly thrown himself into the midst of the enemy's van, he was dismantled and forced to haul off.\" Confusion ensued in the French line, from the difficult character of the manoeuvre. \"Vice-Admiral de Preuilli, commanding the van, in keeping away took too little room, so that in coming to the wind again, the ships, in too close order, lapped and interfered with one another's fire. The absence of M. de la Fayette from the line threw the 'Parfait' into peril. Attacked by two ships, she lost her maintopmast and had also to haul off for repairs.\" Again, the French came into action in succession instead of all together, a usual and almost inevitable result of the manoeuvre in question. \"In the midst of a terrible cannonade,\" that is, after part of his ships were engaged, \"Duquesne, commanding the centre, took post on the beam of Ruyter's division.\" The French rear came into action still later, after the centre. \"Langeron and Bethune, commanding leading ships of the French centre, are crushed by superior forces.\" How can this be, seeing the French had the more ships? It was because, as the narrative tells us, \"the French had not yet repaired the disorder of the first movement.\" However, all at last got into action, and Duquesne gradually restored order. The Dutch, engaged all along the line, resisted everywhere, and there was not one of their ships which was not closely engaged; more cannot be said for the admiral and captains of the inferior fleet. The remaining part of the fight is not very clearly related. Ruyter is said to have given way continually with his two leading divisions; but whether this was a confession of weakness or a tactical move does not appear. The rear was separated, in permitting which either Ruyter or the immediate commander was at fault; but the attempts made by the French to surround and isolate it failed, probably because of damaged spars, for one French ship did pass entirely around the separated division. The action ended at 4.30 p. m., except in the rear, and the Spanish galleys shortly after came up and towed the disabled Dutch ships away. Their escape shows how injured the French must have been. The positions are intended to show the Dutch rear far separated, and the disorder in which a fleet action under sail necessarily ended from loss of spars. Those who are familiar with Clerk's work on naval tactics, published about 1780, will recognize in this account of the battle of Stromboli all the features to which he called the attention of English seamen in his thesis on the methods of action employed by them and their adversaries in and before his time. Clerk's thesis started from the postulate that English seamen and officers were superior in skill or spirit, or both, to the French, and their ships on the whole as fast; that they were conscious of this superiority and therefore eager to attack, while the French, equally conscious of inferiority, or for other reasons, were averse to decisive engagements. With these dispositions the latter, feeling they could rely on a blindly furious attack by the English, had evolved a crafty plan by which, while seeming to fight, they really avoided doing so, and at the same time did the enemy much harm. This plan was to take the lee-gage, the characteristic of which, as has before been pointed out, is that it is a defensive position, and to await attack.",

    "text": "The English error, according to Clerk, upon which the French had learned by experience that they could always count, was in drawing up their line parallel to the enemy, or nearly so, and then keeping away all together to attack, ship for ship, each its opposite in the hostile line. By standing down in this manner the assailant lost the use of most of his artillery, while exposed to the full fire of his opponent, and invariably came up in confusion, because the order of attack was one difficult to maintain at any time, and much more so in the smoke under fire, with torn sails and falling masts. This was precisely the attack made by Duquesne at Stromboli, and it there had precisely the consequences Clerk points out,—confusion in the line, the van arriving first and getting the brunt of the fire of the defence, disabled ships in the van causing confusion in the rear, etc. Clerk further asserts, and he seems to be right, that as the action grew warm, the French, by running off to leeward, in their turn, led the English to repeat the same mode of attack; and so we find, at Stromboli, Ruyter giving ground in the same way, though his motive does not appear. Clerk also points out that a necessary corollary of the lee-gage, assumed for tactical reasons, is to aim at the assailant's spars, his motive power, so that his attack cannot be pushed farther than the defendant chooses, and at Stromboli the crippled condition of the French is evident; for after Ruyter had fallen to leeward, and could no longer help his separated rear, it was practically unmolested by the French, although none of these had been sunk. While therefore there cannot with certainty be attributed to Ruyter the deliberate choice of the lee-gage, for which there was as yet no precedent, it is evident that he reaped all its benefits, and that the character of the French officers of his day, inexperienced as seamen and of impetuous valor, offered just the conditions that gave most advantage to an inferior force standing on the defensive. The qualities and characteristics of the enemy are among the factors to be considered in the choice of methods.",

    "text": "English official reports of the eighteenth century often speak of French ships withdrawing from battle, attributing this maneuver to a lack of valor. However, Clerk suggests it was a skillful tactic to disable assailants as they approached, hindering their artillery. This tactic was used by Decatur's frigate \"United States\" against the \"Macedonian\" in 1812 and by Confederate gunboats at Mobile against Farragut's flagship.  A similar approach can be used by a faster defending ship against a direct attack. An unnoticed factor contributing to a lee line falling further to leeward is the natural impulse of ships without opponents to turn and bring their broadsides to bear. This maneuver, if repeated by several ships, would cause disorder and require the entire line to keep away.\n\nIn 1676, the French admiral Duquesne engaged De Ruyter's Dutch fleet off Stromboli. Duquesne displayed a lack of tactical awareness, attacking ship against ship without concentrating his force or waiting for reinforcements from Messina. This contrasted sharply with the tactical sophistication seen in battles like Solebay or the Texel. Despite this, the battle holds historical significance as it represents the peak of French naval tactics at that time under Duquesne, arguably their best officer of the century, alongside Tourville.  Clerk proposed a remedy: attacking the rear ships of the enemy's line, preferably to leeward, forcing the rest of the fleet to abandon them or engage in a general action, which was what English seamen desired.\n\nAfter the battle, De Ruyter sailed to Palermo, losing a ship en route. Duquesne met reinforcements outside Messina. On April 22nd, 1676, they clashed again off Agosta. Duquesne had twenty-nine ships, while the Dutch and Spanish allies had twenty-seven, ten of which were Spanish. The Spanish commander, against Ruyter's advice, took the center with the Spanish ships, leaving Ruyter's Dutch van to bear the brunt of the attack. The Spanish center remained at long range, resulting in Ruyter's mortal wounding, a first in his long career. His death a week later in Syracuse extinguished the last hope of naval resistance. A month later, the allied fleets were attacked at anchor in Palermo and suffered heavy losses.  Reinforcements from Holland were also intercepted and forced to retreat to Cadiz.\n\nThe Sicilian campaign remained a secondary concern for Louis XIV, who focused on continental war, highlighting his lack of interest in maritime expansion.  Over time, English anti-French sentiment grew, fueled by trade rivalries and French naval expansion surpassing their own. In 1678, an alliance was formed between England and Holland against France, leading to Louis XIV's evacuation of Sicily.",

    "text": "Louis XIV, fearing the combined naval power of England and Holland, evacuated Sicily and focused on the Spanish Netherlands. While avoiding conflict with England when possible, he now aimed to pressure Holland through land-based attacks. The United Provinces, despite their small size, were central to the coalition against France, bearing the financial burden of the war and keeping their German allies loyal through their wealth and strong leadership under William of Orange. Their sea power and commercial prowess were crucial in sustaining the war effort. Like England in later centuries, Holland's maritime strength allowed them to support the war against French ambition, but at a significant cost.  Dutch commerce suffered from French privateering and the loss of the carrying trade to neutral English ships due to Louis XIV's desire to maintain English neutrality. This neutrality also led to favorable trade concessions for England, undermining Colbert's efforts to protect and grow French sea power.\n\nDespite these concessions, deeper motives pushed England towards conflict with France.  The war, however, strained Holland's resources, impacting its navy and trade, demonstrating the limitations of a continental war for a maritime power. While the justification for William of Orange's staunch opposition to Louis XIV is debatable, the conflict undeniably weakened Holland's sea power and international standing. Holland's position between France and England meant constant conflict, which, along with sometimes harmful English alliances, drained its finances and hampered its trade. This contrasted with Holland's earlier role as England's enemy or rival, both positions leaving it disadvantaged due to its smaller size and less favorable location. Holland's exhaustion, coupled with pressure from its merchants and peace advocates, along with France's financial difficulties and the impending threat of the English navy, pushed both nations towards peace.  The Treaty of Nimeguen, signed in August 1678, brought an end to the war, with other powers soon following suit.",

Holland, Louis XIV's initial target, lost no European territory, its survival attributed to its sea power.  The war, however, severely depleted its strength, paving the way for its decline.  The war's impact on France was significant. Colbert's early efforts during Louis XIV's reign focused on financial recovery and national wealth development through production, trade, merchant shipping, a strong navy, and colonial expansion – all elements of sea power. This progress was interrupted by war. Louis XIV faced a choice: pursue continental ambitions that hindered his nation's economic activities and disrupted trade by jeopardizing control of the sea, or focus on maritime pursuits that, while costly, would secure peace, lead to naval dominance, and stimulate trade and revenue. Louis XIV's actions inadvertently propelled England towards the very sea power that Colbert envisioned for France. By driving Dutch trade to English ships, allowing England to establish colonies in North America, and sacrificing French commerce for English neutrality, Louis XIV facilitated England's rapid ascent as a naval power. Despite wartime hardships, England's prosperity grew.  While France couldn't ignore its continental position, a focus on sea power might have averted conflicts and eased the burden of those unavoidable. The Treaty of Nimeguen didn't inflict irreparable damage, but the war negatively impacted French agriculture, commerce, manufacturing, and colonies. The peace terms, while advantageous for French territory and military power, harmed manufacturing due to lowered protective tariffs favoring England and Holland, both maritime powers. French merchant shipping declined, halting the growth of its navy.",

    "section": "Notice of the Comte d'Estrées",
    "text": "Jealousy of England, was like a tree without roots; it soon withered away under the blast of war. Before finally quitting this war with Holland, a short notice of the Comte d'Estrées, to whom Louis committed the charge of the French contingent of the allied fleet, and who commanded it at Solebay and the Texel, will throw some light upon the qualifications of the French naval officers of the day before experience had made seamen of many of them. D'Estrées went to sea for the first time in 1667, being then a man of mature years; but in 1672 we find him in the chief command of an important squadron, having under him Duquesne, who was a seaman, and had been so for nearly forty years. In 1677, D'Estrées obtained from the king a body of eight ships which he undertook to maintain at his own expense, upon the condition of receiving half the prizes made. With this squadron he made an attack upon the then Dutch island of Tobago, with a recklessness which showed that no lack of courage prompted his equivocal conduct at the Texel. The next year he went out again and contrived to run the whole squadron ashore on the Aves Islands. The account given by the flag-captain of this transaction is amusing as well as instructive. In his report he says: — \"The day that the squadron was lost, the sun having been taken by the pilots, the vice-admiral as usual had them put down the position in his cabin. As I was entering to learn what was going on, I met the third pilot, Bourdaloue, who was going out crying. I asked him what the matter was, and he answered: 'Because I find more drift than the other pilots, the admiral is threatening me and abusing me, as usual; yet I am only a poor lad who does the best he can.' When I had entered the cabin, the admiral, who was very angry, said to me, 'That scoundrel of a Bourdaloue is always coming to me with some nonsense or other; I will drive him out of the ship. He makes us to be running a course, the devil knows where, I don't.' As I did not know which was right,\" says the captain of the ship, rather naively, \"I did not dare to say anything for fear of bringing down a like storm on my own head.\" Some hours after this scene, which, as the French officer from whom the extract is taken says, \"appears now almost grotesque, but which is only an exact portrayal of the sea manners of the day, the whole squadron was lost on a group of rocks known as the Aves Islands. Such were the officers.\" The flag-captain, in another part of his report, says: \"The shipwreck resulted from the general line of conduct held by Vice-Admiral d'Estrées. It was always the opinion of his servants, or others than the proper officers of the ship, which prevailed. This manner of acting may be understood in the Comte d'Estrées, who, without the necessary knowledge of a profession he had embraced so late, always had with him obscure counsellors, in order to appropriate the opinions they gave him so as to blind the ship's company as to his capacity.\" D'Estrées had been made vice-admiral two years after he first went aboard ship.",

    "text": "The Peace of Nimeguen was followed by a period of ten years in which no extensive war broke out. They were, however, far from being years of political quiet. Louis XIV. was as intent upon pushing on his frontiers to the eastward in peace as in war, and grasped in quick succession fragments of territory which had not been given him by the peace. Claiming this and that in virtue of ancient feudal ties; this and that other as implicitly surrendered by the treaty, because dependent upon something else that had been explicitly surrendered; purchasing at one time, using bare force in other cases, and backing up all the so-called peaceful methods of obtaining his asserted rights by the presence of armed power, he carried on this process of extension between 1679 and 1682. The aggression most startling to Europe, and above all to the German Empire, was the seizure of the then imperial city of Strasburg on the 30th of September, 1681; and on the same day Casale, in Italy, was sold to him by the Duke of Mantua, showing that his ambitions were directed that way as well as to the north and east. Both of these were positions of great strategic importance, threatening, the one Germany, the other Italy, in case of war. The excitement throughout Europe was very great; in every direction Louis, serenely trusting to his power, was making new enemies and alienating former friends. The king of Sweden, directly insulted, and injured in his duchy of Deux-Ponts, turned against him, as did the Italian States; and the Pope himself sided with the enemies of a king who was already showing his zeal for the conversion of the Protestants, and was preparing for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. But the discontent, though deep and general, had to be organized and directed; the spirit necessary to give it form and final effective expression was found again in Holland, in William of Orange. Time, however, was needed to mature the work. \"No one yet armed himself; but every one talked, wrote, agitated, from Stockholm to Madrid. . . . The war of the pen preceded by many years the war of the sword; incessant appeals were made to European opinion by indefatigable publicists; under all forms was diffused the terror of the New Universal Monarchy,\" which was seeking to take the place once filled by the House of Austria. It was known that Louis sought to make himself or his son emperor of Germany. But complications of different kinds, private interests, lack of money, all combined to delay action. The United Provinces, despite William's wishes, were yet unwilling to act again as banker for a coalition, and the emperor was so threatened on his eastern frontier by the rebel Hungarians and the Turks that he dared not risk a western war. Meanwhile the armed navy of France was daily growing in strength and efficiency under Colbert's care, and acquiring the habit of war by attacks upon the Barbary pirates and their ports. During the same years the navies both of England and of Holland were declining in numbers and efficiency. It has already been said that in 1688, when William needed Dutch ships for his expedition to England, it was objected that the navy was in a far different condition from 1672, \"being incalculably decreased in strength and deprived of its most able commanders.\" In England, the decline of discipline had been followed by an economical policy as to material, gradually lessening the numbers and injuring the condition of the fleet; and after the little flare-up and expected war with France in 1678, the king gave the care of the navy to a new body of men, concerning whom an English naval historian says: \"This new administration lasted five years, and if it had continued five years longer would in all probability have remedied even the numerous and mighty evils it had introduced, by wearing out the whole royal navy, and so leaving no room for future mistakes. However, a just sense of this induced the king, in 1684, to resume the management of the fleet into his own hands, restoring most of the old officers; but before any great progress in the work of restoration could be made, his Majesty died,\" — in 1685. The change of sovereigns was of vast importance, not merely to the English navy, but from the ultimate effect it was to have upon the designs of Louis XIV. and the fortune of the general war which his aggressions were preparing. James II. was peculiarly interested in the navy, being himself a seaman, and having commanded in chief at Lowestoft and Southwold Bay. He knew its actual depressed condition; and the measures he at once took to restore it, both in numbers and efficiency, were thoughtful and thorough. In the three years of his reign very much indeed was done to prepare a weapon which was first proved against himself and his best friend. The accession of James II., which promised fairly for Louis, precipitated the action of Europe against him. The House of Stuart, closely allied to the King of France, and sympathizing with his absolutist rule, had used the still great power of the sovereign to check the political and religious enmity of the English nation to France. James II. added to the same political sympathies a strength of Roman Catholic fervor which led him into acts peculiarly fitted to revolt the feeling of the English people, with the final result of driving him from the throne, and calling to it, by the voice of Parliament, his daughter Mary, whose husband was William of Orange. In the same year that James became king, a vast diplomatic combination against France began. This movement had two sides, religious and political. The Protestant States were enraged at the increasing persecutions of the French Protestants, and their feelings became stronger as the policy of James of England showed itself more and more bent toward Rome. The Protestant northern States, Holland, Sweden, and Brandenburg, drew together in alliances; and they counted for support upon the Emperor of Austria and Germany, upon Spain and other Roman Catholic States whose motives were political apprehension and anger. The emperor had latterly been successful against the Turks, thus freeing his hands for a move against France. July 9, 1686, there was signed at Augsburg a secret agreement between the emperor, the kings of Spain and Sweden, and a number of German princes. Its object was at first defensive only against France, but it could readily be turned into an offensive alliance. This compact took the name of the League of Augsburg, and from it the general war which followed two years later was called the War of the League of Augsburg. The next year, 1687, saw yet greater successes of the Empire over the Turks and Hungarians. It was evident that France could expect no more from diversions in that quarter. At the same time the discontent of the English and the ambitions of the Prince of Orange, who hoped from his accession to the throne of England no ordinary personal aggrandizement, but the fulfilment of his strongest political wish and conviction, in curbing forever the power of Louis XIV., became more and more plain. But for his expedition into England, William needed ships, money, and men from the United Provinces; and they hung back, knowing that the result would be war with the French king, who proclaimed James his ally. Their action was at last decided by the course of Louis, who chose this moment to revoke concessions made at Nimeguen to Dutch trade. The serious injury thus done to Holland's material interests turned the wavering scale. \"This violation of the conventions of Nimeguen,\" says a French historian, \"by giving a severe blow to Dutch commerce, reducing her European trade more than one fourth, removed the obstacle that religious passions still encountered in material interests, and put all Holland at the disposition of William, none having reason longer to conciliate France.\" This was in November, 1687. In the summer of the following year the birth of an heir to the English throne brought things to an issue. English loyalty might have put up with the reign of the father, now advanced in years, but could not endure the prospect of a continued Roman Catholic royalty. Matters had at last reached the crisis to which they had been tending for years. Louis and William of Orange, long-standing enemies, and at the moment the two chief figures in European politics, alike from their own strong personalities and the cause which either represented, stood on the brink of great actions, whose effects were to be felt through many generations. William, despotic in temper himself, stood on the shores of Holland looking hopefully toward free England, from which he was separated by the narrow belt of water that was the defence of the island kingdom, and might yet be an impassable barrier to his own high aims; for the French king at that moment could control the sea if he would. Louis, holding all the power of France in his single grasp, facing eastward as before, saw the continent gathering against him; while on his flank was England heartily hostile, longing to enter on the strife against him, but as yet without a leader. It still remained with him to decide whether he would leave the road open for the head to join the waiting body, and to bring Holland and England, the two sea powers, under one rule. If he attacked Holland by land, and sent his superior navy into the Channel, he might well keep William in his own country; the more so as the English navy, beloved and petted by the king, was likely to have more than the usual loyalty of seamen to their chief. Faithful to the bias of his life, perhaps unable to free himself from it, he turned toward the continent, and September 24, 1688, declared war against Germany and moved his armies toward the Rhine. William, overjoyed, saw removed the last obstacle to his ambition.",

    "text": "winds, he finally set sail from Holland on the 30th of October. More than five hundred transports, with fifteen thousand troops, escorted by fifty men-of-war, formed the expedition; and it is typical of its mingled political and religious character, that the larger part of the army officers were French Protestants who had been driven from France since the last war, the commander-in-chief under William being the Huguenot Schomberg, late a marshal of France. The first start was foiled by a violent storm; but sailing again on the 10th of November, a fresh, fair breeze carried the ships through the Straits and the Channel, and William landed on the 15th at Torbay. Before the end of the year, James had fled from his kingdom. On the 21st of the following April, William and Mary were proclaimed sovereigns of Great Britain, and England and Holland were united for the war, which Louis had declared against the United Provinces as soon as he heard of William's invasion. During all the weeks that the expedition was preparing and delayed, the French ambassador at the Hague and the minister of the navy were praying the king to stop it with his great sea power,—a power so great that the French fleet in the first years of the war outnumbered those of England and Holland combined; but Louis would not. Blindness seems to have struck the kings of England and France alike; for James, amid all his apprehensions, steadily refused any assistance from the French fleet, trusting to the fidelity of the English seamen to his person, although his attempts to have Mass celebrated on board the ships had occasioned an uproar and mutiny which nearly ended in the crews throwing the priests overboard. France thus entered the War of the League of Augsburg without a single ally. \"What her policy had most feared, what she had long averted, was come to pass. England and Holland were not only allied, but united under the same chief; and England entered the coalition with all the eagerness of passions long restrained by the Stuart policy.\" As regards the sea war, the different battles have much less tactical value than those of De Ruyter. The chief points of strategic interest are the failure of Louis, having a decided superiority at sea, properly to support James II. in Ireland, which remained faithful to him, and the gradual disappearance from the ocean of the great French fleets, which Louis XIV. could no longer maintain, owing to the expense of that continental policy which he had chosen for himself. A third point of rather minor interest is the peculiar character and large proportions taken on by the commerce-destroying and privateering warfare of the French, as their large fleets were disappearing. This, and the great effect produced by it, will appear at first to contradict what has been said as to the general inadequacy of such a warfare when not supported by fleets; but an examination of the conditions, which will be made later on, will show that the contradiction is rather apparent than real.",

    "text": "Taught by the experience of the last conflict, the chief effort of the French king, in the general war he had brought upon himself, should have been directed against the sea powers,—against William of Orange and the Anglo-Dutch alliance. The weakest point in William's position was Ireland; though in England itself not only were there many partisans of the exiled king, but even those who had called in William fenced his kingship about with jealous restrictions. His power was not secure so long as Ireland was not subdued. James, having fled from England in January, 1689, landed in Ireland in the following March, accompanied by French troops and a French squadron, and was enthusiastically welcomed everywhere but in the Protestant North. He made Dublin his capital, and remained in the country until July of the next year. During these fifteen months the French were much superior at sea; they landed troops in Ireland on more than one occasion; and the English, attempting to prevent this, were defeated in the naval battle of Bantry Bay. But although James was so well established, and it was of the utmost importance to sustain him; although it was equally important to keep William from getting a foothold till James was further strengthened and Londonderry, then passing through its famous siege, reduced; and although the French were superior to the united English and Dutch on the seas in 1689 and 1690; nevertheless, the English admiral Rooke was able, unmolested, to throw succors and troops into Londonderry, and afterward landed Marshal Schomberg, with a small army, near Carrickfergus. Rooke stopped intercourse between Ireland and Scotland, where were many Stuart partisans, and then with his small squadron passed along the east coast of Ireland, attempted to burn the shipping in Dublin harbor, failing only through lack of wind, and finally came off Cork, then occupied by James, took possession of an island in the harbor, and returned in safety to the Downs in October. These services, which raised the siege of Londonderry and kept open the communications between England and Ireland, extended throughout the summer months; nor was any attempt made by the French to stop them. There can be little doubt than an effective co-operation of the French fleet in the summer of 1689 would have broken down all opposition to James in Ireland, by isolating that country from England, with corresponding injury to William's power.",

So badly had many of them been 184 SLUGGISH PURSUIT BY THE FRENCH. mauled, that, by English accounts, it was decided rather to destroy the disabled ships than to risk a general engagement to preserve them. Tourville pursued ; but instead of ordering a general chase, he kept the line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the slower ships. The occasion was precisely one of those in which a melee is permissible, indeed, obligatory. An enemy beaten and in flight should be pursued with ardor, and with only so much regard to order as will prevent the chas- ing vessels from losing mutual support, — a condition which by no means implies such relative bearings and distances as are required in the beginning or middle of a well-contested action. The failure to order such general pursuit indicates the side on which Tourville's military character lacked completeness ; and the failure showed itself, as is apt to be the case, at the supreme moment of his career. He never had such another opportunity as in this, the first great general action in which he commanded in chief, and which Hoste, who was on board the flag-ship, calls the most complete naval victory ever gained. It was so indeed at that time, — the most complete, but not the most decisive, as it perhaps might have been. The French, according to Hoste, lost not even a boat, much less a ship, which, if true, makes yet more culpable the sluggishness of the pursuit; while the allies fled, casting sixteen of their ships ashore and burning them in sight of the enemy, who pursued as far as the Downs. The English indeed give the allied loss as only eight ships, — an estimate probably full as much out one way as the French the other. Herbert took his fleet to the Thames, and baffled the enemy's further pursuit by remov- ing the buoys.^ Tourville's is the only great historical name among the seamen of this war, if we except the renowned privateersmen at whose head was Jean Bart. Among the English, extraor- dinary merit cannot be claimed for any one of the gallant and enterprising men who commanded squadrons. Tourville, ^ Ledyard says the order to remoA-e the buoys was not carried out (Naval History, vol. ii. p. 636). TOURVILLE'S MILITARY CHARACTER. 185 who by this time had served afloat for nearly thirty years, was at once a seaman and a military man. With su[)erb courage, of which he had given dazzling examples in his youth, he had seen service wherever the French fleets had fought, — in the Anglo-Dutch war, in the Mediterranean, and against the Barbary pirates. Reaching the rank of admiral, he commanded in person all the largest fleets sent out during the earlier years of this war, and he brought to the command a scientific knowledge of tactics, based upon both theory and experience, joined to that practical acquaintance with the seaman's business which is necessary in order to apply tac- tical principles upon the ocean to the best advantage. But with all these high qualities he seems to have failed, where so many warriors fail, in the ability to assume a great re- sponsibility.^ The caution in his pursuit of tlie allies after Beachy Head, though so different in appearance, came from the same trait which impelled him two years later to lead his fleet into almost certain destruction at La Hougue, be- cause he had the king's order in his pocket. He was brave enough to do anything, but not strong enough to bear the heaviest burdens. Tourville was in fact the forerunner of the careful and skilful tacticians of the coming era, but with the savor still of the impetuous hard-fighting which characterized the sea commanders of the seventeenth cen- tury. He doubtless felt, after Beachy Head, that he had done very well and could be satisfied ; but he could not have acted as he did had he felt, to use Nelson' s words, that \" if we had taken ten ships out of the enemy's eleven, and let the eleventh escape, being able to take her, I could never call such a good day.\"",

    "text": "The day after the sea fight off Beachy Head, with its great but still partial results, the cause of James IT. was lost ashore in Ireland. The army which William had been allowed to transport there unmolested was superior in number and quality to that of James, as William himself was superior as a leader 1 Seignelay, the French minister of marine of the day, called him \" poltron de tete, mais pas de cuiur.\" 186 CAMPAIGN IN IRELAND. to the ex-king. The counsel of Louis XIY. was that James should avoid decisive action, retiring if necessary to the Shan- non, in the midst of a country wholly devoted to him. It was, however, a good deal to ask, this abandonment of the capital after more than a year's occupancy, with all the consequent moral effect; it would have been much more to the purpose to stop William's landing. James undertook to cover Dublin, taking up the line of the river Boyne, and there on the lltli of July the two armies met, with the result that James was wholly defeated. The king himself fled to Kinsale, where he found ten of those frigates that had been meant to control St. George's Channel. He embarked, and again took refuge in France, begging Louis to improve the victory at Beachy Head by landing him with another French army in England itself. Louis angrily refused, and directed that the troops still remaining in Ireland should be at once withdrawn. The chances of a rising in favor of James, at least upon the shores of the Channel, if they existed at all, were greatly exaggerated by his own imagination. After the safe retreat of the allied fleet to the Thames, Tourville, in accordance with his instructions, made several demonstrations in the south of England ; but they were wholly fruitless in drawing out any show of attachment to the Stuart cause. In Ireland it was different. The Irish army with its French contingent fell back, after the battle of the Boyne, to the Shannon, and there again made a stand ; while Louis, receding from his first angry impulse, continued to send reinforcements and supplies. But the increasing urgency of the continental war kept him from affording enough support, and the war in Ireland came to a close a little over a year later, by the defeat at Aghrim and capitulation of Limerick. The battle of the Boyne, which from its peculiar religious coloring has obtained a somewhat factitious celebrity, may be taken as the date at which the English crown was firmly fixed on William's head. Yet it would be more accurate to say that the success of William, and with it the success of WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 187 Europe against Louis XIV. in the War of the League of Augs- burg, was due to the mistakes and failure of the French naval campaign in 1690 ; though in that campaign was won the most conspicuous single success the French have ever gained at sea over the English. As regards the more strik- ing military operations, it is curious to remark that Tourville sailed the day after William left Chester, and won Beachy Head the day before the battle of the Boyne ; but the real failure lay in permitting William to transport that solid body of men without hindrance. It might have been favorable to French policy to let him get into Ireland, but not with such a force at his back. The result of the Irish campaign w^as to settle William safely on the English throne and estab- lish the Anglo-Dutch alliance ; and the union of the two sea peoples under one crown was the pledge, through their commercial and maritime ability, and the wealth they drew from the sea, of the successful prosecution of the war by their allies on the continent.",

    "section": "Tourville's Deep-Sea Cruise and Battle of La Hougue",
    "text": "The year 1691 M^as distinguished by only one great mari- time event. This was ever afterward known in France as Tourville's \" deep-sea \" or \" ofT-shore \" cruise ; and the mem- ory of it as a brilliant strategic and tactical display remains to this day in the French navy. That staying power, which has already been spoken of as distinctive of nations whose sea power is not a mere military institution, but based upon the character and pursuits of the people, had now come into play with the allies. Notwithstanding the defeat and loss of Beachy Head, the united fleets took the sea in 1691 with one hundred ships-of-the-line under the command of Admiral Russell. Tourville could only gather seventy -two, the same number as the year before. \" With these he left Brest June 25. As the enemy had not yet appeared upon the coasts of the Channel, he took up his cruising ground at the entrance, sending lookout ships in all directions. In- formed that the allies had stationed themselves near the Scilly Islands to cover the passage of a convoy expected from the Levant, Tourville did not hesitate to steer for the English 188 BATTLE OF LA HO\nUGUE. coasts, where the approaching arrival of another merchant fleet from Jamaica was equally expected. Deceiving the Eng- lish cruisers by false courses, he reached the latter fleet, took from it several ships, and dispersed it before Russell could come up to fight him. When at last Tourville was in pres- ence of the allied fleet, he manoeuvred so skilfully, always keeping the weather-gage, that the enemy, drawn far out into the ocean, lost fifty days without finding an opportunity to engage. During this time French privateers, scattered throughout the Channel, harassed the enemy's commerce and protected convoys sent into Ireland. Worn out by fruit- less efforts, Russell steered for the Irish coast. Tourville, after having protected the return of the French convoys, anchored again in Brest Roads.\" Tlie actual captures made by Tourville's own fleet were insignificant, but its service to the commerce-destroying war- fare of the French, by occupying the allies, is obvious ; never- theless, the loss of English commerce was not as great tliis year as the next. The chief losses of the allies seem to have been in the Dutch North Sea trade. The two wars, continental and maritime, that were being waged, though simultaneous, were as yet independent of each other. It is unnecessary in connection with our subject to mention the operations of the former. In 1692 there oc- curred the great disaster to the French fleet which is known as the battle of La Hougue. In itself, considered tactically, it possesses little importance, and the actual results have been much exaggerated ; but popular report has made it one of the famous sea battles of the world, and therefore it can- not be wholly passed by. Misled by repoi-ts from England, and still more by the rep- resentations of James, who fondly nursed his belief that the attachment of many English naval officers to his person was greater than their love of country or faithfulness to their trust, Louis XIV. determined to attempt an invasion of the south coast of England, led by James in person. As a first step thereto, Tourville, at the head of between fifty and sixty BATTLE OF LA HOUGUE. 189 ships-of-tlic-line, thirteen of which were to come from Toulon, was to engage the English fleet ; from which so many deser- tions were expected as would, with the consequent demorali- zation, yield the French an easy and total victory. The first hitch was in the failure of the Toulon fleet, delayed by con- trary winds, to join ; and Tourvillc went to sea with only forty-four ships, but with a peremptory order from the king to fight when he fell in witli the enemy, were they few or many, and come what might. On the 29th of May, Tourville saw the allies to the north- ward and eastward ; they numbered ninety-nine sail-of-the- line. The wind being southwest, he had the choice of en- gaging",

    "text": "..., the council of war in the admiral's cabin, and the dramatic production of the king's orders, had no existence in fact.  his own, which was also necessarily weak from its extreme length ; but he avoided Herbert's error at Beachy Head, keeping his van refused with long intervals between the ships, to check the enemy's van, and engaging closely with his centre and rear. It is not necessary to follow the phases of this unequal fight ; the extraordinary result was that when the firing ceased at night, in consequence of a thick fog and calm, not a single French ship had struck her colors nor been sunk. No higher proof of military spirit and efficiency could be given by any navy, and Tourville's seamanship and tactical ability contributed largely to the result, which it must also be confessed was not creditable to the allies. The two fleets anchored at night- fall, a body of English ships remaining to the southward and westward of the French. Later on, these cut their cables and allowed themselves to drift through the French line in order to rejoin their main body ; in doing which they were roughly handled. Having amply vindicated the honor of his fleet, and shown the uselessness of further fighting, Tourville now thought of retreat, which was begun at midnight with a light northeast wind and continued all the next day. The allies pursued, the movements of the French being much embarrassed by the crippled condition of the flag-ship \" Royal Sun,\" the finest ship in the French navy, which the admiral could not make up his mind to destroy. The direction of the main retreat was toward the Channel Islands, thirty-five ships being with the admiral ; of them twenty passed with the tidal current through the dangerous passage known as the Race of Alder- ney, between the island of that name and the mainland, and got safe to St. Malo. Before the remaining fifteen could follow, the tide changed ; and the anchors which had been dropped dragging, these ships were carried to the eastward and to leeward of the enemy. Three sought refuge in Cher- bourg, which had then neither breakwater nor port, the remaining twelve at Cape La Hougue ; and they were all burned either by their own crews or by the allies. The French thus lost fifteen of the finest ships in their navy, the least of which carried sixty guns ; but this was little more than the loss of the allies at Beachy Head. The impression made upon the public mind, accustomed to the glories and successes of Louis XIV., was out of all proportion to the results, and blotted out the memory of the splendid self- devotion of Tourville and his followers. La Hougue was also the last general action fought by the French fleet, which did rapidly dwindle away in the following years, so that this disaster seemed to be its death-blow. As a matter of fact, however, Tourville went to sea the next year with seventy ships, and the losses were at the time repaired. The decay of the French navy was not due to any one defeat, but to the exhaustion of France and the great cost of the continental war ; and this war was mainly sustained by the two sea peoples whose union was secured by the success of William in the Irish campaign. Without asserting that the result would have been different had the naval operations of France been otherwise directed in 1690, it may safely be said that their misdirection was the immediate cause of things turning out as they did, and the first cause of the decay of the French navy. The five remaining years of the War of the League of Augsburg, in which all Europe was in arms against France, are marked by no great sea battles, nor any single maritime event of the first importance. To appreciate the effect of the sea power of the allies, it is necessary to sum up and condense an account of the quiet, steady pressure which it brought to bear and maintained in all quarters against France. It is thus indeed that sea power usually acts, and just because so quiet in its working, it is the more likely to be unnoticed and must be somewhat carefully pointed out.",

    "section": "Action of the Allied Navies/Commerce-Destroying/Effects of Sea Power",
    "text": "The head of the opposition to Louis XIY. was William III., and his tastes being military rather than naval combined with the direction of Louis' policy to make the active war continental rather than maritime ; while the gradual withdrawal of the great French fleets, by leaving the allied navies without enemies on the sea, worked in the same way. Furthermore, the efficiency of the English navy, which was double in numbers that of the Dutch, was at this time at a low pitch; the demoralizing effects of the reign of Charles IT. could not be wholly overcome during the three years of his brother's rule, and there was a yet more serious cause of trouble growing out of the political state of England. It has been said that James believed the naval officers and seamen to be attached to his person ; and, whether justly or unjustly, this thought was also in the minds of the present rulers, causing doubts of the loyalty and trustworthiness of many officers, and tending to bring confusion into the naval administration. We are told that \" the complaints made by the merchants were extremely well supported, and showed the folly of preferring unqualified men to that board which directed the naval power of England ; and yet the mischief could not be amended, because the more experienced people who had been long in the service were thought disaffected, and it appeared the remedy might have proved worse than the disease.\" Suspicion reigned in the cabinet and the city, factions and irresolution among the officers ; and a man who was unfortunate or incapable in action knew that the yet more serious charge of treason might follow his mis- adventure. After La Hougue, the direct military action of the allied navies was exerted in three principal ways, the first being in attacks upon the French ports, especially those in the Channel and near Brest. These had rarely in view more than local injury and the destruction of shipping, particularly in the ports whence the French privateers issued ; and although on some occasions the number of troops embarked was large, William proposed to himself little more than the diversion which such threats caused, by forcing Louis to take troops from the field for coast defence. It may be said generally of all these enterprises against the French coast, in this and later wars, that they effected little, and even as a diversion did not weaken the French armies to any great extent. If the French ports had been less well defended, or French water-ways open into the heart of the country, like our own Chesapeake and Delaware bays and the Southern sounds, the result might have been different. In the second place, the allied navies were of great direct military value, though they fought no battles, when Louis XIY. decided in 1694 to make his war against Spain offensive. Spain, though so weak in herself, was yet troublesome from her position in the rear of France; and Louis finally concluded to force her to peace by carrying the war into Cata- lonia, on the northeast coast. The movement of his armies was seconded by his fleet under Tourville ; and the reduction of that difficult province went on rapidly until the approach of the allied navies in largely superior force caused Tourville to retire to Toulon. This saved Barcelona ; and from that time until the two sea nations had determined to make peace, they kept their fleets on the Spanish coast and arrested the French advance. When, in 1697, \"William had become disposed to peace and Spain refused it, Louis again invaded, the allied fleet did not appear, and Barcelona fell. At the same time a French naval expedition was successfully directed against Cartagena in South America, and under the two blows, both of which depended upon the control of the sea, Spain yielded. The third military function of the allied navies was the protection of their sea commerce ; and herein, if history may be trusted, they greatly failed. At no time has war against commerce been conducted on a larger scale and with greater results than during this period ; and its operations were widest and most devastating at the very time that the great French fleets were disappearing, in the years immediately after La Hougue, apparently contradicting the assertion that such a warfare must be based on powerful fleets or neighboring seaports. A somewhat full discussion is due, inasmuch as the distress to commerce wrought by the privateers was a large factor in bringing the sea nations to wish for peace ; just as the subsidies, which their commerce enabled them to pay the continental armies, besides keeping up their own, were the chief means by which the war was prolonged and France brought to terms. The attack and defence of commerce is still a living question. In the first place it is to be observed that the decay of the French fleet was gradual, and that the moral effect of its appearance in the Channel, its victory at Beachy Head, and gallant conduct at La Hougue remained for some time impressed on the minds of the allies. This impression caused their ships to be kept together in fleets, instead of scattering in pursuit of the enemy's cruisers, and so brought to the latter a support almost equal to an active warfare on the seas. Again, the efficiency of the English navy, as has been said, was low, and its administration perhaps worse ; while treason in England gave the French the advantage of better information. Thus in the year following La Hougue, the French, having received accurate information of a great convoy sailing for Smyrna, sent out Tourville in May, getting him to sea before the allies were ready to blockade him in Brest, as they had intended. This delay was due to bad administration, as was also the further misfortune that the English government did not learn of Tourville's departure until after its own fleet had sailed with the trade. Tourville surprised the convoy near the Straits, destroyed or captured one hundred out of four hundred ships, and scattered the rest. This is not a case of simple cruising warfare, for Tourville's fleet was of seventy-one ships ; but it shows the incompetency of the English administration. In truth, it was immediately after La Hougue that the depredations of cruisers became most ruinous ; and the reason was twofold : first, the allied fleet was kept together at Spithead for two months and more, gathering troops for a landing on the continent, thus leaving the cruisers unmolested ; and in the second place, the French, not being able to send their fleet out again that summer, permitted the seamen to take service in private ships, thus largely increasing the numbers of the latter. The two causes working together gave an impunity and extension to commerce-destroying which caused a tremendous outcry in England. \" It must be confessed,\" says the English naval chronicler, \"that our commerce suffered far less the year before, when the French were masters at sea, than in this, when their grand fleet was blocked up in port.\" But the reason was that the French having little commerce and a comparatively large number of seamen, mainly employed in the fleet, were able, when this lay by, to release them to cruisers. As the pressure of the war became greater, and Louis continued to reduce the number of his ships in commission, another increase was given to the commerce-destroyers. \" The ships and officers of the royal navy were loaned, under certain conditions, to private firms, or to companies who wished to undertake privateering enterprises, in which even the cabinet ministers did not disdain to take shares ; \" indeed, they were urged to do so to please the king. The conditions generally provided that a certain proportion of the profits should go to the king, in return for the use of the ships. Such employment would be demoralizing to any military service, but not necessarily all at once ; and the conditions imparted for the time a tone and energy to privateering that it cannot always have. In truth, the public treasury, not being able to maintain the navy, associated with itself private capital, risking only material otherwise useless, and looking for returns to robbing the enemy. The commerce-destroying of this war, also, was no mere business of single cruisers ; squadrons of three or four up to half a dozen ships acted together under one man, and it is only just to say that under seamen like Jean Bart, Forbin, and Duguay-Trouin, they were even more ready to fight than to pillage. The largest of these private expeditions, and the only one that went far from the French shores, was directed in 1697 against Cartagena, on the Spanish Main. It numbered seven ships-of-the-line and six frigates, besides smaller vessels, and carried twenty-eight hundred troops. The chief object was to lay a contribution on the city of Cartagena ; but its effect on the policy of Spain was marked. and led to peace. Such a temper and concert of action went far to supply the place of supporting fleets, but could not wholly do so ; and although the allies continued to keep their large fleets together, still, as the war went on and efficiency of administration improved, commerce-destroying was brought within bounds. At the same time, as an evidence of how much the unsupported cruisers suffered, even under these favorable conditions, it may be mentioned that the English report fifty-nine ships-of-war captured against eighteen admitted by the French during the war, — a difference which a French naval historian attributes, with much probability, to the English failing to distinguish between ships-of-war properly so called, and those loaned to private firms. Cap- tures of actual privateers do not appear in the list quoted\n",

    "text": "The commerce-destroying of this war, therefore, was marked by the particular characteristics of cruisers acting together in squadron, not far from their base, while the enemy thought best to keep his fleet concentrated elsewhere; notwithstanding which, and the bad administration of the English navy, the cruisers were more and more controlled as the great French fleets disappeared. The results of the war of 1689-1697 do not therefore vitiate the general conclusion that \"a cruising, commerce-destroying warfare, to be destructive, must be seconded by a squadron warfare, and by divisions of ships-of-the-line; which, forcing the enemy to unite his forces, permit the cruisers to make fortunate attempts upon his trade. Without such backing the result will be simply the capture of the cruisers.\" Toward the end of this war the real tendency was becoming manifest, and was still more plainly seen in the next, when the French navy had sunk to a yet lower state of weakness. Notwithstanding their losses, the sea nations made good their cause. The war, which began with the French taking the offensive, ended by reducing them everywhere to the defensive, and forced Louis to do violence at once to his strongest prejudices and his most reasonable political wishes, by recognizing as king of England him whom he looked upon as a usurper as well as his own inveterate enemy.\n\nOn its surface, and taken as a whole, this war will appear almost wholly a land struggle, extending from the Spanish Netherlands down the line of the Rhine, to Savoy in Italy and Catalonia in Spain. The sea fights in the Channel, the Irish struggle receding in the distance, look like mere episodes; while the underlying action of trade and commerce is wholly disregarded, or noticed only as their outcries tell of their sufferings. Yet trade and shipping not only bore the burden of suffering, but in the main paid the armies that were fighting the French; and this turning of the stream of wealth from both sea nations into the coffers of their allies was perhaps determined, certainly hastened, by the misdirection of that naval supremacy with which France began the war. It was then possible, as it will usually be possible, for a really fine military navy of superior force to strike an overwhelming blow at a less ready rival; but the opportunity was allowed to slip, and the essentially stronger, better founded sea power of the allies had time to assert itself.\n\nThe peace signed at Ryswick in 1697 was most disadvantageous to France; she lost all that had been gained since the Peace of Nimeguen, nineteen years before, with the single important exception of Strasburg. All that Louis XIV. had gained by trick or force during the years of peace was given up. Immense restitutions were made to Germany and to Spain. In so far as the latter were made in the Netherlands, they were to the immediate advantage of the United Provinces, and indeed of all Europe as well as of Spain. To the two sea nations the terms of the treaty gave commercial benefits, which tended to the increase of their own sea power and to the consequent injury of that of France.",

    "text": "France had made a gigantic struggle; to stand alone as she did then, and as she has since done more than once, against all Europe is a great feat. Yet it may be said that as the United Provinces taught the lesson that a nation, however active and enterprising, cannot rest upon external resources alone, if intrinsically weak in numbers and territory, so France in its measure shows that a nation cannot subsist indefinitely off itself, however powerful in numbers and strong in internal resources. It is said that a friend once found Colbert looking dreamily from his windows, and on questioning him as to the subject of his meditations, received this reply: \"In contemplating the fertile fields before my eyes, I recall those which I have seen elsewhere; what a rich country is France!\" This conviction supported him amid the many discouragements of his official life, when struggling to meet the financial difficulties arising from the extravagance and wars of the king; and it has been justified by the whole course of the nation's history since his days. France is rich in natural resources as well as in the industry and thrift of her people. But neither individual nations nor men can thrive when severed from natural intercourse with their kind; whatever the native vigor of constitution, it requires healthful surroundings, and freedom to draw to itself from near and from far all that is conducive to its growth and strength and general welfare. Not only must the internal organism work satisfactorily, the processes of decay and renewal, of movement and circulation, go on easily, but, from sources external to themselves, both mind and body must receive healthful and varied nourishment. With all her natural gifts France wasted away because of the want of that lively intercourse between the different parts of her own body and constant exchange with other people, which is known as commerce, internal or external. To say that war was the cause of these defects is to state at least a partial truth; but it does not exhaust the matter. War, with its many acknowledged sufferings, is above all harmful when it cuts a nation off from others and throws it back upon itself. There may indeed be periods when such rude shocks have a bracing effect, but they are exceptional, and of short duration, and they do not invalidate the general statement. Such isolation was the lot of France during the later wars of Louis XIV., and it well-nigh destroyed her; whereas to save her from the possibility of such stagnation was the great aim of Colbert's life.\n\nWar alone could not entail it, if only war could be postponed until the processes of circulation within and without the kingdom were established and in vigorous operation. They did not exist when he took office; they had to be both created and firmly rooted in order to withstand the blast of war. Time was not given to accomplish this great work, nor did Louis XIV. support the schemes of his minister by turning the budding energies of his docile and devoted subjects into paths favorable to it. So when the great strain came upon the powers of the nation, instead of drawing strength from every quarter and through many channels, and laying the whole outside world under contribution by the energy of its merchants and seamen, as England has done in like straits, it was thrown back upon itself, cut off from the world by the navies of England and Holland, and the girdle of enemies which surrounded it upon the continent. The only escape from this process of gradual starvation was by an effectual control of the sea; the creation of a strong sea power which should insure free play for the wealth of the land and the industry of the people. For this, too, France had great natural advantages in her three seaboards, on the Channel, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean; and politically she had had the fair opportunity of joining to her own maritime power that of the Dutch in friendly alliance, hostile or at least wary toward England. In the pride of his strength, conscious of absolute control in his kingdom, Louis cast away this strong reinforcement to his power, and proceeded to rouse Europe against him by repeated aggressions. In the period which we have just considered, France justified his confidence by a magnificent, and upon the whole successful, maintenance of his attitude against all Europe; she did not advance, but neither did she greatly recede. But this display of power was exhausting; it ate away the life of the nation, because it drew wholly upon itself and not upon the outside world, with which it could have been kept in contact by the sea. In the war that next followed, the same energy is seen, but not the same vitality; and France was everywhere beaten back and brought to the verge of ruin. The lesson of both is the same; nations, like men, however strong, decay when cut off from the external activities and resources which at once draw out and support their internal powers. A nation, as we have already shown, cannot live indefinitely off itself, and the easiest way by which it can communicate with other peoples and renew its own strength is the sea.",

    "text": "During the last thirty years of the seventeenth century, amid all the strifes of arms and diplomacy, there had been clearly foreseen the coming of an event which would raise new and great issues. This was the failure of the direct royal line in that branch of the House of Austria which was then on the Spanish throne; and the issues to be determined when the present king, infirm both in body and mind, should die, were whether the new monarch was to be taken from the House of Bourbon or from the Austrian family in Germany; and whether, in either event, the sovereign thus raised to the throne should succeed to the entire inheritance, the Empire of Spain, or some partition of that vast inheritance be made in the interests of the balance of European power. But this balance of power was no longer understood in the narrow sense of continental possessions; the effect of the new arrangements upon commerce, shipping, and the control both of the ocean and the Mediterranean, was closely looked to. The influence of the two sea powers and the nature of their interests were becoming more evident.\n\nIt is necessary to recall the various countries that were ruled by Spain at that time in order to understand the strategic questions, as they may fairly be called, now to be settled. These were, in Europe, the Netherlands (now Belgium); Naples and the south of Italy; Milan and other provinces in the north; and, in the Mediterranean, Sicily, Sardinia, and the Balearic Isles. Corsica at that time belonged to Genoa. In the western hemisphere, besides Cuba and Porto Rico, Spain then held all that part of the continent now divided among the Spanish American States, a region whose vast commercial possibilities were coming to be understood; and in the Asian archipelago there were large possessions that entered less into the present dispute. The excessive weakness of this empire, owing to the decay of the central kingdom, had hitherto caused other nations, occupied as they were with more immediate interests, to regard with indifference its enormous extent. This indifference could not last when there was a prospect of a stronger administration, backed possibly by alliances with one of the great powers of Europe. It would be foreign to our subject to enter into the details of diplomatic arrangement, which, by shifting about peoples and territories from one ruler to another, sought to reach a political balance peacefully. The cardinal points of each nation's policy may be shortly stated. The Spanish cabinet and people objected to any solution which dismembered the empire. The English and the Dutch objected to any extension of France in the Spanish Netherlands, and to the monopoly by the French of the trade with Spanish America, both which they feared as the results of placing a Bourbon on the Spanish throne. Louis XIV. wanted Naples and Sicily for one of his sons, in case of any partition; thus giving France a strong Mediterranean position, but one which would be at the mercy of the sea powers, — a fact which induced William III. to acquiesce in this demand. The Emperor of Austria particularly objected to these Mediterranean positions going away from his family, and refused to come into any of the partition treaties. Before any arrangement was perfected, the actual king of Spain died, but before his death was induced by his ministers to sign a will, bequeathing all his States to the grandson of Louis XIV., then Duke of Anjou, known afterward as Philip V. of Spain. By this step it was hoped to preserve the whole, by enlisting in its defence the nearest and one of the most powerful States in Europe, — nearest, if are excepted the powers ruling the sea, which are always near any country whose ports are open to their ships.",

    "text": "By the treaty of alliance between England, Holland, and the emperor, the allies undertook to conquer the Spanish Netherlands to create a barrier between France and the United Provinces; to conquer Milan for the emperor's security; and to conquer Naples and Sicily for the same security, and also for the security of the navigation and commerce of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United Provinces. The sea powers would have the right to conquer, for the utility of the said navigation and commerce, the countries and towns of the Spanish Indies; and all that they should be able to take there should be for them and remain theirs. None of the allies could treat without the others, nor without having taken just measures — first, to prevent the kingdoms of France and Spain from ever being united under the same king; second, to prevent the French from ever making themselves masters of the Spanish Indies, or from sending ships thither to engage, directly or indirectly, in commerce; third, to secure to the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United Provinces the commercial privileges which they enjoyed in all the Spanish States under the late king.  These conditions suggest no intention to resist the accession of the Bourbon king, initially acknowledged by England and Holland. However, the Emperor of Austria does not withdraw the Austrian claim. The sea powers held paramount influence in the coalition, prioritizing their commercial interests, though German claims were considered due to reliance on German armies. This was effectively a new treaty of partition, aiming to reduce the new king, Philip V., to Spain proper, and to secure to England and Holland the commercial use of all the regions that had been under the Spanish monarchy, along with important military and maritime positions against France. Despite the imminent war, hesitation prevailed. Holland depended on England, and despite strong anti-French sentiment, the latter's manufacturers and merchants remembered the previous war's hardships.  The death of James II. and Louis XIV.'s recognition of his son as king of England fueled English outrage, leading to increased military and naval preparations.  Following William III.'s death, Queen Anne continued his policy.  Louis XIV.'s attempt to create a league of neutrals among German states was countered by the emperor, who elevated the Elector of Brandenburg to king of Prussia, consolidating Protestant states and creating a future rival to Austria.  France and Spain entered the war with Bavaria as their sole ally. War was declared in May by Holland and England against France and Spain, with the emperor declaring against the King of France and the Duke of Anjou, thus initiating the War of the Spanish Succession.",

    "text": "Disentangling the naval aspects of the War of the Spanish Succession from the broader narrative is challenging, yet crucial for understanding sea power's impact. William III.'s aim wasn't to dispute Philip V.'s claim but to seize portions of the Spanish American possessions for English and Dutch commerce, and impose conditions preventing commercial losses. This policy prioritized America over the Spanish peninsula. Subsequent events led to a shift, with the coalition backing Archduke Charles (Carlos III.) as a claimant in 1703, turning the peninsula into a major theatre and tying Anglo-Dutch fleets to its coasts. Consequently, actions in Spanish America diminished. This change resulted in England securing Gibraltar and Port Mahon, establishing it as a Mediterranean power.  The Methuen Treaty with Portugal granted England a trade monopoly, channeling Brazilian gold to London and bolstering war efforts and naval maintenance.  While French cruiser losses were heavy, they remained manageable due to increased English naval efficiency.  Initially, Sir George Rooke's expedition against Cadiz, aimed at disrupting Spanish-American trade, failed due to restrictive orders prioritizing Spanish conciliation. However, learning of the galleons' arrival at Vigo Bay, Rooke successfully captured or sank the ships and their cargo, significantly impacting the finances and prestige of France and Spain.  The Vigo incident had political ramifications, pushing Portugal, initially aligned with Philip V. due to fear of France, toward the coalition.  Portugal's proximity to the sea made it susceptible to the dominant naval power.  The arrival of Archduke Charles in Lisbon in 1704, following his proclamation in Vienna and recognition by England and Holland, cemented the coalition's commitment to a peninsular war, requiring the sea powers to shift their focus and protect commerce.",

    "text": "England's overwhelming sea power played a decisive role in the war's outcome and established its century-long maritime dominance. This dominance, characterized by constant pressure on enemy resources, support for land wars, and infrequent direct engagements, is evident throughout the war and subsequent decades. While crucial, its influence often goes unnoticed due to the lack of major naval battles.  With few exceptions like Byng's action at Minorca and Hawke's brilliant victory at Quiberon, significant naval clashes were rare between 1700 and 1778. Thus, the naval aspect of the War of the Spanish Succession is best understood through broad strokes, focusing on the fleet's overall impact rather than specific narratives.  The navies' primary role was protecting allied commerce, ensuring the flow of subsidies that fueled the land war.  In the Spanish peninsula, their involvement was more direct. After landing Carlos III. in Lisbon, Rooke sailed for Barcelona, expecting its surrender, but was met with resistance. He then headed towards Toulon, encountering and chasing a French fleet from Brest without success.  Both French fleets then entered the Mediterranean, one under the Count of Toulouse, the other under the Count of D'Estrées, uniting and anchoring at Toulon.  Rooke blockaded them but ultimately withdrew due to unfavorable winds and supply shortages. This allowed the French fleets to combine with a Spanish squadron, creating a significant force that posed a threat to allied operations. Following Rooke's failure at Barcelona, the allied fleet proceeded to Gibraltar under the command of Sir George Rooke. On August 3, 1704, after limited bombardment, the fortress fell to the Allied forces.",

    "text": "The enemy's squadrons were united in the port. It is worth noting that the English navy did not yet attempt to blockade French ports in winter. At this period, fleets, like armies, went into winter quarters.  Another English admiral, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, had been sent to blockade Brest, but arrived too late. Rooke, not feeling strong enough to resist the combined French squadrons, fell back toward the Straits. England had no ports, base, or useful ally in the Mediterranean; Lisbon was the nearest refuge.  Rooke and Shovel met off Lagos and held a council of war. Rooke, the senior officer, declared his instructions forbade action without consent of the Spanish and Portuguese kings.  Chafing at inaction, Rooke decided to attack Gibraltar for three reasons: it was insufficiently garrisoned, it was a crucial port for the war, and its capture would bring credit to the queen's arms.  Gibraltar was attacked, bombarded, and taken by assault. English possession dates from August 4, 1704, thanks to Rooke's judgment and fearlessness. The Bourbon king of Spain immediately attempted to retake Gibraltar, calling upon the French fleet in Toulon for support.  Tourville had died, and the fleet was now commanded by the Count of Toulouse. Rooke sailed eastward, and the fleets met off Velez Malaga on August 24th. The allies were to windward.  There is uncertainty about numbers, but the French had fifty-two ships-of-the-line, their enemy likely half a dozen more. The battle of Malaga has no military interest except that it showcases the unscientific English attack method criticized by Clerk, which prevailed throughout the century. The result was the same as in all others fought on this principle. The van opened out from the center, and the French attempted to penetrate this gap.  The battle, lasting from ten to five, was indecisive. The next day, the wind shifted, giving the French the weather-gage, but they did not attack. Rooke could not have fought; half his fleet had exhausted its ammunition due to the Gibraltar attack and lack of a supply base, a deficiency Gibraltar would remedy. Rooke's seizure of Gibraltar mirrored the United States seizing Port Royal in the Civil War and the Duke of Parma's advice to seize Flushing before the Spanish Armada.  Rooke retired to Lisbon, supplying Gibraltar with victuals and ammunition. Toulouse returned to Toulon, sending only ten ships to support the Gibraltar attack.  The French attacks were futile; the squadron was destroyed, and the land attack became a blockade. This reverse marked a decline in French popular support for the navy, overshadowed by the army.",

In Catalonia, Carlos III. arrived with the allied fleet. The French navy, outnumbered, stayed in port. Allied troops, aided by seamen and supplied by the fleet, besieged Barcelona, which surrendered on October 9th. Catalonia welcomed Carlos, and the movement spread to Aragon and Valencia.

Without the allied fleet and its supplies, resistance was weak, and Barcelona was besieged again, this time with French naval support.  On May 10th, the allied fleet appeared, the French ships retreated, and the siege was lifted.  The Bourbon claimant fled to France, leaving his rival in possession. Another army advanced from Portugal, maintained by sea-borne subsidies.  This western attack was more successful, capturing cities in Estremadura and Leon.  Learning of the lifted siege of Barcelona, the allies advanced to Madrid, which Philip V. abandoned.  The allied fleet seized Alicante and Cartagena.  Despite these successes, the allies misjudged Spanish resolve and national pride. Hatred for the Portuguese and heretics was aroused. Madrid and the south remained loyal to the Bourbon king.  Unable to hold the hostile capital, the allies retreated eastward towards Aragon.  On April 25th, 1707, the allied army suffered a disastrous defeat at Almansa.  All Spain, except Catalonia, returned to Philip V.'s control. In 1708, the French made gains in Catalonia but couldn't attack Barcelona. Valencia and Alicante were reduced.",

In the following years, British sea power played a less obtrusive but still vital role.  The Austrian claimant in Catalonia was kept supplied by the English fleet.  The disappearance of the French navy allowed for reduced Mediterranean deployments and increased trade protection.  In 1710 and 1711, expeditions targeted French colonies in North America.

    "text": "His loss of favor with the queen was followed by the accession to power of the party opposed to the war, or rather to its further continuance. This change took place in the summer of 1710, and the inclination toward peace was strengthened both by the favorable position in which England then stood for treating, and by the heavy burden she was bearing; which it became evident could bring in no further advantages commensurate to its weight. The weaker ally, Holland, had gradually ceased to contribute her stipulated share to the sea forces; and although far-sighted Englishmen might see with complacency the disappearance of a rival sea power, the immediate increase of expense was more looked to and felt by the men of the day. The cost both of the continental and Spanish wars was also largely defrayed by England's subsidies; and while that on the continent could bring her no further gain, it was seen that the sympathies of the Spanish people could not be overborne in favor of Carlos III without paying more than the game was worth. Secret negotiations between England and France soon began, and received an additional impulse by the unexpected death of the Emperor of Germany, the brother of the Austrian claimant of the Spanish throne. There being no other male heir, Carlos became at once emperor of Austria, and was soon after elected emperor of Germany. England had no more wish to see two crowns on an Austrian head than on that of a Bourbon. The demands made by England, as conditions of peace in 1711, showed her to have become a sea power in the purest sense of the word, not only in fact, but also in her own consciousness. She required that the same person should never be king both of France and Spain; that a barrier of fortified towns should be granted her allies, Holland and Germany, as a defensive line against France; that French conquests from her allies should be restored; and for herself she demanded the formal cession of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, whose strategic and maritime value has been pointed out, the destruction of the port of Dunkirk, the home nest of the privateers that preyed on English commerce, the cession of the French colonies of Newfoundland, Hudson's Bay, and Nova Scotia, the last of which she held at that time, and finally, treaties of commerce with France and Spain, and the concession of the monopoly of the slave trade with Spanish America, known as the Asiento, which Spain had given to France in 1701.",

    "text": "Negotiations continued, though hostilities did not cease; and in June, 1712, a four months' truce between Great Britain and France removed the English troops from the allied armies on the continent, their great leader Marlborough having been taken from their head the year before. The campaign of 1712 was favorable to France; but in almost any event the withdrawal of Great Britain made the end of the war a question of but a short time. The remonstrances of Holland were met by the reply that since 1707 the Dutch had not furnished more than one third their quota of ships, and taking the war through, not over one half.  The House of Commons in an address to the throne in 1712 complained that the service at sea had been carried on disadvantageously to Great Britain, requiring large fleets for the Mediterranean and to counter French forces, while Holland had been deficient in its naval contributions, forcing Britain to compensate and straining her resources.  In fact, between 1701 and 1716 the commerce of Spanish America had brought into France forty million dollars in specie.  To these complaints the Dutch envoy to England could only reply that Holland was not in a condition to fulfil her compacts. The reverses of 1712, added to Great Britain's fixed purpose to have peace, decided the Dutch to the same; and the English still kept, amid their dissatisfaction with their allies, so much of their old feeling against France as to support all the reasonable claims of Holland. April 11, 1713, an almost general peace, known as the Peace of Utrecht, one of the landmarks of history, was signed between France on the one hand, and England, Holland, Prussia, Portugal, and Savoy on the other. The emperor still held out, but the loss of British subsidies fettered the movements of his armies, and with the withdrawal of the sea powers the continental war might have fallen of itself; but France with her hands freed carried on during 1713 a brilliant and successful campaign in Germany. On the 7th of March, 1714, peace was signed between France and Austria. Some embers of the war continued to burn in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, which persisted in their rebellion against Philip V.; but the revolt was stifled as soon as the arms of France were turned against them. Barcelona was taken by storm in September, 1714; the islands submitted in the following summer.",

    "text": "The changes effected by this long war and sanctioned by the peace, neglecting details of lesser or passing importance, may be stated as follows: 1. The House of Bourbon was settled on the Spanish throne, and the Spanish empire retained its West Indian and American possessions; the purpose of William III. against her dominion there was frustrated when England undertook to support the Austrian prince, and so fastened the greater part of her naval force to the Mediterranean. 2. The Spanish empire lost its possessions in the Netherlands, Gelderland going to the new kingdom of Prussia and Belgium to the emperor; the Spanish Netherlands thus became the Austrian Netherlands. 3. Spain lost also the principal islands of the Mediterranean; Sardinia being given to Austria, Minorca with its fine harbor to Great Britain, and Sicily to the Duke of Savoy. 4. Spain lost also her Italian possessions, Milan and Naples going to the emperor. Such, in the main, were the results to Spain of the fight over the succession to her throne. France, the backer of the successful claimant, came out of the strife worn out, and with considerable loss of territory. She had succeeded in placing a king of her own royal house on a neighboring throne, but her sea strength was exhausted, her population diminished, her financial condition ruined. The European territory surrendered was on her northern and eastern boundaries; and she abandoned the use of the port of Dunkirk, the centre of that privateering warfare so dreaded by English merchants. In America, the cession of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was the first step toward that entire loss of Canada which befell half a century later; but for the present she retained Cape Breton Island, with its port Louisburg, the key to the Gulf and River St. Lawrence. The gains of England, by the treaty and the war, corresponded very nearly to the losses of France and Spain, and were all in the direction of extending and strengthening her sea power. Gibraltar and Port Mahon in the Mediterranean, and the colonies already mentioned in North America, afforded new bases to that power, extending and protecting her trade. Second only to the expansion of her own was the injury to the sea power of France and Holland, by the decay of their navies in consequence of the immense drain of the land warfare; further indications of that decay will be given later. The very neglect of Holland to fill up her quota of ships, and the bad condition of those sent, while imposing extra burdens upon England, may be considered a benefit, forcing the British navy to greater development and effort. The disproportion in military power on the sea was further increased by the destruction of the works at Dunkirk; for though not in itself a first-class port, nor of much depth of water, it had great artificial military strength, and its position was peculiarly adapted to annoy English trade. It was but forty miles from the South Foreland and the Downs, and the Channel abreast it is but twenty miles wide. Dunkirk was one of Louis' earliest acquisitions, and in its development was as his own child; the dismantling of the works and filling-in of the port show the depth of his humiliation at this time. But it was the wisdom of England not to base her sea power solely on military positions nor even on fighting-ships, and the commercial advantages she had now gained by the war and the peace were very great. The grant of the slave trade with Spanish America, in itself lucrative, became yet more so as the basis for an immense smuggling intercourse with those countries, which gave the English a partial recompense for their failure to obtain actual possession; while the cessions made to Portugal by France in South America were mainly to the advantage of England, which had obtained the control of Portuguese trade by the treaty of 1703. The North American colonies ceded were valuable, not merely nor chiefly as military stations, but commercially; and treaties of commerce on favorable terms were made both with France and Spain. A minister of the day, defending the treaty in Parliament, said: \"The advantages from this peace appear in the addition made to our wealth; in the great quantities of bullion lately coined in our mint; by the vast increase in our shipping employed since the peace, in the fisheries, and in merchandise; and by the remarkable growth of the customs upon imports, and of our manufactures, and the growth of our country upon export;\" in a word, by the impetus to trade in all its branches.",

    "text": "While England thus came out from the war in good running condition, and fairly placed in that position of maritime supremacy which she has so long maintained, her old rival in trade and fighting was left hopelessly behind. As the result of the war Holland obtained nothing at sea, — no colony, no station. The commercial treaty with France placed her on the same terms as England, but she received no concessions giving her a footing in Spanish America like that obtained by her ally. Indeed, some years before the peace, while the coalition was still maintaining Carlos, a treaty was made with the latter by the British minister, unknown to the Dutch, practically giving the British monopoly of Spanish trade in America; sharing it only with Spaniards, which was pretty much the same as not sharing it at all. This treaty accidentally became known, and made a great impression on the Dutch; but England was then so necessary to the coalition that she ran no risk of being left out by its other members. The gain which Holland made by land was that of military occupation only, of certain fortified places in the Austrian Netherlands, known to history as the \"barrier towns;\" nothing was added by them to her revenue, population, or resources; nothing to that national strength which must underlie military institutions. Holland had forsaken, perhaps unavoidably, the path by which she had advanced to wealth and to leadership among nations. The exigencies of her continental position had led to the neglect of her navy, which in those days of war and privateering involved a loss of carrying-trade and commerce; and although she held her head high through the war, the symptoms of weakness were apparent in her failing armaments. Therefore, though the United Provinces attained the great object for which they began the war, and saved the Spanish Netherlands from the hands of France, the success was not worth the cost. Thenceforth they withdrew for a long period from the wars and diplomacy of Europe; partly, perhaps, because they saw how little they had gained, but yet more from actual weakness and inability. After the strenuous exertions of the war came a reaction, which showed painfully the inherent weakness of a State narrow in territory and small in the number of its people. The visible decline of the Provinces dates from the Peace of Utrecht; the real decline began earlier. Holland ceased to be numbered among the great powers of Europe, her navy was no longer a military factor in diplomacy, and her commerce also shared in the general decline of the State. It remains only to notice briefly the results to Austria, and to Germany generally. France yielded the barrier of the Rhine, with fortified places on the east bank of the river. Austria received, as has been mentioned, Belgium, Sardinia, Naples, and the Spanish possessions in northern Italy; dissatisfied in other respects, Austria was especially discontented at her failure to obtain Sicily, and did not cease negotiating afterward, until she had secured that island. A circumstance more important to Germany and to all Europe than this transitory acquisition of distant and alien countries by Austria was the rise of Prussia, which dates from this war as a Protestant and military kingdom destined to weigh in the balance against Austria. Such were the leading results of the War of the Spanish Succession, \"the vastest yet witnessed by Europe since the Crusades.\" It was a war whose chief military interest was on the land, — a war in which fought two of the greatest generals of all times, Marlborough and Prince…",

On the sea only one great battle, and that scarcely worthy of the name, took place. Yet looking only, for the moment, to immediate and evident results, who reaped the benefit? Was it France, whose only gain was to seat a Bourbon on the Spanish throne? Was it Spain, whose only gain was to have a Bourbon king instead of an Austrian, and thus a closer alliance with France? Was it Holland, with its barrier of fortified towns, its ruined navy, and its exhausted people? Was it, lastly, Austria, even though she had fought with the money of the sea powers, and gained such maritime States as the Netherlands and Naples? Was it with these, who had waged war more and more exclusively by land, and set their eyes more and more on gains on the land, or was it not rather with England, who had indeed paid for that continental war and even backed it with her troops, but who meanwhile was building up her navy, strengthening, extending, and protecting her commerce, seizing maritime positions, — in a word, founding and rearing her sea power upon the ruins of that of her rivals, friend and foe alike? It is not to depreciate the gains of others that the eye fixes on England's naval growth; their gains but bring out more clearly the immenseness of hers. It was a gain to France to have a friend rather than an enemy in her rear, though her navy and shipping were ruined. It was a gain to Spain to be brought in close intercourse with a living country like France after a century of political death, and she had saved the greater part of her threatened possessions. It was a gain to Holland to be definitively freed from French aggression, with Belgium in the hands of a strong instead of a weak State. And it doubtless was a gain to Austria not only to have checked, chiefly at the expense of others, the progress of her hereditary enemy, but also to have received provinces like Sicily and Naples, which, under wise government, might become the foundation of a respectable sea power.",

    "text": "But not one of these gains, nor all together, compared in greatness, and much less in solidity, with the gain to England of that unequalled sea power which started ahead during the War of the League of Augsburg, and received its completeness and seal during that of the Spanish Succession. By it she controlled the great commerce of the open sea with a military shipping that had no rival, and in the exhausted condition of the other nations could have none; and that shipping was now securely based on strong positions in all the disputed quarters of the world. Although her Indian empire was not yet begun, the vast superiority of her navy would enable her to control the communications of other nations with those rich and distant regions, and to assert her will in any disputes arising among the trading-stations of the different nationalities. The commerce which had sustained her in prosperity, and her allies in military efficiency, during the war, though checked and harassed by the enemy's cruisers (to which she could pay only partial attention amid the many claims upon her), started with a bound into new life when the war was over. All over the world, exhausted by their share of the common suffering, people were longing for the return of prosperity and peaceful commerce; and there was no country ready as England was in wealth, capital, and shipping to forward and reap the advantages of every enterprise by which the interchange of commodities was promoted, either by lawful or unlawful means. In the War of the Spanish Succession, by her own wise management and through the exhaustion of other nations, not only her navy but her trade was steadily built up; and indeed, in that dangerous condition of the seas, traversed by some of the most reckless and restless cruisers France ever sent out, the efficiency of the navy meant safer voyages, and so more employment for the merchant-ships. The British merchant-ships, being better protected than those of the Dutch, gained the reputation of being far safer carriers, and the carrying-trade naturally passed more and more into their hands; while the habit of employing them in preference, once established, was likely to continue. \"Taking all things together,\" says an historian of the British navy, \" I doubt whether the credit of the English nation ever stood higher than at this period, or the spirit of the people higher. The success of our arms at sea, the necessity of protecting our trade, and the popularity of every step taken to increase our maritime power, occasioned such measures to be pursued as annually added to our force.",

    "text": "Hence arose that mighty difference which at the close of the year 1706 appeared in the Royal Navy; this, not only in the number but in the quality of the ships, was much superior to what it had been at the time of the Revolution or even before. Hence it was that our trade rather increased than diminished during the last war, and that we gained so signally by our strict intercourse with Portugal.\" ^ The sea power of England therefore was not merely in the great navy, with which we too commonly and exclusively associate it; France had had such a navy in 1688, and it shrivelled away like a leaf in the fire. Neither was it in a prosperous commerce alone; a few years after the date at which we have arrived, the commerce of France took on fair proportions, but the first blast of war swept it off the seas as the navy of Cromwell had once swept that of Holland. It was in the union of the two, carefully fostered, that England made the gain of sea power over and beyond all other States; and this gain is distinctly associated with and dates from the War of the Spanish Succession. Before that war England was one of the sea powers; after it she was the sea power, without any second. This power also she held alone, unshared by friend and unchecked by foe. She alone was rich, and in her control of the sea and her extensive shipping had the sources of wealth so much in her hands that there was no present danger of a rival on the ocean. Thus her gain of sea power and wealth was not only great but solid, being wholly in her own hands; while the gains of the other States were not merely inferior in degree, but weaker in kind, in that they depended more or less upon the good will of other peoples. Is it meant, it maybe asked, to attribute to sea power alone the greatness or wealth of any State? Certainly not. The due use and control of the sea is but one link in the chain of exchange by which wealth accumulates; but it is the central link, which lays under contribution other nations for the benefit of the one holding it, and which, history seems to assert, most surely of all gathers to itself riches. In England, this control and use of the sea seems to arise naturally, from the concurrence of many circumstances; the years immediately preceding the War of the Spanish Succession had, moreover, furthered the advance of her prosperity by a series of fiscal measures, which Macaulay speaks of as \" the deep and solid foundation on which was to rise the most gigantic fabric of commercial prosperity which the world had ever seen.\" It may be questioned, however, whether the genius of the people, inclined to and developed by trade, did not make easier the taking of such measures; whether their adoption did not at least partially spring from, as well as add to, the sea power of the nation.",

    "text": "However that may be, there is seen, on the opposite side of the Channel, a nation which started ahead of England in the race, — a nation peculiarly well fitted, by situation and resources, for the control of the sea both by war and commerce. The position of France is in this peculiar, that of all the great powers she alone had a free choice; the others were more or less constrained to the land chiefly, or to the sea chiefly, for any movement outside their own borders; but she to her long continental frontier added a seaboard on three seas. In 1672 she definitely chose expansion by land. At that time Colbert had administered her finances for twelve years, and from a state of terrible confusion had so restored them that the revenue of the King of France was more than double that of the King of England. In those days France paid the subsidies of Europe; but Colbert's plans and hopes for France rested upon making her powerful on the sea. The war with Holland arrested these plans, the onward movement of prosperity ceased, the nation was thrown back upon itself, shut off from the outside world. Many causes doubtless worked together to the disastrous result which marked the end of the reign of Louis XIV.: constant wars, bad administration in the latter half of the period, extravagance throughout; but France was practically never invaded, the war was kept at or beyond her own frontiers with slight exceptions, her home industries could suffer little from direct hostilities. In these respects she was nearly equal to England, and under better conditions than her other enemies. What made the difference in the results? Why was France miserable and exhausted, while England was smiling and prosperous? Why did England dictate, and France accept, terms of peace? The reason apparently was the difference in wealth and credit. France stood alone against many enemies; but those enemies were raised and kept moving by English subsidies. The Lord Treasurer of England, writing in 1706 to Marlborough, says: — \" Though the land and trade of both England and Holland have excessive burdens upon them, yet the credit continues good both of them and us; whereas the finances of France are so much more exhausted that they are forced to give twenty and twenty-five per cent for every penny they send out of the kingdom, unless they send it in specie.\"",

Jean Bart died in 1702 ; but in Forbin, Du Casse, and others, and above all in Duguay-Trouin, he left worthy successors, the equals of any commerce-destroyers the world has ever seen. The name of Duguay-Trouin suggests the mention, before finally leaving the War of the Spanish Succession, of his greatest privateering expedition, carried to a distance from home rarely reached by the seamen of his occupation, and which illustrates curiously the spirit of such enterprises in that day, and the shifts to which the French government was reduced. A small French squadron had attacked Rio Janeiro in 1710, but being repulsed, had lost some prisoners, who were said to have been put to death. Duguay-Trouin sought permission to avenge the insult to France. The king, con- senting, advanced the ships and furnished the crews ; and a regular contract was drawn up between the king on the one hand and the company employing Duguay-Trouin on the other, stipulating the expenses to be borne and supplies fur- nished on either hand ; among which we find the odd, busi- ness-like provision that for every one of the troops embarked who shall die, be killed, or desert during the cruise, the company should pay a forfeit of thirty francs. The king was to receive one fifth of the net profits, and was to bear the loss of any one of the vessels that should be wrecked, or destroyed in action. Under these provisions, enumerated in full in a long contract, Duguay-Trouin received a force of six ships-of-the-line, seven frigates, and over two thousand troops, with which he sailed to Rio Janeiro in 1711 ; captured the place after a series of operations, and allowed it to be ransomed at the price of something under four hundred thou- sand dollars, probably nearly equal to a million in the present day, besides five hundred cases of sugar. The privateering company cleared about ninety-two per cent on their venture. As two of the ships-of-the-line were never heard from after WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND SWEDEN. 231 sailing on the return voyage, the king's profits were probably small. While the War of the Spanish Succession was engao-ino - all western Europe, a strife which might have had a profound influence upon its issue was going on in the east. Sweden and Russia were at war, the Hungarians had revolted against Austria, and Turkey was finally drawn in, though not till the end of the year 1710. Had Turkey helped the Hun- garians, she would have made a powerful diversion, not for the first time in history, in favor of France. The English historian suggests that she was deterred by fear of the English fleet ; at all events she did not move, and Hungary was reduced to obedience. The war between Sweden and Russia was to result in the preponderance of the latter upon the Baltic, the subsidence of Sweden, the old ally of France, into a second-rate State, and the entrance of Russia defini- tively into European politics.",

The Regency in France. — Alberoni in Spain. — Policies of Walpole and Fleuri. — War of the Polish Succession. — English Contraband Trade in Spanish America. — Great Britain declares War against Spain. — 1715-1739. nr^HE Peace of Utrecht was soon followed by the deaths -*- of the rulers of the two countries which had played the foremost part in the War of the Spanish Succession. Queen Anne died August 1, 1714 ; Louis XIV. on the 1st of September, 1715. The successor to the English throne, the German George I., though undoubtedly the choice of the English people, was far from being their favorite, and was rather endured as a necessary evil, giving them a Protestant instead of a Roman Catholic king. Along with the coldness and dislike of his own partisans, he found a very considerable body of dis- affected men, who wished to see the son of James II. on the throne. There was therefore a lack of solidity, more ap- parent than real, but still real, in his position. In France, on the contrary, the succession to the throne was undis- puted ; but the heir was a child of five years, and there was much jealousy as to the possession of the regency, a power more absolute than that of the King of England. The re- gency was obtained and exercised by the next in succession to the throne, Philip, Duke of Orleans ; but he had to appre- hend, not only attempts on the part of rivals in France to shake his hold, but also the active enmity of the Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V., — an enmity which seems to have dated from an intrigue of Orleans, during the late war, to supplant Philip on the Spanish throne. There was therefore POLICY OF THE REGENT. 233 a feeling of instability, of apprehension, in the governments of England and France, which influenced the policy of both. As regards the relations of France and Spain, the mutual hatred of the actual rulers stood for a while in the way of the friendly accord Louis XIV. had hoped from family ties, and was injurious to the true interests of both nations. The Regent Orleans, mider the advice of the most able and celebrated French statesman of that day, the Abbd Dubois, made overtures of alliance to the King of Great Britain. He began first by commercial concessions of the kind generally acceptable to the English, forbidding French shipping to trade to the South Seas under penalty of death, and lowering the duties on the importation of English coal. England at first received these advances warily ; but the regent would not be discouraged, and offered, further, to compel the Pretender, James III., to withdraw beyond the Alps. He also undertook to fill up the port at Mardyck, a new excavation by which the French government was trying to indemnify itself for the loss of Dunkirk. These concessions, all of which but one, it will be noted, were at the expense of the sea power or commercial interests of France, induced England to sign a treaty by which the two countries mutually guaranteed the execution of the treaties of Utrecht as far as their respective interests were concerned ; especially the clause by which the House of Orleans was to succeed to the French throne, if Louis XV. died childless. The Protestant succession in England was likewise guaranteed. Holland, exhausted by tlie war, was unwilling to enter upon new engagements, but was at last brought over to this by the remission of certain dues on her merchandise entering France. The treaty, signed in Jauu- ary, 1717, was known as the Triple Alliance, and bound France to England for some years to come. While France was thus making overtures to England, Spain, under the guidance of another able churchman, was seeking the same alliance and at the same time developing her national strength with the hope of recovering her lost Italian States. The new minister, Cardinal Alberoni, promised 234 ALLIANCE OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Philip V. to put him in a position to reconquer Sicily and Naples, if granted five years of peace. He worked hard to bring up the revenues, rebuild the navy, and re-establish the army, while at the same time promoting manufactures, commerce, and shipping, and the advance made in all these was remarkable ; but the more legitimate ambition of Spain to recover her lost possessions, and with them to establish her power in the Mediterranean, so grievously wounded by the loss of Gibraltar, was hampered by the ill-timed purpose of Philip to overthrow the regency of Orleans in France. Alberoni was compelled to alienate France, whose sea power, as well as that of Spain, was concerned in seeing Sicily in friendly hands, and, instead of that natural ally, had to conciliate the maritime powers, England and Holland. This he also sought to do by commercial concessions ; promising promptly to put the English in possession of the privileges granted at Utrecht, concerning which Spain had so far delayed. In return, he asked favorable action from them in Italy. George L, wdio was at heart German, received coldly advances which were unfriendly to the German em- peror in his Italian dominions ; and Alberoni, offended, with- drew them. The Triple Alliance, by guaranteeing the exist- ing arrangement of succession to the French throne, gave further offence to Philip V., who dreamed of asserting his own claim. The result of all these negotiations was to bind England and France together against Spain, — a blind policy for the two Bourbon kingdoms. The gist of the situation created by these different aims and feelings, was that the Emperor of Austria and the King of Spain both wanted Sicily, which at Utrecht had been given to the Duke of Savoy ; and that France and England both wished for peace in western Europe, because war would give an opportunity to the malcontents in either kingdom. The position of George, however, being more secure than that of Orleans, the policy of the latter tended to yield to that of the former, and this tendency was increased by the active ill-will of the King of Spain. George, as a German, THE SPANIARDS INVADE SARDINIA. 235 wished the emperor's success ; and the English statesmen naturally preferred to see Sicily in the hands of their late ally and well-assured friend rather than in Spain's. France, contrary to her true policy, but under the urgency of the regent's position, entertained the same views, and it was proposed to modify the Treaty of Utrecht by transferring Sicily from Savoy to Austria, giving the former Sardinia instead. It was necessary, however, to consider Spain, which under Alberoni had already gained a degree of mili- tary power astounding to those who had known her weakness during the last war. She was not yet ready to light, for only half of the five years asked by the cardinal had passed ; but still less was she ready to forego her ambitions. A trifling incident precipitated an outbreak. A high Spanish official, travelling from Rome to Spain by land, and so passing through the Italian States of the emperor, was arrested as a rebellious subject by order of the latter, who still styled himself King of Spain. At this insult, Alberoni could not hold Philip back. An expedition of twelve ships of war and eighty-six hundred soldiers was sent against Sardinia, the transfer to Savoy not having yet taken effect, and reduced the island in a few months. This happened in 1717. Doubtless the Spaniards would at once have moved on against Sicily ; but France and England now intervened more actively to prevent the general war that seemed threaten- ing. England sent a fleet to the Mediterranean, and negotia- tions began at Paris, Vienna, and Madrid. The outcome of these conferences was an agreement between England and France to effect the exchange of Sardinia and Sicily just mentioned, recompensing Spain by giving her Parma and Tuscany in northern Italy, and stipulating that the emperor should renounce forever his absurd but irritating claim to the Spanish crown. This arrangement was to be enforced by arms, if necessary. The emperor at first refused consent ; but the increasing greatness of Alberoni's preparations at last decided him to accept so advantageous an offer, and the accession of Holland to the compact gave it the historical 236 SPANISH INVASION OF SICILY. title of the Quadruple Alliance. Spain M'as obstinate ; and it is sij^nificant of Alberoni's achievements in developing her power, and the eagerness, not to say anxiety, of George I.",

    "text": "If the Regent Orleans knew this, it would partly justify his forwarding the negotiations. Alberoni tried to back up his military power by diplomatic efforts extending all over Europe. Russia and Sweden were brought together in a project for invading England in the interest of the Stuarts; the signing of the Quadruple Alliance in Holland was delayed by his agents; a conspiracy was started in France against the regent; the Turks were stirred up against the emperor; discontent was fomented throughout Great Britain; and an attempt was made to gain over the Duke of Savoy, outraged by being deprived of Sicily. On the 1st of July, 1718, a Spanish army of thirty thousand troops, escorted by twenty-two ships-of-the-line, appeared at Palermo. The troops of Savoy evacuated the city and pretty nearly the whole island, resistance being concentrated in the citadel of Messina. Anxiety was felt in Naples itself, until the English admiral, Byng, anchored there the day after the investment of Messina. The King of Sicily having now consented to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance, Byng received on board two thousand Austrian troops to be landed at Messina. When he appeared before the place, finding it besieged, he wrote to the Spanish general suggesting a suspension of arms for two months. This was of course refused; so the Austrians were landed again at Reggio, in Italy, and Byng passed through the Straits of Messina to seek the Spanish fleet, which had gone to the southward. The engagement which ensued can scarcely be called a battle, and, as is apt to happen in such affairs, when the parties are on the verge of war but war has not actually been declared, there is some doubt as to how far the attack was morally justifiable on the part of the English. It seems pretty sure that Byng was determined beforehand to seize or destroy the Spanish fleet, and that as a military man he was justified by his orders. The Spanish naval officers had not made up their minds to any line of conduct; they were much inferior in numbers, and, as must always be the case, Alberoni's hastily revived navy had not within the same period reached nearly the efficiency of his army. The English approached threateningly near, one or more Spanish ships opened fire, whereupon the English, being to windward, stood down and made an end of them; a few only escaped into Valetta harbor. The Spanish navy was practically annihilated.",

    "text": "It is difficult to understand the importance attached by some writers to Byng's action at this time in attacking without regard to the line-of-battle. He had before him a disorderly force, much inferior both in numbers and discipline. His merit seems rather to lie in the readiness to assume a responsibility from which a more scrupulous man might have shrunk; but in this and throughout the campaign he rendered good service to England, whose sea power was again strengthened by the destruction not of an actual but a possible rival, and his services were rewarded by a peerage. [...] Thus the Spanish navy was struck down on the 11th of August, 1718, off Cape Passaro. This settled the fate of Sicily, if it had been doubtful before. The English fleet cruised round the island, supporting the Austrians and isolating the Spaniards, none of whom were permitted to withdraw before peace was made.  Alberoni's diplomatic projects failed one after the other, with a strange fatality. In the following year the French, in pursuance of the terms of the alliance, invaded the north of Spain and destroyed the dock-yards; burning nine large ships on the stocks, besides the materials for seven more, at the instigation of an English attaché accompanying the French headquarters. Thus was completed the destruction of the Spanish navy, which, says an English historian, was ascribed to the maritime jealousy of England.  [...] The steady stream of reverses, and the hopelessness of contending for distant maritime possessions when without a navy, broke down the resistance of Spain. England and France insisted upon the dismissal of Alberoni, and Philip yielded to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance. The Austrian power, necessarily friendly to England, was thus firmly settled in the central Mediterranean, in Naples and Sicily, as England herself was in Gibraltar and Port Mahon. [...] Contemporaneously with and for some time after the short episode of Alberoni's ministry and Spain's ambition, a struggle was going on around the shores of the Baltic which must be mentioned, because it gave rise to another effectual illustration of the sea power of England, manifested alike in the north and south with a slightness of exertion which calls to mind the stories of the tap of a tiger's paw. [...] The czar in alarm withdrew his fleet. This happened in 1719; but Peter, though baffled, was not yet subdued. The following year the interposition of England was repeated with greater effect, although not in time to save the Swedish coasts from serious injury; but the czar, recognizing the fixed purpose with which he had to deal, and knowing from personal observation and practical experience the efficiency of England's sea power, consented finally to peace.",

    "text": "By this Peace of Nystadt, August 30, 1721, Sweden abandoned Livonia, Esthonia, and other provinces on the east side of the Baltic. This result was inevitable; it was yearly becoming less possible for small States to hold their own. It can readily be understood that Spain was utterly discontented with the terms wrung from her by the Quadruple Alliance. The twelve years which followed are called years of peace, but the peace was very uncertain, and fraught with elements of future wars. The three great grievances rankling with Spain were — Sicily and Naples in the possession of Austria, Gibraltar and Mahon in the hands of England, and lastly, the vast contraband trade carried on by English merchants and ships in Spanish America. It will be seen that England was the active supporter of all these injuries; England therefore was the special enemy of Spain, but Spain was not the only enemy of England. The quiet, such as it was, that succeeded the fall of Alberoni was due mainly to the character and policy of the two ministers of France and England, who agreed in wishing a general peace. The policy and reasons of the French regent are already known. Moved by the same reasons, and to remove an accidental offence taken by England, Dubois obtained for her the further concession from Spain, additional to the commercial advantages granted at Utrecht, of sending a ship every year to trade in the West Indies. It is said that this ship, after being anchored, was kept continually supplied by others, so that fresh cargo came in over one side as fast as the old was sent ashore from the other. Dubois and the regent both died in the latter half of 1723, after an administration of eight years, in which they had reversed the policy of Richelieu by alliance with England and Austria and sacrificing to them the interests of France. The regency and the nominal government of France passed to another member of the royal family; but the real ruler was Cardinal Fleuri, the preceptor of the young king, who was now thirteen years of age. Efforts to displace the preceptor resulted only in giving him the title, as well as the power, of minister in 1726. At this time Sir Robert Walpole had become prime minister of England, with an influence and power which gave him practically the entire guidance of the policy of the State. The chief wish of both Walpole and Fleuri was peace, above all in western Europe. France and England therefore continued to act together for that purpose, and though they could not entirely stifle every murmur, they were for several years successful in preventing outbreaks. But while the aims of the two ministers were thus agreed, the motives which inspired them were different. Walpole desired peace because of the still unsettled condition of the English succession; for the peaceful growth of English commerce, which he had ever before his eyes; and probably also because his spirit, impatient of equals in the government, shrank from war which would raise up stronger men around him. Fleuri, reasonably secure as to the throne and his own power, wished like Walpole the peaceful development of his country, and shrank from war with the love of repose natural to old age; for he was seventy-three when he took office, and ninety when he laid it down in death. Under his mild administration the prosperity of France revived; the passing traveller could note the change in the face of the country and of the people; yet it may be doubted whether this change was due to the government of the quiet old man, or merely to the natural elasticity of the people, no longer drained by war nor isolated from the rest of the world. French authorities say that agriculture did not revive throughout the country. It is certain, however, that the maritime prosperity of France advanced wonderfully, owing mainly to the removal of commercial restrictions in the years immediately following.",

    "text": "The death of Louis XIV. saw a period of growth for the French West Indies, particularly Martinique, Guadeloupe, and Louisiana. Their tropical climate and slave-based cultivation facilitated a paternal, semi-military government.  France gained a significant advantage over England in the West Indies; the French half of Haiti alone equaled the value of all the English West Indies.  French coffee and sugar dominated European markets.  A similar dominance was seen in the Mediterranean and Levant trade. The French East India Company was revived, with L'Orient becoming a major port. Pondicherry and Chandernagore in India grew rapidly, while the Isle of Bourbon and the Isle of France (Mauritius) became crucial for controlling the Indian Ocean.  Two men, Dupleix and La Bourdonnais, spearheaded these advancements, laying the groundwork for French rivalry with England in India. This expansion, driven by private enterprise rather than government policy, is evident in the growth of French merchant shipping from 300 vessels to 1800 in twenty years. This, French historians argue, disproves the notion that France is unsuitable for maritime commerce.  Cardinal Fleury, however, viewed this growth with distrust.  He and Walpole, the British Prime Minister, shared a desire for peace.  However, Walpole had to contend with the British public's resentment of French trade rivalry. Fleury, focused on continental affairs, prioritized strengthening France's land power through Bourbon alliances. The French navy was neglected, declining to fifty-four ships-of-the-line and frigates, mostly in poor condition. When war with England loomed, France had only forty-five ships-of-the-line compared to England's ninety.  Walpole, meanwhile, relied on Fleury's cooperation to avoid war with Spain. He addressed Spanish provocations with naval demonstrations.  In 1725, Spain and Austria formed an alliance, with a secret clause supporting Spain's claim to Gibraltar and Port Mahon.  Russia also considered joining.  England, France, and Prussia formed a counter-alliance.  English fleets were deployed to the Baltic, Spain, and Porto Bello to deter aggression and protect British interests.  Walpole's strict orders against fighting at Porto Bello led to high mortality among the crews due to disease, but it achieved his aim of avoiding war. Austria withdrew from its alliance with Spain and revoked the charter of its Ostend East India Company under English pressure.  As long as commerce remained undisturbed, Walpole's peace policy held, even with Spain's continued demands for Gibraltar.",

    "text": "Spain's restrictive trade policies in its American colonies led to widespread smuggling, primarily by the English, who exploited their Asiento and annual ship privileges. This benefited the colonists and was often overlooked by colonial governors. However, it harmed Spanish merchants and the national treasury.  Spain attempted to tighten control, reviving and enforcing old regulations.  The English, accustomed to these practices, resisted. Spain lacked the power to stop them, leading to increasingly aggressive actions. Spanish ships began stopping and searching English vessels on the high seas, often with accompanying insults and violence. Similar incidents have occurred between Spanish officials and American merchant ships in more recent times.  These acts, coupled with confiscations and trade disruptions, angered the English public. In 1737, West India merchants petitioned Parliament, complaining of seizures and mistreatment. Walpole worked tirelessly to avoid war. The 1729 Treaty of Seville aimed to restore trade conditions and allowed Spanish troops to occupy Tuscany and Parma.  Walpole argued that war would jeopardize existing trade privileges. He negotiated with Spain for concessions and indemnities.  Meanwhile, a war erupted over the Polish succession. France and Spain allied against Austria, joined by Sardinia, which hoped to gain Milan. England and Holland remained neutral after receiving assurances that the Austrian Netherlands would not be attacked. The allies declared war on Austria in 1733. Spain, focused on Naples and Sicily, conquered them quickly and installed the Spanish king's second son as Carlos III, creating the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.  Walpole's neutrality led to a shift in Mediterranean control, potentially detrimental to Britain.  Moreover, Fleury betrayed Walpole by agreeing to a secret clause with Spain targeting English commerce.  This agreement, made during a period of open alliance with England, stipulated that trade abuses, particularly by the English, would be abolished, and France would support Spain against England if necessary. This mirrored the policy William III had warned against, and had Walpole known of it, it might have reinforced his preference for peace. He had warned Parliament that Spain likely had the backing of stronger powers.",

The particular question which excited the two years' War of the Polish Succession, the choice of a ruler for a distracted kingdom fated soon to disappear from the list of European States, seems a small matter; but the turn imparted to European politics by the action of the powers engaged gives it a very different importance. France and Austria came to an arrangement in October, 1735, upon terms to which Sardinia and Spain afterward acceded, the principal points of which were as follows: The French claimant to the Polish throne gave up his claim to it, and received instead the duchies of Bar and Lorraine on the east of France, with the provision that upon his death they were to go to his son-in-law, the King of France, in full sovereignty; the two kingdoms of Sicily and Naples were confirmed to the Spanish Bourbon prince, Don Carlos; and Austria received back Parma. The Sardinian monarchy also got an increase to its Italian territory. France thus, under the peace-loving Fleuri, obtained in Bar and Lorraine an accession of strength which more warlike rulers had coveted in vain; and at the same time her external position was fortified at the expense of England, by the transfer of controlling positions in the central Mediterranean to an ally. Yet the heart of Fleuri might well have failed him as he remembered the secret agreement to check the commerce of England, and thought of her mighty sea power alongside of the decayed navy of France. That compact between France and Spain, to which the Two Sicilies acceded later, bore within it, in the then strained relations between England and Spain, the germ of the great wars between England and the House of Bourbon which issued in the creation of the British Empire and the independence of the United States.",

    "text": "The clamor in England over Spanish outrages continued, and was carefully nursed by the opposition to Walpole. The minister was now over sixty years of age, and scarcely able to change the settled convictions and policy of his prime. He was face to face with one of those irrepressible conflicts between nations and races toward which a policy of repression and compromise can be employed but for a short time. The English were bent upon opening the West Indies and Spanish America, the Spanish government equally bent upon obstructing them. Unfortunately for their policy of obstruction, they strengthened Walpole's enemies by unlawful search of English ships on the open sea, and possibly also by outrages to English seamen. Some of the latter were brought before the bar of the House of Commons, and testified that they had been not merely plundered, but tortured, shut up in prison, and compelled to live and work under loathsome conditions. The most celebrated case was that of a certain Jenkins, the master of a merchant-brig, who told that a Spanish officer had torn off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to the king his master, and say that if he had been there he would have been served likewise. Being asked what were his feelings at such a moment of danger and suffering, he was said to have replied, \"I commended my soul to God and my cause to my country.\" This well-turned dramatic utterance from the mouth of a man of his class throws a suspicion of high coloring over the whole story; but it can be readily imagined what a capital campaign-cry it would be in the heat of a popular movement. The tide of feeling swept away Walpole's patchwork of compromise, and war was declared against Spain by Great Britain on the 19th of October, 1739. The English ultimatum insisted upon a formal renunciation of the right of search as claimed and exercised by the Spaniards, and upon an express acknowledgment of the British claims in North America. Among these claims was one relating to the limits of Georgia, then a recently established colony, touching the Spanish territory of Florida.",

    "text": "Hunting and fur trading were primary activities among the North American native populations, who lacked significant mechanical arts and relied on English colonies for some vessels. Their strength resided in the military nature of their society, with each individual being a soldier. Alongside the inherited hostility between their respective mother countries, England and France, there existed a fundamental antagonism between their directly opposed social and political systems in North America. Canada's remoteness from the West Indies and harsh winter climate made it less valuable to France from a naval perspective than the English colonies were to England. This was further compounded by Canada's inferior resources and population, which stood at 80,000 in 1750 compared to the English colonies' 1,200,000. Given this disparity, Canada's only hope lay in French naval support, either through direct control of neighboring seas or by diverting English forces elsewhere.  Spain held Florida, including vaguely defined surrounding regions, as well as territories in Mexico, South America, Cuba, Porto Rico, and part of Hayti. France possessed Guadeloupe, Martinique, and western Hayti, while England held Jamaica, Barbados, and other smaller islands. The West Indies, with their fertile land and favorable climate, might seem like prime targets in a colonial war. However, no major conquest attempts were made on the larger islands, likely because England, the primary aggressor, prioritized the interests of its North American colonists. The smaller West India islands were valuable as military positions and commercial assets in war, frequently changing hands and often restored during peace negotiations.  The West Indies became a focal point for naval activity due to their commercial importance and the seasonal limitations on continental military operations. In India, the rivalry between England and France played out through their respective East India Companies. The English were established in Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras, with a later addition at Fort St. David (Cuddalore). France had settlements at Chandernagore, Pondicherry, and Mahé. The French held an advantage with their island bases of France and Bourbon in the Indian Ocean, and the leadership of Dupleix and La Bourdonnais.  However, disagreement arose between these two capable leaders. Dupleix envisioned a French empire in India built on alliances with native princes, while La Bourdonnais prioritized naval supremacy and secure communication with France. This conflict reflected a broader tension in French strategy between land and sea power. The Cape of Good Hope, under Dutch control, remained neutral in the early stages of these wars.",

French naval strength in 1744 was estimated at 45 ships-of-the-line and 67 frigates, but French sources depict a navy in poor condition with depleted dockyards. This neglect continued until 1760. Though French ships built between 1740 and 1800 were often better designed and larger than their English counterparts, England had superior seamen and officers due to continuous naval activity. The constant need for crews in both commerce and war, however, led to a reliance on indiscriminate pressing, resulting in poor-quality recruits. Both French and English navies suffered from administrative inefficiencies and political influence in officer appointments, particularly relying on aging officers past their prime. The long peace had also degraded discipline and preparedness in both nations.",

Learning of the disaster at Cartagena, he then determined to cross the Pacific and waylay the two galleons 262 WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION. that sailed yearly from Acapulco to Manila. In the passage across, one of the two ships now left to him was found in such bad condition that she had to be destroyed. With the other he succeeded in his last undertaking, capturing the great galleon with a million and a half dollars in specie. The expedition, from its many misfortunes, had no mili- tary result beyond the terror and consequent embarrassment caused to the Spanish settlements ; but its very misfortunes, and the calm persistency which worked out a great success from them all, have given it a well-deserved renown. During the year 1740 happened two events which led to a general European war breaking in upon that in which Spain and England were already engaged. In May of that year Frederick the Great became king of Prussia, and in October the emperor Charles VI., formerly the Austrian claimant of the Spanish throne, died. He had no son, and left by will the sovereignty of his estates to his eldest daughter, the cele- brated Maria Theresa, to secure whose succession the efforts of his diplomacy had been directed for many years. This suc- cession had been guaranteed by the European powers ; but the apparent weakness of her position excited the ambitions of other sovereigns. The Elector of Bavaria laid claim to the whole inheritance, in which he was supported by France ; while the Prussian king claimed and seized the province of Silesia. Other powers, large and small, threw in their lot with one or the other ; while the position of England was complicated by her king being also elector of Hanover, and in that capacity hurriedly contracting an obligation of neutrality for the electorate, although English feeling was strongly in favor of Austria. Meanwhile the failure of the Spanish-American expeditions and the severe losses of Eng- lish commerce increased the general outcry against Walpole, who resigned early in 1742. England under the new minis- try became the open ally of Austria ; and Parliament voted not only a subsidy to the empress-queen, but also a body of troops to be sent as auxiliaries to the Austrian Netherlands. At the same time Holland, under English influence, and bound THE NAVIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. 263 like England by previous treaties to support the succession of Maria Theresa, also voted a subsidy.",

    "text": "Here occurs again that curious view of international relations before mentioned. Both of these powers thus entered the war against France, but only as auxiliaries to the empress, not as principals ; as nations, except the troo})S actually in the field, they were considered to be still at peace. Such an equivocal situation could in the end have only one result. On the sea France had already assumed the same position of auxiliary to Spain, in virtue of the defensive alliance between the two kingdoms, while affecting still to be at peace with England ; and it is curious to see the gravity with which French writers com- plain of assaults upon French by English ships, upon the plea that there was no open war between the two States. It has already been mentioned that in 1740 a French squadron supported a division of Spanish ships on their way to America, In 1741, Spain, having now entered the continental war as an enemy of Austria, sent a body of fifteen thousand troops from Barcelona to attack the Austrian possessions in Italy. The English admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, sought and found the Spanish fleet ; but with it was a division of twelve French sail-of-the-line, whose commander informed Haddock that he was engaged in the same expedition and had orders to fight, if the Spaniards, though formally at war with Eng- land, were attacked. xA.s the allies were nearly double his force, the English admiral was obliged to go back to Fort Mahon. He was soon after relieved ; and the new admiral, Matthews, held at once the two positions of commander-in- chief in the Mediterranean and English minister at Turin, the capital of the King of Sardinia. In the course of the year 1742 an English captain in his fleet, chasing some Spanish galleys, drove them into the French port of St. Tropez, and following them into the harbor burned them, in spite of tlio so-called neutrality of France. In the same year Matthews sent a division of ships under Commodore Martin\nto Naples, to compel the Bourbon king to withdraw his contingent of twenty thousand troops serving with the Spanish army in 264 THE NAVIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. northern Italy against the Austrians. To the attempts to negotiate, Martin replied only by pulling out his watch and giving the government an hour to come to terms. There was nothing for it but submission ; and the English fleet left the harbor after a stay of twenty-four hours, having re- lieved the empress of a dangerous enemy. Henceforward it was evident that the Spanish war in Italy could only be maintained by sending troops through France ; England con- trolled the sea and the action of Naples. These two last incidents, at St. Tropez and Naples, deeply impressed the aged Fleuri, who recognized too late the scope and impor- tance of a well-founded sea power. Causes of complaint were multiplying on both sides, and the moment was fast approach- ing when both France and England must quit the pretence of being only auxiliaries in the war. Before it came to that, however, the controlling sea power and wealth of England again made itself felt by attaching the King of Sardinia to the Austrian cause. Between the dangers and advantages of the French or English alliance the king's action was deter- mined by a subsidy and the promise of a strong English fleet in the Mediterranean ; in return he engaged to enter the war with an army of forty-five thousand men. This compact was signed in September, 1743. In October, Fleuri being now dead, Louis XV. made with Spain a treaty, by which he en- gaged to declare war against England and Sardinia, and to support the Spanish claims in Italy, as also to Gibraltar, Ma- hon, and Georgia. Open war was thus near at hand, but the declaration was still deferred.",

If both have been lacking to him, indecision will follow; either from not knowing what to do, or from failure to realize that utter self-devotion of himself and his command are required. Of one of the captains cashiered it is said: \"No man had ever lived with a fairer or more honorable character previous to the unfortunate event which did such irreparable injury to his reputation. Many of his contemporaries, men in the highest popular estimation, who knew him well, could scarcely credit what were indisputably established as facts, and declared, with the utmost astonishment, 'they believed it next to impossible for Captain Burrish to behave otherwise than as a man of gallantry and intrepidity.'\" He had been twenty-five years in service, and eleven afloat as a captain (Charnock's Biographia Navalis). Others of the condemned men bore fair characters; and even Richard Norris, who absconded to avoid trial, had been of respectable repute.\n\nThe celebrity attained by Matthews's action off Toulon, certainly not due to the skill with which it was managed, nor to its results, sprang from the clamor at home, and chiefly from the number and findings of the courts-martial that followed. Both the admiral and his second, and also eleven captains out of the twenty-nine, had charges preferred against them. The admiral was cashiered because he had broken the line; that is, because his captains did not follow him when he left it to get at the enemy—a decision that smacks more of the Irish bull than of the Irish love of fighting. The second was acquitted on the technical grounds already given; he avoided the fault of breaking the line by keeping far enough away. Of the eleven captains one died, one deserted, seven were dismissed or suspended, two only were acquitted. Nor were the French and Spaniards better pleased; mutual recriminations passed. Admiral de Court was relieved from his command, while the Spanish admiral was decorated by his government with the title of Marquis de la Victoria, a most extraordinary reward for what was at best a drawn fight. The French, on the other hand, assert that he left the deck on the plea of a very slight wound, and that the ship was really fought by a French captain who happened to be on board.",

    "text": "To use a common expression, this battle, the first general action since that off Malaga forty years before, \"woke up\" the English people and brought about a healthful reaction. The sifting process begun by the battle itself was continued, but the result was reached too late to have its proper effect on the current war. It is rather by its deficient action, than by such conspicuous successes as were attained in earlier and later times, that the general value of England's sea power is now shown; like some precious faculty, scarcely valued when possessed, but keenly missed when withdrawn. Mistress now of the seas rather by the weakness of her enemies than by her own disciplined strength, she drew from that mastery no adequate results; the most solid success, the capture of Cape Breton Island, in 1745, was achieved by the colonial forces of New England, to which indeed the royal navy lent valuable aid, for to troops so situated the fleet is the one line of communication. The misconduct off Toulon was repeated by officers high in command in the West and East Indies, resulting in the latter case in the loss of Madras. Other causes concurred with the effete condition of the naval officers to hamper the action of that sea power which launches out far from home. The condition of England itself was insecure; the cause of the Stuarts was still alive, and though a formidable invasion by fifteen thousand troops under Marshal Saxe, in 1744, was foiled, partly by the English Channel fleet, and partly by a storm which wrecked several of the transports assembled off Dunkirk, with the loss of many lives, yet the reality of the danger was shown in the following year, when the Pretender landed in Scotland with only a few men at his back and the northern kingdom rose with him. His successful invasion was carried well down into England itself; and sober historians have thought that at one time the chances of ultimate success were rather with than against him. Another serious fetter upon the full use of England's power was the direction given to the French operations on land and the mistaken means used to oppose them. Neglecting Germany, France turned upon the Austrian Netherlands, a country which England, out of regard to her sea interests, was not willing to see conquered. Her commercial preponderance would be directly threatened by the passing of Antwerp, Ostend, and the Scheldt into the hands of her great rival; and though her best check against this would have been to seize valuable French possessions elsewhere and hold them as a pledge, the weakness of her government and the present inefficiency of the navy prevented her doing so.",

    "text": "In 1744, the French East India Company, hoping for neutrality with its English counterpart despite the ongoing war between their nations, ordered its forces in India not to attack the English. This proposition, seemingly plausible given Holland's ambiguous relationship with France (nominally at peace yet providing troops to Austria), greatly benefited the English, who were weaker in the Indian Ocean. The English company accepted the offer, while clarifying it couldn't bind the home government or the Royal Navy. This initial advantage secured by the French was squandered. The English Admiralty dispatched a squadron that started seizing French ships between India and China, jolting the French company from its illusion of neutrality.  The squadron then sailed to the Indian coast, arriving off Pondicherry, the French political capital, in July 1745, ready to support a planned land attack by the Madras governor. Meanwhile, Dupleix, the French governor-general, envisioned establishing French dominance in India. He recognized the growing European influence in global affairs and believed India was ripe for European conquest, with England as France’s sole rival.  His strategy involved manipulating Indian politics, first as head of an independent colony and then, as he aspired, a vassal of the Mughal emperor.  His plan was to advance French power through strategic alliances and military intervention. Pondicherry's distance from Delhi allowed Dupleix to expand French influence discreetly.  Crucially, his primary concern wasn't empire-building, but eliminating the English presence.  He understood that European powers would inevitably dominate the region unless countered by other Europeans, and this depended on sea control.  In India’s deadly climate, maintaining military forces required constant reinforcements from Europe, making naval supremacy crucial.  Despite early English naval inefficiencies and inconclusive battles, sea power ultimately played a decisive role. Had French fleets controlled the Indian coast and its sea lanes to Europe from 1743 to 1763, Dupleix's ambitions might have succeeded. French naval weakness hindered his progress; the French Royal Navy was absent from the East Indies during this period.",

La Bourdonnais arrived with a French squadron and clashed inconclusively with Commodore Peyton’s English force.  Peyton, however, retreated to Ceylon, ceding control of the sea to the French. La Bourdonnais then captured Madras, agreeing to a ransom, a decision that infuriated Dupleix, who considered the city under his jurisdiction and broke the agreement.  A cyclone subsequently crippled La Bourdonnais’ squadron, forcing his return to France, where he was unjustly imprisoned. Dupleix, seizing Madras, expelled the English and fortified the city. His subsequent attack on Fort St. David was thwarted by the arrival of an English squadron in March 1747.  French naval disasters in the Atlantic during this year gave the English uncontested sea control. They sent a large fleet and army under Admiral Boscawen to India in 1748, attacking Pondicherry unsuccessfully.  News of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle then arrived, ending the war.  This restored Dupleix's lines of communication with France, enabling him to resume his efforts to secure a territorial base, mistakenly believing this would protect him from sea power. The peace treaty stipulated the return of Madras to the English in exchange for Louisburg, a strategic location in North America.  While England’s naval power made Louisburg more valuable than Madras, the exchange benefited Britain.  The English colonists, familiar with their nation’s naval strength, understood the situation. In India, however, the forced surrender of Madras undermined Dupleix’s credibility with the native princes, who failed to grasp the significance of sea power.

    "text": "The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed in April and October 1748, largely restored the pre-war status quo.  Silesia was ceded to Prussia, Parma to the Infante Philip of Spain, and some Italian territories to the King of Sardinia. The war, despite significant events and losses, essentially reset the positions of France, England, and Spain.  The Austrian succession conflict had diverted attention from more pressing disputes between these powers, postponing their resolution for fifteen years. France, exploiting Austria’s weakness, renewed its attacks, while England, motivated by the King’s German interests and concerns about French influence, opposed these actions. Whether France should have focused on the Austrian heartland or the Netherlands is debatable.  The former offered a base in Bavaria and an alliance with Prussia, while the latter targeted Austria and the sea powers sensitive to French presence in the region.  France’s continental successes were offset by its naval annihilation and severed colonial connections. While the French government’s colonial ambitions are debated, its commerce undeniably suffered.  England, drawn into a costly continental war by disputes in Spanish America and naval inefficiency, faced disaster and substantial debt, with Holland threatened by invasion.  The peace treaty was signed under French duress, indicating France's desperation despite holding the Netherlands and parts of Holland.  Its naval collapse and the disruption of colonial trade forced its hand.",

At the same time her own resources were drained, and Holland, exhausted, was seeking to borrow from her. \" Money,\" we are told, \" was never so scarce in the city, and cannot be had at twelve per cent.\" Had France, therefore, at this time had a navy able to make head against that of England, even though somewhat infe- rior in strength, she might, with her grip on the Netherlands and Maestricht, have exacted her own conditions. England, on the other hand, though driven to the wall on the conti- nent, was nevertheless able to obtain peace on equal terms, through the control of the sea by her navy. The commerce of all three nations had suffered enor- mously, but the balance of prizes in favor of Great Britain was estimated at .£2,000,000. Stated in another way, it is said that the combined losses of French and Spanish com- merce amounted during the war to 3,434 ships, the English to 3,238 ; but in considering such figures, the relation they bear to the total merchant shipping of either nation must not be forgotten. A thousand vessels were a very much larger fraction of French shipping than of English, and meant more grievous loss. \" After the disaster to the squadron of L'Etenduere,\" says a French writer, '• the French flag did not appear at sea. Twenty- two ships-of-the-line composed the navy of France, which sixty years before had one hundred and twenty. Privateers made few prizes ; followed everywhere, unprotected, they almost always fell a prey to the English. The British naval forces, without any rivals, I)assed unmolested over the seas. In one year they are said to have taken from French commerce £7,000,000 sterling. Yet this sea power, which might have seized French and Spanish colonies, made few conquests from want of unity and persistence in the direc- tion given them.\" To sum up, France was forced to give up her conquests for want of a navy, and England saved her position by her sea power, though she had failed to use it to the best advantage.\n\nCHAPTER VIII. Seven Years' \"War, 1 756-1 7G3. — England's Overwhelming Power AND Conquests on the Seas, in North America, Europe, and East and West Indies. — Sea Battles : Byng off Minorca ; Hawke and Conflans ; Pocock and D'Acut in East Indies. The urgency with which peace was desired by the prin- cipal parties to the War of the Austrian Succession may perhaps be inferred from the neglect to settle definitely and conclusively many of the questions outstanding between them, and notably the very disputes about which the war between England and Spain began. It seems as though the powers feared to treat thoroughly matters that contained the germs of future quarrels, lest the discussion should prolong the war that then existed. England made peace because the fall of Holland was otherwise inevitable, not because she had enforced, or surrendered, her claims of 1739 against Spain. The right of uninterrupted navigation in West Indian seas, free from any search, was left undetermined, as were other kindred matters. Not only so, but the boundaries between the English and French colonies in the valley of the Ohio, toward Canada, and on the land side of the Nova Scotian peninsula, remained as vague as they had before been, it was plain that peace could not last ; and by it, if she had saved Holland, England surrendered the control of the sea which she had won. The true character of the strife, shrouded for a moment by the continental war, was revealed by the so- called peace ; though formally allayed, the contention con- tinued in every part of the world.",

    "text": "The morning of the 20th of May, after a series of maneuvers, the French and English fleets were positioned with the French to leeward, between the English and the harbor. Byng's attack, intended to be ship against ship, was hampered by the fleets' angled formation and the greater distance between their rears. The English van, running head-on towards the French, suffered heavy damage. Byng hesitated to engage directly, citing Matthews's prior misfortune for his caution. The indecisive engagement saw the English van bear the brunt of the fighting.  French sources offer varying explanations for Galissoniere's failure to press his advantage, but the most likely is his prioritization of the land attack on Mahon over destroying the English fleet. This reflects the French naval policy of prioritizing territorial gains over fleet engagements.  This approach contrasts with the English focus on controlling the sea by targeting enemy fleets. The French prioritization of land objectives limited their naval prestige and contributed to later losses. Had Galissoniere decisively engaged, the outcome of the war, and the fate of Richelieu's troops, could have been different. The French government’s preference for defensive naval actions, as exemplified in this battle, ultimately proved detrimental to their overall sea power. John Clerk identified this as a deliberate tactic, not an accident. By taking the lee gauge, the French admiral protected Mahon and forced the English to attack.  Clerk provides evidence suggesting the French ships, after damaging their opponents, skillfully withdrew, forcing repeated attacks with similar results. This defensive policy, though successful in the short term, negatively impacted the French naval officers’ spirit and contributed to De Grasse's failure to defeat Rodney in 1782. Despite having a tactical advantage, De Grasse avoided a decisive engagement, prioritizing his overall mission. This caution ultimately led to his defeat three days later. Returning to Minorca, after the action of the 20th, Byng convened a council of war which decided to withdraw to Gibraltar. Byng was subsequently relieved of command, court-martialed, and executed for failing to do his utmost.",

Following the island's capture, the nature of the conflict indicated a primarily maritime war.  However, France, again distracted by continental concerns, failed to capitalize on naval opportunities, leading to colonial losses and setbacks in India.  England, recognizing the importance of sea control, thrived, securing its position and supporting France's enemies.  This ultimately led to the expansion of the British Empire. While France possessed a sizeable fleet, it lacked sufficient equipment and artillery.  Spain, a potential ally, had a numerically comparable fleet but questionable effectiveness.  England’s superior numbers, combined with its focus on naval power, gave it a significant advantage.  Despite initial gains like the acquisition of Corsica, which strengthened France's Mediterranean presence, and successes in Canada and India, France failed to strategically leverage these victories against England. England's aggressive blockade of French ports, a move demonstrating its confidence in its naval power, could have been exploited by France to forge alliances against England. Instead, France engaged in another continental war, hindering its naval efforts. This, combined with the execution of Admiral Byng, marked a turning point in the conflict, shifting the balance of power in favor of Great Britain.",

The empress urged the two Roman Catholic powers to unite to take Silesia from a Protestant king, offering France a part of her possessions in the Netherlands.  Frederick the Great, learning of the combination against him, invaded Saxony in October 1756, starting the Seven Years' War. This war, like the War of the Austrian Succession, distracted some participants from the original cause of the conflict. While France, already engaged in a quarrel with England, needlessly entered another struggle to bolster the Austrian empire, England recognized her true interests.  Prioritizing the maritime and colonial aspects of the war, England supported Frederick with money and sympathy in his defensive war, which significantly diverted French resources.  In 1757, the English attempt against Louisburg failed due to the admiral's reluctance to engage a larger French fleet. The following year, Admiral Boscawen, with a stronger force, captured Louisburg, opening the St. Lawrence River to the heart of Canada and providing a new base for the English fleet and army.",

In 1760, although the English controlled the St. Lawrence, the French governor held out in Montreal.  An imprudent attack by the English garrison at Quebec almost resulted in the city's recapture, but the timely arrival of an English squadron saved the day. The English chronicler emphasized the importance of sea superiority.  Cut off entirely, the French forces in Montreal surrendered in September 1760, ending French rule in Canada.  English successes continued elsewhere after Pitt's rise to power. On the continent, Frederick the Great, with English financial aid, struggled against France, Austria, and Russia.

The blockade of Brest, a primarily defensive measure, aimed to neutralize the French fleet. The effectiveness of this tactic was evident in the English panic when the French fleet briefly escaped in 1759.  In 1758, facing setbacks on the continent and harassed by English coastal raids, France decided to strike directly at England.  French commerce was devastated while English commerce flourished under Pitt's leadership.  Choiseul, a new French minister, initiated invasion preparations in 1759, planning to land troops in England and Scotland. Two French squadrons, one at Toulon and one at Brest, were to unite for the operation.  This plan failed due to English control of Gibraltar and their naval superiority.  Pitt's 1757 offer to cede Gibraltar to Spain for assistance in retaking Minorca highlights the strategic importance of this location.  Admiral Boscawen's Mediterranean fleet, while refitting at Gibraltar after an engagement in Toulon, used a system of lookout frigates and signal guns to detect the French fleet's movement.",

The general rule for all chases where the pursuer is decidedly superior, namely, that order must be observed only so far as to keep the leading ships within reasonable supporting distance of the slower ones, so that they may not be singly overpowered before the latter can come up, was by this time well understood in the English navy, and that is certainly the fitting time for a melee. Boscawen acted accordingly. The rear ship of the French, on the other hand, nobly emulated the example of L'Etenduere when he saved his convoy. Overtaken at two o'clock by the leading English ship, and soon after surrounded by four others, her captain made for five hours a desperate resistance, from which he could hope, not to save himself, but to delay the enemies long enough for the better sailers to escape. He so far succeeded that — thanks to the injury done by him and their better speed — they did that day escape action at close quarters, which could only have ended in their capture. When he hauled down his flag, his three topmasts were gone, the mizzen-mast fell immediately after, and the hull was so full of water that the ship was with difficulty kept afloat. M. de Sabran — his name is worthy to be remembered — had received eleven wounds in this gallant resistance, by which he illustrated so signally the duty and service of a rearguard in retarding pursuit. That night two of the French ships hauled off to the westward, and so escaped. The other four continued their flight as before ; but the next morning the commodore, despairing of escape, headed for the Portuguese coast, and ran them all ashore between Lagos and Cape St. Vincent. The English admiral followed and attacked them, taking two and burning the others, without regard to the neutrality of Portugal. For this insult no amend was made beyond a formal apology ; Portugal was too dependent upon England to be seriously considered. Pitt, writing to the English minister to Portugal about the affair, told him that while soothing the susceptibilities of the Portuguese government he must not allow it to suppose that either the ships would be given up or the distinguished admiral censured. The destruction or dispersal of the Toulon fleet stopped the invasion of England, though the five ships that got into Cadiz remained a matter of anxiety to Sir Edward Hawke, who cruised before Brest.",

    "text": "Choiseul, balked of his main object, still clung to the invasion of Scotland. The French fleet at Brest, under Marshal de Conflans, a sea officer despite his title, numbered twenty sail-of-the-line, besides frigates. The troops to be embarked are variously stated at fifteen to twenty thousand. The original purpose was to escort the transports with only five ships-of-the-line, besides smaller vessels. Conflans insisted that the whole fleet ought to go. The minister of the navy thought that the admiral was not a sufficiently skilful tactician to be able to check the advance of an enemy, and so insure the safe arrival of the convoy at its destination near the Clyde without risking a decisive encounter. Believing therefore that there would be a general action, he considered that it would be better to fight it before the troops sailed ; for if disastrous, the convoy would not be sacrificed, and if decisively victorious, the road would then be clear. The transports were assembled, not at Brest, but in the ports to the southward as far as the mouth of the Loire. The French fleet therefore put to sea with the expectation and purpose of fighting the enemy ; but it is not easy to reconcile its subsequent course with that purpose, nor with the elaborate fighting instructions issued by the admiral before sailing. About the 5th or 6th of November there came on a tremendous westerly gale. After buffeting it for three days, Hawke bore up and ran into Torbay, where he waited for the wind to shift, keeping his fleet in readiness to sail at once. The same gale, while keeping back the French already in Brest, gave the chance to a small squadron under M. Bompart, which was expected from the West Indies, to slip in during Hawke's absence. Conflans made his preparations with activity, distributed Bompart's crews among his own ships, which were not very well manned, and got to sea with an easterly wind on the 14th. He stood at once to the southward, flattering himself that he had escaped Hawke. The latter, however, had sailed from Torbay on the 12th ; and though again driven back, sailed a second time on the 14th, the same day that Conflans left Brest. He soon reached his station, learned that the enemy had been seen to the southward steering east, and easily concluding that they were bound to Quiberon Bay, shaped his own course for the same place under a press of sail. At eleven p. m. of the 19th the French admiral estimated his position to be seventy miles southwest by west from Belle Isle ; and the wind springing up fresh from the westward, he stood for it under short sail, the wind continuing to increase and hauling to west-northwest. At daybreak several ships were seen ahead, which proved to be the English squadron of Commodore Duff, blockading Quiberon. The signal was made to chase; and the English, taking flight, separated into two divisions, — one going off before the wind, the other hauling up to the southward. The greater part of the French fleet continued its course after the former division, that is, toward the coast ; but one ship hauled up for the second. Immediately after, the rear French ships made signal of sails to windward, which were also visible from aloft on board the flag-ship. It must have been about the same moment that the lookout frigate in advance of the English fleet informed her admiral of sails to leeward. Hawke's diligence had brought him up with Conflans, who, in his official reports, says he had considered it impossible that the enemy could have in that neighborhood forces superior or even equal to his own.",

    "text": "Conflans now ordered his rear division to haul its wind in support of the ship chasing to the southward and eastward. In a few moments more it was discovered that the fleet to windward numbered twenty-three ships-of-the- line to the French twenty-one, and among them some three- deckers. Conflans then called in the chasing ships and got ready for action. It remained to settle his course under circumstances which he had not foreseen. It was now blowing hard from the west-northwest, with every appearance of heavy weather, the fleet not far from a lee shore, with an enemy considerably superior in numbers ; for besides Hawke's twenty-three of the line, Duff had four fifty-gun ships. Con- flans therefore determined to run for it and lead his squadron into Quiberon Bay, trusting and believing that Hawke would not dare to follow, under the conditions of the weather, into a bay which French authorities describe as containing banks and shoals, and lined with reefs which the navigator rarely sees without fright and never passes without emotion. It was in the midst of these ghastly dangers that forty-four large ships were about to engage pell-mell ; for the space was too contracted for fleet manoeuvres. Conflans flattered himself that he would get in first and be able to haul up close under the western shore of the bay, forcing the enemy, if he followed, to take position between him and the beach, six miles to leeward. None of his expectations were fulfilled. In the retreat he took the head of his fleet ; a step not unjustifiable, since only by leading in person could he have shown just what he wanted to do, but unfortunate for his reputation with the public, as it placed the admiral foremost in the flight. Hawke was not in the least, nor for one moment, deterred by the dangers before him, whose full extent he, as a skilful sea- man, entirely realized ; but his was a calm and steadfast as well as a gallant temper, that weighed risks justly, neither dissembling nor exaggerating. He has not left us his rea- soning, but he doubtless felt that the French, leading, would serve partially as pilots, and must take the ground before him ; he believed the temper and experience of his officers, tried by the severe school of the blockade, to be superior to those of the French ; and he knew that both the government and the country demanded that the enemy's fleet should not reach another friendly port in safety. On the very day that he was thus following the French, amid dangers and under conditions that have made this one of the most dramatic of sea fights, he was being burnt in effigy in England for allow- ing them to escape. As Confians, leading his fleet, was round- ing the Cardinals, — as the southernmost rocks at the entrance of Quiberon Bay are called, — the leading English ships brought the French rear to action. It was another case of a general chase ending in a melee, but under conditions of exceptional interest and grandeur from the surrounding circumstances of the gale of wind, the heavy sea, the lee shore, the headlong speed, shortened canvas, and the great number of ships en- gaged. One French seventy-four, closely pressed and out- numbered, ventured to open her lower-deck ports ; the sea sweeping in carried her down with all on board but twenty men. Another was sunk by the fire of Hawke's flag-ship. Two others, one of which carried a commodore's pennant, struck their colors. The remainder were dispersed. Seven fled to the northward and eastward, and anchored off the mouth of the little river Vilaine, into which they succeeded in entering at the top of high water in two tides, — a feat never before performed. Seven others took refuge to the southward and eastward in Rochefort. One, after being very badly injured, ran ashore and was lost near the mouth of the Loire.

    "text": "The great French fleet was annihilated ; for the fourteen ships not taken or destroyed were divided into two parts, and those in the Vilaine only succeeded in escaping, two at a time, between fifteen months and two years later. The English lost two ships which ran upon a shoal and were hopelessly wrecked ; their losses in action were slight. At nightfall Hawke anchored his fleet and prizes. All possibility of an invasion of England passed away with the destruction of the Brest fleet. The battle of November 20, 1759, was the Trafalgar of this war ; and though a block- ade was maintained over the fractions that were laid up in the Vilaine and at Rochefort, the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before. The same year that saw this great sea fight and the fall of Quebec witnessed also the capture of Guadeloupe in the West Indies, of Goree on the west coast of Africa, and the abandonment of the East Indian seas by the French flag after three indecisive actions between their commodore, D'Ache, and Admiral Pocock, — an abandonment which necessarily led to the fall of the French power in India, never again to rise. In this year also the King of Spain died, and his brother succeeded, un- der the title of Charles III. This Charles had been King of Naples at the time when an English commodore had al- lowed one hour for the court to determine to withdraw the Neapolitan troops from the Spanish army. He had never for- gotten this humiliation, and brought to his new throne a heart unfriendly to England. With such feelings on his part, France and Spain drew more readily together. Charles's first step was to propose mediation, but Pitt was averse to it. Looking upon France as the chief enemy of England, and upon the sea and the colonies as the chief source of power and wealth, he wished, now that he had her down, to weaken her thoroughly for the future as well as the present, and to establish England's greatness more firmly upon the wreck. Later on he offered certain conditions; but the influence of Louis's mistress, attached to the Empress of Austria, prevailed to except Prussia from the negotiations, and England would not allow the exception. Pitt, indeed, was not yet ready for peace. A year later, October 25, 1760, George II. died, and Pitt's influence then began to wane, the new king being less bent on war.",

This diverted France's attention from England, allowing the British to focus on colonial expeditions.  In India, the recall of Dupleix had placed the British and French East India Companies on equal footing, but the Marquis de Bussy, a supporter of Dupleix's expansionist policies, remained in the Deccan.  In 1756, following the Black Hole of Calcutta, Robert Clive recaptured the city.  Subsequent conflicts with the Nabob of Bengal and the French at Chandernagore culminated in the Battle of Plassey in 1757, marking the beginning of British dominance in India.  Clive, adopting Dupleix's strategies, secured Bengal for the British.  Control of the sea was crucial for European powers in India, allowing small forces to maintain control amidst larger native populations, provided they weren't opposed by other European powers.",

The first naval battle, off the Coromandel Coast in April 1758, was indecisive, but prevented the British from relieving Fort St. David, which subsequently fell to the French. A second battle in August was similarly inconclusive, but revealed the critical weakness of the French position: a lack of supplies and repair facilities.  Forced to retreat to the Isle of France, the French squadron found the colony equally depleted.  The situation highlighted the chronic underfunding and poor logistics that plagued the French navy.  Despite repairs and a return to India in September 1759, D'Ache, the French commander, was again defeated by the British admiral Pocock and retreated, leaving the French position in India increasingly precarious.",

The contrast between D'Ache and the later French admiral Suffren is striking. Suffren, facing similar logistical challenges two decades later, displayed the vigor and leadership that D'Ache lacked.

    "section": "The Decline of French Naval Power and the Bourbon Family Compact",
    "text": "French naval historians extensively document the exhaustion of French resources by 1761.  Few single ships left port, and all were captured. The alliance with Spain came too late to save France’s remaining colonies. As early as 1758, France, lacking funds, ships, and supplies, resorted to avoiding direct naval engagements. The arrival of a mere four ships-of-the-line at Louisburg was considered a fortunate event, highlighting the precarious state of their navy.  The destruction of French commerce, starting with merchant ships, culminated in the loss of colonies. The Family Compact between France and Spain, including a secret clause obliging Spain to declare war on England within a year if peace wasn't achieved, was unwise. Spain entered a disadvantageous agreement, hoping to revive the French navy and forge an alliance of neutral powers who had grievances against England.  English cruisers often disrespected the Spanish flag, seizing neutral vessels carrying goods from French colonies or military stores. This fueled resentment and contributed to the later “armed neutrality” of Baltic powers against England's maritime claims.  England's unchallenged sea power led to disregard for others' rights, asserting the right to seize enemy property on neutral ships. This disrupted trade and caused losses for neutral nations, similar to England's earlier paper blockade of French ports. Although neutrals were frustrated, 1761 was not the time for armed protest, especially for Spain. England possessed a formidable navy of 120 ships-of-the-line, manned by 70,000 experienced sailors.  In contrast, the French navy, once numbering 77 ships-of-the-line, had suffered heavy losses. Spain's navy of 50 ships likely had inferior personnel.  Neutrality, despite occasional violations, had benefited Spain, allowing it to recover financially and rebuild resources, but more time was needed.  Influenced by family ties and resentment, the Spanish king was persuaded by Choiseul to sign the Family Compact on August 15, 1761. This pact, also intended for Naples, guaranteed mutual possessions.  A secret clause stipulated Spain's declaration of war against England by May 1, 1762, if peace with France hadn't been achieved.",

    "text": "Pitt learned of Spain’s impending hostility and sought to preemptively declare war, but was overruled and resigned on October 5, 1761. His foresight was proven correct. Spain stalled, awaiting treasure ships from America. These arrived safely in Cadiz on September 21st, followed by richly laden ships from the West Indies on November 2nd.  Spain's tone shifted dramatically, asserting grievances and claims against England. The new English ministry, despite desiring peace, recalled their ambassador and declared war on January 4, 1762, effectively adopting Pitt’s strategy, but too late for the element of surprise.  England's superior strength and preparation remained unchanged.  Pocock, back from the East Indies, sailed from Portsmouth on March 5th, escorting transports to attack Havana. He was reinforced in the West Indies, commanding nineteen ships-of-the-line and 10,000 soldiers.  In January, Rodney's West India fleet and land forces captured Martinique, a key French island and privateering hub.  This disrupted privateering operations and secured English colonies and trade. Martinique's fall was followed by the capture of Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent, making all the Lesser Antilles British possessions.  Pocock's fleet, reinforced, navigated the Old Bahama Channel to Havana, a challenging feat at the time, arriving without incident. The siege of Havana lasted forty days, culminating in the capture of Moro Castle on July 30th and the city on August 10th. Spain lost the city, port, twelve ships-of-the-line, and substantial wealth. Havana’s importance stemmed not only from its size and rich surrounding area, but also its control over the passage for treasure ships from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe. Its capture forced ships to assemble in Cartagena and sail against trade winds, increasing their vulnerability. This blow to Spain was facilitated by England’s sea power, which also enabled the timely transport of American troops to reinforce the depleted English forces.  While England's sea power dominated the West Indies, it was also instrumental in Portugal and the East Indies.  Portugal, pressured by the allied crowns to join their alliance against the “tyrants of the seas,” resisted despite the threat to its neutrality.  The allies invaded Portugal but England responded, sending a fleet and troops to Lisbon, repelling the Spaniards and even carrying the war into Spain.",

These events severely crippled Spain’s colonial empire, disrupting trade and communication.  Pitt's strategy of targeting key points effectively severed Spain's strength. While the element of surprise was lost, the rapid execution of plans, enabled by England's efficient navy, led to triumph. With Manila's fall, the war's military operations concluded.  In just nine months, France’s hopes were dashed and Spain was forced into a peace conceding all points that had triggered the conflict.

This enabled her forces to operate across vast distances, from Cuba and Portugal to India and the Philippines, without fear of communication disruptions.  The magnitude of England's merchant ship losses paradoxically demonstrated her prosperity: despite significant captures by French privateers, the sheer size of the English merchant fleet, estimated at eight thousand ships, absorbed these losses. French privateering itself stemmed from the decline of their own merchant fleet, forcing idle sailors and owners into piracy. While privateers did inflict losses on English commerce, especially in coastal trade, the overall balance favored England. Key victories like the capture of Duquesne, Louisburg, and Prince Edward's Island, alongside the reduction of Senegal, Guadeloupe, and Martinique, severely hampered French commerce and colonies while bolstering England's.  The vast difference in prisoners of war further highlighted England's dominance: England held twenty-five thousand French prisoners, while only twelve hundred Englishmen were held in France. The influx of captured Spanish specie, combined with bills of exchange paid in British manufactures, fueled trade and industry. This sustained economic prosperity, even amidst a costly war, was unprecedented and showcased England's strength.",

Portugal, caught between England and Spain, ultimately chose to maintain the alliance with England, recognizing the greater immediate threat. The Peace of Paris in 1763 redrew the map of global power. France ceded Canada, Nova Scotia, and territories east of the Mississippi (excluding New Orleans) to England. Spain, in exchange for the return of Havana, ceded Florida.  This expanded England's colonial empire significantly across North America.  In the West Indies, some islands were exchanged, with England retaining strategically important territories.  Minorca returned to English control, and France ceded Louisiana west of the Mississippi to Spain. In India, France regained pre-war possessions but lost political influence, effectively ceding control to the English East India Company. Fishing rights in Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence were granted to France but denied to Spain. Public opinion in England, including prominent figures like Pitt, criticized the treaty's leniency, particularly the return of French colonies and Indian trading posts. These concessions allowed France to potentially rebuild its navy and commerce, challenging England’s maritime dominance. The restoration of Havana was also deemed insufficiently compensated by the acquisition of Florida.

    "text": "The terms of the peace after the Seven Years' War were simply the status quo ante helium.  To attribute the outcome solely to differences between land and sea war is absurd. Frederick's genius, backed by English money, matched the coalition.  States with good seaboards or ocean access benefit from seeking prosperity and extension through sea commerce rather than unsettling existing political arrangements in countries where long possession has conferred rights and created national allegiance. Since the 1763 Treaty of Paris, the world's waste places have been filled (North America, Australia, South America).  Nominal political possession often exists even in forsaken regions, but in many places, it's feeble and can't support itself. The Turkish Empire, kept erect by opposing forces and mutual jealousies, exemplifies weak political tenure; sea powers' interest and control are chief elements fixing the situation and directing future changes. The unstable political condition of Central and South American states causes anxiety about internal order and interferes with commerce and resource development.  As long as they 'hurt no one but themselves,' this can continue, but citizens of stable governments seeking to exploit their resources have borne losses from their distracted condition. As North American and Australian opportunities diminish, demand will arise for more settled governments in disordered states, ensuring security and institutional stability for merchants.  No present hope exists that this demand can be fulfilled with existing native materials; when it arises, no theoretical positions (like the Monroe Doctrine) will prevent interested nations from interfering politically. Such interference can cause collisions, sometimes settled by arbitration, but also war.  Even for peaceful solutions, the nation with the strongest organized force will have the strongest arguments. Piercing the Central American Isthmus could precipitate the inevitable moment of intervention.  Modified commercial routes and the political importance of such a channel for the US are not the whole question.  The time will come when stable governments for American tropical states must be assured by powerful American or European states.  Sea power will determine which foreign state predominates – if not by possession, by influence. The US has an undeniable advantage due to geography and power, but this won't avail if there's a great inferiority of organized force. The Seven Years' War holds living interest.  England, with a small army, defended her shores, carried arms in every direction, spread rule and influence, and bound remote regions to her, making them tributary to her wealth, strength, and reputation. As she loosened France and Spain's grasp in overseas regions, there's perhaps a prophecy of some future nation inclining the balance of power in a future sea war, whose scope will be the political future and economic development of regions previously lost to civilization; but not the US if she remains indifferent to the empire of the seas.",

    "section": "Naval Power of Great Britain",
    "text": "England's efforts, directed by national instinct and Pitt's genius, continued after the war and profoundly influenced her subsequent policy. Mistress of North America, lording over twenty million inhabitants in India through the company whose conquests native princes ratified – a population larger than Great Britain's with respectable revenue – England had before her the lesson of Spain's weakness. The words of an English naval historian about Spain apply to England today: \"Spain is precisely that power against which England can always contend with...advantage and honor. That extensive monarchy is exhausted at heart, her resources lie at a great distance, and whatever power commands the sea, may command the wealth and commerce of Spain. The dominions from which she draws her resources, lying at an immense distance from the capital and from one another, make it more necessary for her than for any other State to temporize, until she can inspire with activity all parts of her enormous but disjointed empire.\" Though untrue to say England is exhausted, her dependence on the outside world gives the phrase suggestiveness.  England hasn't overlooked this analogy.  Her sea power and the possessions it won have controlled her policy. The road to India – once a perilous voyage without English stopping-places – was reinforced by acquiring St. Helena, the Cape of Good Hope, and Mauritius.  When steam made the Red Sea route practicable, she acquired Aden and later Socotra.  Malta, acquired during the French Revolution, was claimed in 1815.  A thousand miles from Gibraltar, their military commands intersect.  The stretch from Malta to Suez is now guarded by Cyprus.  Egypt, despite French jealousy, is under English control.  Its importance to India, understood by Napoleon and Nelson, led the latter to send news of the Nile victory overland to Bombay. England's jealousy of Russia's Central Asian advance results from when her sea power wrenched India from French ambition. M. Martin, speaking of the Seven Years' War, said, \"For the first time since the Middle Ages, England had conquered France single-handed almost without allies, France having powerful auxiliaries. She had conquered solely by the superiority of her government.\" Yes, but by her government using sea power.  This made her rich and protected her trade.  With her money, she upheld Prussia and Hanover. Her power reached wherever her ships could, undisputed at sea.  Her mobility multiplied her forces and distracted enemies'.  Ruling the seas, she obstructed highways. Enemy fleets couldn't join; none could escape, or if so, only to meet veteran English crews. Except Minorca, she held her bases and seized the enemy's. Gibraltar blocked French squadrons; Louisburg aided the English fleet against Canada. The nation that gained used the sea for peacetime wealth and ruled it in war through naval extent, seafaring subjects, and numerous bases.  These bases lose value with obstructed communications. Hence, the French lost Louisburg, Martinique, Pondicherry; England lost Minorca. Service between bases and mobile forces is mutual. The navy is a light corps; it keeps its communications open, obstructs the enemy's, sweeps the sea for the land, and controls the desert so man can thrive.",

    "text": "The virtual annihilation of the French fleet in 1759 spurred national enthusiasm for naval restoration, skillfully guided by Choiseul.  Cities, corporations, and individuals contributed funds, leading to a surge of activity in French ports.  Choiseul also aimed to restore naval discipline and morale.  However, initiating these preparations mid-war proved too late.  Spain, in a better initial position with an estimated sixty ships-of-the-line, joined France against England. Despite this alliance, England's superior numbers, skill, experience, and prestige proved overwhelming. After the war, Choiseul continued naval restoration, fostering professional ambition among officers.  Shipbuilding flourished, resulting in forty ships-of-the-line by war's end and sixty-four ships-of-the-line and fifty frigates by 1770. Arsenals were stocked, and a timber reserve established.  Choiseul also addressed the aristocratic arrogance among naval officers, which undermined subordination.  A sense of social equality among officers, regardless of rank, hindered effective command.  This contrasted sharply with the ingrained meritocratic system of the British navy.  Insubordination plagued the French fleet, hindering even the capable Suffren. Choiseul's reforms struggled against this ingrained social hierarchy, ultimately remedied only by the revolution. Crew personnel, however, saw significant improvements, including the formation and training of a ten-thousand-strong gunner corps.  Simultaneously, Choiseul cultivated the Spanish alliance, encouraging Spain's progress under Charles III. While maintaining the Austrian alliance, he prioritized Spain due to its proximity, naval position, and shared animosity towards England over Gibraltar, Minorca, and Florida.",

    "text": "France's growing naval power caused concern in England, but internal issues and the brewing American colonial conflict restrained English action.  Two opportunities for conflict arose.  First, in 1764, Genoa effectively ceded Corsica to France.  Despite English protests, only a single voice in Parliament advocated war over this strategically important island.  Second, in 1770, a dispute over the Falkland Islands erupted. Spain, with a superior force, seized the English settlement at Port Egmont. This act, unlike the Corsican transfer, sparked outrage in England, prompting naval mobilization.  Spain, anticipating French support, initially resisted English demands. However, Louis XV's aversion to war and Choiseul's dismissal led to Spanish compliance, though the sovereignty issue remained unresolved.  These events demonstrated England's naval strength but also its reluctance to engage in war solely to counter rival naval development.  The first partition of Poland in 1772, facilitated by Choiseul's focus on naval policy and the Spanish alliance, further weakened France's traditional continental influence.  Louis XV's death in 1774, coinciding with escalating American colonial tensions, ushered in Louis XVI, who continued the policies of continental peace, Spanish alliance, and naval expansion. This foreign policy, inherited from Choiseul, targeted England's sea power as the primary threat and emphasized French sea power as the nation's principal defense. The instructions given to Louis XVI's ministers reflected this strategic vision: vigilance against threats, naval monitoring of key areas, observation of English military and economic conditions, covert support for American colonists, and continued, discreet naval development in preparation for potential conflict with England, coordinated with Spanish naval preparations.",

    "text": "assemble numerous troops upon the shores of Brittany and Normandy, and get everything ready for an invasion of England, so as to force her to concentrate her forces, and thus restrict her means of resistance at the extremities of the empire. Such instructions, whether given all at once as a symmetrical, well-thought-out plan, or from time to time, as occasion arose, showed that an accurate forecast of the situation had been made, and breathed a conviction which, if earlier felt, would have greatly modified the history of the two countries. The execution was less thorough than the conception. In the matter of developing the navy, however, fifteen years of peace and steady work showed good results. When war openly broke out in 1778, France had eighty ships-of-the-line in good condition, and sixty-seven thousand seamen were borne on the rolls of the maritime conscription. Spain, when she entered the war in 1779 as the ally of France, had in her ports nearly sixty ships-of-the-line. To this combination England opposed a total number of two hundred and twenty-eight ships of all classes, of which about one hundred and fifty were of the line. The apparent equality in material which would result from these numbers was affected, to the disadvantage of England, by the superior size and artillery of the French and Spaniards; but on the other hand her strength was increased by the unity of aim imparted by belonging to one nation. The allies were destined to feel the proverbial weakness of naval coalitions, as well as the degenerate administration of Spain, and the lack of habit — may it not even be said without injustice, of aptitude for the sea — of both nations. The naval policy with which Louis XVI. began his reign was kept up to the end; in 1791, two years after the assembly of the States-General, the French navy numbered eighty-six ships-of-the-line, generally superior, both in dimensions and model, to English ships of the same class. We have come, therefore, to the beginning of a truly maritime war; which, as will be granted by those who have followed this narrative, had not been seen since the days of De Ruyter and Tourville. The magnificence of sea power and its value had perhaps been more clearly shown by the uncontrolled sway, and consequent exaltation, of one belligerent; but the lesson thus given, if more striking, is less vividly interesting than the spectacle of that sea power meeting a foe worthy of its steel, and excited to exertion by a strife which endangered, not only its most valuable colonies, but even its own shores. Waged, from the extended character of the British Empire, in all quarters of the world at once, the attention of the student is called now to the East Indies and now to the West; now to the shores of the United States and thence to those of England; from New York and Chesapeake Bay to Gibraltar and Minorca, to the Cape Verde Islands, the Cape of Good Hope, and Ceylon. Fleets now meet fleets of equal size, and the general chase and the melee, which marked the actions of Hawke, Boscawen, and Anson, though they still occur at times, are for the most part succeeded by wary and complicated manoeuvres, too often barren of decisive results as naval battles, which are the prevailing characteristic of this coming war. The superior tactical science of the French succeeded in imparting to this conflict that peculiar feature of their naval policy, which subordinated the control of the sea by the destruction of the enemy's fleets, of his organized naval forces, to the success of particular operations, the retention of particular points, the carrying out of particular ulterior strategic ends.",

    "section": "Orders to French Admirals",
    "text": "It is not necessary to endeavor to force upon others the conviction of the present writer that such a policy, however applicable as an exception, is faulty as a rule; but it is most desirable that all persons responsible for the conduct of naval affairs should recognize that the two lines of policy, in direct contradiction to each other, do exist. In the one there is a strict analogy to a war of posts; while in the other the objective is that force whose destruction leaves the posts unsupported and therefore sure to fall in due time. These opposing policies being recognized, consideration should also be had of the results of the two as exemplified in the history of England and France. It was not, however, with such cautious views that the new king at first sought to impress his admirals. In the instructions addressed to the Count d'Orvilliers, commanding the first fleet sent out from Brest, the minister, speaking in the name of the king, says: — \"Your duty now is to restore to the French flag the lustre with which it once shone; past misfortunes and faults must be buried out of sight; only by the most illustrious actions can the navy hope to succeed in doing this. His Majesty has the right to expect the greatest efforts from his officers. . . . Under whatever circumstances the king's fleet may be placed, his Majesty's orders, which he expressly charges me to impress upon you, as well as upon all officers in command, are that his ships attack with the greatest vigor, and defend themselves, on all occasions, to the last extremity.\" More follows to the same effect; upon which a French officer, who has not before been quoted in connection with this phase of French naval policy, says: — \"How different this language from that held to our admirals during the last war; for it would be an error to believe that they followed by choice and temper the timid and defensive system which predominated in the tactics of the navy. The government, always finding the expenses exacted by the employment of the navy excessive, too often prescribed to its admirals to keep the sea as long as possible without coming to pitched battles, or even to brushes, generally very expensive, and from which might follow the loss of ships difficult to replace. Often they were enjoined, if driven to accept action, carefully to avoid compromising the fate of their squadron by too decisive encounters. They thought themselves, therefore, obliged to retreat as soon as an engagement took too serious a turn. Thus they acquired the unhappy habit of voluntarily yielding the field of battle as soon as an enemy, even inferior, boldly disputed it with them. Thus to send a fleet to meet the enemy, only to retire shamefully from his presence; to receive action instead of offering it; to begin battles only to end them with the semblance of defeat; to ruin moral force in order to save physical force, — that was the spirit which, as has been very judiciously said by M. Charles Dupin, guided the French ministry of that epoch. The results are known.\" The brave words of Louis XVI. were followed almost immediately by others, of different and qualifying tenor, to Admiral d'Orvilliers before he sailed. He was informed that the king, having learned the strength of the English fleet, relied upon his prudence as to the conduct to be followed at a moment when he had under his orders all the naval force of which France could dispose. As a matter of fact the two fleets were nearly equal; it would be impossible to decide which was the stronger, without detailed information as to the armament of every ship. D'Orvilliers found himself, as many a responsible man has before, with two sets of orders, on one or the other of which he was sure to be impaled, if unlucky; while the government, in the same event, was sure of a scape-goat.",

    "section": "Military Situation in America",
    "text": "The consideration of the relative force of the two navies, material and moral, has necessarily carried us beyond the date of the opening of the American Revolutionary War. Before beginning with that struggle, it may be well to supplement the rough estimate of England's total naval force, given, in lack of more precise information, by the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty made in the House of Lords in November, 1777, a very few months before the war with France began. Replying to a complaint of the opposition as to the smallness of the Channel fleet, he said: — “We have now forty-two ships-of-the-line in commission in Great Britain (without counting those on foreign service), thirty-five of which are completely manned, and ready for sea at a moment's warning. . . . I do not believe that either France or Spain entertains any hostile disposition toward us; but from what I have now submitted to you, I am authorized to affirm that our navy is more than a match for that of the whole House of Bourbon.” It must, however, be said that this pleasing prospect was not realized by Admiral Keppel when appointed to command in the following March, and looking at his fleet with (to use his own apt expression) “a seaman's eye;” and in June he went to sea with only twenty ships. It is plainly undesirable to insert in a narrative of this character any account of the political questions which led to the separation of the United States from the British Empire. It has already been remarked that the separation followed upon a succession of blunders by the English ministry, — not unnatural in view of the ideas generally prevalent at that day as to the relations of colonies to the mother-country. It needed a man of commanding genius to recognize, not only the substantial justice of the American claims, — many did that, — but also the military strength of their situation, as before indicated. This lay in the distance of the colonies from home, their nearness to each other independently of the command of the sea, the character of the colonists, — mainly of English and Dutch stock, — and the probable hostility of France and Spain. Unfortunately for England, the men most able to cope with the situation were in the minority and out of office. It has been said before that, had the thirteen colonies been islands, the sea power of Great Britain would have so completely isolated them that their fall, one after the other, must have ensued. To this it may be added that the narrowness of the strip then occupied by civilized man, and the manner in which it was intersected by estuaries of the sea and navigable rivers, practically reduced to the condition of islands, so far as mutual support went, great sections of the insurgent country, which were not large enough to stand alone, yet too large for their fall not to have been a fatal blow to the common cause. The most familiar case is that of the line of the Hudson, where the Bay of New York was held from the first by the British, who also took the city in September, 1776, two months after the Declaration of Independence. The difficulties in the way of moving up and down such a stream were doubtless much greater to sailing vessels than they now are to steamers; yet it seems impossible to doubt that active and capable men wielding the great sea power of England could so have held that river and Lake Champlain with ships-of-war at intervals and accompanying galleys as to have supported a sufficient army moving between the head-waters of the Hudson and the lake, while themselves preventing any intercourse by water between New England and the States west of the river. This operation would have closely resembled that by which in the Civil War the United States fleets and armies gradually cut in twain the Southern Confederacy by mastering the course of the Mississippi, and the political results would have been even more important than the military; for at that early stage of the war the spirit of independence was far more general and bitter in the section that would have been cut off, — in New England, — than in New York and New Jersey, perhaps than anywhere except in South Carolina.",

    "section": "Part 1: The North American Theater and Maritime Conflict",
    "text": "The British forces' corps were positioned out of mutual support, abandoning control of the Hudson River's water-line. While Burgoyne advanced with seven thousand regular troops and auxiliaries to seize the river's headwaters, fourteen thousand men were shifted from its mouth to the Chesapeake.  The remaining eight thousand near New York were tied to the city due to the American army's presence in New Jersey. This disastrous August maneuver led to Burgoyne's isolated surrender in October. The following May, the British evacuated Philadelphia, enduring a difficult retreat through New Jersey with Washington in pursuit, finally reaching New York.  Moving the British fleet to the Chesapeake's head, along with the 1814 Potomac ascent by English frigates, exposed another weak point in the American colonies. Unlike the Hudson-Champlain line, vulnerable at both ends to enemy control (Canada and the sea), this weakness was less critical. Regarding the broader sea warfare, the colonists, unable to confront the British fleet, relinquished sea control. They resorted to privateering, exploiting their maritime skills to disrupt English commerce. By 1778's end, American privateers had captured nearly a thousand merchant ships, valued at almost £2,000,000, although English historians claim heavier American losses.  This was plausible, given the superior support and power of British cruisers, while the growth of American commerce had astonished British statesmen. At war's outbreak, it rivaled England's own commerce at the century's beginning. The First Lord of the Admiralty highlighted North America's seafaring population, stating the navy's loss of eighteen thousand seamen from the last war due to \"not having America\"—a significant loss to any sea power, especially when these seamen potentially joined the enemy. Sea warfare predictably led to neutral grievances against English seizures of ships trading with America. However, such provocation wasn't needed to fuel French animosity and ambitions, given Britain's strained government. Choiseul's vengeful policy seemed near fruition.  Paris debated its stance and how to exploit the colonial revolt. They decided on maximum support short of open conflict with England. Beaumarchais, a Frenchman, received funds to establish a firm supplying war materials to the colonists. France and Spain each contributed a million francs, and Beaumarchais accessed government arsenals. Simultaneously, agents from the United States were received, and French officers joined American service with minimal government interference. Beaumarchais's operation began in 1776.  December saw Franklin's arrival in France, and Lafayette reached America in May 1777. War preparations, particularly naval, intensified; the French navy grew, and plans for a Channel invasion were made, while the colonies were the intended war theatre.  France had little to lose. Stripped of Canada, she believed war renewal, with a neutral Europe and friendly Americans, wouldn't cost her Caribbean islands. Acknowledging American opposition to Canada's return, France disavowed such aims while stipulating retention of any seized English West Indian possessions.  Spain's situation differed. Despising England, desiring Gibraltar, Minorca, and Jamaica's return (keystones of her sea power), she recognized the danger of successful English colonial rebellion as an example to her own vast colonial system, which provided substantial annual subsidies. If England's navy failed, what could Spain achieve?",

    "section": "Part 2: Spanish Dilemma, Treaty, and Military Overview",
    "text": "In the introductory chapter, the inherent contradiction in Spain’s position was highlighted: its revenue came not from a diversified, robust maritime economy but a fragile trickle of colonial wealth.  Spain had much to lose and potentially gain.  It remained the ideal adversary for England, but grievances and dynastic sympathies prevailed, leading Spain down the same covert hostile path as France. Burgoyne's surrender ignited this volatile situation. France, aware of American strength from past conflicts and expecting their assistance, now feared an independent America might reject alliances. The news reached Europe on December 2, 1777; by December 16, France offered recognition of American independence, a commercial treaty, and a contingent defensive alliance.  The rapid progress demonstrated France’s readiness, and the momentous treaty was signed on February 6, 1778.  Key aspects include France's renunciation of Canada and Nova Scotia (foreshadowing the Monroe Doctrine's principles, requiring naval strength for enforcement) and the alliance providing the Americans with a crucial counterbalance to British sea power. American pride notwithstanding, without French naval opposition, Britain could likely have subdued the Atlantic seaboard.  It’s vital to acknowledge the crucial role France played in American victory.  Before examining the maritime war, a review of the global military situation is needed. Three key differences distinguish it from the 1756 Seven Years’ War: America’s hostility towards England, Spain’s early alliance with France, and the other continental powers’ neutrality, freeing France from land-based distractions.  In North America, the Americans held Boston for two years. The British occupied Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, New York, and Philadelphia.  Chesapeake Bay, lacking strong fortifications, was vulnerable to any hostile fleet.  The South remained largely inactive since the failed 1776 Charleston attack; the war’s main events before France’s declaration were north of the Chesapeake. Conversely, the American campaign in Canada had failed, providing a secure base for British power.  In Europe, French and (to a lesser degree) Spanish naval preparedness contrasted sharply with previous wars.  England, isolated and defensive, faced the Bourbon monarchs' ambitions to conquer Gibraltar and Port Mahon and invade England. The first two were Spain's priorities, the last France’s, creating a divergence of aims that ultimately undermined the maritime coalition.  The introductory chapter touched upon the strategic issues arising from these conflicting objectives.",

    "section": "Part 3: West Indies, India, and Interconnected Theaters of War",
    "text": "In the West Indies, both sides held roughly equal ground, although this shouldn’t have been the case. France and England had strong positions in the Windward Islands—Martinique and Barbados, respectively. Barbados's windward location provided a significant strategic advantage in the age of sail. Fighting was largely concentrated around the Lesser Antilles.  Dominica, an English island situated between the French Martinique and Guadeloupe, was a desirable target and was subsequently seized. South of Martinique lay St. Lucia, a French colony.  Its sheltered harbor, Gros Islet Bay, offered an excellent vantage point for observing the French navy at Fort Royal, Martinique. The English captured the island, and Rodney used this secure anchorage to monitor and pursue the French fleet before his famous 1782 victory. The islands further south were of lesser military importance. Spain, controlling Cuba, Puerto Rico, and (jointly with France) Hispaniola, should have outweighed England, who held only Jamaica.  However, Spain’s contribution was negligible, and England was too preoccupied elsewhere to attack her. Spanish forces made their presence felt only in Florida (then an English possession), which didn’t join the colonial rebellion. In the East Indies, France had regained its trading posts in the 1763 peace, but unlike the British dominance in Bengal, France lacked comparable control in any part of the peninsula.  The English expanded their power in the following years, aided by capable leaders like Clive and Warren Hastings.  However, powerful native adversaries emerged in the south, presenting an ideal opportunity for France to regain influence when war erupted. Yet, the French government and people remained oblivious to the region's potential. England, however, recognized the opportunity.  The same day news of the war reached Calcutta (July 7, 1778), Hastings ordered an attack on Pondicherry and set the example by seizing Chandernagore. Naval forces on both sides were minimal, but the French commodore abandoned Pondicherry after a brief engagement, leading to its surrender after a seventy-day siege.  In March 1779, Mahé, the last French settlement, fell, and the French flag disappeared again. Simultaneously, a strong English squadron of six ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hughes arrived.  The lack of a comparable French force gave England complete sea control until Suffren's arrival nearly three years later. Meanwhile, Holland entered the war, and its stations—Negapatam on the Coromandel coast and the crucial Trincomalee harbor in Ceylon—were captured, the latter in January 1782 by joint army-navy operations. These successes solidified the military situation in India just before Suffren's arrival a month later transformed the nominal war into a fierce and bloody struggle. Suffren commanded a stronger squadron but lacked a friendly port to base operations against the English. Of the four main theaters—North America, West Indies, Europe, and India—the first two, due to proximity, were intertwined and directly influenced each other.  This was less apparent for the conflicts in Europe and India. The narrative therefore naturally divides into three main sections, which can be examined individually before considering their interplay and any valuable lessons.",

    "text": "On March 10, 1778, France formally recognized the United States and entered into a treaty with them, prompting England to recall its ambassador.  Despite England's disadvantageous position, Spain offered mediation, causing France to delay its attack.  In June, Admiral Keppel sailed from Portsmouth and initiated hostilities with French frigates, learning of a larger French fleet in Brest. After reinforcing, Keppel engaged D'Orvilliers's fleet west of Ushant on July 27, 1778. This indecisive battle, involving thirty ships-of-the-line on each side, resulted in no ships lost or captured.  The battle's lack of a clear victor fueled public and political controversy in England, with accusations exchanged between Keppel and another officer.  Tactically, the battle is notable for Keppel's attempt to force an action from a leeward position by ordering a general chase to windward, a move that eventually allowed the fleets to engage.  D'Orvilliers, initially unwilling to fight except on his own terms, responded to Keppel's maneuvers. The fleets exchanged ineffective broadsides while passing on opposite tacks. A potentially advantageous maneuver by the French van, commanded by the Duc de Chartres, was not executed, raising questions about the ideal position of a commander-in-chief during battle.",

    "text": "The Battle of Ushant highlighted the ongoing debate about the optimal position for a naval commander-in-chief.  D'Orvilliers's inability to directly control the French van led to a missed opportunity.  Various positions were considered: the center of the line offered equal visibility (or lack thereof) of the fleet's extremities; leading from the van provided direct leadership by example; and a position outside the line of battle, on a frigate, allowed for a clearer overview of the battle and better signal visibility, similar to a general's position on land.  The frigate position, adopted by Howe and the French, was later abandoned. Nelson, at Trafalgar, led from the front, but this may have been driven by his personal fighting spirit rather than tactical advantage.  The traditional practice was for the admiral to be in the center of the line. Nelson and Collingwood's leading of their columns at Trafalgar, while successful, exposed them to significant risk.  The loss of these key figures could have severely impacted the battle.  Their rapid disappearance into the smoke also limited their ongoing command and control.  The attack formation at Trafalgar, with two columns approaching a perpendicular line, sacrificed the leading ships to create breaches, into which fresher ships could then advance, effectively acting as a reserve.  This raises the question of whether the admiral should be positioned with this reserve to maintain control and influence later in the battle.",

    "text": "Farragut's practice, particularly later in his career after New Orleans and Vicksburg, was to lead from the front. At Mobile, he reluctantly agreed to take the second position and later regretted doing so. However, Farragut's battles differed from traditional fleet engagements. His objectives were to pass fortifications, not engage in prolonged battles, often under challenging pilotage conditions where he possessed superior knowledge of the terrain. This necessitated his leadership at the front, both literally and figuratively. By leading, he guided the fleet through safe passages, maintained visibility ahead of the smoke, and assumed responsibility for the chosen course, a responsibility a subordinate might hesitate to take. Notably, at Mobile, leaders of both columns questioned Farragut's intentions at a critical juncture, not due to unclear orders, but because the circumstances appeared different from what he had anticipated. This emphasizes the importance of the commander's direct presence and control in complex and dynamic situations.",

    "text": "Tecumseh,\" departed from the admiral's orders and left the course dictated to them, with disastrous results. There is no necessity to condemn either captain; but the irresistible inference is that Farragut was unqualifiedly right in his opinion that the man who alone has the highest responsibility should, under the conditions of his battles, be in the front. And here it must be remarked that at such critical moments of doubt any but the highest order of mind tends to throw off the responsibility of decision upon the superior, though from the instancy of the case hesitation or delay may be fatal. A man who as the commissioned chief would act intelligently, as the mere subordinate will balk. Nelson's action at St. Vincent will rarely be emulated, a truth which is strongly shown by the fact that Collingwood was immediately in his rear that day, and did not imitate his action till signaled by the commander-in-chief; yet after receiving the authority of the signal, he particularly distinguished himself by his judgment and daring. It will be recalled, also, in connection with this question of pilot-ground battles, that a central position nearly lost the flag-ship at New Orleans, owing to the darkness and to the smoke from the preceding ships; the United States fleet came near finding itself without its leader after the passage of the forts. Now as the mention of a reserve prompted one set of considerations, so the name of pilotage suggests certain ideas, broader than itself, which modify what has been said of keeping the admiral with the reserve. The ease and quickness with which a steam fleet can change its formation make it very probable that a fleet bearing down to attack may find itself, almost at the very moment of collision, threatened with some unlooked-for combination; then where would be the happiest position for an admiral? Doubtless in that part of his own order where he could most readily pilot his ships into the new disposition, or direction, by which he would meet the changed conditions; that is, in the position of leading. It would seem that there are always two moments of greatest importance in a sea-fight; one which determines the method of the main attack, the other the bringing up and directing the effort of the reserve. If the first is more important, the second perhaps requires the higher order of ability; for the former may and should proceed on a before-determined plan, while the latter may, and often must, be shaped to meet unforeseen exigencies. The conditions of sea-battles of the future contain one element that land battles cannot have, — the extreme rapidity with which encounters and changes of order can take place. However troops may be moved by steam to the field of battle, they will there fight on foot or on horseback, and with a gradual development of their plan, which will allow the commander-in-chief time to make his wishes known (as a rule, of course), in case of a change in the enemy's attack. On the other hand, a fleet, comparatively small in numbers and with its component units clearly defined, may be meditating an important change of which no sign can appear until it begins, and which will occupy but a few minutes. So far as these remarks are sound, they show the need of a second in command thoroughly conversant with not only the plans, but with the leading principles of action of his chief, — a need plain enough from the fact that the two extremities of the order-of-battle may be necessarily remote, and that you want the spirit of the leader at both extremities. As he cannot be there in person, the best thing is to have an efficient second at one end.",

    "text": "As regards Nelson's position at Trafalgar, mentioned at the beginning of this discussion, it is to be noted that the \"Victory\" did nothing that another ship could not have done as well, and that the lightness of the wind forbade the expectation of any sudden change in the enemy's order. The enormous risk run by the person of the admiral, on whose ship was concentrated the fire of the enemy's line, and which led several captains to implore a change, was condemned long before by Nelson himself in one of his letters after the battle of the Nile: — \"I think, if it had pleased God I had not been wounded, not a boat would have escaped to have told the tale; but do not believe that any individual in the fleet is to blame. ... I only mean to say that if my experience could in person have directed those individuals, there was every appearance that Almighty God would have continued to bless my endeavors,\" etc. Yet, notwithstanding such an expression of opinion based upon experience, he took the most exposed position at Trafalgar, and upon the loss of the leader there followed a curious exemplification of its effects. Collingwood at once, rightly or wrongly, avoidably or unavoidably, reversed Nelson's plans, urged with his last breath. \"Anchor! Hardy, do you anchor!\" said the dying chief. \"Anchor!\" said Collingwood. \"It is the last thing I should have thought of.\"",

    "text": "On the 15th of April, 1778, Admiral Comte d'Estaing sailed from Toulon for the American continent, having under his command twelve ships-of-the-line and five frigates. With him went as a passenger a minister accredited to Congress, who was instructed to decline all requests for subsidies, and to avoid explicit engagements relative to the conquest of Canada and other British possessions. \"The Cabinet of Versailles,\" says a French historian, \"was not sorry for the United States to have near them a cause of anxiety, which would make them feel the value of the French alliance.\" While acknowledging the generous sympathy of many Frenchmen for their struggle, Americans need not blind themselves to the self-interestedness of the French government. Neither should they find fault; for its duty was to consider French interests first. D'Estaing's progress was very slow. It is said that he wasted much time in drills, and even uselessly. However that may be, he did not reach his destination, the Capes of the Delaware, until the 8th of July, — making a passage of twelve weeks, four of which were spent in reaching the Atlantic. The English government had news of his intended sailing; and in fact, as soon as they recalled their ambassador at Paris, orders were sent to America to evacuate Philadelphia, and concentrate upon New York. Fortunately for them, Lord Howe's movements were marked by a vigor and system other than D'Estaing's. First assembling his fleet and transports in Delaware Bay, and then hastening the embarkation of stores and supplies, he left Philadelphia as soon as the army had marched from there for New York. Time was taken up in reaching the mouth of the bay; but he sailed from it the 28th of June, ten days before D'Estaing arrived, though more than ten weeks after he had sailed. Once outside, a favoring wind took the whole fleet to Sandy Hook in two days. War is unforgiving; the prey that D'Estaing had missed by delays foiled him in his attempts upon both New York and Rhode Island. The day after Howe's arrival at Sandy Hook the English army reached the heights of Navesink, after an harassing march through New Jersey, with Washington's troops hanging upon its rear. By the active co-operation of the navy it was carried up to New York by the 5th of July; and Howe then went back to bar the entrance to the port against the French fleet. As no battle followed, the details of his arrangements will not be given; but a very full and interesting account by an officer of the fleet can be found in Eldns's \"Naval Battles.\" Attention, however, may well be called to the combination of energy, thought, skill, and determination shown by the admiral. The problem before him was to defend a practicable pass with six sixty-four-gun ships and three of fifty, against eight of seventy-four guns or over, three sixty-fours, and one fifty, — it may be said against nearly double his own force. D'Estaing anchored outside, south of the Hook, on the 11th of July, and there remained until the 22d, engaged in sounding the bar, and with every apparent determination to enter. On the 22d a high northeast wind, coinciding with a spring tide, raised the water on the bar to thirty feet. The French fleet got under way, and worked up to windward to a point fair for crossing the bar. Then D'Estaing's heart failed him under the discouragement of the pilots; he gave up the attack and stood away to the southward.",

    "text": "Naval officers cannot but sympathize with the hesitation of a commander to disregard the advice of pilots, especially on a coast unknown to him; but such sympathy should not close their eyes to the highest type of character. Let any one compare the action of D'Estaing at New York with that of Nelson at Copenhagen and the Nile, or that of Farragut at Mobile and Port Hudson, and the inferiority of the Frenchman as a military leader, guided only by military considerations, is painfully apparent. New York was the very centre of the British power; its fall could not but have shortened the war. In fairness to D'Estaing, however, it must be remembered that other than military considerations had to weigh with him. The French admiral doubtless had instructions similar to those of the French minister, and he probably reasoned that France had nothing to gain by the fall of New York, which might have led to peace between America and England, and left the latter free to turn all her power against his own country. Less than that would have been enough to decide his wavering mind as to risking his fleet over the bar. Howe was more fortunate than D'Estaing, in having no divided purposes. Having escaped from Philadelphia and saved New York by his diligence, he had in store the further honor of saving Rhode Island by the like rapid movements. Scattered ships-of-war from a fleet despatched from England now began to arrive. On the 28th of July Howe was informed that the French fleet, which had disappeared to the southward, had been seen heading for Rhode Island. In four days his fleet was ready for sea, but owing to contrary winds did not reach Point Judith till the 9th of August. There he anchored, and learned that D'Estaing had run the batteries the day before and anchored between Gould and Canonicut Islands; the Seakonnet and Western passages had also been occupied by French ships, and the fleet was prepared to sustain the American army in an attack upon the British works. The arrival of Howe, although his reinforcements did not raise the English fleet to over two thirds the strength of the French, upset D'Estaing's plans. With the prevailing summer southwest breezes blowing straight into the bay, he was exposed to any attempts his adversary might make.",

    "section": "ACTIVITY SHOWN BY HOWE",
    "text": "The Eng:lish fell back on New York. The French rallied again off the entrance of Narragansett Bay ; but D'Estaino- decided that he could not remain on account of the damage to the squadron, and accordingly sailed for Boston on the 21st of August. Rhode Island was thus left to the English, who retained it for a year longer, evacuating then for strategic reasons. Howe on his part diligently repaired his ships, and sailed again for Rhode Island when he heard of the French being there ; but meeting on the way a vessel with word of their going to Boston, he followed them to that harbor, in which they were too strongly placed to be attacked. Taking into consideration his enforced return to New York, the neces- sary repairs, and the fact that he was only four days behind the French at Boston, it may be believed that Howe showed to the end the activity which characterized the beginning of his operations. Scarcely a shot had been exchanged between the two fleets, yet the weaker had thoroughly outgeneral led the stronger. With the exception of the manoeuvres for the weather-gage after D'Estaing left Newport, which have not been preserved, and of Howe's dispositions to receive the expected attack in New York Bay, the lessons are not tactical, but strategic, and of present application. Chief among them undoubtedly stands the value of celerity and watchfulness, combined with knowl- edge of one's profession. Howe learned of his danger by advices from home three weeks after D'Estaing sailed from Toulon. He had to gather in his cruisers from the Chesa- peake and outside, get his ships-of-the-line from New York and Rhode Island, embark the supplies of an army of ten thousand men, move down the Delaware, — which unavoidably took ten days, — and round to New York again. D'Estaing was ten days behind him at the Delaware, twelve days at Sandy Hook, and only one day ahead of him in entering Newport, outside which harbor he had lain ten days before sailing in. An English narrator in the fleet, speaking of the untiring labor between June 30, when the English army reached Navesink, and the arrival of the French fleet on the 364 SUCCESS OF HOWE'S MOVEMENTS. 11th of July, says : \" Lord Howe attended in person as usual, and by his presence animated the zeal and quickened the industry of officers and men.\" In this quality he was a marked contrast to his amiable but indolent brother, Gen- eral Howe. The same industry and watchfulness marked his remaining operations. As soon as the French ships hauled off to the southward, lookout vessels followed them, and preparations continued (notably of fireships) for pursuit. The last ship that joined from England crossed the bar at New York on the 30th of July\n. On the 1st of August the fleet was ready for sea, with four fire-ships. The accident of the wind delayed his next movements; but, as has been seen, he came up only one day after the entrance of the enemy into Newport, which his inferior force could not have pre- vented. But the object of the enemy, which he could not oppose, was frustrated by his presence. D'Estaing was no sooner in Newport tiian he wished himself out. Howe's position was strategically excellent. With his weatherly position in reference to the prevailing winds, the difficulty of beating a fleet out through the narrow entrance to the harbor would expose the French ships trying it to be at- tacked in detail ; while if the wind unluckily came fair, the admiral relied upon his own skill to save his squadron.",

    "text": "D'Estaing, having repaired his ships, sailed with liis whole force for Martinique on the -Ith of November ; on the same day Commodore Hotham left New York for Barbadoes, with five sixty-four and fifty-gun ships and a convoy of five thousand troops, destined for the conquest of Sta. Lucia Island. On the way a heavy gale of wind injured the French fleet more than the English, the French flag-ship losing her main and mizzcn topmasts. The loss of these spars, and the fact that twelve unencumbered ships-of-war reached Martinique only one day before the convoy of fifty-nine English transports reached Barbadoes, a hundred miles farther on, tells badly for the professional skill which then and now is a determining feature in naval war. Admiral Barrington, commanding at Barbadoes, showed the same energy as Howe. The transports arrived on the 10th ; the troops were kept on board ; sailed on the morning of the 12th for Sta. Lucia, and anchored there at three p. m, the 13th. The same afternoon half the troops were landed, and the rest the next morning. They seized at once a better port, to which the admiral was about to move the transports when the appearance of D'Estaing prevented him. All that night of the transports were being warped inside the ships-of-war, and the latter anchored across the entrance to the bay, espe- cial care being taken to strengthen the two extremities of the line, and to prevent the enemy from passing inside the weather end, as the English ships in after years did at the battle of the Nile. The French was much more than double the Englisli fleet ; and if the latter were destroyed, the transports and troops would be trapped. D'Estaing stood down along the English order twice from north to south, cannonading at long range, but did not anchor. Abandoning then his intentions against the fleet, he moved to another bay, landed some French soldiers, and assaulted the position of the English troops. Failing here also, ho retired to Martinique ; and the French garrison, which had been driven into the interior of the island, surrendered. It seems scarcely necessary to point out the admirable dili- gence of Admiral Barrington, to which and to the skill of his dispositions he owed this valuable strategic success ; for such it was. Sta. Lucia was the island next south of Martinique, and the harbor of Gros Hot at its northern end was especially adapted to the work of watching the French depot at Fort Royal, their principal station in the West Indies. Thence Rodney pursued them before his great action in 1782. The absence of precise information causes hesitation in con- demning D'Estaing for this mortifying failure. His respon- sibility depends upon the wind, which may have been light under the land, and upon his power to anchor. The fact, however, remains that he passed twice along the enemy's line within cannon-shot, yet did not force a decisive action. His course was unfavorably criticised by the great SufTren, then one of his captains.^ The English had thus retrieved the capture of Dominica, which had been taken on the 8th of September by the French governor of the West India Islands. There being no English squadron there, no difficulty had been met. The value of Dominica to the French has been pointed out; and it is ^ See page 42G.",

Lucia to enforce what has before been said, that the posses- sion of these smaller islands depended solely upon the naval preponderance. Upon the grasp of this principle held by any one will depend his criticism upon the next action of D'Estaing, to be immediately related. Six months of almost entire quiet followed the affair of Sta. Lucia. The English were reinforced by the fleet of Byron, who took chief command ; but the French, being joined by ten more ships-of-the-line, remained superior in numbers. About the middle of June, Byron sailed with his fleet to protect a large convoy of merchant-ships, bound for England, till they were clear of the islands. D'Estaing then sent a very small expe- dition which seized St. Vincent, June 16, 1779, without diffi- culty ; and on the 30th of June he sailed with his whole fleet to attack Grenada. Anchoring off Georgetown on the 2d of July, he landed his soldiers, and on the 4th the garrison of seven hundred men surrendered the island. Meanwhile Byron, hearing of the loss of St. Vincent and probable attack on Grenada, sailed with a large convoy of vessels carrying troops, and with twenty-one ships-of-the-line, to regain the one and relieve the other. Receiving on the way definite in- formation that the French were before Grenada, he kept on for it, rounding the northwest point of the island at day- break of July 6. His approach had been reported the day before to D'Estaing, who remained at anchor,^ fearing lest with the currents and light winds he might drop too far to leeward if he let go the bottom. When the English came in sight, the French got under way ; but the confused mass- ing of their ships prevented Byron from recognizing at once the disparity of numbers, they having twenty-five ships-of- the-line. He made signal for a general chase, and as the disorder of the French fleet forced it to form on the lee- wardmost ships, the English easily retained the advantage of the wind with which they approached.

As the signal so far commanded a general chase, the three fastest of the English, among which was the flag of the second in command, Admiral Barrington, came under fire of the French centre and rear, apparently unsupported (b), and suffered much from the consequent concentration of fire upon them. When they reached the sternmost ships they wore upon the same tack with them and stood north, after and to windward of them; and at about the same time Byron, who had not before known of the surrender, saw the French flag flying over the forts. Signals followed to wear in succession, and for the advanced ships to form line for mutual support, ceasing the general chase under which the engagement had hitherto been fought. While the main body was still standing south on the port tack, three ships, — 'Cornwall,' 'Grafton,' and 'Lion' (c), — obeying literally the signal for close action, had passed much to leeward of the others, drawing upon themselves most of the fire of the enemy's line. They thus suffered very severely in men and spars; and though finally relieved by the advanced ships, as these approached from the southward on the opposite tack, they were unable, after wearing (B, c', c''), to keep up with the fleet, and so dropped astern and toward the French. The bulk of the injury sustained by the English fell upon these three, upon the three advanced ships under Barrington, and upon two others in the rear (A, a), which, seeing the van so heavily engaged, did not follow the successive movement, but bore down straight out of the order, and took their places at the head of the column (B, a, a'), — an act strongly resembling that which won Nelson such high renown at Cape St. Vincent, but involving less responsibility.",

This is criticized as a flawed principle, as control of the sea was essential for holding the West Indies. D'Estaing's actions are further questioned due to his failures at the Delaware, New York, and Rhode Island, as well as the affair at Sta. Lucia.  His bravery in leading assaults at Sta.

    "section": "Breaking the Line",
    "text": "The failure sprang from the signal-book and tactical inefficiency of the fleet, for which he, having lately joined, was not answerable. But the ugliness of his fence was so apparent to De Guichen, that he exclaimed, when the English fleet kept away the first time, that six or seven of his ships were gone; and sent word to Rodney that if his signals had been obeyed he would have had him for his prisoner. A more convincing proof that he recognized the dangerousness of his enemy is to be found in the fact that he took care not to have the lee-gage in their subsequent encounters. Rodney's careful plans being upset, he showed that with them he carried all the stubborn courage of the most downright fighter; taking his own ship close to the enemy and ceasing only when the latter hauled off, her foremast and mainyard gone, and her hull so damaged that she could hardly be kept afloat.\nAn incident of this battle mentioned by French writers and by Botta, who probably drew upon French authorities, but not found in the English accounts, shows the critical nature of the attack in the apprehension of the French. According to them, Rodney, marking a gap in their order due to a ship in rear of the French admiral being out of station, tried to break through; but the captain of the \"Destin,\" seventy-four, pressed up under more sail and threw himself across the path of the English ninety-gun ship. \"The action of the 'Destin' was justly praised,\" says Lapeyrouse-Bonfils. \"The fleet ran the danger of almost certain defeat, but for the bravery of M. de Goimpy. Such, after the affair, was the opinion of the whole French squadron. Yet, admitting that our line was broken, what disasters then would necessarily threaten the fleet? Would it not always have been easy for our rear to remedy the accident by promptly standing on to fill the place of the vessels cut off? That movement would necessarily have brought about a melee, which would have turned to the advantage of the fleet having the bravest and most devoted captains. But then, as under the empire, it was an acknowledged principle that ships cut off were ships taken, and the belief wrought its own fulfilment.\"\nThe effect of breaking an enemy's line, or order-of-battle, depends upon several conditions. The essential idea is to divide the opposing force by penetrating through an interval found, or made, in it, and then to concentrate upon that one of the fractions which can be least easily helped by the other. In a column of ships this will usually be the rear. The compactness of the order attacked, the number of the ships cut off, the length of time during which they can be isolated and outnumbered, will all affect the results. A very great factor in the issue will be the moral effect, the confusion introduced into a line thus broken. Ships coming up toward the break are stopped, the rear doubles up, while the ships ahead continue their course. Such a moment is critical, and calls for instant action; but the men are rare who in an unforeseen emergency can see, and at once take the right course, especially if, being subordinates, they incur responsibility. In such a scene of confusion the English, without presumption, hoped to profit by their better seamanship; for it is not only \"courage and devotion,\" but skill, which then tells. All these effects of \"breaking the line\" received illustration in Rodney's great battle in 1782.",

    "text": "De Guichen and Rodney met twice again in the following month, but on neither occasion did the French admiral take the favorite lee-gage of his nation. Meanwhile a Spanish fleet of twelve ships-of-the-line was on its way to join the French. Rodney cruised to windward of Martinique to intercept them; but the Spanish admiral kept a northerly course, sighted Guadeloupe, and thence sent a despatch to De Guichen, who joined his allies and escorted them into port. The great preponderance of the coalition, in numbers, raised the fears of the English islands; but lack of harmony led to delays and hesitations, a terrible epidemic raged in the Spanish squadron, and the intended operations came to nothing. In August De Guichen sailed for France with fifteen ships. Rodney, ignorant of his destination, and anxious about both North America and Jamaica, divided his fleet, leaving one half in the islands, and with the remainder sailing for New York, where he arrived on the 12th of September. The risk thus run was very great, and scarcely justifiable; but no ill effect followed the dispersal of forces. Had De Guichen intended to turn upon Jamaica, or, as was expected by Washington, upon New York, neither part of Rodney's fleet could well have withstood him. Two chances of disaster, instead of one, were run, by being in small force on two fields instead of in full force on one.\nRodney's anxiety about North America was well grounded. On the 12th of July of this year the long expected French succor arrived,—five thousand French troops under Rochambeau and seven ships-of-the-line under De Ternay. Hence the English, though still superior at sea, felt forced to concentrate at New York, and were unable to strengthen their operations in Carolina. The difficulty and distance of movements by land gave such an advantage to sea power that Lafayette urged the French government further to increase the fleet; but it was still naturally and properly attentive to its own immediate interests in the Antilles. It was not yet time to deliver America.\nRodney, having escaped the great hurricane of October, 1780, by his absence, returned to the West Indies later in the year, and soon after heard of the war between England and Holland; which, proceeding from causes which will be mentioned later, was declared December 20, 1780. The admiral at once seized the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius and St. Martin, besides numerous merchant-ships, with property amounting in all to fifteen million dollars. These islands, while still neutral, had played a role similar to that of Nassau during the American Civil War, and had become a great depot of contraband goods, immense quantities of which now fell into the English hands. The year 1780 had been gloomy for the cause of the United States, The battle of Camden had seemed to settle the English yoke on South Carolina, and the enemy formed high hopes of controlling both North Carolina and Virginia. The treason of Arnold following had increased the depression, which was but partially relieved by the victory at King's Mountain. The substantial aid of French troops was the most cheerful spot in the situation. Yet even that had a checkered light, the second division of the intended help being blocked in Brest by the English fleet; while the final failure of De Guichen to appear, and Rodney coming in his stead, made the hopes of the campaign fruitless.\nA period of vehement and decisive action was, however, at hand. At the end of March, 1781, the Comte de Grasse sailed from Brest with twenty-six ships-of-the-line and a large convoy. When off the Azores, five ships parted company for the East Indies, under Suffren, of whom more will be heard later on. De Grasse came in sight of Martinique on the 28th of April.",

    "text": "Admiral Hood (Rodney having remained behind at St. Eustatius) was blockading before Fort Royal, the French port and arsenal on the lee side of the island, in which were four ships-of-the-line, when his lookouts reported the enemy's fleet. Hood had two objects before him,—one to prevent the junction of the four blockaded ships with the approaching fleet, the other to keep the latter from getting between him and Gros Hot Bay in Sta. Lucia. Instead of effecting this in the next twenty-four hours, by beating to windward of the Diamond Rock, his fleet got so far to leeward that De Grasse, passing through the channel on the 29th, headed up for Fort Royal, keeping his convoy between the fleet and the island. For this false position Hood was severely blamed by Rodney, but it may have been due to light winds and the lee current. However that be, the four ships in Fort Royal got under way and joined the main body. The English had now only eighteen ships to the French twenty-four, and the latter were to windward; but though thus in the proportion of four to three, and having the power to attack, De Grasse would not do it. The fear of exposing his convoy prevented him from running the chance of a serious engagement. Great must have been his distrust of his forces, one would say. When is a navy to fight, if this was not a time? He carried on a distant cannonade, with results so far against the English as to make his backwardness yet more extraordinary. Can a policy or a tradition which justifies such a line of conduct be good?\nThe following day, April 30, De Grasse, having thrown away his chance, attempted to follow Hood; but the latter had no longer any reason for fighting, and his original inferiority was increased by the severe injuries of some ships on the 29th. De Grasse could not overtake him, owing to the inferior speed of his fleet, many of the ships not being coppered,—a fact worthy of note, as French vessels by model and size were generally faster than English; but this superiority was sacrificed through the delay of the government in adopting the new improvement. Hood rejoined Rodney at Antigua, and De Grasse, after remaining a short time at Fort Royal, made an attempt upon Gros Hot Bay, the possession of which by the English kept all the movements of his fleet under surveillance. Foiled here, he moved against Tobago, which surrendered June 2, 1781. Sailing thence, after some minor operations, he anchored on the 26th of July at Cap Français (now Cape Haytien), in the island of Hayti. Here he found awaiting him a French frigate from the United States, bearing despatches from Washington and Rochambeau, upon which he was to take the most momentous action that fell to any French admiral during the war.",

    "text": "The invasion of the Southern States by the English, beginning in Georgia and followed by the taking of Charleston and the military control of the two extreme States, had been pressed on to the northward by way of Camden into North Carolina. On the 16th of August, 1780, General Gates was totally defeated at Camden; and during the following nine months the English under Cornwallis persisted in their attempts to overrun North Carolina. These operations, the narration of which is foreign to our immediate subject, had ended by forcing Cornwallis, despite many successes in actual encounter, to fall back exhausted toward the seaboard, and finally upon Wilmington, in which place depots for such a contingency had been established. His opponent, General Greene, then turned the American troops toward South Carolina. Cornwallis, too weak to dream of controlling, or even penetrating, into the interior of an unfriendly country, had now to choose between returning to Charleston, to assure there and in South Carolina the shaken British power, and moving northward again into Virginia, there to join hands with a small expeditionary force operating on the James River under Generals Phillips and Arnold. To fall back would be a confession that the weary marching and fighting of months past had been without results, and the general readily convinced himself that the Chesapeake was the proper seat of war, even if New York itself had to be abandoned. The commander-in-chief, Sir Henry Clinton, by no means shared this opinion, upon which was justified a step taken without asking him. \"Operations in the Chesapeake,\" he wrote, \"are attended with great risk unless we are sure of a permanent superiority at sea. I tremble for the fatal consequences that may ensue.\" For Cornwallis, taking the matter into his own hands, had marched from Wilmington on the 25th of April, 1781, joining the British already at Petersburg on the 20th of May.",

    "text": "The forces thus united numbered seven thousand men. Driven back from the open country of South Carolina into Charleston, there now remained two centres of British power, — at New York and in the Chesapeake. With New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the hands of the Americans, communication between the two depended wholly upon the sea. Despite his unfavorable criticism of Cornwallis's action, Clinton had himself already risked a large detachment in the Chesapeake. A body of sixteen hundred men under Benedict Arnold had ravaged the country of the James and burned Richmond in January of this same year. In the hopes of capturing Arnold, Lafayette had been sent to Virginia with a nucleus of twelve hundred troops, and on the evening of the 8th of March the French squadron at Newport sailed, in concerted movement, to control the waters of the bay. Admiral Arbuthnot, commanding the English fleet lying in Gardiner's Bay, learned the departure by his lookouts, and started in pursuit on the morning of the 10th, thirty-six hours later. Favored either by diligence or luck, he made such good time that when the two fleets came in sight of each other, a little outside of the capes of the Chesapeake, the English were leading. They at once went about to meet their enemy, who, on his part, formed a line-of-battle. The wind at this time was west, so that neither could head directly into the bay. The two fleets were nearly equal in strength, there being eight ships on each side; but the English had one ninety-gun ship, while of the French one was only a heavy frigate, which was put into the line. Nevertheless, the case was eminently one for the general French policy to have determined the action of a vigorous chief, and the failure to see the matter through must fall upon the good-will of Commodore Des Touches, or upon some other cause than that preference for the ulterior objects of the operations, of which the reader of French naval history hears so much. The weather was boisterous and threatening, and the wind, after hauling once or twice, settled down to northeast, with a big sea, but was then fair for entering the bay. The two fleets were by this time both on the port tack standing out to sea, the French leading, and about a point on the weather bow of the English. From this position they wore in succession ahead of the latter, taking the lee-gage, and thus gaining the use of their lower batteries, which the heavy sea forbade to the weather-gage. The English stood on till abreast the enemy's line, when they wore together, and soon after attacked in the usual manner, and with the usual results. The three van ships were very badly injured aloft, but in their turn, throwing their force mainly on the two leaders of the enemy, crippled them seriously in hulls and rigging. The French van then kept away, and Arbuthnot, in perplexity, ordered his van to haul the wind again. M. Destouches now executed a very neat movement by defiling. Signalling his van to haul up on the other tack, he led the rest of his squadron by the disabled English ships, and after giving them the successive broadsides of his comparatively fresh ships, wore, and out to sea. This was the end of the battle, in which the English certainly got the worst; but with their usual tenacity of purpose, being unable to pursue their enemy afloat, they steered for the bay, made the junction with Arnold, and thus broke up the plans of the French and Americans, from which so much had been hoped by Washington.",

    "text": "The way of the sea being thus open and held in force, two thousand more English troops sailing from New York reached Virginia on the 26th of March, and the subsequent arrival of Cornwallis in May raised the number to seven thousand. The operations of the contending forces during the spring and summer months, in which Lafayette commanded the Americans, do not concern our subject. Early in August, Cornwallis, acting under orders from Clinton, withdrew his troops into the peninsula between the York and James rivers, and occupied Yorktown. Washington and Rochambeau had met on the 21st of May, and decided that the situation demanded that the effort of the French West Indian fleet, when it came, should be directed against either New York or the Chesapeake. This was the tenor of the despatch found by De Grasse at Cap Français, and meantime the allied generals drew their troops toward New York, where they would be on hand for the furtherance of one object, and nearer the second if they had to make for it. In either case the result, in the opinion both of Washington and of the French government, depended upon superior sea power; but Rochambeau had privately notified the admiral that his own preference was for the Chesapeake as the scene of the intended operations, and moreover the French government had declined to furnish the means for a formal siege of New York. The enterprise therefore assumed the form of an extensive military combination, dependent upon ease and rapidity of movement, and upon blinding the eyes of the enemy to the real objective, — purposes to which the peculiar qualities of a navy admirably lent themselves. The shorter distance to be traversed, the greater depth of water and easier pilotage of the Chesapeake, were further reasons which would commend the scheme to the judgment of a seaman; and De Grasse readily accepted it, without making difficulties or demanding modifications which would have involved discussion and delay. Having made his decision, the French admiral acted with great good judgment, promptitude, and vigor. The same frigate that brought despatches from Washington was sent back, so that by August 15th the allied generals knew of the intended coming of the fleet. Thirty-five hundred soldiers were spared by the governor of Cap Français, upon the condition of a Spanish squadron anchoring at the place, which De Grasse procured. He also raised from the governor of Havana the money urgently needed by the Americans; and finally, instead of weakening his force by sending convoys to France, as the court had wished, he took every available ship to the Chesapeake. To conceal his coming as long as possible, he passed through the Bahama Channel, as a less frequented route, and on the 30th of August anchored in Lynnhaven Bay, just within the capes of the Chesapeake, with twenty-eight ships-of-the-line. Three days before, August 27, the French squadron at Newport, eight ships-of-the-line with four frigates and eighteen transports under M. de Barras, sailed for the rendezvous; making, however, a wide circuit out to sea to avoid the English. This course was the more necessary as the French siege-artillery was with it. The troops under Washington and Rochambeau had crossed the Hudson on the 24th of August, moving toward the head of Chesapeake Bay. Thus the different armed forces, both land and sea, were converging toward their objective, Cornwallis. The English were unfortunate in all directions. Rodney, learning of De Grasse's departure, sent fourteen ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hood to North America, and himself sailed for England in August, on account of ill health. Hood, going by the direct route, reached the Chesapeake three days before De Grasse, looked into the bay, and finding it empty went on to New York. There he met five ships-of-the-line under Admiral Graves, who, being senior officer, took command of the whole force and sailed on the 31st of August for the Chesapeake, hoping to intercept De Barras before he could join De Grasse. It was not till two days later that Sir Henry Clinton was persuaded that the allied armies had gone against Cornwallis, and had too far the start to be overtaken. Admiral Graves was painfully surprised, on making the Chesapeake, to find anchored there a fleet which from its numbers could only be an enemy's. Nevertheless, he stood in to meet it, and as De Grasse got under way, allowing his ships to be counted, the sense of numerical inferiority — nineteen to twenty-four — did not deter the English admiral from attacking. The clumsiness of his method, however, betrayed his gallantry; many of his ships were roughly handled, without any advantage being gained. De Grasse, expecting De Barras, remained outside five days, keeping the English fleet in play without coming to action; then returning to port he found De Barras safely at anchor. Graves went back to New York, and with him disappeared the last hope of succor that was to gladden Cornwallis's eyes. The siege was steadily endured, but the control of the sea made only one issue possible, and the English forces were surrendered October 19, 1781. With this disaster the hope of subduing the colonies died in England. The conflict flickered through a year longer, but no serious operations were undertaken.",

    "text": "In the conduct of the English operations, which ended thus unfortunately, there was both bad management and ill fortune. Hood's detachment might have been strengthened by several ships from Jamaica, had Rodney's orders been carried out. The despatch-ship, also, sent by him to Admiral Graves commanding in New York, found that officer absent on a cruise to the eastward, with a view to intercept certain very important supplies which had been forwarded by the American agent in France. The English Court had laid great stress upon cutting off this convoy; but, with the knowledge that he had of the force accompanying it, the admiral was probably ill-advised in leaving his headquarters himself, with all his fleet, at the time when the approach of the hurricane season in the West Indies directed the active operations of the navies toward the continent. In consequence of his absence, although Rodney's despatches were at once sent on by the senior officer in New York, the vessel carrying them being driven ashore by enemy's cruisers, Graves did not learn their contents until his return to port, August 16. The information sent by Hood of his coming was also intercepted. After Hood's arrival, it does not appear that there was avoidable delay in going to sea; but there does seem to have been misjudgment in the direction given to the fleet. It was known that De Barras had sailed from Newport with eight ships, bound probably for the Chesapeake, certainly to effect a junction with De Grasse; and it has been judiciously pointed out that if Graves had taken up his cruising-ground near the Capes, but out of sight of land, he could hardly have failed to fall in with him in overwhelming force. Knowing what is now known, this would undoubtedly have been the proper thing to do; but the English admiral had imperfect information. It was nowhere expected that the French would bring nearly the force they did; and Graves lost information, which he ought to have received, as to their numbers, by the carelessness of his cruisers stationed off the Chesapeake. These had been ordered to keep under way, but were both at anchor under Cape Henry when De Grasse's appearance cut off their escape. One was captured, the other driven up York River. No single circumstance contributed more to the general result than the neglect of these two subordinate officers, by which Graves lost that all-important information. It can readily be conceived how his movements might have been affected, had he known two days earlier that De Grasse had brought twenty-seven or twenty-eight sail of the line; how natural would have been the conclusion, first, to waylay De Barras, with whom his own nineteen could more than cope. \"Had Admiral Graves succeeded in capturing that squadron, it would have greatly paralyzed the besieging army [it had the siege train on board], if it would not have prevented its operations altogether; it would have put the two fleets nearly on an equality in point of numbers, would have arrested the progress of the French arms for the ensuing year in the West Indies, and might possibly have created such a spirit of discord between the French and Americans as would have sunk the latter into the lowest depths of despair, from which they were only extricated by the arrival of the forces under De Grasse.\" These are true and sober comments upon the naval strategy. In regard to the admiral's tactics…",

    "text": "On the French side De Grasse must be credited with a degree of energy, foresight, and determination surprising in view of his failures at other times. The decision to take every ship with him, which made him independent of any failure on the part of De Barras; the passage through the Bahama Channel to conceal his movements; the address with which he obtained the money and troops required, from the Spanish and the French military authorities; the prevision which led him, as early as March 29, shortly after leaving Brest, to write to Rochambeau that American coast pilots should be sent to Cap Francais; the coolness with which he kept Graves amused until De Barras's squadron had slipped in, are all points worthy of admiration. The French were also helped by the admiral's power to detain the two hundred merchant-ships, the \"West India trade,\" awaiting convoy at Cap Francais, where they remained from July till November, when the close of operations left him at liberty to convoy them with ships-of-war. The incident illustrates one weakness of a mercantile country with representative government, compared with a purely military nation. \"If the British government,\" wrote an officer of that day, \"had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted, such a measure, the one would have been turned out and the other hanged.\" Rodney at the same time had felt it necessary to detach five ships-of-the-line with convoys, while half a dozen more went home with the trade from Jamaica. It is easier to criticise the division of the English fleet between the West Indies and North America in the successive years 1780 and 1781, than to realize the embarrassment of the situation. This embarrassment was but the reflection of the military difficulty of England's position, all over the world, in this great and unequal war. England was everywhere outmatched and embarrassed, as she has always been as an empire, by the number of her exposed points. In Europe the Channel fleet was more than once driven into its ports by overwhelming forces. Gibraltar, closely blockaded by land and sea, was only kept alive in its desperate resistance by the skill of English seamen triumphing over the inaptness and discords of their combined enemies. In the East Indies, Sir Edward Hughes met in Suffren an opponent as superior to him in numbers as was De Grasse to Hood, and of far greater ability. Minorca, abandoned by the home government, fell before superior strength, as has been seen to fall, one by one, the less important of the English Antilles. The position of England from the time that France and Spain opened their maritime war was everywhere defensive, except in North America; and was therefore, from the military point of view, essentially false. She everywhere awaited attacks which the enemies, superior in every case, could make at their own choice and their own time. North America was really no exception to this rule, despite some offensive operations which in no way injured her real, that is her naval, foes.",

    "text": "Thus situated, and putting aside questions of national pride or sensitiveness, what did military wisdom prescribe to England? The question would afford an admirable study to a military inquirer, and is not to be answered off-hand, but certain evident truths may be pointed out. In the first place, it should have been determined what part of the assailed empire was most necessary to be preserved. After the British islands themselves, the North American colonies were the most valuable possessions in the eyes of the England of that day. Next should have been decided what others by their natural importance were best worth preserving, and by their own inherent strength, or that of the empire, which was mainly naval strength, could most surely be held. In the Mediterranean, for instance, Gibraltar and Mahon were both very valuable positions. Could both be held? Which was more easily to be reached and supported by the fleet? If both could not probably be held, one should have been frankly abandoned, and the force and efforts necessary to its defence carried elsewhere. So in the West Indies the evident strategic advantages of Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia prescribed the abandonment of the other small islands by garrisons as soon as the fleet was fairly outnumbered, if not before. The case of so large an island as Jamaica must be studied separately, as well as with reference to the general question. Such an island may be so far self-supporting as to defy any attack but one in great force and numbers, and that would rightly draw to it the whole English force from the windward stations at Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia. With the defence thus concentrated, England's great weapon, the navy, should have been vigorously used on the offensive. Experience has taught that free nations, popular governments, will seldom dare wholly to remove the force that lies between an invader and its shores or capital. Whatever the military wisdom, therefore, of sending the Channel fleet to seek the enemy before it united, the step may not have been possible. But at points less vital the attack of the English should have anticipated that of the allies. This was most especially true of that theatre of the war which has so far been considered. If North America was the first object, Jamaica and the other islands should have been boldly risked. It is due to Rodney to say that he claims that his orders to the admirals at Jamaica and New York were disobeyed in 1781, and that to this was owing the inferiority in number of Graves's fleet. But why, in 1780, when the departure of De Guichen for Europe left Rodney markedly superior in numbers during his short visit to North America, from September 1-4 to November 14, should no attempt have been made to destroy the French detachment of seven ships-of-the-line in Newport? These ships had arrived there in July; but although they had at once strengthened their position by earthworks, great alarm was excited by the news of Rodney's appearance off the coast. A fortnight passed by Rodney in New York and by the French in busy work, placed the latter, in their own opinion, in a position to brave all the naval force of England. \"We twice feared, and above all at the time of Rodney's arrival,\" wrote the chief of staff of the French squadron, \"that the English might attack us in the road itself; and there was a space of time during which such an undertaking would not have been an act of rashness. Now [October 20], the anchorage is fortified so that we can there brave all the naval force of England.\"",

This would instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult defensive. . . . Indeed, it is not to be conceived how they could subsist a large force in this country, if we had the command of the seas to interrupt the regular transmission of supplies from Europe. This superiority, with an aid in money, would enable us to convert the war into a vigorous offensive. With respect to us it seems to be one of two deciding points.\" In another letter to the same person, then in Paris, dated April 9, he writes: — \"If France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should she attempt it hereafter. . . . Why need I run into detail, when it may be declared in a word that we are at the end of our tether, and that now or never our deliverance must come? How easy would it be to retort the enemy's own game upon them, if it could be made to comport with the general plan of the war to keep a superior fleet always in these seas, and France would put us in condition to be active by advancing us money.\" Ships and money are the burden of his cry. May 23, 1781, he writes to the Chevalier de la Luzerne: \"I do not see how it is possible to give effectual support to the Southern States, and avert the evils which threaten, while we are inferior in naval force in these seas.\" As the season for active operations advances, his utterances are more frequent and urgent. THE INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER. 399 To Major General Greene, struggling with his difficulties in South Carolina, he writes, June 1, 1781: \"Our affairs have been attentively considered in every point of view, and it was finally determined to make an attempt upon New York, in preference to a Southern operation, as we had not decided command of the water.\" To Jefferson, June 8: \"Should I be supported in the manner I expect, by the neighboring States, the enemy will, I hope, be reduced to the necessity of recalling part of their force from the southward to support New York, or they will run the most imminent risk of being expelled from that post, which is to them invaluable; and should we, by a lucky coincidence of circumstances, gain a naval superiority, their ruin would be inevitable. . . . While we remain inferior at sea . . . policy dictates that relief should be attempted by diversion rather than by sending reinforcements immediately to the point in distress,\" that is, to the South. To Rochambeau, June 13: \"Your Excellency will recollect that New York was looked upon by us as the only practicable object under present circumstances; but should we be able to secure a naval superiority, we may perhaps find others more practicable and equally advisable.\" By the 15th of August the letters of De Grasse announcing his sailing for the Chesapeake were received, and the correspondence of Washington is thenceforth filled with busy preparations for the campaign in Virginia, based upon the long-delayed fleet.",

The day after the capitulation he writes to De Grasse: \"The surrender of York . . . the honor of which belongs to your Excellency, has greatly anticipated [in time] our most sanguine anticipations.\" He then goes on to urge further operations in the South, seeing so much of the good season was still left: \"The general naval superiority of the British, previous to your arrival, gave them decisive advantages in 400 OPINIONS OF WASHINGTON. the South, in the rapid transport of their troops and supplies; while the immense land marches of our succors, too tardy and expensive in every point of view, subjected us to be beaten in detail. It will depend upon your Excellency, therefore, to terminate the war.\" De Grasse refusing this request, but intimating an intention to co-operate in the next year's campaign, Washington instantly accepts: \"With your Excellency I need not insist upon the indispensable necessity of a maritime force capable of giving you an absolute ascendency in these seas. . . . You will have observed that, whatever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest.\" A fortnight later, November 15, he writes to Lafayette, who is on the point of sailing for France: — \"As you expressed a desire to know my sentiments respecting the operations of the next campaign, I will, without a tedious display of reasoning, declare in one word that it must depend absolutely upon the naval force which is employed in these seas, and the time of its appearance next year. No land force can act decisively unless accompanied by a maritime superiority. ... A doubt did not exist, nor does it at this moment, in any man's mind, of the total extirpation of the British force in the Carolinas and Georgia, if Count de Grasse could have extended his co-operation two months longer.\" Such, in the opinion of the revered commander-in-chief of the American armies, was the influence of sea power upon the contest which he directed with so much skill and such infinite patience, and which, amidst countless trials and discouragements, he brought to a glorious close. It will be observed that the American cause was reduced to these straits, notwithstanding the great and admitted losses of British commerce by the cruisers of the allies and by American privateers. This fact, and the small results from the general war, dominated as it was by the idea of commerce-destroying, show strongly the secondary and indecisive effect of such a policy upon the great issues of war.",

    "text": "Maritime War in Europe, 1779-1782. THE last chapter closed with the opinions of Washington, expressed in many ways and at many times, as to the effect of sea power upon the struggle for American independence. If space allowed, these opinions could be amply strengthened by similar statements of Sir Henry Clinton, the English commander-in-chief. In Europe the results turned yet more entirely upon the same factor. There the allies had three several objectives, at each of which England stood strictly upon the defensive. The first of these was England herself, involving, as a preliminary to an invasion, the destruction of the Channel fleet, — a project which, if seriously entertained, can scarcely be said to have been seriously attempted; the second was the reduction of Gibraltar; the third, the capture of Minorca. The last alone met with success. Thrice was England threatened by a largely superior fleet, thrice the threat fell harmless. Thrice was Gibraltar reduced to straits; thrice was it relieved by the address and fortune of English seamen, despite overpowering odds. After Keppel's action off Ushant, no general encounter took place between fleets in European seas during the year 1778 and the first half of 1779. Meantime Spain was drawing toward a rupture with England and an active alliance with France. War was declared by her on the 16th of June, 1779; but as early as April 12, a treaty between the two Bourbon kingdoms, involving active war upon England, had been signed. By its terms the invasion of Great Britain or Ireland was to be undertaken, every effort made to recover for Spain, Minorca, Pensacola, and Mobile, and the two courts bound themselves to grant neither peace, nor truce, nor suspension of hostilities, until Gibraltar should be restored. The declaration of war was withheld until ready to strike; but the English government, doubtless, should have been upon its guard in the strained relations of the two countries, and prepared to prevent a junction of the two fleets. As it was, no efficient blockade of Brest was established, and twenty-eight French sail-of-the-line went out unopposed June 3, 1779, under D'Orvilliers, Keppel's opponent of the year before. The fleet steered for the coasts of Spain, where it was to find the Spanish ships; but it was not till the 22d of July that the full contingent joined. Seven precious summer weeks thus slipped by unimproved, but that was not all the loss; the French had been provisioned for only thirteen weeks, and this truly great armada of sixty-six ships-of-the-line and fourteen frigates had not more than forty working-days before it. Sickness, moreover, ravaged the fleet; and although it was fortunate enough to enter the Channel while the English were at sea, the latter, numbering little more than half their enemies, succeeded in passing within them. The flabbiness of coalitions increased the weakness due to inefficient preparation; a great and not unnatural panic on the English Channel coast, and the capture of one ship-of-the-line, were the sole results of a cruise extending, for the French, over fifteen weeks.",

Being of a deeply religious character, the refuge which Villeneuve after Trafalgar found in suicide was denied him; but he threw up his command and retired into a religious house. The scanty maritime interest of the year 1780, in Europe, centres round Cadiz and Gibraltar.

    "section": "The Armed Neutrality and War with Holland",
    "text": "The state of politics and parties in England at this time was such that, combined with the unavoidable inferiority of the Channel fleet, it was difficult to find an admiral willing to accept the chief command. An admirable officer, Barrington, the captor of Sta. Lucia, refused the first place, though willing to serve as second, even to a junior.^ The allied fleet, to the number of thirty-six sail-of-the-line, assembled at Cadiz. Their cruises, however, were confined to the Portuguese coast ; and their only service, a most important one, was the capture of an entire convoy, largely laden with military stores, for the East and West Indies. The entrance of sixty English prizes, with nearly three thousand prisoners, into Cadiz, was a source of great rejoicing to Spain. On the 24th of October, De Guichen, returning from his contest with Rodney, came into the same port with his West Indian squadron, of nineteen ships-of-the-line ; but the immense armament thus assembled did nothing. The French ships returned to Brest in January, 1781. While thus unproductive of military results in Europe, the war in 1780 gave rise to an event which cannot wholly be passed over by any history of sea power. This was the Armed Neutrality, at the head of which stood Russia, joined by Sweden and Denmark. The claim of England to seize enemy's goods in neutral ships bore hard upon neutral powers, and especially upon those of the Baltic and upon Holland, into whose hands, and those of the Austrian Netherlands, the war had thrown much of the European carrying-trade ; while the products of the Baltic, naval stores and grain, were those which England was particularly interested in forbidding to her enemies. The declarations finally put forth by Russia, and signed by Sweden and Denmark, were four in number : 1. That neutral vessels had a right, not only to sail to unblockaded ports, but also from port to port of a belligerent nation ; in other words, to maintain the coasting trade of a belligerent. 2. That property belonging to the subjects of a power at war should be safe on board neutral vessels. This was the principle involved in the now familiar maxim, \" Free ships make free goods.\" 3. That no articles are contraband, except arms, equipments, and munitions of war. This ruled out naval stores and provisions unless belonging to the government of a belligerent. 4. That blockades, to be binding, must have an adequate naval force stationed in close proximity to the blockaded port. The contracting parties being neutral in the present war, but binding themselves to support these principles by a combined armed fleet of a fixed minimum number, the agreement received the name of the Armed Neutrality. The discussion of the propriety of the various declarations belongs to International law ; but it is evident that no great maritime State, situated as England then was, would submit to the first and third as a matter of right. Policy only could induce her to do so. Without meeting the declarations by a direct contradiction, the ministry and the king determined to disregard them, — a course which was sustained in principle even by prominent members of the bitter opposition of that day. The undecided attitude of the United Provinces, divided as in the days of Louis XIV. between the partisans of England and France, despite a century of alliance with the former, drew the especial attention of Great Britain. They had been asked to join the Armed Neutrality ; they hesitated, but the majority of the provinces favored it. A British officer had already gone so far as to fire upon a Dutch man-of-war which had resisted the search of merchant-ships under its convoy ; an act which, whether right or wrong, tended to incense the Dutch generally against England. It was determined by the latter that if the United Provinces acceded to the coalition of neutrals, war should be declared. On the 16th of December, 1780, the English ministry was informed that the States-General had resolved to sign the declarations of the Armed Neutrality without delay. Orders were at once sent out to Rodney to seize the Dutch West India and South American possessions ; similar orders to the East Indies ; and the ambassador at the Hague was recalled. England declared war four days later. The principal effect, therefore, of the Armed Neutrality upon the war was to add the colonies and commerce of Holland to the prey of English cruisers. The additional enemy was of small account to Great Britain, whose geographical position effectually blocked the junction of the Dutch fleet with those of her other enemies. The possessions of Holland fell everywhere, except when saved by the French ; while a bloody but wholly uninstructive battle between English and Dutch squadrons in the North Sea, in August, 1781, was the only feat of arms illustrative of the old Dutch courage and obstinacy.",

    "section": "Naval Campaigns of 1781",
    "text": "The year 1781, decisive of the question of the independence of the United States, was marked in the European seas by imposing movements of great fleets followed by puny results. At the end of March De Grasse sailed from Brest with twenty-six ships-of-the-line. On the 29th he detached five under Suffren to the East Indies, and himself continued on to meet success at Yorktown and disaster in the West Indies. On the 23d of June De Guichen sailed from Brest with eighteen ships-of-the-line for Cadiz, where he joined thirty Spanish ships. This immense armament sailed on the 22d of July for the Mediterranean, landed fourteen thousand troops at Minorca, and then moved upon the English Channel. The English had this year first to provide against the danger to Gibraltar. That beset fortress had had no supplies since Rodney's visit, in January of the year before, and was now in sore want, the provisions being scanty and bad, the biscuits weevilly, and the meat tainted. Amid the horrors and uproar of one of the longest and most exciting sieges of history, the sufferings of the combatants were intensified by the presence of many peaceful inhabitants, including the wives and families of soldiers as well as of officers. A great fleet of twenty-eight ships-of-the-line sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of March, convoying three hundred merchant-ships for the East and West Indies, besides ninety-seven transports and supply-ships for the Rock. A delay on the Irish coast prevented its falling in with De Grasse, who had sailed nine days after it. Arriving off Cape St. Vincent, it met no enemy, and looking into Cadiz saw the great Spanish fleet at anchor. The latter made no move, and the English admiral, Derby, threw his supplies into Gibraltar on the 12th of April, undisturbed. At the same time he, like De Grasse, detached to the East Indies a small squadron, which was destined before long to fall in with Suffren. The inaction of the Spanish fleet, considering the eagerness of its government about Gibraltar and its equal if not superior numbers, shows scanty reliance of the Spanish admiral upon himself or his command. Derby, having relieved Gibraltar and Minorca, returned to the Channel in May. Upon the approach of the combined fleet of nearly fifty sail in August following, Derby fell back upon Torbay and there anchored his fleet, numbering thirty ships. De Guichen, who held chief command, and whose caution when engaged with Rodney has been before remarked, was in favor of fighting ; but the almost unanimous opposition of the Spaniards, backed by some of his own officers, overruled him in a council of war,^ and again the great Bourbon coalition fell back, foiled by their own discord and the unity of their enemy. Gibraltar relieved, England untouched, were the results of these gigantic gatherings ; they can scarcely be called efforts. A mortifying disaster closed the year for the allies. De Guichen sailed from Brest with seventeen sail, protecting a large convoy of merchantmen and ships with military supplies. The fleet was pursued by twelve English ships under Admiral Kempenfeldt, an officer whose high professional abilities have not earned the immortality with which poetry has graced his tragical death. Falling in with the French one hundred and fifty miles west of Ushant, he cut off a part of the convoy, despite his inferior numbers.2 A few days later a tempest dispersed the French fleet. Only two ships-of-the-line and five merchantmen out of one hundred and fifty reached the West Indies.",

    "section": "Loss of Port Mahon and the Attack on Gibraltar (1782)",
    "text": "The year 1782 opened with the loss to the English of Port Mahon, which surrendered on the 5th of February, after a siege of six months, — a surrender induced by the ravages of scurvy, consequent upon the lack of vegetables, and confinement in the foul air of bombproofs and casemates, under the heavy fire of an enemy. On the last night of the defence the call for necessary guards was four hundred and fifteen, while only six hundred and sixty men were fit for duty, thus leaving no reliefs. The allied fleets assembled this year in Cadiz, to the number of forty ships-of-the-line. It was expected that this force would be increased by Dutch ships, but a squadron under Lord Howe drove the latter back to their ports. It does not certainly appear that any active enterprise was intended against the English coast ; but the allies cruised off the mouth of the Channel and in the Bay of Biscay during the summer months. Their presence insured the safe arrival and departure of the homeward and outward bound merchantmen, and likewise threatened English commerce ; notwithstanding which, Howe, with twenty-two ships, not only kept the sea and avoided an engagement, but also succeeded in bringing the Jamaica fleet safe into port. The injury to trade and to military transportation by sea may be said to have been about equal on either side ; and the credit for successful use of sea power for these most important ends must therefore be given to the weaker party. Having carried out their orders for the summer cruise, the combined fleets returned to Cadiz. On the 10th of September they sailed thence for Algesiras, on the opposite side of the bay from Gibraltar, to support a grand combined attack by land and sea, which, it was hoped, would reduce to submission the key to the Mediterranean. With the ships already there, the total rose to nearly fifty ships-of-the-line. The details of the mighty onslaught scarcely belong to our subject, yet cannot be wholly passed by, without at least such mention as may recognize and draw attention to their interest; The three years' siege which was now drawing to its",

    "text": "end had been productive of many brilliant feats of arms, as well as of less striking but more trying proofs of steadfast endurance, on the part of the garrison. How long the latter might have held out cannot be said, seeing the success with which the English sea power defied the efforts of the allies to cut off the communications of the fortress ; but it was seemingly certain that the place must be subdued by main force or not at all, while the growing exhaustion of the belligerents foretold the near end of the war. Accordingly Spain multiplied her efforts of preparation and military in- genuity ; while the report of them and of the approaching decisive contest drew to the scene volunteers and men of emi- nence from other countries of Europe. Two French Bour- bon princes added, by their coming, to the theatrical interest with which the approaching drama was invested. The pres- ence of royalty was needed adequately to grace the sublime catastrophe ; for the sanguine confidence of the besiegers had determined a satisfactory denouement with all the security of a playwright. Besides the works on the isthmus which joins the Rock to the mainland, where three hundred pieces of artillery were now mounted, the chief reliance of the assailants was upon ten floating batteries elaborately contrived to be shot and fire proof, and carrying one hundred and fifty-four heavy guns. These were to anchor in a close north-and-south line along the west face of the works, at about nine hundred yards distance. They were to be supported by forty gunboats and as many bomb vessels, besides the efforts of the ships-of-the- line to cover the attack and distract the garrison. Twelve thousand French troops were brought to reinforce the Span- iards in the grand assault, which was to be made when the bombardment had sufficiently injured and demoralized the defenders. At this time the latter numbered seven thousand, their land opponents thirty -three thousand men. ATTACK ON GIBRALTAR. 411 The final act was opened by the English. At seven o'clock on the morning of September 8, 1782, the commanding gen- eral, Elliott, began a sesere and most injurious fire upon the works on the isthmus. Having effected his purpose, he stopped ; but the enemy took up the glove the next morning, and for four days successively poured in a fire from the isth- mus alone of six thousand five hundred cannon-balls and one thousand one hundred bombs every twenty-four hours. So approached the great closing scene of September 13. At seven a. m. of that day the ten battering-ships unmoored from the head of the bay and stood down to their station. Be- tween nine and ten they anchored, and the general fire at once began. The besieged replied with equal fury. The bat- tering-ships seem in the main, and for some hours, to have justified the hopes formed of them ; cold shot glanced or failed to get through their sides, while the self-acting appara- tus for extinguishing fires balked the hot shot. About two o'clock, however, smoke was seen to issue from the ship of the commander-in-chief, and though controlled for some time, the fire continued to gain. The same misfor- tune befell others ; by evening, the fire of the besieged gained a marked superiority, and by one o'clock in the morning the greater part of the battering-ships were in flames. Their distress was increased by the action of the naval officer com- manding the English gunboats, who now took post upon the flank of the line and raked it effectually, — a service which the Spanish gunboats should have prevented. In the end, nine of the ten blew up at their anchors, with a loss esti- mated at fifteen hundred men, four hundred being saved from the midst of the fire by the English seamen. The tenth ship was boarded and burned by the English boats. The hopes of the assailants perished with the failure of the battering-ships. There remained only the hope of starving out the garrison. To this end the allied fleets now gave themselves. It was known that Lord Howe was on his way out with a great fleet, numbering thirty -four ships-of-the-line, besides supply vessels.",

    "section": "LORD HOWE RELIEVES GIBRALTAR. NAVAL POLICY OF GREAT BRITAIN.",
    "text": "412 LORD HOWE RELIEVES GIBRALTAR. On the 10th of October a violent westerly gale injured the com- bined ships, driving one ashore under the batteries of Gibral- tar, where she was surrendered. The next day Howe's force came in sight, and the transports had a fine chance to make the anchorage, which, through carelessness, was missed by all but four. The rest, with the men-of-war, drove eastward into the Mediterranean. The allies followed on the 13th\n\n; but though thus placed between the port and the relieving force, and not encumbered, like the latter, with supply-ships, they yet contrived to let the transports, with scarcely an ex- ception, slip in and anchor safely. Not only provisions and ammunition, but also bodies of troops carried by the ships- of-war, were landed without molestation. On the 19th the English fleet repassed the straits with an easterly wind, having within a week's time fulfilled its mission, and made Gibraltar safe for another year. The allied fleet followed, and on the 20tli an action took place at long range, the allies to windward, but not pressing their attack close. The num- ber of ships engaged in this magnificent spectacle, the closing scene of the great drama in Europe, the after-piece to the successful defence of Gibraltar, was eighty-three of the line, — forty-nine allies and thirty-four English. Of the former, thirty-three only got into action ; but as the duller sailers would have come up to a general engagement. Lord Howe was probably right in declining, so far as in him lay, a trial which the allies did not too eagerly court. Such were the results of this great contest in the European seas, marked on the part of the allies by efforts gigantic in size, but loose-jointed and flabby in execution. By England, so heavily overmatched in mere numbers, were shown firm- ness of purpose, high courage, and seamanship ; but it can scarcely be said that the military conceptions of her councils, or the cabinet management of her sea forces, were worthy of the skill and devotion of her seamen. The odds against her were not so great — not nearly so great — as the formidable lists of guns and ships seemed to show ; and while allowance must justly be made for early hesitations, the passing years NAVAL POLICY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 413 of indecision and inefficiency on the part of the allies should have betrayed to her their weakness. The reluctance of the French to risk their shi})s, so plainly shown by D'Estaing, De Grasse, and De Guichen, the sluggishness and inefficiency of the Spaniards, should have encouraged England to pursue her old policy, to strike at the organized forces of the enemy afloat. As a matter of fact, and probably from the neces- sities of the case, the opening of every campaign found the enemies separated, — the Spaniards in Cadiz, the French in Brest.^ To blockade the latter in full force before they could get out, England sliould have strained every effort ; thus she would have stopped at its head the main stream of the allied strength, and, by knowing exactly where this great body was, would have removed tliat uncertainty as to its action which fettered her own movements as soon as it had gained the freedom of the open sea. Before Brest she was interposed between the allies ; by her lookouts she would have known the approach of the Spaniards long before the French could know it ; she would have kept in her hands the power of bringing against each, singly, ships more numerous and indi- vidually more effective. A wind that was fair to bring on the Spaniards would have locked their allies in the port.",

    "text": ", who have the whole history before us, but might have been inferred by those who had watched the tactics of D'Estaing and De Guichen, and later on of De Grasse. Or, had even so much dispersal been thought unadvisable, forty ships before Brest would have left the sea open to the Spanish fleet to try conclusions with the rest of the English navy when the question of controlling Gib- raltar and Mahon came up for decision. Knowing what we do of the efficiency of the two services, there can be little question of the result ; and Gibraltar, instead of a weight, would, as often before and since those days, have been an element of strength to Great Britain. The conclusion continually recurs. Whatever may be the determining factors in strifes between neighboring continental States, when a question arises of control over distant regions, politically weak, — whether they be crumbling empires, an- archical republics, colonies, isolated military posts, or islands below a certain size, — it must ultimately be decided by naval power, by the organized military force afloat, which repre- sents the communications that form so prominent a feature in all strategy. The magnificent defence of Gibraltar hinged upon this ; upon this depended the military results of the war in America ; upon this the final fate of the West India Islands ; upon this certainly the possession of India, Upon this will depend the control of the Central American Isthmus, if that question take a military coloring; and though modified by the continental position and surroundings of Turkey, the same sea power must be a weighty factor in shaping the outcome of the Eastern Question in Europe. If this be true, military wisdom and economy, both of time and money, dictate bringing matters to an issue as soon as possible upon the broad sea, with the certainty that the power which achieves military preponderance there will win in the end. In the war of the American Revolution the nu- merical preponderance was very great against England ; the actual odds were less, though still against her. Military con- siderations would have ordered the abandonment of the colo- nies ; but if the national pi'ide could not stoop to this, the right course was to blockade the hostile arsenals. If not strong enough to be in superior force before both, that of the more powerful nation should have been closed. Here was the first fault of the English admiralty ; the statement of the First Lord as to the available force at the outbreak of the war was not borne out by facts. The first fleet, under Keppel, barely equalled the French ; and at the same time Howe's force in America was inferior to the fleet under D'Estaing. In 1779 and 1781, on tlie contrary, the English fleet was superior to that of the French alone ; yet the allies joined unopposed, while in the latter year De Grasse got away to the West Indies, and Suffren to the East. In Kempenfeldt's affair with De Guichen, the admiralty knew that the French convoy was of the utmost importance to the campaign in the West Indies, yet they sent out their admiral with only twelve ships ; while at that time, besides the reinforcement destined for the West Indies, a number of others were stationed in the Downs, for what Fox justly called \"the paltry purpose\" of distress- ing the Dutch trade. The various charges made by Fox in the speech quoted from, and which, as regarded the Franco- Spanish War, were founded mainly on the expediency of attacking the allies before they got away into the ocean wil- derness, were supported by the high professional opinion of Lord Howe, who of the Kempenfeldt affair said : \" Not only the fate of the West India Islands, but perhaps the whole future fortune of the war, might have been decided, almost without a risk, in the Bay of Biscay.\" ^ Not without a risk, but with strong probabilities of success, the whole fortune of the war should at the first have been staked on a concen- tration of the English fleet between Brest and Cadiz. No relief for Gibraltar would have been more efficacious ; no diversion surer for the West India Islands ; and the Ameri- cans would have appealed in vain for the help, scantily given as it was, of the French fleet. For the great results that flowed from the coming of De Grasse must not obscure the fact that he came on the 31st of August, and announced from the beginning that he must be in the West Indies again by the middle of October. Only a providential com- bination of circumstances prevented a repetition to Washing- ton, in 1781, of the painful disappointments by D'Estaing and De Guichen in 1778 and 1780.",

    "text": "The very interesting and instructive campaign of Suffren in the East Indies, although in itself by far the most noteworthy and meritorious naval performance of the war of 1778, failed, through no fault of his, to affect the gen- eral issue. It was not till 1781 that the French Court felt able to direct upon the East naval forces adequate to the im- portance of the issue. Yet the conditions of the peninsula at that time were such as to give an unusual opportunity for shaking the English power. Hyder Ali, the most skilful and daring of all the enemies against whom the English had yet fought in India, was then ruling over the kingdom of Mysore, which, from its position in the southern part of the peninsula, threatened both tlie Carnatic and the Malabar coast. Hyder, ten years before, had maintained alone a most successful war against the intruding foreigners, concluding with a peace upon the terms of a mutual restoration of con- quests ; and he was now angered by the capture of Mah^. On the other hand, a number of warlike tribes, known by the name of the Mahrattas, of the same race and loosely knit together in a kind of feudal system, had become involved in war with the English. The territory occupied by these tribes, whose chief capital was at Poonah, near Bombay, extended northward from Mysore to the Ganges. With boundaries thus conterminous, and placed centrally with reference to the three English presidencies of Bombay, Calcutta, and Ma- dras, Hyder and the Mahrattas were in a position of advan- tage for mutual support and for offensive operations against the common enemy. At the beginning of the war between England and Fiance, a French agent appeared at Poonah, It was reported to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, that the tribes had agreed to terms and ceded to the French a seaport on the Malabar coast. With his usual promptness, Hastings at once determined on war, and sent a division of the Bengal army across the Jumna and into Berar. An- other body of four thousand English troops also marched from Bombay ; but being badly led, was surrounded and forced to surrender in January, 1779. This unusual reverse quickened the hopes and increased the strength of the ene- mies of the English ; and although the material injury was soon remedied by substantial successes under able leaders, the loss of prestige remained. The anger of Hyder Ali, roused by the capture of Mahd, was increased by imprudent thwarting on the part of the governor of Madras. Seeing the English entangled with the Mahrattas, and hearing that a French armament was expected on the Coromandel coast, he quietly prepared for war. In the summer of 1780 swarms of his horsemen descended without warning from the hills, and appeared near the gates of Madras. In September one body of English troops, three thousand strong, was cut to pieces, and another of five thousand was only saved by a rapid retreat upon Madras, losing its artillery and trains. Unable to attack Madras, Hyder turned upon the scattered posts separated from each other and the capital by the open country, which was now wholly in his control. Such was the state of affairs when, in January, 1781, a French squadron of six ships-of-the-line and three frigates appeared on the coast. The English fleet under Sir Edward Hughes had gone to Bombay. To the French commodore, Count d'Orves, Hyder appealed for aid in an attack upon Cud- dalore. Deprived of support by sea, and surrounded by the myriads of natives, the place must have fallen. D'Orves, how- ever, refused, and returned to the Isle of France. At the same time one of the most skilful of the English Indian soldiers. Sir Eyre Coote, took the field against Hyder. The latter at once raised the siege of the beleaguered posts, and after a series of operations extending through the spring months, was brought to battle on the 1st of July, 1781. His total defeat restored to the English the open country, saved the Carnatic, and put an end to the hopes of tlie partisans of the French in their late possession of Pondicherry. A great opportunity had been lost. Meanwhile a French officer of very different temper from his predecessors Avas on his way to the East Indies. It will be remembered that when De Grasse sailed from Brest, March 22, 1781, for the West Indies, there went with his fleet a division of five ships-of-the-line under Suffren. The latter separated from the main body on the 29th of the month, taking with him a few transports destined for the Cape of Good Hope, then a Dutch colony. The Frencli government had learned that an expedition from England was destined to seize this important halting-place on the road to India, and Suffren's first mission was to secure it. In fact, the squadron under Commodore Johnstone^ had got away first, and had anchored at Porto Praya, in the Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese colony, on the 11th of April. It numbered two ships-of-the-line, and three of fifty guns, with frigates and smaller vessels, besides thirty-five transports, mostly armed. Without apprehension of attack, not because he trusted to the neutrality of the port but because he thought his destina- tion secret, the English commodore had not anchored with a view to battle. It so happened that at the moment of sailing from Brest one of the ships intended for the West Indies was transferred to Suffren's squadron. She consequently had not water enough for the longer voyage, and this with other reasons determined Suffren also to anchor at Porto Praya. On the 16th of April, five days after Johnstone, he made the island early in the morning and stood for the anchorage, sending a coppered ship ahead to reconnoitre. Approaching from the eastward, the land for some time hid the English squad- ron ; but at quarter before nine the advance ship, the \" Ar- tesien,\" signalled that enemy's ships were anchored in the bay. The latter is open to the southward, and extends from east to west about a mile and a half ; the conditions are such that ships usually lie in the northeast part, near the shore (Plate XIII). ^ The English were there, stretch- ing irregularly in a west-northwest line. Both Suffren and Johnstone were surprised, but the latter more so ; and the initiative remained with the French officer. Few men were fitter, by natural temper and the teaching of experience, for the prompt decision required. Of ardent disposition and inborn military genius, Suffren had learned, in the conduct of Boscawen toward the squadron of De la Clue,^ in which he had served, not to lay weight upon the power of Portugal to enforce respect for her neutrality. He knew that this must be the squadron meant for the Cape of Good Hope. The only question for him was whether to press on to the Cape with the chance of getting there first, or to attack the English at their anchors, in the hope of so crippling them as to prevent their further progress. He decided for the latter ; and although the ships of his squadron, not sailing equally well, were scattered, he also determined to stand in at once, rather than lose the advantage of a surprise. Making signal to pre- pare for action at anchor, he took the lead in his flag-ship, the \" Heros,\" of seventy-four guns, hauled close round the southeast point of the bay, and stood for the English flag- ship (f). He was closely followed by the \" Hannibal,\" sev- enty-four (line a b) ; the advance ship \"Artesien\" (c), a sixty-four, also stood on with him; but the two rear ships were still far astern.",

    "text": "Suffren anchored five hundred feet from the flagship's starboard beam (the English flagship was also called \"Hero\"), placing enemy ships on both sides, and opened fire.  The \"Hannibal\" anchored too close ahead, hindering its own maneuverability, but followed Suffren boldly into action despite being unprepared.  The \"Art^sien\" mistakenly engaged an East India ship, drifting out of the main fight. The remaining two French vessels failed to maintain advantageous positioning. Suffren, with only two ships effectively engaged, cut his cable and sailed out, followed by the heavily damaged \"Hannibal.\" \n\nSuffren's decision to attack, though violating Portuguese neutrality, was strategically sound. His primary mission was protecting the Cape of Good Hope from the English.  He had two options: race to the Cape or defeat the English fleet.  Encountering the enemy unexpectedly, Suffren prioritized control of the southern waters.  He believed destroying the English squadron would secure French dominance in India and prevent the English from reaching the Cape before him. Although misinformed about the English strength, he recognized the advantage of surprise. His decision, while unorthodox for the French navy, proved correct.  While he didn't receive adequate support from his captains due to various mishaps, his positioning of his own ship and the \"Hannibal\" was excellent, maximizing their firepower.\n\nThe English squadron's disorganization further hampered their effectiveness, confirming Suffren's judgment.  Had he received the expected support, he might have destroyed the English fleet; as it was, his actions secured the Cape Colony. The French court, despite the diplomatic repercussions, acknowledged his decisive action. Suffren, influenced by his observations of D'Estaing's cautious approach in America, believed that formalized tactics hindered French naval aggressiveness. However, the Porto Praya encounter, fought without prearranged plans, demonstrated the value of tactical order. His subsequent combinations were skillful, particularly in his early East Indies engagements. Suffren's greatest strength was recognizing the English fleet as the primary obstacle to French ambitions. He prioritized attacking the enemy fleet over protecting his own, a view contrasting with the prevailing French naval doctrine.  He understood that sea power translated to control of land-based outcomes, especially in distant regions. This understanding, derived from English strategy, was combined with a unique tactical approach emphasizing aggressive action.",

He later joined forces with Count d'Orves, and the combined fleet sailed for India.  Following d'Orves' death, Suffren assumed command. Upon reaching Madras, Suffren's fleet encountered the English fleet under Sir Edward Hughes. The French had a numerical advantage (12 ships to 9) and potentially greater individual ship strength. However, Suffren lacked a secure base of operations and friendly ports, while the English held Trincomalee, a crucial harbor in Ceylon, although not yet fully provisioned.  Hughes faced the challenge of defending multiple locations with fewer ships against Suffren's offensive capabilities.  Control of the sea remained vital for dominance in India, although England's position had strengthened over time. Suffren's need to destroy the English fleet was therefore even greater than that of his predecessors, while Hughes benefited from a more secure land-based position. The sea, however, remained the decisive factor, and securing it required disabling the enemy fleet and establishing a reliable base. Trincomalee, despite health concerns, was the best harbor, but its recent capture limited its usefulness to the English.  Hughes, therefore, was constrained in his options.",

The French admiral, Suffren, recognized Trincomalee's strategic importance and sought to seize it. This objective, coupled with the ongoing war between Hyder Ali and the British, compelled Suffren to secure a mainland port for landing troops and obtaining supplies. These factors pressured the British admiral, Hughes, to confront Suffren and prevent the French from gaining Trincomalee. Hughes aimed to engage Suffren on favorable terms, ideally from a windward position to offset his weaker force.  A windward position would grant him the initiative in choosing the time and method of attack.  Conversely, a leeward position would leave Hughes with the undesirable options of fleeing or accepting battle on Suffren's terms. Hughes's task was challenging, requiring him to weaken the French fleet and simultaneously protect Trincomalee, which relied entirely on the navy's presence.

Hughes pursued, exploiting a separation between the French warships and their convoy. This maneuver led to the capture of six French ships, including five previously captured British vessels. Suffren, in pursuit, closed the distance with four of his fastest ships.  By evening, both squadrons regrouped and sailed southeast. At dawn on the 17th, the fleets were within sight of each other.  Hughes formed a line ahead on the port tack, hoping to gain the weather gauge. However, light winds and frequent squalls favored the French, allowing them to rapidly approach Hughes's rear. Hughes responded by forming a line abreast, attempting to buy time and consolidate his ships. Recognizing the inevitability of battle, Hughes hauled his wind and awaited the French attack, placing himself in a disadvantageous leeward position.  His rear ship, the \"Exeter,\" remained out of formation.  Suffren's attack strategy, according to Hughes, involved a double line abreast targeting both the rear and center of the British line.",

If Suffren's flagship had indeed sailed along the entire British line as claimed, it would have been exposed to the concentrated fire of six ships in succession, potentially crippling it and disrupting the French line. Suffren also highlights his plan to double on the British rear with three ships, a tactic partially executed by two French vessels. Suffren further explains his decision to keep his flagship at a distance, a move intended to contain the British van but which inadvertently set a negative example for the captains following him. This led to a disconnect between orders and example, as his signals for closer engagement were disregarded. Suffren expressed frustration with the inaction of some of his captains, particularly his second-in-command, Tromelin, who failed to effectively relay and enforce Suffren's signals.",

This assessment of the situation underscored the importance of a decisive naval engagement.  Consequently, avoiding such a decisive action should have been Hughes's primary objective. Hughes's attempt to gain the windward position was sound, given the prevailing wind patterns at Madras. His intended use of this advantage, however – to engage more closely – lacks tactical clarity. Suffren's instructions to his second-in-command, Tromelin, ten days before the battle, reveal his concept of a coordinated attack. He delegated significant authority to Tromelin, anticipating the need for flexibility and initiative during the battle. This delegation mirrors Nelson's approach at Trafalgar, emphasizing the crucial role of the second-in-command in executing complex maneuvers. Suffren's decision to lead the attack may have stemmed from his ship's superior speed and the need for swift action. However, his decision to maintain distance, while tactically sound, inadvertently influenced his captains to do the same, highlighting the importance of leading by example in the heat of battle.",

It is tlie business of a chief to provide against such misappre- liensions by most careful previous explanation of both the letter and spirit of his plans. Especially is this so at sea, where smoke, slack wind, and intervening rigging make signals hard to read, though they are almost the only means of com- munication. This was Nelson's practice ; nor was Suffren a stranger to the idea. \" Dispositions well concerted with those who are to carry them out are needed,\" he wrote to D'Estaing, three years before. The excuse which may be pleaded for SUFFREN'S COMPLAINTS OF HIS OFFICERS. 435 those who followed him, and engaged, cannot avail for the rear ships, and especially not for the second in command, who knew Siiffren's plans. He should have compelled the rear ships to take position to leeward, leading himself, if ne- cessary. There was wind enough ; for two captains actually engaged to leeward, one of them without orders, acting, through the impulse of his own good will and courage, on Nelson's saying, \" No captain can do very wrong who places his ship alongside that of an enemy.\" He received the special commendation of Suffren, in itself an honor and a reward. Whether the failure of so many of his fellows was due to inefhciency, or to a spirit of faction and disloyalty, is unimportant to the general military writer, however in- teresting to French officers jealous for the honor of their service. Suffren's complaints, after several disappointments, became vehement. \" My heart,\" wrote he, \" is wrung by the most general defection. I have just lost the opportunity of destroying the English squadron. . . . All — yes, all — might have got near, since we were to wind- ward and ahead, and none did so. Several among them had behaved bravely in other combats. I can only attribute this horror to the wish to bring the cruise to an end, to ill-will, and to ignorance ; for I dare not suspect anytliing worse. The result has been terrible. I must tell j^ou, Monseigneur, that officers who have been long at the Isle of France are neither seamen nor military men. Not seamen, for they have not been at sea ; and the trading temper, independent and insubordinate, is absolutely opposed to the military spirit.\" This letter, written after his fourth battle with Hughes, must be taken with allowance. Not only does it appear that Suffren himself, hurried away on this last occasion by his eagerness, was partly responsible for the disorder of his fleet, but there were other circumstances, and above all the char- acter of some of the officers blamed, which made the charge of a general disaffection excessive. On the other hand, it remains true that after four general actions, with superior numbers on the part of the French, under a chief of the skill and ardor of Suffren, the English squadron, to use his own 43G MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. plaintive expression, \" still existed ; \" not only so, but had not lost a single ship. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that of a French naval writer : \" Quantity disappeared be- fore quality.\" ^ It is immaterial whether the defect was due to inefficiency or disaffection. The inefficiency Avhich showed itself on the field of battle disappeared in the general conduct of the campaign where the qualities of the chief alone told.",

    "text": "The battle of February 17th ended with a shift of wind to the southeast at six p. m., after two hours action. The English were thus brought to wind- ward, and their van ships enabled to share in the fight. Night falling, Suffren, at half-past six, hauled his squadron by the wind on the starboard tack, heading northeast, while Hughes steered south under easy sail. It is said by Captain Che- valier, of the French navy, that Suffren intended to renew the fight next day. In that case he should have taken measures to keep within reach. It was too plainly Hughes's policy not to fight without some advantage, — to allow the supposition that with one ship, the \" Exeter,\" lost to liim through the concentration of so many enemies upon her, he would quietly await an attack. This is so plain as to make it probable that Suffren saw sufficient reason, in the results to his fleet and the misconduct of his officers, not to wish to renew action at once. The next morning the two fleets were out of sight of each other. The continuance of the north wind, and the crippled state of two of his ships, forced Hughes\n\nto go to Trin- comalec, where the sheltered harbor allowed them to repair. Suffren, anxious about his transports, went to Pondicherry, where he anchored in their company. It was his wish then to proceed against Negapatam ; but the commander of the troops chose to act against Cuddalore. After negotiations and arrangements with Hyder Ali the army landed south of Porto Novo, and marched against Cuddalore, which surrendered on the 4th of April. Meanwhile Suffren, anxious to act against his principal objective, had sailed again on the 23d of March. It was his 1 Troude : Batailles Navales. MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. 437 hope to cut off two shi})S-of-thc-liiie Avhicli were expected from England. For this he was too late ; the two seventy- fours joined the main body at Madras, March 30th. Hughes had refitted at Trincomalee in a fortnight, and reached Madras again on the 12th of March. Soon after the reinforcement had joined him, he sailed again for Trincomalee with troops and military stores for the garrison. On the 8th of April Suffren's squadron was seen to the northeast, also standing to the southward. Hughes kept on, through that and the two following days, with light northerly winds. On the 11th he made the coast of Ceylon, fifty miles north of Trincomalee, and bore away for the port. On the morning of the 12th the French squadron in the northeast was seen crowding sail in pursuit. It was the day on which Rodney and De Grasse met in the West Indies, but the parts were reversed ; here the French, not the English, sought action. The speed of the ships in both squadrons was very un- equal ; each had some coppered ships and some not cop- pered. Hughes found that his slow sailers could not escape tiie fastest of his enemy, — a condition which will always compel a retreating force to hazard an action, unless it can resolve to give up the rear ships, and which makes it im- perative for the safety, as well as the efficiency, of a squad- ron that vessels of the same class should all have a certain minimum speed. The same cause — the danger of a sepa- rated ship — led the unwilling De Grasse, the same day, in another scene, to a risky manoeuvre and a great mishap. Hughes, with better reason, resolved to fight ; and at nine A. M. formed his line on the starboard tack, standing in-shore (Plate XV., A), the squadron in good order, with intervals of two cables between the ships.^ His account, which again varies from that of Suffren, giving a radically different idea of the tactics used by the French commodore, and more to tlie credit of the latter's skill, will first be followed.

    "text": "On the starboard tack… the French chief intended an attack elementary in conception and difficult of execution. Keeping a fleet on a line of bearing, sailing free, requires much drill, especially with ships of varying speeds like Suffren's. The 'Superbe' and 'Monmouth' suffered extreme injury due to a concentration of fire, not attributable to Suffren's dispositions. The 'Héros,' damaged early in the action, passed ahead and engaged the 'Monmouth,' accounting for the latter's severe damage. The 'Superbe,' disengaged from Suffren, faced another heavy French ship. As the 'Monmouth' drifted leeward, Suffren's flagship also drifted, briefly firing stern guns into the 'Superbe's' bow.  Simultaneously, the 'Superbe' was engaged on the beam and quarter by two other French ships. French casualties were more distributed than the English, with three English ships escaping without fatalities. The core of the action was a fortuitous concentration of two French seventy-fours and a sixty-four on an English seventy-four and sixty-four, resulting in a significant gun advantage for the French.  Admiral Hughes's conduct in the days preceding the battle drew criticism for not attacking the slightly larger, but separated, French fleet. Hughes's decision was likely influenced by his mission to Trincomalee, prioritizing resupply over engaging the enemy. This prioritization aligns more with French than English naval doctrine.  The lack of detailed information prevents a conclusive judgment, but the criticism highlights the prevailing English view that attacking the enemy fleet was paramount.  Hughes's outcome was arguably no worse than if he had attacked, and potentially better had Suffren's captains been more competent. Following the action, both squadrons anchored for a week, two miles apart, for repairs. Hughes anticipated an attack, but Suffren, after completing repairs, remained outside for twenty-four hours, inviting but not initiating battle.  Suffren's justification for this cautious approach included the condition of his fleet and the perceived lack of support from his captains.",

This ability to rapidly refit and redeploy is a valuable military lesson. The battle forced six weeks of English inactivity.  Suffren, however, lacked the resources for immediate offense, needing men, provisions, and especially spars and rigging.  He anchored at Batacalo to protect expected supply ships and intercept outward-bound English vessels.  He then sailed to Tranquebar to disrupt English communications, and later to Cuddalore to confer with land forces and Hyder Ali.  Suffren recognized the strategic necessity of maintaining the alliance and securing the seaboard, but prioritized disabling the English fleet. This focus, combined with his tenacity and vigor, distinguishes him from other French commanders of equal courage but burdened by flawed traditions. Hughes, after jury-rigging the 'Monmouth,' refitted his squadron at Trincomalee, demonstrating the English advantage in resources. While Suffren disrupted English communications, Hughes remained in port, sailing for Negapatam on June 23rd, coinciding with Suffren's arrival at Cuddalore.  Suffren hastened preparations for attack.  Before sailing, Suffren proudly reported having equipped the squadron for six months and secured rations for over a year, largely through captured prizes.  This achievement, accomplished without a port and initial destitution, highlights his resourcefulness and the effectiveness of his cruisers.  Despite having fought a costly battle with limited resources three months prior, Suffren's ability to replenish his supplies demonstrates his self-reliance and strategic thinking.  This achievement defied expectations in Paris, where a return to the Isle of France for refit was anticipated.  Suffren’s insistence on maintaining the squadron’s presence demonstrated his understanding of the importance of sea control for operations in India.",

    "text": "disregard not only the murmurs of his officers but the express orders of the Court. When he reached Batacalo, he found despatches directing him to return to the Isle of France. Instead of taking them as a release from the great burden of responsi- bility, he disobeyed, giving his reasons, and asserting that he on the spot could judge better than a minister in Europe what the circumstances demanded. Such a leader deserved better subordinates, and a better colleague than he had in the commander of the forces on shore. Whether or no the con- ditions of the general maritime struggle would have permitted the overthrow of the English East Indian power may be doubt- ful ; but it is certain that among all the admirals of the three nations there was none so fitted to accomplish that result as Suffren. We shall find him enduring severer tests, and always equal to them. In the afternoon of the 5th of July Suffren's squadron came in sight of the English, ancliored off Cuddalore. An hour later, a sudden squall carried away the main and mizzen topmasts of one of the French ships. Admiral Hughes got under way, and the two fleets manoeuvred during the night. The following day the wind favored tlie English, and the opponents found themselves in line of battle on the starboard tack, heading south-southeast, with the wind at southwest. The disabled French ship having by unpardonable inactivity failed to re- pair her injuries, the numbers about to engage were equal, — eleven on each side. At eleven a. m. the English bore down to- gether and engaged ship against ship ; but as was usual under those conditions, the rear ships did not come to as close ac- tion as those ahead of them (Plate XVI., Position I.). Cap- tain Chevalier carefully points out that their failure was a fair offset to the failure of the French rear on the 12th of April,^ but fails to note in this connection that the French van, both on that occasion and again on the 3d of September, bungled as well as the rear. There can remain little doubt, in the mind of the careful reader, that most of the French captains were inferior, as seamen, to their opponents.",

Four English ships, the \" Burford,\" \"Sultan\" (s), \"Worcester,\" and \"Eagle,\" seeing the breeze coming, kept off to port, toward the French line ; the otliers were taken aback and paid off to starboard.

    "text": "The difficulties were increased by the character of the anchorage, an open roadstead with frequent heavy sea, and by the near presence of the English fleet; but the work was driven on under the eyes of the commander-in-chief, who, like Lord Howe at New York, inspired the working parties by his constant appearance among them. \" Notwithstanding his prodigious obesity, Suffren displayed the fiery ardor of youth; he was everywhere where work was going on. Under his powerful impulse, the most difficult tasks were done with incredible rapidity. Nevertheless, his officers represented to him the bad state of the fleet, and the need of a port for the ships-of-the-line. 'Until we have taken Trincomalee,' he replied, 'the open roadsteads of the Coromandel coast will answer.' \" It was indeed to this activity on the Coromandel coast that the success at Trincomalee was due. The weapons with which Suffren fought are obsolete; but the results wrought by his tenacity and fertility in resources are among the undying lessons of history. While the characters of the two chiefs were thus telling upon the strife in India, other no less lasting lessons were being afforded by the respective governments at home, who did much to restore the balance between them. While the English ministry, after the news of the battle of Porto Praya, fitted out in November, 1781, a large and compact expedition, convoyed by a powerful squadron of six ships-of-the-line, under the command of an active officer, to reinforce Hughes, the French despatched comparatively scanty succors in small detached bodies, relying apparently upon secrecy rather than upon force to assure their safety. Thus Suffren, while struggling with his innumerable embarrassments, had the mortification of learning that now one and now another of the small detachments sent to his relief were captured, or driven back to France, before they were clear of European waters. There was in truth little safety for small divisions north of the Straits of Gibraltar. Thus the advantages gained by his activity were in the end sacrificed. Up to the fall of Trincomalee the French were superior at sea; but in the six months which followed, the balance turned the other way, by the arrival of the English reinforcements under Sir Richard Bickerton. With his usual promptness the French commodore had prepared for further immediate action as soon as Trincomalee surrendered. The cannon and men landed from the ships were at once re-embarked, and the port secured by a garrison strong enough to relieve him of any anxiety about holding it. This great seaman, who had done as much in proportion to the means intrusted to him as any known to history, and had so signally illustrated the sphere and influence of naval power, had no intention of fettering the movements of his fleet, or risking his important conquest, by needlessly taking upon the shoulders of the ships the burden of defending a seaport. When Hughes appeared, it was past the power of the English fleet by a single battle to reduce the now properly garrisoned post.",

    "section": "The Fourth Battle between Suffren and Hughes",
    "text": "Doubtless a successful campaign, by destroying or driving away the French sea power, would achieve this result; but Suffren might well believe that, whatever mishaps might arise on a single day, he could in the long run more than hold his own with his opponent. Seaports should defend themselves; the sphere of the fleet is on the open sea, its object offence rather than defence, its objective the enemy's shipping wherever it can be found. Suffren now saw again before him the squadron on which depended the English control of the sea; he knew that powerful reinforcements to it must arrive before the next season, and he hastened to attack. Hughes, mortified by his failure to arrive in time, — for a drawn battle beforehand would have saved what a successful battle afterward could not regain, — was in no humor to balk him. Still, with sound judgment, he retreated to the southeast, flying in good order, to use Suffren's expression; regulating speed by the slowest ships, and steering many different courses, so that the chase which began at daybreak overtook the enemy only at two in the afternoon. The object of the English was to draw Suffren so far to leeward of the port that, if his ships were disabled, he could not easily regain it. The French numbered fourteen ships-of-the-line to twelve English. This superiority, together with his sound appreciation of the military situation in India, increased Suffren's natural eagerness for action; but his ships sailed badly, and were poorly handled by indifferent and dissatisfied men. These circumstances, during the long and vexatious pursuit, chafed and fretted the hot temper of the commodore, which still felt the spur of urgency that for two months had quickened the operations of the squadron. Signal followed signal, manoeuvre succeeded manoeuvre, to bring his disordered vessels into position. \" Sometimes they edged down, sometimes they brought to,\" says the English admiral, who was carefully watching their approach, \" in no regular order, as if undetermined what to do.\" Still, Suffren continued on, and at two p. m., having been carried twenty-five miles away from his port, his line being then partly formed and within striking distance of the enemy, the signal was made to come to the wind to correct the order before finally bearing down. A number of blunders in executing this made matters worse rather than better; and the commodore, at last losing patience, made signal thirty minutes later to attack (Plate XVII,, A), following it with another for close action at pistol range. This being slowly and clumsily obeyed, he ordered a gun fired, as is customary at sea to emphasize a signal; unluckily this was understood by his own crew to be the opening of the action, and the flag-ship discharged all her battery. This example was followed by the other ships, though yet at the distance of half cannon-shot, which, under the gunnery conditions of that day, meant indecisive action. Thus at the end and as the result of a mortifying series of blunders and bad seamanship, the battle began greatly to the disadvantage of the French, despite their superior numbers. The English, who had been retreating under short and handy sail, were in good order and quietly ready; whereas their enemies were in no order (B). Seven ships had forereached in rounding to,^ and now formed an irregular group ahead of the English van, as well as far from it, where they were of little service; while in the centre a second confused group was formed, the ships overlapping and masking each other's fire. Under the circumstances the entire brunt of the action fell upon Suffren's flag-ship (a) and two others which supported him; while at the extreme rear a small ship-of-the-line, backed by a large frigate, alone engaged the English rear; but these, being wholly overmatched, were soon forced to retire. A military operation could scarcely be worse carried out. The French ships in the battle did not support each other; they were so grouped as to hamper their own fire and needlessly increase the target offered to the enemy; so far from concentrating their own effort, three ships were left, almost unsupported, to a concentrated fire from the English line.^ \" Time passed on, and our three ships [B, a], engaged on the beam by the centre of the English fleet and raked [enfiladed] by van and rear, suffered greatly. After two hours the * H^ros' ' sails were in rags, all her running rigging cut, and she could no longer steer. The 'lllustre' had lost her mizzen-mast and maintopmast.\" In this disorder such gaps existed as to offer a great opportunity to a more active opponent. \" Had the enemy tacked now,\" wrote the chief-of-staff in his journal, \" we would have been cut off and probably destroyed.\"",

    "text": "The faults of an action in which every proper distribution was wanting are summed up in the results. The French had fourteen ships engaged. They lost eighty-two killed and two hundred and fifty-five wounded. Of this total, sixty-four killed and one hundred and seventy-eight wounded, or three fourths, fell to three ships. Two of these three lost their main and mizzen masts and foretopmast; in other words, were helpless. This was a repetition on a larger scale of the disaster to two of Hughes's ships on the 12th of April; but on that day the English admiral, being to leeward and in smaller force, had to accept action on the adversary's terms, while here the loss fell on the assailant, who, to the advantage of the wind and choice of his mode of attack, added superiority in numbers. Full credit must in this action be allowed to Hughes, who, though lacking in enterprise and giving no token of tactical skill or coup d'oeil, showed both judgment and good management in the direction of his retreat and in keeping his ships so well in hand. It is not easy to apportion the blame which rests upon his enemies. Suffren laid it freely upon his captains. It has been rightly pointed out, however, that many of the officers thus condemned in mass had conducted themselves well before, both under Suffren and other admirals; that the order of pursuit was irregular, and Suffren's signals followed each other with confusing rapidity; and finally that chance, for which something must always be allowed, was against the French, as was also the inexperience of several captains. It is pretty certain that some of the mishap must be laid to the fiery and inconsiderate haste of Suffren, who had the defects of his great qualities, upon which his coy and wary antagonist unwittingly played. It is noteworthy that no complaints of his captains are to be found in Hughes's reports. Six fell in action, and of each he speaks in terms of simple but evidently sincere appreciation, while on the survivors he often bestows particular as well as general commendation. The marked contrast between the two leaders, and between the individual ship-commanders, on either side, makes this singularly instructive among naval campaigns; and the ultimate lesson taught is in entire accordance with the experience of all military 'history from the beginning. Suffren had genius, energy, great tenacity, sound military ideas, and was also an accomplished seaman. Hughes had apparently all the technical acquirements of the latter profession, would probably have commanded a ship equally well with any of his captains, but shows no trace of the qualities needed by a general officer. On the other hand, without insisting again upon the skill and fidelity of the English subordinates, it is evident that, to whatever it be attributed, the French single ships were as a rule incomparably worse-handled than those of their opponents. Four times, Suffren claims, certainly thrice, the English squadron was saved from overwhelming disaster by the difference in quality of the under officers. Good troops have often made amends for bad generalship; but in the end the better leader will prevail. This was conspicuously the case in the Indian seas in 1782 and 1783. War cut short the strife, but not before the issue was clearly indicated. The action of September 3, like that of July 6, was brought to a close by a shift of wind to the southeast. When it came, the English line wore, and formed again on the other tack. The French also wore; and their van ships, being now to windward, stood down between their crippled ships and the enemy's line (C). Toward sundown Hughes hauled off to the northward, abandoning the hope of regaining Trincomalee, but with the satisfaction of having inflicted this severe retaliation upon his successful opponent. That firmness of mind which was not the least of Suffren's qualities was severely tried soon after the action off Trincomalee. In returning to port, a seventy -four, the \" Orient,\" was run ashore and lost by mismanagement, the only consolation being that her spars were saved for the two dismasted ships. Other crippled masts were replaced as before by robbing the frigates, whose crews also were needed to replace the losses in battle. Repairs were pushed on with the usual energy, the defence of the port was fully provided for, and on the 30th of September the squadron sailed for the Coromandel coast, where the state of French interests urgently called for it. Cuddalore was reached in four days; and here another incapable officer wrecked the \" Bizarre,\" of sixty-four guns, in picking up his anchorage. In consequence of the loss of these two ships, Suffren, when he next met the enemy, could oppose only fifteen to eighteen ships-of-the-line; so much do general results",

He reports his ships badly damaged; but the loss was so evenly distributed among them that it is difficult to justify his failure to follow up the injuries done to the French. At this season the monsoon wind, which has come for four or five months from southwest, changes to northeast, blowing upon the east coast of the peninsula, where are no good harbors. The consequent swell made the shore often unapproachable, and so forbade support from fleet to army. The change of the monsoon is also frequently marked by violent hurricanes. The two commanders, therefore, had to quit a region where their stay might be dangerous as well as useless. Had Trincomalee not been lost, Hughes, in the condition of his squadron, might have awaited there the reinforcements and supplies expected soon from England; for although the port is not healthy, it is secure and well situated. Bickerton had already reached Bombay, and was on his way now to Madras with five ships-of-the-line. As things were, Hughes thought necessary to go to Bombay for the season, sailing or rather being driven to sea by a hurricane, on the 17th of October. Four days later Bickerton reached Madras, not having fallen in with the admiral. With an activity which characterized him he sailed at once, and was again in Bombay on the 28th of November, Hughes's ships, scattered and crippled by tempest, dropped in one by one, a few days later. Suffren held Trincomalee, yet his decision was not easy. The port was safe, he had not to fear an attack by the English fleet; and on the other hand, besides being sickly during the approaching monsoon, it was doubtful whether the provisions needed for the health of the crews could be had there. In short, though of strategic value from its strength and position, the port was deficient in resources. Opposed to Trincomalee there was an alternative in Achem, a harbor on the other side of the Bay of Bengal, at the west end of the island of Sumatra. This was healthy, could supply provisions, and, from its position with reference to the northeast monsoon, would permit ships to regain the Coromandel coast sooner than those in Bombay, when the milder ending of the season made landing more practicable.",

    "text": "These simple considerations were not, however, the only elements in the really difficult problem before Suffren. The small results that followed this campaign must not hide the fact that great issues were possible, and that much might depend upon his decision. Owing to the French policy of sending out reinforcements in several small bodies, not only was there much loss, but great uncertainty prevailed among the scattered commands as to conditions elsewhere. This uncertainty, loss, and delay profoundly affected the political situation in India. When Suffren first reached the coast, the English had on their hands not only Hyder Ali, but the Mahrattas as well. Peace with the latter was signed on the 17th of May, 1782; but, owing probably to an opposition party among them, the ratifications were not exchanged until December. Both there and in the court of Hyder Ali there was division of interest; and representations were made from both to the French, who, though suspicious, could obtain no certain information of the treaty, that everything depended upon the relative military strength of themselves and the English. The presence and the actions of Suffren were all that France had to show, — the prestige of his genius, the capture of Trincomalee, his success in battle. The French army, cooped up in Cuddalore, was dependent upon the sultan for money, for food, and for reinforcements; even the fleet called on him for money, for masts, for ammunition, for grain. The English, on the other hand, maintained their ground; though on the whole worsted, they lost no ships; and Bickerton's powerful squadron was known to have reached Bombay. Above all, while the French asked for money, the English lavished it. It was impossible for the French to make head against their enemy without native allies; it was essential to keep Hyder from also making peace. Here the inadequate support and faulty dispositions of the home government made themselves felt. The command in India, both by land and sea, was intrusted to General de Bussy, once the brilliant fellow-worker with Dupleix, now a gouty invalid of sixty-four. With a view to secrecy, Bussy sailed from Cadiz in November, 1781, with two ships-of-the-line, for Teneriffe, where he was to be joined by a convoy leaving Brest in December. This convoy was captured by the English, only two of the vessels escaping to Bussy. The latter pursued his journey, and learning at the Cape of Good Hope that Bickerton's strong force was on the way, felt compelled to land there a great part of his troops. He reached the Isle of France on the 31st of May. The next convoy of eighteen transports, sailing in April for India, was also intercepted. Two of the four ships-of-war were taken, as also ten of the transports; the remainder returned to Brest. A third detachment was more fortunate, reaching the Cape in May; but it was delayed there two months by the wretched condition of the ships and crews. These disappointments decided Bussy to remain at the Island until joined by the expected ships from the Cape, and Suffren at this critical moment did not know what the state of things there was. The general had only written him that, as he could not reach the coast before the bad season, he should rendezvous at Achem.",

    "text": "These uncertainties made a painful impression upon Hyder Ali, who had been led to expect Bussy in September, and had instead received news of Bickerton's arrival and the defection of his old allies, the Mahrattas. Suffren was forced to pretend a confidence which he did not feel, but which, with the influence of his own character and achievements, determined the sultan to continue the war. This settled, the squadron sailed for Achem on the 15th of October, anchoring there the 2d of November. Three weeks afterward a vessel arrived from Bussy, with word that his departure was indefinitely delayed by an epidemic raging among the troops. Suffren therefore determined to hasten his own return to the coast, and sailed on the 20th of December. January 8, 1783, he anchored off Ganjam, five hundred miles northeast of Cuddalore, whence he would have a fair wind to proceed when he wished. It was his purpose to attack not only the coasting vessels but the English factories on shore as well, the surf being now often moderate; but learning on the 12th, from an English prize, the important and discouraging news of Hyder Ali's death, he gave up all minor operations, and sailed at once for Cuddalore, hoping to secure by his presence the continuance of the alliance as well as the safety of the garrison. He reached the place on the 6th of February. During his four months absence the failure of Bussy to appear with his troops, and the arrival of Bickerton, who had shown himself on both coasts, had seriously injured the French cause. The treaty of peace between the English and the Mahrattas had been ratified; and the former, released from this war and reinforced, had attacked the sultan on the west, or Malabar, coast. The effect of this diversion was of course felt on the east coast, despite the efforts of the French to keep the new sultan there. The sickness among the troops at the Isle of France had, however, ceased early in November; and had Bussy then started without delay, he and Suffren would now have met in the Carnatic, with full command of the sea and large odds in their favor ashore. Hughes did not arrive till two months later. Being thus alone, Suffren, after communicating with Tippoo-Saib, the new sultan of Mysore, went to Trincomalee; and there he was at last joined, on the 10th of March, by Bussy, accompanied by three ships-of-the-line and numerous transports. Eager to bring the troops into the field, Suffren sailed on the 15th with his fastest ships, and landed them the next day at Porto Novo. He returned to Trincomalee on the 11th of April, and fell in with Hughes's fleet of seventeen ships-of-the-line off the harbor's mouth. Having only part of his force with him, no fight ensued, and the English went on to Madras. The southwest monsoon was now blowing.",

    "text": "It is not necessary to follow the trivial operations of the next two months. Tippoo being engaged on the other side of the peninsula and Bussy displaying little vigor, while Hughes was in superior force off the coast, the affairs of the French on shore went from bad to worse. Suffren, having but fifteen ships to eighteen English, was unwilling to go to leeward of Trincomalee, lest it should fall before he could return to it. Under these conditions the English troops advanced from Madras, passing near but around Cuddalore, and encamped to the southward of it, by the sea. The supply-ships and light cruisers were stationed off the shore near the army; while Admiral Hughes, with the heavy ships, anchored some twenty miles south, where, being to windward, he covered the others. In order to assure to Suffren the full credit of his subsequent course, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that Bussy, though commander-in-chief both by land and sea, did not venture to order him to leave Trincomalee and come to his support. Allowing him to feel the extremity of the danger, he told him not to leave port unless he heard that the army was shut up in Cuddalore, and blockaded by the English squadron. This letter was received on the 10th of June. Suffren waited for no more. The next day he sailed, and forty-eight hours later his frigates saw the English fleet. The same day, the 10th, after a sharp action, the French army was shut up in the town, behind very weak walls. Everything now depended on the action of the fleets. Upon Suffren's appearance, Hughes moved away and anchored four or five miles from the town. Baffling winds prevailed for three days; but the monsoon resuming on the 16th, Suffren approached. The English admiral not liking to accept action at anchor, and to leeward, in which he was right, got under way; but attaching more importance to the weather-gage than to preventing a junction between the enemy's land and sea forces, he stood out into the offing with a southerly, or south-southeast wind, notwithstanding his superior numbers. Suffren formed on the same tack, and some manoeuvring ensued during that night and the next day. At eight P.M. of the 17th the French squadron, which had refused to be drawn to sea, anchored off Cuddalore and communicated with the commander-in-chief. Twelve hundred of the garrison were hastily embarked to fill the numerous vacancies at the guns of the fleet. Until the 20th the wind, holding unexpectedly at west, denied Hughes the advantage which he sought; and finally on that day he decided to accept action and await the attack. It was made by Suffren with fifteen ships to eighteen, the fire opening at quarter-past four P.M. and lasting until half-past six. The loss on both sides was nearly equal; but the English ships, abandoning both the field of battle and their army, returned to Madras. Suffren anchored before Cuddalore. The embarrassment of the British army was now very great. The supply-ships on which it had depended fled before the action of the 20th, and the result of course made it impossible for them to return. The sultan's light cavalry harassed their communications by land. On the 25th, the general commanding wrote that his \"mind was on the rack without a moment's rest since the departure of the fleet, considering the character of M. de Suffren, and the infinite superiority on the part of the French now that we are left to ourselves.\" From this anxiety he was relieved by the news of the conclusion of peace, which reached Cuddalore on the 29th by flag-of-truce from Madras. If any doubt had remained as to the relative merits of the two sea-commanders, the last few days of their campaign would have removed them. Hughes alleges the number of his sick and shortness of water as his reasons for abandoning the contest. Suffren's difficulties, however, were as great as his own; and if he had an advantage at Trincomalee, that only shifts the dispute a step back, for he owed its possession to superior generalship and activity. The simple facts that with fifteen ships he forced eighteen to abandon a blockade, relieved the invested army, strengthened his own crews, and fought a decisive action, make an impression which There was not a single ship of Suffren's which had more than three- fourths of her regular complement of men. It must be added that soldiers and sepoys made up half of these reduced crews. — Chevaher, p. ",

    "text": "does not need to be diminished in the interests of truth.i It is probable that Hughes's self-reliance had been badly shaken by his various meetings with Suffren. Although the tidings of peace sent by Hughes to Bussy rested only upon unofficial letters, they were too positive to justify a continuance of bloodshed. An arrangement was entered into by the authorities of the two nations in India, and hostilities ceased on the 8th of July. Two months later, at Pondi cherry, the official despatches reached Suifren. His own words upon them are worth quoting, for they show the depressing convictions under which he had acted so noble a part : \" God be praised for the peace ! for it was clear that in India, though we had the means to impose the law, all would have been lost. I await your orders with impatience, and heartily pray they may permit me to leave. War alone can make bearable the. weariness of certain things.\" On the 6th of October, 1783, Suffren finally sailed from Trincomalee for France, stopping at the Isle of France and the Cape of Good Hope. The homeward voyage was a con- tinued and spontaneous ovation. In each port visited the most flattering attentions were paid by men of every degree and of every nation. What especially gratified him was the homage of the English captains. It might well be so ; none had so clearly established a right to his esteem as a warrior. On no occasion when Hughes and Suffren met, save the last, did the English number over twelve ships ; but six English captains had laid down their lives, obstinately opposing his efforts. While he was at the Cape, a division of nine of Hughes's ships, returning from the war, anchored in the harbor. Their captains called eagerly upon the admiral, the stout Commodore King of the \" Exeter \" at their head. \" The good Dutchmen have received me as their savior,\" wrote Suffren ; \" but among the tributes Avhich have most flattered me, none has given me more pleasure than the esteem and consideration testified by the English who are here.\" On reaching home, rewards were heaped upon him. Having left France as a captain, he came back a rear- admiral ; and immediately after his return the king created a fourth vice-admiralship, a special post to be filled by Suffren, and to lapse at his death. These honors were won by himself alone ; they were the tribute paid to his un- yielding energy and genius, shown not only in actual fight but in the steadfastness which held to his station through every discouragement, and rose equal to every demand made by recurring want and misfortune.",

    "text": "Alike in the general conduct of his operations and on the battlefield under the fire of the enemy, this lofty resolve was the distinguishing merit of Suffren ; and when there is coupled with it the clear and absolute conviction which he held of the necessity to seek and crush the enemy's fleet, we have probably the leading traits of his military character. The latter was the light that led him, the former the spirit that sustained him. As a tactician, in the sense of a driller of ships, imparting to them uniformity of action and manoeu- vring, he seems to have been deficient, and would probably himself have admitted, with some contempt, the justice of the criticism made upon him in these respects. Whether or no he ever actually characterized tactics — meaning thereby elementary or evolutionary tactics — as the veil of timidity, there was that in his actions which makes the mot probable. Such a contempt, however, is unsafe even in the case of genius. The faculty of moving together with uniformity and precision is too necessary to the development of the full power of a body of ships to Le lightly esteemed ; it is essen- tial to that concentration of effort at which Suffren rightly aimed, but which he was not always careful to secure by pre- vious dispositions. Paradoxical though it sounds, it is true that only fleets which are able to perform regular movements can afford at times to cast them aside ; only captains whom the habit of the drill-ground has familiarized with the shift- ing phases it presents, can be expected to seize readily the opportunities for independent action presented by the field of battle. Howe and Jervis must make ready the way for the successes of Nelson. Suffren expected too much of his cap- tains. He had the right to expect more than he got, but not that ready perception of the situation and that firmness of nerve which, except to a few favorites of Nature, are the re- sult only of practice and experience. Still, he was a very great man. When every deduction has been made, there must still remain his heroic constancy, his fearlessness of responsibility as of danger, the rapidity of his action, and the genius whose unerring intuition led him to break through the traditions of his service and assert for the navy that principal part which befits it, that offensive action which secures the control of the sea by the destruc- tion of the enemy's fleet. Had he met in his lieutenants such ready instruments as Nelson found prepared for him, there can be little doubt that Hughes's squadron would have been destroyed while inferior to Suffren's, before re- inforcements could have arrived ; and with the English fleet it could scarcely have failed that the Coromandel coast also would have fallen. What effect this would have had upon the fate of the peninsula, or upon the terms of the peace, can only be surmised. His own hope was that, by acquiring the superiority in India, a glorious peace might result.",

The French were thus warned of the enemy's approach. While not suspecting an attack, De Grasse feared Hood would disrupt the siege of Brimstone Hill. Hood's plan seemed rash given his inferior force. At 1 P.M. on the 24th, the English fleet was seen rounding Nevis; at three, De Grasse stood southward.  Hood also stood south towards sundown, appearing to retreat, but maintained a windward advantage. At daybreak, both fleets were leeward of Nevis—the English near the island, the French nine miles distant. Hood maneuvered to get De Grasse further leeward, intending to seize the anchorage De Grasse had left. This hazardous move aimed to place Hood between the besiegers of Brimstone Hill and their fleet. Alternatively, if the French fleet anchored near the hill, Hood would be between it and Martinique, intercepting supplies. Hood's position would flank the enemy's communications, advantageous because the island couldn't sustain the large troop presence. Both fleets awaited reinforcements; Rodney was en route, possibly arriving first. Four months after Yorktown, England's affairs were precarious, demanding a bold move. Hood trusted his officers and knew his opponent. At noon, with Nevis crowded with onlookers, the English fleet formed a line, heading north for Basse Terre. The French, in column steering south, turned and stood for the enemy in a bow-and-quarter line. At two, the British signaled to anchor. At 2:20, the French van engaged the English center, focusing on the rear ships, which had opened out. The French flagship, \"Ville de Paris,\" aimed for the gap but was thwarted by the \"Canada,\" whose captain, Cornwallis, supported the rear, followed by the \"Resolution\" and \"Bedford.\" The English van anchored, while the center pressed sail to gain position, despite the threatened rear. The rear ships anchored under fire, while the French fired and bore south, leaving their former berths to the English. Hood's anchorage controlled De Grasse's previous position. The night and morning were spent strengthening the order. The van ship anchored near Basse Terre, protected by a point and shoal. The line extended west-northwest, then turned north, the last six ships on a north-south line. Hood's flagship, \"Barfleur,\" was at the angle's apex. Dislodging Hood was difficult due to his tactical arrangement. His left flank was covered by the shore, his rear by ships en potence, and his front commanded approaches to Basse Terre. Attacking from the northwest was blocked by trade winds.  Attacks had to be under sail against anchored ships with springs, able to train broadsides effectively.",

    "text": "De Grasse, impelled by policy and pride, attacked on January 26th. His single-column attack against Hood's line was flawed. Hood had planned a similar tactic but hoped to surprise the enemy at their original anchorage. The French steered for Hood's eastern flank. The wind headed their van ship, forcing it to engage only the third English ship, which concentrated fire on it with three other ships. This French vessel, thought to be the \"Pluton,\" was severely damaged and forced to retreat to St. Eustatius.  Other French ships passed along the English line, distributing fire ineffectually. De Grasse attacked again in the same order, targeting the rear and center, but with little success. Hood maintained his position until February 14th, while the French cruised offshore. On February 1st, a despatch vessel informed Hood of the dispersal of French reinforcements, raising hopes of Rodney's arrival and success.  However, Brimstone Hill surrendered on the 12th. On the 13th, De Grasse anchored his fleet, now 33 ships-of-the-line, at Nevis. On the 14th, Hood summoned his captains, synchronized watches, and at 11 P.M., cut cables and sailed north, passing Nevis unmolested. Hood's strategic and tactical brilliance was evident, his execution honorable. Though materially unsuccessful, his daring instilled confidence in his fleet. Had he commanded at the Chesapeake, Cornwallis might have been saved. De Grasse's actions, including failing to crush Hood despite superior numbers, reflect the French principle of subordinating fleet action to specific operations. This unsound principle led to disastrous results. Hood's inferiority weakened his offensive capabilities. As long as he held the anchorage, De Grasse could not operate freely. The failure of De Grasse to capitalize on opportunities offers insight into his military capacity.",

    "section": "Criticism of De Grasse's Action and the Battle of the Saintes",
    "text": "Sir John Jervis, in his report of the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, justified his departure from standard naval procedure by citing the honor of His Majesty's arms and the specific circumstances prevailing in those waters.  This serves as a point of comparison when analyzing De Grasse's actions. While De Grasse maintained communication with Martinique and had sufficient strength to support troops at Brimstone Hill, his decision not to engage the British fleet at St. Kitt's is questionable. Though the reduction of St. Kitt's ultimately succeeded, the French Navy's traditional prioritization of securing conquests over engaging in potentially more glorious but less tangible fleet actions is evident.  Upon learning of the dispersal of expected reinforcements, De Grasse knew he would be outnumbered upon Rodney's arrival. Despite having thirty-three ships-of-the-line against twenty-two British ships at anchor, he allowed them to escape.  De Grasse explained that his provisions were exhausted, necessitating a resupply at Nevis. However, this explanation is weak, as he should have anticipated his supply needs and recognized the strategic importance of engaging the British fleet before Rodney's reinforcements arrived.  Hood, through audacious and skillful positioning, held his ground until the odds became overwhelmingly unfavorable, then skillfully withdrew.  De Grasse's claim of low provisions ignores the fact that he should have known his supply status well in advance.  He also failed to exploit potential weaknesses in the British position, such as their leeward ships.  A letter from Suffren, written three years prior, prophetically describes a similar situation at Santa Lucia, advocating for a vigorous attack before circumstances allowed the enemy to escape.  De Grasse's failure to grasp the importance of neutralizing the British fleet before the campaign truly began resulted in a missed opportunity. His prioritization of a minor island over the enemy fleet was a significant blunder, though in line with typical French naval practice.",

The prevailing easterly winds typically facilitated travel between the islands, but a strong westerly current and frequent calms often hampered northward movement from Sta. Lucia. A chain of British frigates relayed signals from lookout ships off Martinique to Rodney's flagship. On April 5th, Rodney received intelligence of French troop embarkations. On April 8th, the lookout frigates signaled the French fleet's departure. The British fleet, numbering thirty-six ships-of-the-line, set sail and by sundown sighted the French fleet. By daybreak on April 9th, the British were abreast Dominica, largely becalmed.  The French fleet and convoy, spread out due to variable winds, were sighted inshore. Fifteen French ships-of-the-line, aided by a fresh trade wind, were maneuvering in the channel between Dominica and the Saintes. The rest of the French warships and most of the convoy remained becalmed near Dominica.  Exploiting localized winds, the French ships gradually moved from Dominica toward the steadier breeze of the channel, gaining mobility.  Meanwhile, light southeasterly airs propelled the British van under Hood northward, towards two isolated French ships. These French ships, caught in the calm, narrowly escaped as a northwesterly breeze allowed them to rejoin their main force.  As the British van advanced, their wind strengthened, giving them access to the trade wind in the Saintes channel. De Grasse ordered the convoy to Guadeloupe, and they successfully disappeared from the scene.  With the British van now separated from its main body and posing a threat to the two isolated French ships, De Grasse ordered his van to engage.  Fourteen or fifteen French ships attacked Hood’s division at half-past nine a.m., an engagement lasting until quarter-past one p.m.  Hood was forced to heave-to to avoid further separation from the main fleet. The French ships, passing to windward, would tack and return south to resume their attack, maintaining a continuous elliptical pattern.",

    "text": "The attack upon Hood was therefore hotly renewed; but the French centre and rear, having the wind, kept their distance, and held Rodney's division at long range. At quarter-past one the French, finding that the whole British line was coming up with the wind, ceased firing, and at two Rodney hauled down the signal for battle, the enemy having withdrawn. This action of the 9th of April amounted actually to no more than an artillery duel. One French ship, the \"Caton,\" a sixty-four, received injuries which sent her into Guadeloupe; two English were disabled, but repaired their injuries without leaving the fleet. The material advantage, therefore, lay with the latter. Opinions differ as to the generalship of the Comte de Grasse on this day, but they divide on the same basis of principle as to whether ulterior operations, or the chances of beating the enemy's fleet, are to determine an admiral's action. The facts of the case are these: Sixteen of the English fleet, all the rear and four of the centre, were not able at any time to fire a shot. Apparently every French ship, first and last, might have been brought into action. At the beginning, eight or nine English were opposed to fifteen French. At the end there were twenty English to thirty-three French, and these general proportions doubtless obtained throughout the four hours. De Grasse therefore found himself in the presence of a fleet superior to his own, in numbers at least, and by the favor of Providence that fleet so divided that nearly half of it was powerless to act. He had the wind, he had a fine body of captains; what was to prevent him from attacking Hood's nine ships with fifteen, putting one on each side of the six in the rear. Had those nine been thoroughly beaten, Rodney's further movements must have been hopelessly crippled. The French lost only five in their defeat three days later. The subsequent court-martial, however, laid down the French doctrine thus: \"The decision to persist in engaging with only a part of our fleet may be considered as an act of prudence on the part of the admiral, which might be dictated by the ulterior projects of the campaign.\" On this a French professional writer naturally remarks, that if an attack were made at all, it would be more prudent to make it in force; less injury would fall on individual ships, while in the end the whole fleet would inevitably be drawn in to support any which, by losing spars, could not return to windward. Three times in one year had Fortune thrown before De Grasse the opportunity of attacking English fleets with decisive odds on his side. Her favors were now exhausted.",

    "text": "Three days more were to show how decidedly the ulterior projects of a campaign may be affected by a battle and the loss of a few ships. From the 9th to the morning of the 12th the French fleet continued beating to windward between Dominica and the Saints, in no regular order. On the night of the 9th the English hove-to to repair damages. The next day the chase to windward was resumed, but the French gained very decidedly upon their pursuers. On the night of the 10th two ships, the \"Jason\" and \"Zele,\" collided. The \"Zele\" was the bane of the French fleet during these days. She was one of those that were nearly caught by the enemy on the 9th, and was also the cause of the final disaster. The injuries to the \"Jason\" forced her to put into Guadeloupe. On the 11th the main body was to windward of the Saints, but the \"Zele\" and another had fallen so far to leeward that De Grasse bore down to cover them, thus losing much of the ground gained. On the night following, the \"Zele\" was again in collision, this time with De Grasse's flag-ship; the latter lost some sails, but the other, which had not the right of way and was wholly at fault, carried away both foremast and bowsprit. The admiral sent word to the frigate \"Astrede\" to take the \"Zele\" in tow; and here flits across the page of our story a celebrated and tragical figure, for the captain of the \"Astrede\" was the ill-fated explorer Lapeyrouse, the mystery of whose disappearance with two ships and their entire crews remained so long unsolved. Two hours were consumed in getting the ship under way in tow of the frigate,—not very smart work under the conditions of weather and urgency; but by five a.m. the two were standing away for Basse Terre, where the \"Caton\" and \"Jason,\" as well as the convoy, had already arrived. The French fleet had thus lost three from its line-of-battle since leaving Martinique. The disabled ship had not long been headed for Basse Terre, when the faint streaks of dawn announced the approach of the 12th of April, a day doubly celebrated in naval annals. The sun had not quite set upon the exhausted squadrons of Suffren and Hughes, anchoring after their fiercest battle off Ceylon, when his early rays shone upon the opening strife between Rodney and De Grasse. The latter was at the time the greatest naval battle in its results that had been fought in a century; its influence on the course of events was very great, though far from as decisive as it might have been; it was attended with circumstances of unusual though somewhat factitious brilliancy, and particularly was marked by a manoeuvre that was then looked upon as exceptionally daring and decisive,—\"breaking the line.\" It must be added that it has given rise to a storm of controversy; and the mass of details, as given by witnesses who should be reliable, are so confused and contradictory, owing mainly to the uncertainties of the wind, that it is impossible now to do more than attempt to reconcile them in a full account. Nevertheless, the leading features can be presented with sufficient accuracy, and this will first be done briefly and barely; the outline thus presented can afterward be clothed with the details which give color, life, and interest to the great scene.",

    "text": "The French were forced off to leeward by the interposition of the enemy's columns, besides being broken up. Compelled to forsake their line, it was necessary to re-form and unite their three divided groups—a difficult maneuver, especially under the moral impression of disaster and facing a superior, albeit disordered, enemy already feeling the glow of victory. No substantial attempt to re-form seems to have been made by the French; they reunited as a flying, disordered mass.  By midday, shifts of wind and movements left their fleet with the centre two miles northwest and leeward of the van, and the rear even farther leeward. Calms and short puffs of wind prevailed. At half-past one PM, a light easterly breeze sprang up, and De Grasse signaled to form the line on the port tack; between three and four, unsuccessful, he signaled to form on the starboard. These signals and accounts indicate the French never re-formed after their line was broken, and all maneuvers tended towards, if not necessitated, taking the whole fleet as far down as its most leewardly parts. Consequently, the most crippled ships were left behind, picked off one by one by the English, who pursued without regular order, as mutual support was assured. Shortly after six PM, De Grasse's flagship, the \"Ville de Paris,\" struck her colors to the \"Barfleur,\" Sir Samuel Hood's flagship. French accounts state nine enemy ships surrounded her, and she was undoubtedly fought to the bitter end. Her name, commemorating Paris, her unusual size, and the unprecedented capture of a French naval commander-in-chief, bestowed peculiar brilliance upon Rodney's victory. Four other ships-of-the-line were taken, carrying the entire artillery train intended for Jamaica's reduction.",

    "text": "When the day opened, the French fleet was scattered and disordered. De Grasse's fear for the \"Z'jle\" precipitated his movements, preventing proper line formation at engagement. The van ships were not in position, and the rest were so far from their places that De Vaudreuil, commanding the rear, stated the line formed under musket fire. Conversely, the English were in good order, shortening ship intervals from two to one cable's length. Breaking the French line resulted not from intention, but a wind shift disordering the French and widening gaps between ships, with the \"Diadème\" taken aback and paying round on the other tack. Sir Charles Douglas noted the immediate effect of the flagship breaking through brought four French ships near the point of penetration almost into contact, creating a large target attacked simultaneously by the \"Duke,\" \"Namur,\" and \"Formidable\" (ninety-gun ships), each delivering multiple broadsides with devastating effect. The \"Duke,\" following the flagship, also broke through, passing north of the clustered French ships and subjecting them to fire from both sides. The \"Magnanime's\" log records passing under fire from two three-deckers on either side.  With the line broken, Rodney lowered the signal for the line, maintaining close action, and ordered his van, now north of the enemy's rear, to rejoin the English centre, a maneuver delayed by sail and spar damage.  His flagship and accompanying ships went about. Hood's rear, instead of rejoining the centre, stood to windward and was becalmed far from the rest of the fleet.",

    "section": "Effects of Rodney's Maneuver",
    "text": "Much debate arose later regarding Rodney's line-breaking maneuver's wisdom and its originator.  While evidence suggests Douglas's suggestion, Rodney bears full responsibility for the results. The maneuver's value outweighs personal reputation. Some argue it was unfortunate, attributing it to circumstance rather than choice, suggesting continuing along the French rear's lee, inflicting fire from the entire English line, then tacking and doubling on the French rear. This argument overlooks that tacking after such an engagement was possible for only some ships, which would struggle to overtake less-crippled enemies. This proposed attack, mirroring the Battle of Ushant, essentially has fleets passing on opposite tacks, distributing fire without concentrating on any part.  Admittedly, Rodney's change of course allowed eleven French rear ships to escape leeward, receiving fire from only part of the English line while the English van endured fire from nearly the entire French fleet. However, these ships were effectively removed from action for a crucial period, driven leeward, and further out of position to assist their fleet.  Rodney's action alone divided the French fleet, with six miles separating the two parts, one hopelessly leeward.  The English, gaining the wind, could easily contain the eleven leeward ships and surround the nineteen weather ships with overwhelming force. The actual situation, due to two line breaches, placed De Grasse's group of six between his weather and lee divisions, two miles from the former and four from the latter. This offered tactical advantages for the English, compounding the French confusion.  A key lesson comes from the English guns' immediate effect while passing through. Three of the five captured ships were those pierced by the English divisions. Instead of equal exchange of fire as parallel lines passed, French ships near the penetrating columns received successive fire from the entire enemy division. Hood's thirteen ships filed past the \"Cesar\" and \"Hector,\" crushing them under concentrated fire, while Rodney's six similarly devastated the \"Glorieux.\" This \"concentration by defiling\" parallels concentrating on a line's flank, a potent attack then and now.  Seizing their advantage, the English could have fired on ships on both sides of the gaps, as the \"Formidable\" did; but they used starboard broadsides, and many missed their opportunity. Rodney's action yielded: (1) Gaining the wind and offensive action; (2) Concentrated fire; and (3) French confusion and division, offering further tactical advantage.  It's insufficient to argue that quicker French action could have mitigated this. A good maneuver doesn't lose merit because the enemy can counter it. The maneuver was sagacious despite the French fragments' potential for quicker union. The alternative, tacking after passing the enemy's rear, resulted in a stern chase with both sides equally engaged and crippled.  Both fleets signaled numerous disabilities.",

Admiral La Gravière acknowledges the generally heavier calibre of French cannons at that time.  Superior French ship construction and deeper draughts contributed to their sailing and beating abilities, partially explaining De Grasse's success in gaining windward positions. On the 11th's afternoon, only three or four of his main fleet were visible from the English flagship's masthead, despite previously being within gunshot.",

    "section": "Lessons Deduced from the Battle",
    "text": "Rapidly handled from their lightness, firing grape and shot of large diameter, these guns were peculiarly harmful in close action and useless at long range. In a later despatch De Vaudreuil says : \" The effect of these new arms is most deadly within musket range ; it is they which so badly crippled us on the 12th of April.\" There were other gunnery innovations, in some at least of the English ships, which by increasing the accuracy, the rapidity, and the hold of fire, greatly augmented the power of their batteries. These were the introduction of locks, by which the man who aimed also fired ; and the fitting to the gun-carriages of breast-pieces and sweeps, so that the guns could be pointed farther ahead or astern, — that is, over a larger field than had been usual. In fights between single ships, not controlled in their movements by their relations to a fleet, this improvement would at times allow the possessor to take a position whence he could train upon his enemy without the latter being able to reply, and some striking instances of such tactical advantage are given. In a fleet fight, such as is now being considered, the gain was that the guns could be brought to bear farther forward, and could follow the opponent longer as he passed astern, thus doubling, or more, the number of shots he might receive, and lessening for him the interval of immunity enjoyed between two successive antagonists.^ These matters of antiquated and now obsolete detail carry with them lessons that are never obsolete ; they differ in no respect from the more modern experiences with the needle-gun and the torpedo. And indeed this whole action of April 12, 1782, is fraught with sound military teaching. Perseverance in pursuit, gaining advantage of position, concentration of one's own effort, dispersal of the enemy's force, the efficient tactical bearing of small but important improvements in the material of war, have been dwelt on. To insist further upon the necessity of not letting slip a chance to beat the enemy in detail, would be thrown away on any one not already convinced by the bearing of April 9 on April 12. The abandonment of the attack upon Jamaica, after the defeat of the French fleet, shows conclusively that the true way to secure ulterior objects is to defeat the force which threatens them. There remains at least one criticism, delicate in its character, but essential to draw out the full teachings of these events ; that is, upon the manner in which the victory was followed up, and the consequent effects upon the war in general.",

    "section": "Rodney's Failure to Pursue the Enemy",
    "text": "The liability of sailing-ships to injury in spars and sails, in other words, in that mobility which is the prime characteristic of naval strength, makes it difficult to say, after a lapse of time, what might or might not have been done. It is not only a question of actual damage received, which log-books may record, but also of the means for repair, the energy and aptitude of the officers and seamen, which differ from ship to ship. As to the ability of the English fleet, however, to follow up its advantages by a more vigorous pursuit on the 12th of April, we have the authority of two most distinguished officers, — Sir Samuel Hood, the second in command, and Sir Charles Douglas, the captain of the fleet, or chief-of-staff to the admiral. The former expressed the opinion that twenty ships might have been taken, and said so to Rodney the next day ; while the chief-of-staff was so much mortified by the failure, and by the manner in which the admiral received his suggestions, as seriously to contemplate resigning his position.^ Advice and criticism are easy, nor can the full weight of a responsibility be felt, except by the man on whom it is laid ; but great results cannot often be reached in war without risk and effort. The accuracy of the judgment of these two officers, however, is confirmed by inference from the French reports. Rodney justifies his failure to pursue by alleging the crippled condition of many ships, and other matters incident to the conclusion of a hard-fought battle, and then goes on to suggest what might have been done that night, had he pursued, by the French fleet, which \" went off in a body of twenty-six ships-of-the-line.\" ^ These possibilities are rather creditable to his imagination, considering what the French fleet had done by day ; but as regards the body of twenty-six ^ ships, De Vaudreuil, who, after De Grasse's surrender, made the signal for the ships to rally round his flag, found only ten with him next morning, and was not joined by any more before the 14th. During the following days five more joined him at intervals.^ With these he went to the rendezvous at Cap Français, where he found others, bringing the whole number who repaired thither to twenty. The five remaining, of those that had been in the action, fled to Curaçao, six hundred miles distant, and did not rejoin until May. The \" body of twenty-six ships,\" therefore, had no existence in fact ; on the contrary, the French fleet was very badly broken up, and several of its ships isolated. As regards the crippled condition, there seems no reason to think the English had suffered more, but rather less, than their enemy ; and a curious statement, bearing upon this, appears in a letter from Sir Gilbert Blane : — \" It was with difficulty we could make the French officers believe that the returns of killed and wounded, made by our ships to the admiral, were true ; and one of them flatly contradicted me, saying we always gave the world a false account of our loss. I then walked with him over the decks of the ' Formidable,' and bid him remark what number of shot-holes there were, and also how little her rigging had suffered, and asked if that degree of damage was likely to be connected with the loss of more than fourteen men, which was our number killed, and the greatest of any in the fleet, except the 'Royal Oak ' and ' Monarch.' He . . . owned our fire must have been much better kept up and directed than theirs.\" ^ There can remain little doubt, therefore, that the advantage was not followed up with all possible vigor. Not till five days after the battle was Hood's division sent toward San Domingo, where they picked up in the Mona Passage the \" Jason \" and the \" Caton,\" which had separated before the battle and were on their way to Cap Français. These, and two small vessels with them, were the sole after-fruits of the victory.",

He had saved Jamaica for the time ; but he had not, having the opportunity, crushed the French fleet. He too, like De Grasse, had allowed the immediate objective to blind him to the general military situation, and to the factor which controlled it. To appreciate the consequences of this neglect, and the real indecisiveness of this celebrated battle, we must go forward a year and listen to the debates in Parliament on the conditions of peace, in February, 1783. The approval or censure of the terms negotiated by the existing ministry involved the discussion of many considerations ; but the gist of the dispute was, whether the conditions were such as the comparative financial and military situations of the belligerents justified, or whether it would have been better for England to continue the war rather than submit to the sacrifices she had made. As regards the financial condition, despite the gloomy picture drawn by the advocates of the peace, there was probably no more doubt then than there is now about the comparative resources of the different countries. The question of military strength was really that of naval power. The ministry argued that the whole British force hardly numbered one hundred sail-of-the-line, while the navies of France and Spain amounted to one hundred and forty, not to speak of that of Holland. \" With so glaring an inferiority, what hopes of success could we derive, either from the experience of the last campaign, or from any new distribution of our force in that which would have followed ? In the West Indies we could not have had more than forty-six sail to oppose to forty, which on the day that peace was signed lay in Cadiz Bay, with sixteen thousand troops on board, ready to sail for that quarter of the world, where they would have been joined by twelve of the line from Havana and ten from San Domingo. . . . Might we not too reasonably apprehend that the campaign in the West Indies would have closed with the loss of Jamaica itself, the avowed object of this immense armament ? \" ^ These are certainly the reasonings of an avowed partisan, for which large allowances must be made. The accuracy of the statement of comparative numbers was denied by Lord Keppel, a member of the same party, and but lately at the head of the admiralty, a post which he had resigned because he disapproved the treaty .^ English statesmen, too, as well as English seamen, must by this time have learned to discount largely the apparent, when estimating the real, power of the other navies. Nevertheless, how different would have been the appreciation of the situation, both moral and material, had Rodney reaped the full fruits of the victory which he owed rather to chance than to his own merit, great as that undeniably was.",

In the fallen and discouraging state of English affairs at the time, it excited the utmost exultation, and silenced the strictures which certain parts of the admiral's previous con- duct had drawn forth. The people were not in a humor to be critical, and amid the exaggerated notions that prevailed of the results achieved, no one thought of the failure to obtain greater. This impression long prevailed. As late as 1830, when Rodney's Life was first published, it was asserted \" that the French navy had been so effectually crippled and re- duced by the decisive victory of the 12th of April, as to be 1 Page 404. Yet here also the gossip of the day, as reflected in the Naval Atalantis, imputed the chief credit to Young, the captain of the flag-ship. Sir Gilbert Blane stated, many years later, \" When it was close upon sunset, it became a question whether the chase should be continued. After some dis- cussion between the admiral and captain, at which I was present, the admiral being confined with the gout, it was decided to persist in the same course with the signal to engage to leeward.\" (United Service Journal, 1800, Part II. p. 479.) - Rodney was a strong Tory. Almost all the other distinguished admirals of the day, notably Keppel, Howe, and Barrington, were Whigs, — a fact unfortunate for the naval power of England. SUBSEQUENT CAREER OF BE GRASSE. 501 no longer in a condition to contest with Great Britain the empire of the seas.\" This is nonsense, excusable in 1782, but not to the calm thought of after days. The favorable terms obtained were due to the financial embarrassment of France, not to her naval humiliation ; and if there was exaggeration in the contention of the advocates of peace that England could not save Jamaica, it is probable that she could not have recovered by arms the other islands restored to her by the treaty. The memory of De Grasse will always be associated with great services done to America. His name, rather than that of Rochambeau, represents tlie material succor which France gave to the struggling life of the young Republic, as Lafayette's recalls the moral sympathy so opportunely extended. The incidents of his life, subsequent to the great disaster which closed his active career, cannot be witliout interest to American readers. After the surrender of the \" Yille de Paris,\" De Grasse accompanied the English fleet and its prizes to Jamaica, whither Rodney repaired to refit his ships, thus appear- ing as a captive upon the scene of his intended conquest.",

Both by naval officers and by the English people he was treated with that flattering and benevolent attention which comes easily from the victor to the van- quished, and of which his personal valor at least was not unworthy. It is said that he did not refuse to show himself on several occasions upon the balcony of his rooms in Lon- don, to the populace shouting for the valiant Frenchman. This undignified failure to appreciate his true position naturally excited the indignation of his countrymen ; the more so as he had been unsparing and excessive in de- nouncing the conduct of his subordinates on the unlucky 12th of April. \" He bears his misfortune,\" wrote Sir Gilbert Blane, \" with equa- nimity ; conscious, as he says, that he has done his duty. ... He attributes his misfortune, not to the inferiority of his force, but to the 502 FINDINGS OF THE COURT-MARTIAL base desertion of his officers in the other ships, to whom lie made the signal to rally, and even hailed them to abide by him, but was abandoned.\" ^ This was the key-note to all his utterances. Writing from the English flag-ship, the day after the battle, he '' threw upon the greater part of his captains the misfortunes of the day. Some had disobeyed his signals ; others, and notably the captains of the ' Languedoc ' and ' Couronne,' that is to say his next ahead and astern, had abandoned him.\" ^ He did not, however, confine himself to official reports, but while a prisoner in London published several pamphlets to the same effect, which he sent broadcast over Europe. The government, naturally thinking that an officer could not thus sully the honor of his corps without good reason, resolved to search out and relentlessly punish all the guilty. The captains of the \" Languedoc \" and \" Couronne \" were imprisoned as soon as they reached France, and all papers, logs, etc., bearing upon the case were gathered together. Under all the circumstances it is not to be wondered at that on his return to France, De Grasse, to use his own words, \" found no one to hold out a hand to him.\" ^ It was not till the beginning of 1784 that all the accused and witnesses were ready to appear before the court-martial ; but the result of the trial was to clear entirely and in the most ample manner almost every one whom he had attacked, while the faults found were considered of a character entitled to indulgence, and were awarded but slight punishment. \" Nevertheless,\" cautiously observes a French writer, \" one cannot but say, with the Court, that the capture of an ad- miral commanding thirty ships-of-the-line is an historical incident which causes the regret of the whole nation.\" * As 1 Rodney's Life, vol. ii. p. 242. 2 Chevalier, p. 311. ^ Kerguelen : Guerre Maritime de 1778.

It is interesting to note in this connection tliat one of the ships near the French admiral, when he surrendered, was the \" Pluton,\" which, though the extreme rear ship, had nevertheless thus reached a position worthy of the high reputation of her captain, D' Albert de Rions. UPON DE GRASSE AND HIS OFFICERS. 503 to the conduct of the battle by the admiral, the Court found that the danger of the '' Zel^ \" on the morning of the 12th was not such as to justify bearing down for so long a time as was done ; that the crippled ship had a breeze which was not then shared by the English, five miles away to the southward, and which carried her into Basse Terre at ten A. M. ; that the engagement should nut have been begun before all the ships had come into line ; and finally, that the fleet should have been formed on the same tack as the English, because, by continuing to stand south, it entered the zone of calms and light airs at the north end of Dominica.^ De Grasse was much dissatisfied with the finding of the Court, and was indiscreet enough to write to the minister of marine, protesting against it and demanding a new trial. The minister, acknowledging his protest, replied in the name of the king. After commenting upon the pamphlets that had been so widely issued, and the entire contradiction of their statements by the testimony before the Court, he concluded with these weighty words : — \" The loss of the battle cannot be attributed to the fault of private oflBcers.^ It results, from the findings, that you have allowed yourself to injure, by ill-founded accusations, the reputation of several officers, in order to clear yourself in public opinion of an unhappy result, the excuse for which you might perhaps have found in the inferiority of your force, in the uncertain fortune of war, and in circumstances over which you had no control. His Majesty is willing to believe that you did what you could to prevent the misfortunes of the day ; but he cannot be equally indulgent to your unjust imputations upon those officers of his navy who have been cleared of the charges against them. His Majesty, dissatisfied with your conduct in this respect, forbids you to present yourself before him. I transmit his orders with re- gret, and add my own advice to retire, under the circumstances, to your province.\" De Grasse died in January, 1788.

He died in 1816, at the great age of ninety-two.",

    "text": "Critical Discussion of the Maritime War of 1778. nPHE war of 1778, between Great Britain and the House of •^ Bourbon, which is so inextricably associated with the American Revolution, stands by itself in one respect. It was purely a maritime war. Not only did the allied kingdoms carefully refrain from continental entanglements, Avhich Eng- land in accordance with her former policy strove to excite, but there was between the two contestants an approach to equality on the sea which had not been realized since the days of Tourville. The points in dispute, the objects for which the war was undertaken or at which it aimed, were for the most part remote from Europe ; and none of them was on the con- tinent with the single exception of Gibraltar, the strife over which, being at the extreme point of a rugged and dijfficult salient, and separated from neutral nations by the whole of France and Spain, never threatened to drag in other parties than those immediately interested. No such conditions existed in any war between the acces- sion of Louis XIV. and the downfall of Napoleon. There was a period during the reign of the former in Avhich the French navy was superior in number and equipment to the Englisli and Dutch ; but the policy and ambition of the sover- eign was always directed to continental extension, and his naval power, resting on inadequate foundations, was epheme- ral. During the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century there was practically no check to the sea power of England ; great as were its effects upon the issues of the day, the ab- sence of a capable rival made its operations barren of military lessons. In the later wars of the French Republic and Em- 506 SPECIAL INTEREST OF THE WAR OF 1778. pire, the apparent equality in numbers of ships and weight of batteries was illusive, owing to the demoralization of the French officers and seamen by causes upon which it is not necessary here to enlarge. After some years of courageous but impotent effort, the tremendous disaster of Trafalgar proclaimed to the world the professional inefficiency of the French and Spanish navies, already detected by the keen eyes of Nelson and his brother officers, and upon which rested the contemptuous confidence that cliaracterized his attitude, and to some extent his tactics, toward them. Thenceforward the emperor \" turned his eyes from the only field of battle where fortune had been unfaithful to him, and deciding to pursue England elsewhere than upon the seas, undertook to restore his navy, but without reserving to it any share in a strife become more than ever furious. . . . Up to the last day of the Empire he refused to offer to this restored navy, full of ardor and confidence, the opportunity to measure itself with the enemy.\" ^ Great Britain resumed her old position as unquestioned mis- tress of the seas. The student of naval war will therefore expect to find a particular interest in the plans and methods of the parties to this great contest, and especially where they concern the gen- eral conduct of the whole war, or of certain large and clearly defined portions of it ; in the strategic purpose which gave, or should have given, continuity to their actions from first to last, and in the strategic movements which affected for good or ill the fortunes of the more limited periods, which may be called naval campaigns. For while it cannot be conceded that the particular battles are, even at this day, wholly devoid of tactical instruction, which it has been one of the aims of the preceding pages to elicit, it is undoubtedly true that, like all the tactical systems of history, they have had their day, and their present usefulness to the student is rather in the mental training, in the forming of correct tacticial habits of thought, than in supplying models for close imitation. On the other hand, the movements which precede and prepare for great 1 Jurieu de la Gravi^re : Guerres Maritimes, vol. ii. p. 255.

    "text": "In considering any war, it's crucial to understand the objectives of each belligerent.  The military objective might differ from the political object.  In the War of 1778, the main parties were Great Britain versus the House of Bourbon (France and Spain), with the American colonies and later Holland playing lesser roles. The Americans simply wanted independence from Britain. Holland, safe from land invasion, sought minimal losses with allied naval support.  Britain's objective was to retain control of her colonies, a goal complicated by France and Spain's entry into the war.  Forcing Holland into the conflict offered Britain some military advantage, opening up Dutch positions to attack.  France and Spain had more complex goals. While revenge and philosophical sympathy for the colonists played a part, France primarily aimed to weaken Britain by seizing her West Indies possessions and gaining control of India.  Spain, similarly motivated to surpass Britain, specifically targeted Gibraltar, Minorca, and the Floridas, territories lost in previous conflicts.  Both Bourbon powers sought maritime and political superiority over Britain, a goal summarized in the French manifesto's phrase about ending England's \"tyrannical empire\" over the ocean.",

The American revolt disrupted this network, while France and Spain's growing navies challenged British maritime dominance. This presented an opportune moment to attack Britain.  The key question for the allies was selecting the right objectives.  Turgot, a French statesman, argued against American independence, believing their continued subjugation or controlled resistance would weaken Britain more.  While France ultimately supported American independence, this view influenced their strategy.  The American colonies were not the primary objective; rather, the conflict there served as a useful diversion.  The West Indies, while commercially valuable, were strategically vulnerable without naval superiority.  France forbade occupying captured islands, focusing instead on disrupting British control.  Secure bases already existed in Martinique, Cap Francais, and Havana.  The true objective was control of the fleets themselves, which held the key to the West Indies and served as crucial links between Europe and America.  Land operations in the West Indies were limited, highlighting the importance of naval power. This naval dominance also heavily influenced the war in America and the East Indies, where the capture of Trincomalee served as a crucial base for the French.",

In North America and India sound military policy pointed out, as the true objective, the enemy's fleet, upon which also depended the communications with the mother-countries. There remains Europe, which it is scarcely profitable to examine at length as a separate field of action, because its relations to the universal war are so much more important. It may simply be pointed out that the only two points in Europe whose political transfer was an object of the war were Gibraltar and Minorca; the former of which was throughout, by the urgency of Spain, made a principal objective of the allies. The tenure of both these depended, obviously, upon control of the sea.\n\nIn a sea war, as in all others, two things are from the first essential,—a suitable base upon the frontier, in this case the seaboard, from which the operations start, and an organized military force, in this case a fleet, of size and quality adequate to the proposed operations. If the war, as in the present instance, extends to distant parts of the globe, there will be needed in each of those distant regions secure ports for the shipping, to serve as secondary, or contingent, bases of the local war. Between these secondary and the principal, or home, bases there must be reasonably secure communication, which will depend upon military control of the intervening sea. This control must be exercised by the navy, which will enforce it either by clearing the sea in all directions of hostile cruisers, thus allowing the ships of its own nation to pass with reasonable security, or by accompanying in force (convoying) each train of supply-ships necessary for the support of the distant operations. The former method aims at a widely diffused effort of the national power, the other at a concentration of it upon that part of the sea where the convoy is at a given moment. Whichever be adopted, the communications will doubtless be strengthened by the military holding of good harbors, properly spaced yet not too numerous, along the routes,—as, for instance, the Cape of Good Hope and the Mauritius. Stations of this kind have always been necessary, but are doubly so now, as fuel needs renewing more frequently than did the provisions and supplies in former days.\n\nThese combinations of strong points at home and abroad, and the condition of the communications between them, may be called the strategic features of the general military situation, by which, and by the relative strength of the opposing fleets, the nature of the operations must be determined. In each of the three divisions of the field, Europe, America, and India, under which for sake of clearness the narrative has been given, the control of the sea has been insisted upon as the determining factor, and the hostile fleet therefore indicated as the true objective. Let the foregoing considerations now be applied to the whole field of war, and see how far the same conclusion holds good of it, and if so, what should have been the nature of the operations on either side.",

    "section": "The Bases of Operations",
    "text": "In Europe the home base of Great Britain was on the English Channel, with the two principal arsenals of Plymouth and Portsmouth. The base of the allied powers was on the Atlantic, the principal military ports being Brest, Ferrol, and Cadiz. Behind these, within the Mediterranean, were the dock-yards of Toulon and Cartagena, over against which stood the English station Port Mahon, in Minorca. The latter, however, may be left wholly out of account, being confined to a defensive part during the war, as the British fleet was not able to spare any squadron to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar, on the contrary, by its position, effectually watched over detachments or reinforcements from within the Straits, provided it were utilized as the station of a body of ships adequate to the duty. This was not done; the British European fleet being kept tied to the Channel, that is, to home defence, and making infrequent visits to the Rock to convoy supplies essential to the endurance of the garrison. There was, however, a difference in the parts played by Port Mahon and Gibraltar. The former, being at the time wholly unimportant, received no attention from the allies until late in the war, when it fell after a six months' siege; whereas the latter, being considered of the first importance, absorbed from the beginning a very large part of the allied attack, and so made a valuable diversion in favor of Great Britain. To this view of the principal features of the natural strategic situation in Europe may properly be added the remark, that such aid as Holland might be inclined to send to the allied fleets had a very insecure line of communication, being forced to pass along the English base on the Channel. Such aid in fact was never given.\n\nIn North America the local bases of the war at its outbreak were New York, Narragansett Bay, and Boston. The two former were then held by the English, and were the most important stations on the continent, from their position, susceptibility of defence, and resources. Boston had passed into the hands of the Americans, and was therefore at the service of the allies. From the direction actually given to the war, by diverting the active English operations to the Southern States in 1779, Boston was thrown outside the principal theatre of operations, and became from its position militarily unimportant; but had the plan been adopted of isolating New England by holding the line of the Hudson and Lake Champlain, and concentrating military effort to the eastward, it will be seen that these three ports would all have been of decisive importance to the issue. South of New York, the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays undoubtedly offered tempting fields for maritime enterprise; but the width of the entrances, the want of suitable and easily defended points for naval stations near the sea, the wide dispersal of the land forces entailed by an attempt to hold so many points, and the sickliness of the locality during a great part of the year, should have excepted them from a principal part in the plan of the first campaigns. It is not necessary to include them among the local bases of the war. To the extreme south the English were drawn by the ignis fatuus of expected support among the people. They failed to consider that even if a majority there preferred quiet to freedom, that very quality would prevent them from rising against the revolutionary government by which, on the English theory, they were oppressed; yet upon such a rising the whole success of this distant and in its end most unfortunate enterprise was staked. The local base of this war apart was Charleston, which passed into the hands of the British in May, 1780, eighteen months after the first expedition had landed in Georgia. The principal local bases of the war in the West Indies are already known through the previous narrative. They were for the English, Barbadoes, Sta. Lucia, and to a less degree Antigua. A thousand miles to leeward was the large island of Jamaica, with a dock-yard of great natural capabilities at Kingston. The allies held, in the first order of importance, Fort Royal in Martinique, and Havana; in the second order, Guadeloupe and Cap Français. A controlling feature of the strategic situation in that day, and one which will not be wholly without weight in our own, was the trade-wind, with its accompanying current. A passage to windward against these obstacles was a long and serious undertaking even for single ships, much more for larger bodies. It followed that fleets would go to the western islands only reluctantly, or when assured that the enemy had taken the same direction, as Rodney went to Jamaica after the Battle of the Saints, knowing the French fleet to have gone to Cap Français. This condition of the wind made the windward, or eastern, islands points on the natural lines of communication between Europe and America, as well as local bases of the naval war, and tied the fleets to them. Hence also it followed that between the two scenes of operations, between the continent and the Lesser Antilles, was interposed a wide central region into which the larger operations of war could not safely be carried except by a belligerent possessed of great naval superiority, or unless a decisive advantage had been gained upon one flank. In 1762, when England held all the Windward Islands, with undisputed superiority at sea, she safely attacked and subdued Havana; but in the years 1779-1782 the French sea power in America and the French tenure of the Windward Islands practically balanced her own, leaving the Spaniards at Havana free to prosecute their designs against Pensacola and the Bahamas, in the central region mentioned.",

    "text": "Posts like Martinique and Sta. Lucia had therefore for the present war great strategic advantage over Jamaica, Havana, or others to leeward. They commanded the latter in virtue of their position, by which the passage westward could be made so much more quickly than the return; while the decisive points of the continental struggle were practically little farther from the one than from the other. This advantage was shared equally by most of those known as the Lesser Antilles; but the small island of Barbadoes, being well to windward of all, possessed peculiar advantages, not only for offensive action, but because it was defended by the difficulty with which a large fleet could approach it, even from so near a port as Fort Royal. It will be remembered that the expedition which finally sat down before St. Kitt’s had been intended for Barbadoes, but could not reach it through the violence of the trade-wind. Thus Barbadoes, under the conditions of the time, was peculiarly fitted to be the local base and depot of the English war, as well as a wayside port of refuge on the line of communications to Jamaica, Florida, and even to North America; while Sta. Lucia, a hundred miles to leeward, was held in force as an advanced post for the fleet, watching closely the enemy at Fort Royal.\n\nIn India the political conditions of the peninsula necessarily indicated the eastern, or Coromandel, coast as the scene of operations. Trincomalee, in the adjacent island of Ceylon, though unhealthy, offered an excellent and defensible harbor, and thus acquired first-rate strategic importance, all the other anchorages on the coast being mere open roadsteads. From this circumstance the trade-winds, or monsoons, in this region also had strategic bearing. From the autumnal to the spring equinox the wind blows regularly from the northeast, at times with much violence, throwing a heavy surf upon the beach and making landing difficult; but during the summer months the prevailing wind is southwest, giving comparatively smooth seas and good weather. The “change of the monsoon,” in September and October, is often marked by violent hurricanes. Active operations, or even remaining on the coast, were therefore inadvisable from this time until the close of the northeast monsoon. The question of a port to which to retire during this season was pressing. Trincomalee was the only one, and its unique strategic value was heightened by being to windward, during the fine season, of the principal scene of war. The English harbor of Bombay on the west coast was too distant to be considered a local base, and rather falls, like the French islands Mauritius and Bourbon, under the head of stations on the line of communications with the mother-country.\n\nSuch were the principal points of support, or bases, of the belligerent nations, at home and abroad. Of those abroad it must be said, speaking generally, that they were deficient in resources,—an important element of strategic value. Naval and military stores and equipments, and to a great extent provisions for sea use, had to be sent them from the mother-countries. Boston, surrounded by a thriving, friendly population, was perhaps an exception to this statement, as was also Havana, at that time an important naval arsenal, where much ship-building was done; but these were distant from the principal theatres of war. Upon New York and Narragansett Bay the Americans pressed too closely for the resources of the neighboring country to be largely available, while the distant ports of the East and West Indies depended wholly upon home. Hence the strategic question of communications assumed additional importance. To intercept a large convoy of supply-ships was an operation only secondary to the destruction of a body of ships-of-war; while to protect such by main strength, or by evading the enemy’s search, taxed the skill of the governments and naval commanders in distributing the ships-of-war and squadrons at their disposal.",

    "text": "Among the many objects which demanded attention. The address of Kempenfeldt and the bad management of Guichen in the North Atlantic, seconded by a heavy gale of wind, seriously embarrassed De Grasse in the West Indies. Similar injury, by cutting off small convoys in the Atlantic, was done to Suffren in the Indian seas ; while the latter at once made good part of these losses, and worried his opponents by the success of his cruisers preying on the English supply-ships. Thus the navies, by which alone these vital streams could be secured or endangered, bore the same relation to the maintenance of the general war that has already been observed of the separate parts. They were the links that bound the whole together, and were therefore indicated as the proper objective of both belligerents. The distance from Europe to America was not such as to make intermediate ports of supply absolutely necessary; while if difficulty did arise from an unforeseen cause, it was always possible, barring meeting an enemy, either to return to Europe or to make a friendly port in the West Indies. The case was different with the long voyage to India by the Cape of Good Hope. Bickerton, leaving England with a convoy in February, was thought to have done well in reaching Bombay the following September ; while the ardent Suffren, sailing in March, took an equal time to reach Mauritius, whence the passage to Madras consumed two months more. A voyage of such duration could rarely be made without a stop for water, for fresh provisions, often for such refitting as called for the quiet of a harbor, even when the stores on board furnished the necessary material. A perfect line of communications required, as has been said, several such harbors, properly spaced, adequately defended, and with abundant supplies, such as England in the present day holds on some of her main commercial routes, acquisitions of her past wars. In the war of 1778 none of the belligerents had such ports on this route, until, by the accession of Holland, the Cape of Good Hope was put at the disposal of the French and suitably strengthened by Suffren. With this and the Mauritius on the way, and Trincomalee at the far end of the road, the communications of the allies with France were reasonably guarded. England, though then holding St. Helena, depended, for the refreshment and refitting of her India-bound squadrons and convoys in the Atlantic, upon the benevolent neutrality of Portugal, extended in the islands of Madeira and Cape Verde and in the Brazilian ports. This neutrality was indeed a frail reliance for defence, as was shown by the encounter between Johnstone and Suffren at the Cape Verde ; but there being several possible stopping-places, and the enemy unable to know which, if any, would be used, this ignorance itself conferred no small security, if the naval commander did not trust it to the neglect of proper disposition of his own force, as did Johnstone at Porto Praya. Indeed, with the delay and uncertainty which then characterized the transmission of intelligence from one point to another, doubt where to find the enemy was a greater bar to offensive enterprises than the often slight defences of a colonial port. This combination of useful harbors and the conditions of the communications between them constitute, as has been said, the main strategic outlines of the situation. The navy, as the organized force linking the whole together, has been indicated as the principal objective of military effort. The method employed to reach the objective, the conduct of the war, is still to be considered.",

    "text": "Before doing this a condition peculiar to the sea, and affecting the following discussion, must be briefly mentioned ; that is, the difficulty of obtaining information. Armies pass through countries more or less inhabited by a stationary population, and they leave behind them traces of their march. Fleets move through a desert over which wanderers flit, but where they do not remain; and as the waters close behind them, an occasional waif from the decks may indicate their passage, but tells nothing of their course. The sail spoken by the pursuer may know nothing of the pursued, which yet passed the point of parley but a few days or hours before. Of late, careful study of the winds and currents of the ocean has laid down certain advantageous routes, which will be habitually followed by a careful seaman, and afford some presumption as to his movements ; but in 1778 the data for such precision were not collected, and even had they been, the quickest route must often have been abandoned for one of the many possible ones, in order to elude pursuit or lying-in-wait. In such a game of hide-and-seek the advantage is with the sought, and the great importance of watching the outlets of an enemy's country, of stopping the chase before it has got away into the silent desert, is at once evident. If for any reason such a watch there is impossible, the next best thing is, not attempting to watch routes which may not be taken, to get first to the enemy's destination and await him there ; but this implies a knowledge of his intentions which may not always be obtainable. The action of Suffren, when pitted against Johnstone, was throughout strategically sound, both in his attack at Porto Praya and in the haste with which he made for their common destination ; while the two failures of Rodney to intercept the convoys to Martinique in 1780 and 1782, though informed that they were coming, show the difficulty which attended lying-in-wait even when the point of arrival was known. Of any maritime expedition two points only are fixed, — the point of departure and that of arrival. The latter may be unknown to the enemy ; but up to the time of sailing, the presence of a certain force in a port, and the indications of a purpose soon to move, may be assumed as known. It may be of moment to either belligerent to intercept such a movement ; but it is more especially and universally necessary to the defence, because, of the many points at which he is open to attack, it may be impossible for him to know which is threatened ; whereas the offence proceeds with full knowledge direct to his aim, if he can deceive his opponent. The importance of blocking such an expedition becomes yet more evident should it at any time be divided between two or more ports, — a condition which may easily arise when the facilities of a single dock-yard are insufficient to fit out so many ships in the time allowed, or when, as in the present war, allied powers furnish separate contingents. To prevent the junction of these contingents is a matter of prime necessity, and nowhere can this be done so certainly as off the ports whence one or both is to sail. The defence, from its very name, is presumably the less strong, and is therefore the more bound to take advantage of such a source of weakness as the division of the enemy's force. Rodney in 1782 at Sta. Lucia, watching the French contingent at Martinique to prevent its union with the Spaniards at Cap Frangais, is \"an instance of correct strategic position ; and had the islands been so placed as to put him between the French and their destination, instead of in their rear, nothing better could have been devised. As it was, he did the best thing possible under the circumstances. The defence, being the weaker, cannot attempt to block all the ports where divisions of the enemy lie, without defeating his aim by being in inferior force before each. This would be to neglect the fundamental principles of war. If he correctly decide not to do this, but to collect a superior force before one or two points, it becomes necessary to decide which shall be thus guarded and which neglected, — a question involving the whole policy of the war after a full understanding of the main conditions, military, moral, and economic, in every quarter.",

    "text": "Graves is not much better.\" ^ The high professional opinion of Lord Howe was also adverse to the practice. Besides the exhaustion of men and ships, it must also be admitted that no blockade could be relied on certainly to check the exit of an enemy's fleet. Villeneuve escaped from Toulon, Missiessy from Rochefort. \" I am here watching the French squadron in Rochefort,\" wrote Collingwood, \" but feel that it is not practicable to prevent their sailing ; and yet, if they should get by me, I should be exceedingly mor- tified. . . . The only thing that can prevent their sailing is the apprehension that they may get among us, as they can- not know exactly where we are.\" ^ Nevertheless, the strain then was endured. The English fleets girdled the shores of France and Spain ; losses were made good ; ships were repaired ; as one officer fell, or was worn out at his post, another took his place. The strict guard over Brest broke up the emperor's combinations ; the watchfulness of Nelson, despite an unusual concurrence of difficulties, followed the Toulon fleet, from the moment of its starting, across the Atlantic and back to the shores of Eu- rope. It was long before they came to blows, before strategy stepped aside and tactics completed the work at Trafalgar ; but step by step and point by point the rugged but disci- plined seamen, the rusty and battered but well-handled ships, blocked each move of their unpractised opponents. Disposed in force before each arsenal of the enemy, and linked together by chains of smaller vessels, they might fail now and again to check a raid, but they effectually stopped all grand com- binations of the enemy's squadrons. 1 Life and Letters of Lord Collingwood. The ships of 1805 were essentially the same as those of 1780. There had doubtless been progress and improvement ; but the changes were in degree, not in kind. Not only so, but the fleets of twenty years earlier, under Hawke and his fellows, had dared the winters of the Bay of Biscay. \" There is not in Hawke's correspondence,\" says his biographer, \" the slightest indication that he himself doubted for a moment that it was not only possible, but his duty, to keep the sea, even through the storms of winter, and that he should soon be able to ' make downright work of it.' \" ^ If it be urged that the condition of the French navy was better, the character and training of its officers higher, than in the days of Hawke and Nelson, the fact must be admitted ; nevertheless, the ad- miralty could not long have been ignorant that the number of such officers was still so deficient as seriously to affect the quality of the deck service, and the lack of seamen so great as to necessitate filling up the complements with soldiers. As for the personnel of the Spanish navy, there is no reason to believe it better than fifteen years later, when Nelson, speaking of Spain giving certain ships to France, said, \" I take it for granted not manned [by Spaniards], as that would be the readiest way to lose them again.\" In truth, however, it is too evident to need much arguing, that the surest way for the weaker party to neutralize the enemy's ships was to watch them in their harbors and fight them if they started. The only serious objection to doing this, in Europe, was the violence of the weather off the coasts of France and Spain, especially during the long nights of winter. This brought with it not only risk of immediate dis- aster, which strong, well-managed ships would rarely undergo, but a continual strain which no skill could prevent, and which therefore called for a large reserve of ships to relieve those sent in for repairs, or to refresh the crews. The problem would be greatly simplified if the blockading fleet could find a convenient anchorage on the flank of the route the enemy must take, as Nelson in 180-1 and 1805 used Maddalena Bay in Sardinia when watching the Toulon fleet, — a step to which he was further forced by the excep- tionally bad condition of many of his ships. So Sir James Saumarez in 1800 even used Douarnenez Bay, on the French coast, only five miles from Brest, to anchor the in-shore squad- ron of the blockadhig force in heavy weather. The positions at Plymouth and Torbay cannot be considered perfectly satis- factory from this point of view ; not being, like Maddalena Bay, on the flank of the enemy's route, but like Sta. Lucia, rather to its rear. Nevertheless, Hawke proved that diligence and well-managed ships could overcome this disadvantage, as Rodney also afterward showed on his less tempestuous station.",

Every opportunity has been offered the enemy to put to sea, for it is there we hope to realize the hopes and expectations of our country.\" \" Nothing,\" he says again, \" ever kept the French fleet in Toulon or Brest when they had a mind to come out ; \" and although the statement is somewhat exaggerated, it is true that the attempt to shut them up in port would have been hopeless. What Nelson expected by keeping near their ports, with enough lookout ships properly distributed, was to know when they sailed and what direction they took, intending, to use his own expression, to \" follow them to the antipodes.\" \" I am led to believe,\" he writes at another time, \" that the Ferrol squadron of French ships will push for the Mediter- ranean. If it join that in Toulon, it will much outnumber us ; but I shall never lose sight of them, and Pellew (commanding the English squadron off Ferrol) will soon be after them.\" So it happened often enough during that prolonged war that divisions of French ships escaped, through stress of weather, temporary absence of a blockading fleet, or misjudgment on the part of its commander ; but the alarm was quickly given, some of the many frigates caught sight of tliem, followed to detect their probable destination, passed the word from point to point and from fleet to fleet, and soon a division of equal force was after them, \" to the antipodes \" if need were. As, according to the traditional use of the French navy by French governments, their expeditions went not to fight the hostile fleet, but with \" ulterior objects,\" the angry buzz and hot pursuit that immediately followed was far from conducive to an undisturbed and methodical execution of the programme laid down, even by a single division ; while to great combi- nations, dependent upon uniting the divisions from different ports, they were absolutely fatal. The adventurous cruise of Bruix, leaving Brest with twenty-five ships-of-the-line in 1799, the rapidity with which the news spread, the stirring action and individual mistakes of the English, the frustration of the French projects ^ and the closeness of the pursuit,^ the escape of Missiessy from Rochefort in 1805, of the divisions of Willaumez and Leissegues from Brest in 1806, — all these may be named, along with the great Trafalgar cam- paign, as affording interesting studies of a naval strategy following the lines here suggested ; while the campaign of 1798, despite its brilliant ending at the Nile, may be cited as a case where failure nearly ensued, owing to the English having no force before Toulon when the expedition sailed, and to Nelson being insufficiently provided with frigates. The nine weeks' cruise of Gantcaume in the Mediterranean, in 1808, also illustrates the difficulty of controlling a fleet which has been permitted to get out, unwatched by a strong force, even in such narrow waters.",

    "text": "No parallel instances can be cited from the war of 1778, although the old monarchy did not cover the movements of its fleets with the secrecy enforced by the stern military despotism of the Empire. In both epochs England stood on the defensive ; but in the earlier war she gave up the first line of the defence, off the hostile ports, and tried to protect all parts of her scattered empire by dividing the fleet among them. It has been attempted to show the weakness of the one policy, while admitting the difficulties and dangers of the other. The latter aims at shortening and deciding the war by either shutting up or forcing battle upon the hostile navy, recognizing that this is the key of the situation, when the sea at once unites and separates the different parts of the theatre of war. It requires a navy equal in number and superior in efficiency, to which it assigns a limited field of action, narrowed to the conditions which admit of mutual support among the squadrons occupying it. Thus distributed, it relies upon skill and watchfulness to intercept or overtake any division of the enemy which gets to sea. It defends remote possessions and trade by offensive action against the fleet, in which it sees their real enemy and its own principal objective. Being near the home ports, the relief and renewal of ships needing repairs are accomplished with the least loss of time, while the demands upon the scan- tier resources of the bases abroad are lessened. The other policy, to be effective, call sfor superior numbers, because the different divisions are too far apart for mutual support. Each must therefore be equal to any probable combination against it, which implies superiority everywhere to the force of the enemy actually opposed, as the latter may be unexpectedly reinforced. How impossible and dangerous such a defensive strategy is, when not superior in force, is shown by the fre- quent inferiority of the English abroad, as well as in Europe, despite the effort to be everywhere equal. Howe at New York in 1778, Byron at Grenada in 1779, Graves off the Chesa- peake in 1781, Hood at Martinique in 1781 and at St. Kitt's in 1782, all were inferior, at the same time that the allied fleet in Europe overwhelmingly outnumbered the English. In con- sequence, unseaworthy ships were retained, to the danger of their crews and their own increasing injury, rather than di- minish the force by sending them home ; for the deficiencies of the colonial dock-yards did not allow extensive repairs without crossing the Atlantic.",

    "text": "navies avoided or accepted action ; they never imposed it. Yet so long as the English navy was permitted thus with impunity to range the seas, not only was there no security that it would not frustrate the ulterior objects of the campaign, as it did again and again, but there was always the possibility that by some happy chance it would, by winning an important victory, restore the balance of strength. That it did not do so is to be imputed as a fault to the English ministry; but if England was wrong in permitting her European fleet to fall so far below that of the allies, the latter were yet more to blame for their failure to profit by the mistake. The stronger party, assuming the offensive, cannot plead the perplexities which account for, though they do not justify, the undue dispersal of forces by the defence anxious about many points. The national bias of the French, which found expression in the line of action here again and for the last time criticised, appears to have been shared by both the government and the naval officers of the day. It is the key to the course of the French navy, and, in the opinion of the author, to its failure to achieve more substantial results to France from this war. It is instructive, as showing how strong a hold tradition has over the minds of men, that a body of highly accomplished and gallant seamen should have accepted, apparently without a murmur, so inferior a role for their noble profession. It carries also a warning, if these criticisms are correct, that current opinions and plausible impressions should always be thoroughly tested; for if erroneous they work sure failure, and perhaps disaster.\n\nThere was such an impression largely held by French officers of that day, and yet more widely spread in the United States now, of the efficacy of commerce-destroying as a main reliance in war, especially when directed against a commercial country like Great Britain. “The surest means in my opinion,” wrote a distinguished officer, Lamotte-Picquet, “to conquer the English is to attack them in their commerce.” The harassment and distress caused to a country by serious interference with its commerce will be conceded by all. It is doubtless a most important secondary operation of naval war, and is not likely to be abandoned till war itself shall cease; but regarded as a primary and fundamental measure, sufficient in itself to crush an enemy, it is probably a delusion, and a most dangerous delusion, when presented in the fascinating garb of cheapness to the representatives of a people. Especially is it misleading when the nation against whom it is to be directed possesses, as Great Britain did and does, the two requisites of a strong sea power,—a wide-spread healthy commerce and a powerful navy. Where the revenues and industries of a country can be concentrated into a few treasure-ships, like the flota of Spanish galleons, the sinew of war may perhaps be cut by a stroke; but when its wealth is scattered in thousands of going and coming ships, when the roots of the system spread wide and far, and strike deep, it can stand many a cruel shock and lose many a goodly bough without the life being touched. Only by military command of the sea by prolonged control of the strategic centres of commerce, can such an attack be fatal; and such control can be wrung from a powerful navy only by fighting and overcoming it. For two hundred years England has been the great commercial nation of the world. More than any other her wealth has been intrusted to the sea in war as in peace; yet of all nations she has ever been most reluctant to concede the immunities of commerce and the rights of neutrals. Regarded not as a matter of right, but of policy, history has justified the refusal; and if she maintain her navy in full strength, the future will doubtless repeat the lesson of the past.",

This was the great outcome of the war. As between the European belligerents, Great Britain received back from France all the West India Islands she had lost, except Tobago, and gave up Sta. Lucia. The French stations in India were restored; and Trincomalee being in the possession of the enemy, England could not dispute its return to Holland, but she refused to cede Negapatam. To Spain, England surrendered the two Floridas and Minorca, the latter a serious loss had the naval power of Spain been sufficient to maintain possession of it; as it was, it again fell into the hands of Great Britain in the next war. Some unimportant redistribution of trading-posts on the west coast of Africa was also made. Trivial in themselves, there is but one comment that need be made upon these arrangements. In any coming war their permanency would depend wholly upon the balance of sea power, upon that empire of the seas concerning which nothing conclusive had been established by the war.

    "text": "At first sight nothing can appear more unpractical, less promising of useful result, than to approach the study of war with a theory. There seems indeed to be something essentially antagonistic between the habit of mind that seeks theoretical guidance and that which makes for the successful conduct of war. The conduct of war is so much a question of personality, of character, of common-sense, of rapid decision upon complex and ever-shifting factors, and those factors themselves are so varied, so intangible, so dependent upon unstable moral and physical conditions, that it seems incapable of being reduced to anything like true scientific analysis. At the bare idea of a theory or \"science\" of war the mind recurs uneasily to well-known cases where highly \"scientific\" officers failed as leaders. Yet, on the other hand, no one will deny that since the great theorists of the early nineteenth century attempted to produce a reasoned theory of war, its planning and conduct have acquired a method, a precision, and a certainty of grasp which were unknown before. Still less will any one deny the value which the shrewdest and most successful leaders in war have placed upon the work of the classical strategical writers.\n\nThe truth is that the mistrust of theory arises from a misconception of what it is that theory claims to do. It does not pretend to give the power of conduct in the field; it claims no more than to increase the effective power of conduct. Its main practical value is that it can assist a capable man to acquire a broad outlook whereby he may be the surer his plan shall cover all the ground, and whereby he may with greater rapidity and certainty seize all the factors of a sudden situation. The greatest of the theorists himself puts the matter quite frankly. Of theoretical study he says, \"It should educate the mind of the man who is to lead in war, or rather guide him to self-education, but it should not accompany him on the field of battle.\" Its practical utility, however, is not by any means confined to its effects upon the powers of a leader. It is not enough that a leader should have the ability to decide rightly; his subordinates must seize at once the full meaning of his decision and be able to express it with certainty in well-adjusted action. For this every man concerned must have been trained to think in the same plane; the chief's order must awake in every brain the same process of thought; his words must have the same meaning for all. If a theory of tactics had existed in 1780, and if Captain Carkett had had a sound training in such a theory, he could not possibly have misunderstood Rodney's signal. As it was, the real intention of the signal was obscure, and Rodney's neglect to explain the tactical device it indicated robbed his country of a victory at an hour of the direst need. There had been no previous theoretical training to supply the omission, and Rodney's fine conception was unintelligible to anybody but himself.",

    "text": "Nor is it only for the sake of mental solidarity between a chief and his subordinates that theory is indispensable. It is of still higher value for producing a similar solidarity between him and his superiors at the Council table at home. How often have officers dumbly acquiesced in ill-advised operations simply for lack of the mental power and verbal apparatus to convince an impatient Minister where the errors of his plan lay? How often, moreover, have statesmen and officers, even in the most harmonious conference, been unable to decide on a coherent plan of war from inability to analyse scientifically the situation they had to face, and to recognise the general character of the struggle in which they were about to engage. That the true nature of a war should be realised by contemporaries as clearly as it comes to be seen afterwards in the fuller light of history is seldom to be expected. At close range accidental factors will force themselves into undue prominence and tend to obscure the true horizon. Such error can scarcely ever be eliminated, but by theoretical study we can reduce it, nor by any other means can we hope to approach the clearness of vision with which posterity will read our mistakes. Theory is, in fact, a question of education and deliberation, and not of execution at all. That depends on the combination of intangible human qualities which we call executive ability. This, then, is all the great authorities ever claimed for theory, but to this claim the chief of them at least, after years of active service on the Staff, attached the highest importance. \"In actual operations,\" he wrote in one of his latest memoranda, \"men are guided solely by their judgment, and it will hit the mark more or less accurately according as they possess more or less genius. This is the way all great generals have acted.... Thus it will always be in action, and so far judgment will suffice. But when it is a question not of taking action yourself, but of convincing others at the Council table, then everything depends on clear conceptions and the exposition of the inherent relations of things. So little progress has been made in this respect that most deliberations are merely verbal contentions which rest on no firm foundation, and end either in every one retaining his own opinion, or in a compromise from considerations of mutual respect—a middle course of no actual value.\" The writer's experience of such discussions was rich and at first hand. Clear conceptions of the ideas and factors involved in a war problem, and a definite exposition of the relations between them, were in his eyes the remedy for loose and purposeless discussion; and such conceptions and expositions are all we mean by the theory or the science of war. It is a process by which we co-ordinate our ideas, define the meaning of the words we use, grasp the difference between essential and unessential factors, and fix and expose the fundamental data on which every one is agreed. In this way we prepare the apparatus of practical discussion; we secure the means of arranging the factors in manageable shape, and of deducing from them with precision and rapidity a practical course of action. Without such an apparatus no two men can even think on the same line; much less can they ever hope to detach the real point of difference that divides them and isolate it for quiet solution.",

    "text": "It can at least determine the normal. By careful collation of past events it becomes clear that certain lines of conduct tend normally to produce certain effects; that wars tend to take certain forms each with a marked idiosyncrasy; that these forms are normally related to the object of the war and to its value to one or both belligerents; that a system of operations which suits one form may not be that best suited to another. We can even go further. By pursuing an historical and comparative method we can detect that even the human factor is not quite indeterminable. We can assert that certain situations will normally produce, whether in ourselves or in our adversaries, certain moral states on which we may calculate. Having determined the normal, we are at once in a stronger position. Any proposal can be compared with it, and we can proceed to discuss clearly the weight of the factors which prompt us to depart from the normal. Every case must be judged on its merits, but without a normal to work from we cannot form any real judgment at all; we can only guess. Every case will assuredly depart from the normal to a greater or less extent, and it is equally certain that the greatest successes in war have been the boldest departures from the normal. But for the most part they have been departures made with open eyes by geniuses who could perceive in the accidents of the case a just reason for the departure. Take an analogous example, and the province of strategical theory becomes clear at once. Navigation and the parts of seamanship that belong to it have to deal with phenomena as varied and unreliable as those of the conduct of war. Together they form an art which depends quite as much as generalship on the judgment of individuals. The law of storms and tides, of winds and currents, and the whole of meteorology are subject to infinite and incalculable deflections, and yet who will deny nowadays that by the theoretical study of such things the seaman's art has gained in coherence and strength? Such study will not by itself make a seaman or a navigator, but without it no seaman or navigator can nowadays pretend to the name. Because storms do not always behave in the same way, because currents are erratic, will the most practical seaman deny that the study of the normal conditions are useless to him in his practical decisions?\nIf, then, the theoretical study of strategy be approached in this way—if, that is, it be regarded not as a substitute for judgment and experience, but as a means of fertilising both, it can do no man harm. Individual thought and common-sense will remain the masters and remain the guides to point the general direction when the mass of facts begins to grow bewildering. Theory will warn us the moment we begin to leave the beaten track, and enable us to decide with open eyes whether the divergence is necessary or justifiable. Above all, when men assemble in Council it will hold discussion to the essential lines, and help to keep side issues in their place. But beyond all this there lies in the theory of war yet another element of peculiar value to a maritime Empire. We are accustomed, partly for convenience and partly from lack of a scientific habit of thought, to speak of naval strategy and military strategy as though they were distinct branches of knowledge which had no common ground. It is the theory of war which brings out their intimate relation. It reveals that embracing them both is a larger strategy which regards the fleet and army as one weapon, which co-ordinates their action, and indicates the lines on which each must move to realise the full power of both.",

    "text": "It will direct us to assign to each its proper function in a plan of war; it will enable each service to realise the better the limitations and the possibilities of the function with which it is charged, and how and when its own necessities must give way to a higher or more pressing need of the other. It discloses, in short, that naval strategy is not a thing by itself, that its problems can seldom or never be solved on naval considerations alone, but that it is only a part of maritime strategy—the higher learning which teaches us that for a maritime State to make successful war and to realise her special strength, army and navy must be used and thought of as instruments no less intimately connected than are the three arms ashore. It is for these reasons that it is of little use to approach naval strategy except through the theory of war. Without such theory we can never really understand its scope or meaning, nor can we hope to grasp the forces which most profoundly affect its conclusions. PART ONE THEORY OF WAR CHAPTER ONE THE THEORY OF WAR The last thing that an explorer arrives at is a complete map that will cover the whole ground he has travelled, but for those who come after him and would profit by and extend his knowledge his map is the first thing with which they will begin. So it is with strategy. Before we start upon its study we seek a chart which will show us at a glance what exactly is the ground we have to cover and what are the leading features which determine its form and general characteristics. Such a chart a \"theory of war\" alone can provide. It is for this reason that in the study of war we must get our theory clear before we can venture in search of practical conclusions. So great is the complexity of war that without such a guide we are sure to go astray amidst the bewildering multiplicity of tracks and obstacles that meet us at every step. If for continental strategy its value has been proved abundantly, then for maritime strategy, where the conditions are far more complex, the need of it is even greater. By maritime strategy we mean the principles which govern a war in which the sea is a substantial factor. Naval strategy is but that part of it which determines the movements of the fleet when maritime strategy has determined what part the fleet must play in relation to the action of the land forces; for it scarcely needs saying that it is almost impossible that a war can be decided by naval action alone. Unaided, naval pressure can only work by a process of exhaustion. Its effects must always be slow, and so galling both to our own commercial community and to neutrals, that the tendency is always to accept terms of peace that are far from conclusive. For a firm decision a quicker and more drastic form of pressure is required. Since men live upon the land and not upon the sea, great issues between nations at war have always been decided—except in the rarest cases—either by what your army can do against your enemy's territory and national life or else by the fear of what the fleet makes it possible for your army to do. The paramount concern, then, of maritime strategy is to determine the mutual relations of your army and navy in a plan of war. When this is done, and not till then, naval strategy can begin to work out the manner in which the fleet can best discharge the function assigned to it. The problem of such co-ordination is one that is susceptible of widely varying solutions. It may be that the command of the sea is of so urgent an importance that the army will have to devote itself to assisting the fleet in its special task before it can act directly against the enemy's territory and land forces; on the other hand, it may be that the immediate duty of the fleet will be to forward military action ashore before it is free to devote itself whole-heartedly to the destruction of the enemy's fleets. The crude maxims as to primary objects which seem to have served well enough in continental warfare have never worked so clearly where the sea enters seriously into a war. In such cases it will not suffice to say the primary object of the army is to destroy the enemy's army, or that of the fleet to destroy the enemy's fleet. The delicate interactions of the land and sea factors produce conditions too intricate for such blunt solutions. Even the initial equations they present are too complex to be reduced by the simple application of rough-and-ready maxims. Their right handling depends upon the broadest and most fundamental principles of war, and it is as a standpoint from which to get a clear and unobstructed view of the factors in their true relations that a theory of war has perhaps its highest value. The theory which now holds the field is that war in a fundamental sense is a continuation of policy by other means. The process by which the continental strategists arrived at it involved some hard philosophical reasoning.",

    "text": "of the universal practice which obtained in the barbaric stages of social development, and which every civilisation in turn had abandoned as economically unsound and subversive of specialisation in citizenship. The results of the abandonment were sometimes good and sometimes bad, but the determining conditions have been studied as yet too imperfectly to justify any broad generalisation. Secondly, there is the idea of strenuous and persistent effort—not resting to secure each minor advantage, but pressing the enemy without pause or rest till he is utterly overthrown—an idea in which Cromwell had anticipated Napoleon by a century and a half. Scarcely distinguishable from this is a third idea—that of taking the offensive, in which there was really nothing new at all, since its advantages had always been understood, and Frederick the Great had pressed it to extremity with little less daring than Napoleon himself—nay even to culpable rashness, as the highest exponents of the Napoleonic idea admit. Finally, there is the notion of making the armed forces of the enemy and not his territory or any part of it your main objective. This perhaps is regarded as the strongest characteristic of Napoleon's methods, and yet even here we are confused by the fact that undoubtedly on some very important occasions—the Austerlitz campaign, for example—Napoleon made the hostile capital his objective as though he believed its occupation was the most effective step towards the overthrow of the enemy's power and will to resist. He certainly did not make the enemy's main army his primary objective—for their main army was not Mack's but that of the Archduke Charles. On the whole then, when men speak of the Napoleonic system they seem to include two groups of ideas—one which comprises the conception of war made with the whole force of the nation; the other, a group which includes the Cromwellian idea of persistent effort, Frederick's preference for the offensive at almost any risk, and finally the idea of the enemy's armed forces as the main objective, which was also Cromwell's. It is the combination of these by no means original or very distinct ideas that we are told has brought about so entire a change in the conduct of war that it has become altogether a different thing. It is unnecessary for our purpose to consider how far the facts seem to support such a conclusion, for in the inherent nature of things it must be radically unsound. Neither war nor anything else can change in its essentials. If it appears to do so, it is because we are still mistaking accidents for essentials, and this is exactly how it struck the acutest thinkers of Napoleonic times. For a while it is true they were bewildered, but so soon as they had had time to clear their heads from the din of the struggle in which they had taken part, they began to see that the new phenomena were but accidents after all. They perceived that Napoleon's methods, which had taken the world by storm, had met with success in wars of a certain nature only, and that when he tried to extend those methods to other natures of war he had met with failure and even disaster. How was this to be explained? What theory, for instance, would cover Napoleon's successes in Germany and Italy, as well as his failures in Spain and Russia? If the whole conception of war had changed, how could you account for the success of England, who had not changed her methods? To us the answer to these questions is of living and infinite importance. Our standpoint remains still unchanged. Is there anything inherent in the conception of war that justifies that attitude in our case? Are we entitled to expect from it again the same success it met with in the past? The first man to enunciate a theory which would explain the phenomena of the Napoleonic era and co-ordinate them with previous history was General Carl von Clausewitz, a man whose arduous service on the Staff and the actual work of higher instruction had taught the necessity of systematising the study of his profession.",

    "text": "He was no mere professor, but a soldier bred in the severest school of war. The pupil and friend of Sharnhorst and Gneisenau, he had served on the Staff of Blücher in 1813, he had been Chief of the Staff to Wallmoden in his campaign against Davoust on the Lower Elbe, and also to the Third Prussian Army Corps in the campaign of 1815. Thereafter for more than ten years he was Director of the General Academy of War at Berlin, and died in 1831 as Chief of the Staff to Marshal Gneisenau. For the fifty years that followed his death his theories and system were, as he expected they would be, attacked from all sides. Yet to-day his work is more firmly established than ever as the necessary basis of all strategical thought, and above all in the \"blood and iron\" school of Germany.\n\nThe process by which he reached his famous theory can be followed in his classical work On War and the Notes regarding it which he left behind him. In accordance with the philosophic fashion of his time he began by trying to formulate an abstract idea of war. The definition he started with was that \"War is an act of violence to compel our opponent to do our will.\" But that act of violence was not merely \"the shock of armies,\" as Montecuccoli had defined it a century and a half before. If the abstract idea of war be followed to its logical conclusion, the act of violence must be performed with the whole of the means at our disposal and with the utmost exertion of our will. Consequently we get the conception of two armed nations flinging themselves one upon the other, and continuing the struggle with the utmost strength and energy they can command till one or other is no longer capable of resistance. This Clausewitz called \"Absolute War.\" But his practical experience and ripe study of history told him at once that \"Real War\" was something radically different. It is true, as he said, that Napoleon's methods had approximated to the absolute and had given some colour to the use of the absolute idea as a working theory. \"But shall we,\" he acutely asks, \"rest satisfied with this idea and judge all wars by it however much they may differ from it—shall we deduce from it all the requirements of theory? We must decide the point, for we can say nothing trustworthy about a war plan until we have made up our minds whether war should only be of this kind or whether it may be of another kind.\" He saw at once that a theory formed upon the abstract or absolute idea of war would not cover the ground, and therefore failed to give what was required for practical purposes. It would exclude almost the whole of war from Alexander's time to Napoleon's. And what guarantee was there that the next war would confirm to the Napoleonic type and accommodate itself to the abstract theory? \"This theory,\" he says, \"is still quite powerless against the force of circumstances.\" And so it proved, for the wars of the middle nineteenth century did in fact revert to the pre-Napoleonic type. In short, Clausewitz's difficulty in adopting his abstract theory as a working rule was that his practical mind could not forget that war had not begun with the Revolutionary era, nor was it likely to end with it. If that era had changed the conduct of war, it must be presumed that war would change again with other times and other conditions. A theory of war which did not allow for this and did not cover all that had gone before was no theory at all. If a theory of war was to be of any use as a practical guide it must cover and explain not only the extreme manifestation of hostility which he himself had witnessed, but every manifestation that had occurred in the past or was likely to recur in the future. It was in casting about for the underlying causes of the oscillations manifested in the energy and intensity of hostile relations that he found his solution. His experience on the Staff, and his study of the inner springs of war, told him it was never in fact a question of purely military endeavour aiming always at the extreme of what was possible or expedient from a purely military point of view. The energy exhibited would always be modified by political considerations and by the depth of the national interest in the object of the war. He saw that real war was in fact an international relation which differed from other international relations only in the method we adopted to achieve the object of our policy. So it was he arrived at his famous theory—\"that war is a mere continuation of policy by other means.\"",

    "text": "At first sight there seems little enough in it. It may seem perhaps that we have been watching a mountain in labour and nothing but a mouse has been produced. But it is only upon some such simple, even obvious, formula that any scientific system can be constructed with safety. We have only to develop the meaning of this one to see how important and practical are the guiding lines which flow from it. With the conception of war as a continuation of political intercourse before us, it is clear that everything which lies outside the political conception, everything, that is, which is strictly peculiar to military and naval operations, relates merely to the means which we use to achieve our policy. Consequently, the first desideratum of a war plan is that the means adopted must conflict as little as possible with the political conditions from which the war springs. In practice, of course, as in all human relations, there will be a compromise between the means and the end, between the political and the military exigencies. But Clausewitz held that policy must always be the master. The officer charged with the conduct of the war may of course demand that the tendencies and views of policy shall not be incompatible with the military means which are placed at his disposal; but however strongly this demand may react on policy in particular cases, military action must still be regarded only as a manifestation of policy. It must never supersede policy. The policy is always the object; war is only the means by which we obtain the object, and the means must always keep the end in view. The practical importance of this conception will now become clear. It will be seen to afford the logical or theoretical exposition of what we began by stating in its purely concrete form. When a Chief of Staff is asked for a war plan he must not say we will make war in such and such a way because it was Napoleon's or Moltke's way. He will ask what is the political object of the war, what are the political conditions, and how much does the question at issue mean respectively to us and to our adversary. It is these considerations which determine the nature of the war. This primordial question settled, he will be in a position to say whether the war is of the same nature as those in which Napoleon's and Moltke's methods were successful, or whether it is of another nature in which those methods failed. He will then design and offer a war plan, not because it has the hall-mark of this or that great master of war, but because it is one that has been proved to fit the kind of war in hand. To assume that one method of conducting war will suit all kinds of war is to fall a victim to abstract theory, and not to be a prophet of reality, as the narrowest disciples of the Napoleonic school are inclined to see themselves. Hence, says Clausewitz, the first, the greatest and most critical decision upon which the Statesman and the General have to exercise their judgment is to determine the nature of the war, to be sure they do not mistake it for something nor seek to make of it something which from its inherent conditions it can never be. \"This,\" he declares, \"is the first and the most far-reaching of all strategical questions.\"\nThe first value, then, of his theory of war is that it gives a clear line on which we may proceed to determine the nature of a war in which we are about to engage, and to ensure that we do not try to apply to one nature of war any particular course of operations simply because they have proved successful in another nature of war. It is only, he insists, by regarding war not as an independent thing but as a political instrument that we can read aright the lessons of history and understand for our practical guidance how wars must differ in character according to the nature of the motives and circumstances from which they proceed. This conception, he claims, is the first ray of light to guide us to a true theory of war and thereby enable us to classify wars and distinguish them one from another. Jomini, his great contemporary and rival, though proceeding by a less philosophical but no less lucid method, entirely endorses this view. A Swiss soldier of fortune, his experience was much the same as that of Clausewitz. It was obtained mainly on the Staff of Marshal Ney and subsequently on the Russian headquarter Staff. He reached no definite theory of war, but his fundamental conclusions were the same. The first chapter of his final work, Précis de l'art de la Guerre, is devoted to \"La Politique de la Guerre.\" In it he classifies wars into nine categories according to their political object, and he lays it down as a base proposition \"That these different kinds of war will have more or less influence on the nature of the operations which will be demanded to attain the end in view, on the amount of energy that must be put forth, and on the extent of the undertakings in which we must engage.\" \"There will,\" he adds, \"be a great difference in the operations according to the risks we have to run.\" Both men, therefore, though on details of means they were often widely opposed, are agreed that the fundamental conception of war is political. Both of course agree that if we isolate in our mind the forces engaged in any theatre of war the abstract conception reappears. So far as those forces are concerned, war is a question of fighting in which each belligerent should endeavour by all means at his command and with all his energy to destroy the other. But even so they may find that certain means are barred to them for political reasons, and at any moment the fortune of war or a development of the political conditions with which it is entangled may throw them back upon the fundamental political theory. That theory it will be unprofitable to labour further at this point. Let it suffice for the present to mark that it gives us a conception of war",

    "text": "Having determined that wars must vary in character according to the nature and importance of their object, we are faced with the difficulty that the variations will be of infinite number and of all degrees of distinction. So complex indeed is the graduation presented that at first sight it appears scarcely possible to make it the basis of practical study. But on further examination it will be seen that by applying the usual analytical method the whole subject is susceptible of much simplification. We must in short attempt to reach some system of classification; that is, we must see if it is not possible to group the variations into some well-founded categories. With a subject so complex and intangible the grouping must of course be to some extent arbitrary, and in some places the lines of demarcation will be shadowy; but if classification has been found possible and helpful in Zoology or Botany, with the infinite and minute individual variations with which they have to deal, it should be no less possible and helpful in the study of war.\n\nThe political theory of war will at any rate give us two broad and well-marked classifications. The first is simple and well known, depending on whether the political object of the war is positive or negative. If it be positive—that is, if our aim is to wrest something from the enemy—then our war in its main lines will be offensive. If, on the other hand, our aim be negative, and we simply seek to prevent the enemy wresting some advantage to our detriment, then the war in its general direction will be defensive.\n\nIt is only as a broad conception that this classification has value. Though it fixes the general trend of our operations, it will not in itself affect their character. For a maritime Power at least it is obvious that this must be so. For in any circumstances it is impossible for such a Power either to establish its defence or develop fully its offence without securing a working control of the sea by aggressive action against the enemy's fleets. Furthermore, we have always found that however strictly our aim may be defensive, the most effective means of securing it has been by counter-attack over-sea, either to support an ally directly or to deprive our enemy of his colonial possessions. Neither category, then, excludes the use of offensive operations nor the idea of overthrowing our enemy so far as is necessary to gain our end. In neither case does the conception lead us eventually to any other objective than the enemy's armed forces, and particularly his naval forces. The only real difference is this—that if our object be positive our general plan must be offensive, and we should at least open with a true offensive movement; whereas if our object be negative our general plan will be preventive, and we may bide our time for our counter-attack. To this extent our action must always tend to the offensive. For counter-attack is the soul of defence. Defence is not a passive attitude, for that is the negation of war. Rightly conceived, it is an attitude of alert expectation. We wait for the moment when the enemy shall expose himself to a counter-stroke, the success of which will so far cripple him as to render us relatively strong enough to pass to the offensive ourselves.",

    "text": "From these considerations it will appear that, real and logical as the classification is, to give it the designation \"offensive and defensive\" is objectionable from every point of view. To begin with, it does not emphasise what the real and logical distinction is. It suggests that the basis of the classification is not so much a difference of object as a difference in the means employed to achieve the object. Consequently we find ourselves continually struggling with the false assumption that positive war means using attack, and negative war being content with defence. That is confusing enough, but a second objection to the designation is far more serious and more fertile of error. For the classification \"offensive and defensive\" implies that offensive and defensive are mutually exclusive ideas, whereas the truth is, and it is a fundamental truth of war, that they are mutually complementary. All war and every form of it must be both offensive and defensive. No matter how clear our positive aim nor how high our offensive spirit, we cannot develop an aggressive line of strategy to the full without the support of the defensive on all but the main lines of operation. In tactics it is the same. The most convinced devotee of attack admits the spade as well as the rifle. And even when it comes to men and material, we know that without a certain amount of protection neither ships, guns, nor men can develop their utmost energy and endurance in striking power.\n\nThere is never, in fact, a clean choice between attack and defence. In aggressive operations the question always is, how far must defence enter into the methods we employ in order to enable us to do the utmost within our resources to break or paralyse the strength of the enemy. So also with defence. Even in its most legitimate use, it must always be supplemented by attack. Even behind the walls of a fortress men know that sooner or later the place must fall unless by counter-attack on the enemy's siege works or communications they can cripple his power of attack.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that it were better to lay aside the designation \"offensive and defensive\" altogether and substitute the terms \"positive and negative.\" But here again we are confronted with a difficulty. There have been many wars in which positive methods have been used all through to secure a negative end, and such wars will not sit easily in either class. For instance, in the War of Spanish Succession our object was mainly to prevent the Mediterranean becoming a French lake by the union of the French and Spanish crowns, but the method by which we succeeded in achieving our end was to seize the naval positions of Gibraltar and Minorca, and so in practice our method was positive. Again, in the late Russo-Japanese War the main object of Japan was to prevent Korea being absorbed by Russia. That aim was preventive and negative. But the only effective way of securing her aim was to take Korea herself, and so for her the war was in practice positive.",

    "text": "On the other hand, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in the majority of wars the side with the positive object has acted generally on the offensive and the other generally on the defensive. Unpractical therefore as the distinction seems to be, it is impossible to dismiss it without inquiring why this was so, and it is in this inquiry that the practical results of the classification will be found to lie—that is, it forces us to analyse the comparative advantages of offence and defence. A clear apprehension of their relative possibilities is the corner stone of strategical study.\n\nNow the advantages of the offensive are patent and admitted. It is only the offensive that can produce positive results, while the strength and energy which are born of the moral stimulation of attack are of a practical value that outweighs almost every other consideration. Every man of spirit would desire to use the offensive whether his object were positive or negative, and yet there are a number of cases in which some of the most energetic masters of war have chosen the defensive, and chosen with success. They have chosen it when they have found themselves inferior in physical force to their enemy, and when they believed that no amount of aggressive spirit could redress that inferiority. Obviously, then, for all the inferiority of the defensive as a drastic form of war it must have some inherent advantage which the offensive does not enjoy. In war we adopt every method for which we have sufficient strength. If, then, we adopt the less desirable method of defence, it must be either that we have not sufficient strength for offence, or that the defence gives us some special strength for the attainment of our object. What, then, are these elements of strength? It is very necessary to inquire, not only that we may know that if for a time we are forced back upon the defensive all is not lost, but also that we may judge with how much daring we should push our offensive to prevent the enemy securing the advantages of defence.",

    "text": "As a general principle we all know that possession is nine points of the law. It is easier to keep money in our pocket than to take it from another man's. If one man would rob another he must be the stronger or better armed unless he can do it by dexterity or stealth, and there lies one of the advantages of offence. The side which takes the initiative has usually the better chance of securing advantage by dexterity or stealth. But it is not always so. If either by land or sea we can take a defensive position so good that it cannot be turned and must be broken down before our enemy can reach his objective, then the advantage of dexterity and stealth passes to us. We choose our own ground for the trial of strength. We are hidden on familiar ground; he is exposed on ground that is less familiar. We can lay traps and prepare surprises by counter-attack, when he is most dangerously exposed. Hence the paradoxical doctrine that where defence is sound and well designed the advantage of surprise is against the attack. It will be seen therefore that whatever advantages lie in defence they depend on the preservation of the offensive spirit. Its essence is the counter-attack—waiting deliberately for a chance to strike—not cowering in inactivity. Defence is a condition of restrained activity—not a mere condition of rest. Its real weakness is that if unduly prolonged it tends to deaden the spirit of offence. This is a truth so vital that some authorities in their eagerness to enforce it have travestied it into the misleading maxim, \"That attack is the best defence.\" Hence again an amateurish notion that defence is always stupid or pusillanimous, leading always to defeat, and that what is called \"the military spirit\" means nothing but taking the offensive. Nothing is further from the teaching or the practice of the best masters. Like Wellington at Torres Vedras, they all at times used the defensive till the elements of strength inherent in that form of war, as opposed to the exhausting strain inherent in the form that they had fixed upon their opponents, lifted them to a position where they in their turn were relatively strong enough to use the more exhausting form.",

    "text": "The confusion of thought which has led to the misconceptions about defence as a method of war is due to several obvious causes. Counter-attacks from a general defensive attitude have been regarded as a true offensive, as, for instance, in Frederick the Great's best-known operations, or in Admiral Tegetthoff's brilliant counterstroke at Lissa, or our own operations against the Spanish Armada. Again, the defensive has acquired an ill name by its being confused with a wrongly arrested offensive, where the superior Power with the positive object lacked the spirit to use his material superiority with sufficient activity and perseverance. Against such a Power an inferior enemy can always redress his inferiority by passing to a bold and quick offensive, thus acquiring a momentum both moral and physical which more than compensates his lack of weight. The defensive has also failed by the choice of a bad position which the enemy was able to turn or avoid. A defensive attitude is nothing at all, its elements of strength entirely disappear, unless it is such that the enemy must break it down by force before he can reach his ultimate objective. Even more often has it failed when the belligerent adopting it, finding he has no available defensive position which will bar the enemy's progress, attempts to guard every possible line of attack. The result is of course that by attenuating his force he only accentuates his inferiority. Clear and well proven as these considerations are for land warfare, their application to the sea is not so obvious. It will be objected that at sea there is no defensive. This is generally true for tactics, but even so not universally true. Defensive tactical positions are possible at sea, as in defended anchorages. These were always a reality, and the mine has increased their possibilities. In the latest developments of naval warfare we have seen the Japanese at the Elliot Islands preparing a real defensive position to cover the landing of their Second Army in the Liaotung Peninsula. Strategically the proposition is not true at all. A strategical defensive has been quite as common at sea as on land, and our own gravest problems have often been how to break down such an attitude when our enemy assumed it. It usually meant that the enemy remained in his own waters and near his own bases, where it was almost impossible for us to attack him with decisive result, and whence he always threatened us with counterattack at moments of exhaustion, as the Dutch did at Sole Bay and in the Medway. The difficulty of dealing decisively with an enemy who adopted this course was realised by our service very early, and from first to last one of our chief preoccupations was to prevent the enemy availing himself of this device and to force him to fight in the open, or at least to get between him and his base and force an action there.",

To submit to blockade in order to engage the attention of a superior enemy's fleet is another form of defensive, but one that is almost wholly evil. For a short time it may do good by permitting offensive operations elsewhere which otherwise would be impossible. But if prolonged, it will sooner or later destroy the spirit of your force and render it incapable of effective aggression.\n\nThe conclusion then is that although for the practical purpose of framing or appreciating plans of war the classification of wars into offensive and defensive is of little use, a clear apprehension of the inherent relative advantages of offence and defence is essential. We must realise that in certain cases, provided always we preserve the aggressive spirit, the defensive will enable an inferior force to achieve points when the offensive would probably lead to its destruction. But the elements of strength depend entirely on the will and insight to deal rapid blows in the enemy's unguarded moments. So soon as the defensive ceases to be regarded as a means of fostering power to strike and of reducing the enemy's power of attack it loses all its strength. It ceases to be even a suspended activity, and anything that is not activity is not war.\n\nWith these general indications of the relative advantages of offence and defence we may leave the subject for the present. It is possible of course to catalogue the advantages and disadvantages of each form, but any such bald statement—without concrete examples to explain the meaning—must always appear controversial and is apt to mislead. It is better to reserve their fuller consideration till we come to deal with strategical operations and are able to note their actual effect upon the conduct of war in its various forms. Leaving therefore our first classification of wars into offensive and defensive we will pass on to the second, which is the only one of real practical importance.",

    "text": "The second classification to which we are led by the political theory of war, is one which Clausewitz was the first to formulate and one to which he came to attach the highest importance. It becomes necessary therefore to examine his views in some detail—not because there is any need to regard a continental soldier, however distinguished, as an indispensable authority for a maritime nation. The reason is quite the reverse. It is because a careful examination of his doctrine on this point will lay open what are the radical and essential differences between the German or Continental School of Strategy and the British or Maritime School—that is, our own traditional School, which too many writers both at home and abroad quietly assume to have no existence. The evil tendency of that assumption cannot be too strongly emphasised, and the main purpose of this and the following chapters will be to show how and why even the greatest of the continental strategists fell short of realising fully the characteristic conception of the British tradition.\n\nBy the classification in question Clausewitz distinguished wars into those with a \"Limited\" object and those whose object was \"Unlimited.\" Such a classification was entirely characteristic of him, for it rested not alone upon the material nature of the object, but on certain moral considerations to which he was the first to attach their real value in war. Other writers such as Jomini had attempted to classify wars by the special purpose for which they were fought, but Clausewitz's long course of study convinced him that such a distinction was unphilosophical and bore no just relation to any tenable theory of war. Whether, that is, a war was positive or negative mattered much, but its special purpose, whether, for instance, according to Jomini's system, it was a war \"to assert rights\" or \"to assist an ally\" or \"to acquire territory,\" mattered not at all. Whatever the object, the vital and paramount question was the intensity with which the spirit of the nation was absorbed in its attainment. The real point to determine in approaching any war plan was what did the object mean to the two belligerents, what sacrifices would they make for it, what risks were they prepared to run?\n\nIt was thus he stated his view. \"The smaller the sacrifice we demand from our opponent, the smaller presumably will be the means of resistance he will employ, and the smaller his means, the smaller will ours be required to be. Similarly the smaller our political object, the less value shall we set upon it and the more easily we shall be induced to abandon it.\" Thus the political object of the war, its original motive, will not only determine for both belligerents reciprocally the aim of the force they use, but it will also be the standard of the intensity of the efforts they will make. So he concludes there may be wars of all degrees of importance and energy from a war of extermination down to the use of an army of observation. So also in the naval sphere there may be a life and death struggle for maritime supremacy or hostilities which never rise beyond a blockade.",

    "text": "Such a view of the subject was of course a wide departure from the theory of \"Absolute War\" on which Clausewitz had started working. Under that theory \"Absolute War\" was the ideal form to which all war ought to attain, and those which fell short of it were imperfect wars cramped by a lack of true military spirit. But so soon as he had seized the fact that in actual life the moral factor always must override the purely military factor, he saw that he had been working on too narrow a basis—a basis that was purely theoretical in that it ignored the human factor. He began to perceive that it was logically unsound to assume as the foundation of a strategical system that there was one pattern to which all wars ought to conform. In the light of his full and final apprehension of the value of the human factor he saw wars falling into two well-marked categories, each of which would legitimately be approached in a radically different manner, and not necessarily on the lines of \"Absolute War.\" He saw that there was one class of war where the political object was of so vital an importance to both belligerents that they would tend to fight to the utmost limit of their endurance to secure it. But there was another class where the object was of less importance, that is to say, where its value to one or both the belligerents was not so great as to be worth unlimited sacrifices of blood and treasure. It was these two kinds of war he designated provisionally \"Unlimited\" and \"Limited,\" by which he meant not that you were not to exert the force employed with all the vigour you could develop, but that there might be a limit beyond which it would be bad policy to spend that vigour, a point at which, long before your force was exhausted or even fully developed, it would be wiser to abandon your object rather than to spend more upon it.\n\nThis distinction it is very necessary to grasp quite clearly, for it is often superficially confused with the distinction already referred to, which Clausewitz drew in the earlier part of his work—that is, the distinction between what he called the character of modern war and the character of the wars which preceded the Napoleonic era. It will be remembered he insisted that the wars of his own time had been wars between armed nations with a tendency to throw the whole weight of the nation into the fighting line, whereas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries wars were waged by standing armies and not by the whole nation in arms. The distinction of course is real and of far-reaching consequences, but it has no relation to the distinction between \"Limited\" and \"Unlimited\" war. War may be waged on the Napoleonic system either for a limited or an unlimited object. A modern instance will serve to clear the field. The recent Russo-Japanese War was fought for a limited object— the assertion of certain claims over territory which formed no part of the possessions of either belligerent. Hostilities were conducted on entirely modern lines by two armed nations and not by standing armies alone. But in the case of one belligerent her interest in the object was so limited as to cause her to abandon it long before her whole force as an armed nation was exhausted or even put forth. The expense of life and treasure which the struggle was involving was beyond what the object was worth.",

    "text": "This second distinction—that is, between Limited and Unlimited wars—Clausewitz regarded as of greater importance than his previous one founded on the negative or positive nature of the object. He was long in reaching it. His great work On War as he left it proceeds almost entirely on the conception of offensive or defensive as applied to the Napoleonic ideal of absolute war. The new idea came to him towards the end in the full maturity of his prolonged study, and it came to him in endeavouring to apply his strategical speculations to the practical process of framing a war plan in anticipation of a threatened breach with France. It was only in his final section On War Plans that he began to deal with it. By that time he had grasped the first practical result to which his theory led. He saw that the distinction between Limited and Unlimited war connoted a cardinal distinction in the methods of waging it. When the object was unlimited, and would consequently call forth your enemy's whole war power, it was evident that no firm decision of the struggle could be reached till his war power was entirely crushed. Unless you had a reasonable hope of being able to do this it was bad policy to seek your end by force—that is, you ought not to go to war. In the case of a limited object, however, the complete destruction of the enemy's armed force was beyond what was necessary. Clearly you could achieve your end if you could seize the object, and by availing yourself of the elements of strength inherent in the defensive could set up such a situation that it would cost the enemy more to turn you out than the object was worth to him. Here then was a wide difference in the fundamental postulate of your war plan. In the case of an unlimited war your main strategical offensive must be directed against the armed forces of the enemy; in the case of a limited war, even where its object was positive, it need not be. If conditions were favourable, it would suffice to make the object itself the objective of your main strategical offensive. Clearly, then, he had reached a theoretical distinction which modified his whole conception of strategy. No longer is there logically but one kind of war, the Absolute, and no longer is there but one legitimate objective, the enemy's armed forces. Being sound theory, it of course had an immediate practical value, for obviously it was a distinction from which the actual work of framing a war plan must take its departure. A curious corroboration of the soundness of these views is that Jomini reached an almost identical standpoint independently and by an entirely different road. His method was severely concrete, based on the comparison of observed facts, but it brought him as surely as the abstract method of his rival to the conclusion that there were two distinct classes of object. “They are of two different kinds,” he says, “one which may be called territorial or geographical … the other on the contrary consists exclusively in the destruction or disorganisation of the enemy’s forces without concerning yourself with geographical points of any kind.” It is under the first category of his first main classification “Of offensive wars to assert rights,” that he deals with what Clausewitz would call “Limited Wars.” Citing as an example Frederick the Great’s war for the conquest of Silesia, he says, “In such a war … the offensive operations ought to be proportional to the end in view. The first move is naturally to occupy the provinces claimed” (not, be it noted, to direct your blow at the enemy’s main force). “Afterwards,” he proceeds, “you can push the offensive according to circumstances and your relative strength in order to obtain the desired cession by menacing the enemy at home.” Here we have Clausewitz’s whole doctrine of “Limited War”; firstly, the primary or territorial stage, in which you endeavour to occupy the geographical object, and then the secondary or coercive stage, in which you seek by exerting general pressure upon your enemy to force him to accept the adverse situation you have set up. Such a method of making war obviously differs in a fundamental manner from that which Napoleon habitually adopted, and yet we have it presented by Jomini and Clausewitz, the two apostles of the Napoleonic method. The explanation is, of course, that both of them had seen too much not to know that Napoleon’s method was only applicable when you could command a real physical or moral preponderance. Given such a preponderance, both were staunch for the use of extreme means in Napoleon’s manner. It is not as something better than the higher road that they commend the lower one, but being veteran staff-officers and not mere theorists, they knew well that a belligerent must sometimes find the higher road beyond his strength, or beyond the effort which the spirit of the nation is prepared to make for the end in view, and like the practical men they were, they set themselves to study the potentialities of the lower road should hard necessity force them to travel it. They found that these potentialities in certain circumstances were great. As an example of a case where the lower form was more appropriate Jomini cites Napoleon’s campaign against Russia in 1812. In his opinion it would have been better if Napoleon had been satisfied to begin on the lower method with a limited territorial object, and he attributes his failure to the abuse of a method which, however well suited to his wars in Germany, was incapable of achieving success in the conditions presented by a war with Russia. Seeing how high was Napoleon’s opinion of Jomini as a master of the science of war, it is curious how his views on the two natures of wars have been ignored in the present day. It is even more curious in the case of Clausewitz, since we know that in the plenitude of his powers he came to regard this classification as the master-key of the subject. The explanation is that the distinction is not very clearly formulated in his first seven books, which alone he left in anything like a finished condition. It was not till he came to write his eighth book On War Plans that he saw the vital importance of the distinction round which he had been hovering. In that book the distinction is clearly laid down, but the book unhappily was never completed.",

    "text": "With his manuscript, however, he left a \"Note\" warning us against regarding his earlier books as a full presentation of his developed ideas. From the note it is also evident that he thought the classification on which he had lighted was of the utmost importance, that he believed it would clear up all the difficulties which he had encountered in his earlier books—difficulties which he had come to see arose from a too exclusive consideration of the Napoleonic method of conducting war. \"I look upon the first six books,\" he wrote in 1827, \"as only a mass of material which is still in a manner without form and which has still to be revised again. In this revision the two kinds of wars will be kept more distinctly in view all through, and thereby all ideas will gain in clearness, in precision, and in exactness of application.\" Evidently he had grown dissatisfied with the theory of Absolute War on which he had started. His new discovery had convinced him that that theory would not serve as a standard for all natures of wars. \"Shall we,\" he asks in his final book, \"shall we now rest satisfied with this idea and by it judge of all wars, however much they may differ?\" He answers his question in the negative. \"You cannot determine the requirements of all wars from the Napoleonic type. Keep that type and its absolute method before you to use when you can or when you must, but keep equally before you that there are two main natures of war.\" In his note written at this time, when the distinction first came to him, he defines these two natures of war as follows: \"First, those in which the object is the overthrow of the enemy, whether it be we aim at his political destruction or merely at disarming him and forcing him to conclude peace on our terms; and secondly, those in which our object is merely to make some conquests on the frontiers of his country, either for the purpose of retaining them permanently or of turning them to account as a matter of exchange in settling terms of peace.\" It was in his eighth book that he intended, had he lived, to have worked out the comprehensive idea he had conceived. Of that book he says, \"The chief object will be to make good the two points of view above mentioned, by which everything will be simplified and at the same time be given the breath of life. I hope in this book to iron out many creases in the heads of strategists and statesmen, and at least to show the object of action and the real point to be considered in war.\" That hope was never realised, and that perhaps is why his penetrating analysis has been so much ignored. The eighth book as we have it is only a fragment. In the spring of 1830—an anxious moment, when it seemed that Prussia would require all her best for another struggle single-handed with France—he was called away to an active command. What he left of the book on \"War Plans\" he describes as \"merely a track roughly cleared, as it were, through the mass, in order to ascertain the points of greatest moment.\" It was his intention, he says, to \"carry the spirit of these ideas into his first six books\"—to put the crown on his work, in fact, by elaborating and insisting upon his two great propositions, viz. that war was a form of policy, and that being so it might be Limited or Unlimited. The extent to which he would have infused his new idea into the whole every one is at liberty to judge for himself; but this indisputable fact remains. In the winter in view of the threatening attitude of France in regard to Belgium he drew up a war plan, and it was designed not on the Napoleonic method of making the enemy's armed force the main strategical objective, but on seizing a limited territorial object and forcing a disadvantageous counter-offensive upon the French. The revolutionary movement throughout Europe had broken the Holy Alliance to pieces. Not only did Prussia find herself almost single-handed against France, but she herself was sapped by revolution. To adopt the higher form of war and seek to destroy the armed force of the enemy was beyond her power. But she could still use the lower form, and by seizing Belgium she could herself force so exhausting a task on France that success was well within her strength. It was exactly so we endeavoured to begin the Seven Years' War; and it was exactly so the Japanese successfully conducted their war with Russia; and what is more striking, it was on similar lines that in 1859 Moltke in similar circumstances drew up his first war plan against France. His idea at that time was on the lines which Jomini held should have been Napoleon's in 1812. It was not to strike directly at Paris or the French main army, but to occupy Alsace-Lorraine and hold that territory till altered conditions should give him the necessary preponderance for proceeding to the higher form or forcing a favourable peace.",

    "text": "In conclusion, then, we have to note that the matured fruit of the Napoleonic period was a theory of war based not on the single absolute idea, but on the dual distinction of Limited and Unlimited. Whatever practical importance we may attach to the distinction, so much must be admitted on the clear and emphatic pronouncements of Clausewitz and Jomini. The practical importance is another matter. It may fairly be argued that in continental warfare—in spite of the instances quoted by both the classical writers—it is not very great, for reasons that will appear directly. But it must be remembered that continental warfare is not the only form in which great international issues are decided. Standing at the final point which Clausewitz and Jomini reached, we are indeed only on the threshold of the subject. We have to begin where they left off and inquire what their ideas have to tell for the modern conditions of worldwide imperial States, where the sea becomes a direct and vital factor. CHAPTER FOUR LIMITED WAR AND MARITIME EMPIRES— Development of Clausewitz's and Jomini's Theory of a Limited Territorial Object, and Its Application to Modern Imperial Conditions The German war plans already cited, which were based respectively on the occupation of Belgium and Alsace-Lorraine, and Jomini's remarks on Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign serve well to show the point to which continental strategists have advanced along the road which Clausewitz was the first to indicate clearly. We have now to consider its application to modern imperial conditions, and above all where the maritime element forcibly asserts itself. We shall then see how small that advance has been compared with its far-reaching effects for a maritime and above all an insular Power. It is clear that Clausewitz himself never apprehended the full significance of his brilliant theory. His outlook was still purely continental, and the limitations of continental warfare tend to veil the fuller meaning of the principle he had framed. Had he lived, there is little doubt he would have worked it out to its logical conclusion, but his death condemned his theory of limited war to remain in the inchoate condition in which he had left it. It will be observed, as was natural enough, that all through his work Clausewitz had in his mind war between two contiguous or at least adjacent continental States, and a moment's consideration will show that in that type of war the principle of the limited object can rarely if ever assert itself in perfect precision. Clausewitz himself put it quite clearly. Assuming a case where \"the overthrow of the enemy\"—that is, unlimited war—is beyond our strength, he points out that we need not therefore necessarily act on the defensive. Our action may still be positive and offensive, but the object can be nothing more than \"the conquest of part of the enemy's country.\" Such a conquest he knew might so far weaken your enemy or strengthen your own position as to enable you to secure a satisfactory peace. The path of history is indeed strewn with such cases. But he was careful to point out that such a form of war was open to the gravest objections. Once you had occupied the territory you aimed at, your offensive action was, as a rule, arrested. A defensive attitude had to be assumed, and such an arrest of offensive action he had previously shown was inherently vicious, if only for moral reasons. Added to this you might find that in your effort to occupy the territorial object you had so irretrievably separated your striking force from your home-defence force as to be in no position to meet your enemy if he was able to retort by acting on unlimited lines with a stroke at your heart. A case in point was the Austerlitz campaign, where Austria's object was to wrest North Italy from Napoleon's empire. She sent her main army under the Archduke Charles to seize the territory she desired. Napoleon immediately struck at Vienna, destroyed her home army, and occupied the capital before the Archduke could turn to bar his way. The argument is this: that, as all strategic attack tends to leave points of your own uncovered, it always involves greater or less provision for their defence. It is obvious, therefore, that if we are aiming at a limited territorial object the proportion of defence required will tend to be much greater than if we are directing our attack on the main forces of the enemy. In unlimited war our attack will itself tend to defend everything elsewhere, by forcing the enemy to concentrate against our attack.",

    "section": "Chapter Four: Limited War",
    "text": "Therefore, we must leave the continental theatres and turn to mixed or maritime wars. We have to look to such cases as Canada and Havana in the Seven Years' War, and Cuba in the Spanish-American War, cases in which complete isolation of the object by naval action was possible, or to such examples as the Crimea and Korea, where sufficient isolation was attainable by naval action owing to the length and difficulty of the enemy's land communications and to the strategical situation of the territory at stake. These examples will also serve to illustrate and enforce the second essential of this kind of war. As has been already said, for a true limited object we must have not only the power of isolation, but also the power by a secure home defence of barring an unlimited counterstroke. In all the above cases this condition existed. In all of them the belligerents had no contiguous frontiers, and this point is vital. For it is obvious that if two belligerents have a common frontier, it is open to the superior of them, no matter how distant or how easy to isolate the limited object may be, to pass at will to unlimited war by invasion. This process is even possible when the belligerents are separated by a neutral State, since the territory of a weak neutral will be violated if the object be of sufficient importance, or if the neutral be too strong to coerce, there still remains the possibility that his alliance may be secured. We come, then, to this final proposition—that limited war is only permanently possible to island Powers or between Powers which are separated by sea, and then only when the Power desiring limited war is able to command the sea to such a degree as to be able not only to isolate the distant object, but also to render impossible the invasion of his home territory. Here, then, we reach the true meaning and highest military value of what we call the command of the sea, and here we touch the secret of England's success against Powers so greatly superior to herself in military strength. It is only fitting that such a secret should have been first penetrated by an Englishman. For so it was, though it must be said that except in the light of Clausewitz's doctrine the full meaning of Bacon's famous aphorism is not revealed. \"This much is certain,\" said the great Elizabethan on the experience of our first imperial war; \"he that commands the sea is at great liberty and may take as much or as little of the war as he will, whereas those that be strongest by land are many times nevertheless in great straits.\" It would be difficult to state more pithily the ultimate significance of Clausewitz's doctrine. Its cardinal truth is clearly indicated—that limited wars do not turn upon the armed strength of the belligerents, but upon the amount of that strength which they are able or willing to bring to bear at the decisive point. It is much to be regretted that Clausewitz did not live to see with Bacon's eyes and to work out the full comprehensiveness of his doctrine. His ambition was to formulate a theory which would explain all wars. He believed he had done so, and yet it is clear he never knew how complete was his success, nor how wide was the field he had covered. To the end it would seem he was unaware that he had found an explanation of one of the most inscrutable problems in history—the expansion of England—at least so far as it has been due to successful war. That a small country with a weak army should have been able to gather to herself the most desirable regions of the earth, and to gather them at the expense of the greatest military Powers, is a paradox to which such Powers find it hard to be reconciled. The phenomenon seemed always a matter of chance-an accident without any foundation in the essential constants of war. It remained for Clausewitz, unknown to himself, to discover that explanation, and he reveals it to us in the inherent strength of limited war when means and conditions are favourable for its use. We find, then, if we take a wider view than was open to Clausewitz and submit his latest ideas to the test of present imperial conditions, so far from failing to cover the ground they gain a fuller meaning and a firmer basis. Apply them to maritime warfare and it becomes clear that his distinction between limited and unlimited war does not rest alone on the moral factor. A war may be limited not only because the importance of the object is too limited to call forth the whole national force, but also because the sea may be made to present an insuperable physical obstacle to the whole national force being brought to bear. That is to say, a war may be limited physically by the strategical isolation of the object, as well as morally by its comparative unimportance.",

    "section": "Chapter Five: Wars of Intervention - Limited Interference in Unlimited War",
    "text": "Before leaving the general consideration of limited war, we have still to deal with a form of it that has not yet been mentioned. Clausewitz gave it provisionally the name of \"War limited by contingent,\" and could find no place for it in his system. It appeared to him to differ essentially from war limited by its political object, or as Jomini put it, war with a territorial object. Yet it had to be taken into account and explained, if only for the part it had played in European history. For us it calls for the most careful examination, not only because it baffled the great German strategist to reconcile it with his theory of war, but also because it is the form in which Great Britain most successfully demonstrated the potentiality for direct continental interference of a small army acting in conjunction with a dominant fleet. The combined operations which were the normal expression of the British method of making war on the limited basis were of two main classes. Firstly, there were those designed purely for the conquest of the objects for which we went to war, which were usually colonial or distant oversea territory; and secondly, operations more or less upon the European seaboard designed not for permanent conquest, but as a method of disturbing our enemy's plans and strengthening the hands of our allies and our own position. Such operations might take the form of insignificant coastal diversions, or they might rise through all degrees of importance till, as in Wellington's operations in the Peninsula, they became indistinguishable in form from regular continental warfare. It would seem, therefore, that these operations were distinguished not so much by the nature of the object as by the fact that we devoted to them, not the whole of our military strength, but only a certain part of it which was known as our \"disposal force.\" Consequently, they appear to call for some such special classification, and to fall naturally into the category which Clausewitz called \"War limited by contingent.\" It was a nature of war well enough known in another form on the Continent. During the eighteenth century there had been a large number of cases of war actually limited by contingent—that is, cases where a country not having a vital interest in the object made war by furnishing the chief belligerent with an auxiliary force of a stipulated strength. It was in the sixth chapter of his last book that Clausewitz intended to deal with this anomalous form of hostility. His untimely death, however, has left us with no more than a fragment, in which he confesses that such cases are \"embarrassing to his theory.\" If, he adds, the auxiliary force were placed unreservedly at the disposal of the chief belligerent, the problem would be simple enough. It would then, in effect, be the same thing as unlimited war with the aid of a subsidised force. But in fact, as he observes, this seldom happened, for the contingent was always more or less controlled in accordance with the special political aims of the Government which furnished it. Consequently, the only conclusion he succeeded in reaching was that it was a form of war that had to be taken into account, and that it was a form of limited war that appeared to differ essentially from war limited by object. We are left, in fact, with an impression that there must be two kinds of limited war. But if we pursue his historical method and examine the cases in which this nature of war was successful, and those in which it was unsuccessful, we shall find that wherever success is taken as an index of its legitimate employment, the practical distinction between the two kinds of limited war tends to disappear. The indications are that where the essential factors which justify the use of war limited by object are present in war limited by contingent, then that form of war tends to succeed, but not otherwise. We are brought, in fact, to this proposition, that the distinction \"Limited by contingent\" is not one that is inherent in war, and is quite out of line with the theory in hand—that, in reality, it is not a form of war, but a method which may be employed either for limited or unlimited war. In other words, war limited by contingent, if it is to be regarded as a legitimate form of war at all, must take frankly the one shape or the other. Either the contingent must act as an organic unit of the force making unlimited war without any reservations whatever, or else it should be given a definite territorial object, with an independent organisation and an independent limited function. Our own experience seems to indicate that war by contingent or war with \"a disposal force\" attains the highest success when it approaches most closely to true limited war—that is, as in the case of the Peninsula and the Crimea, where its object is to wrest or secure from the enemy a definite piece of territory that to a greater or less extent can be isolated by naval action. Its operative power, in fact, appears to bear some direct relation to the intimacy with which naval and military action can be combined to give the contingent a weight and mobility that are beyond its intrinsic power. If, then, we would unravel the difficulties of war limited by contingent, it seems necessary to distinguish between the continental and the British form of it. The continental form, as we have seen, differs but little in conception from unlimited war. The contingent is furnished at least ostensibly with the idea that it is to be used by the chief belligerent to assist him in overthrowing the common enemy, and that its objective will be the enemy's organised forces or his capital. Or it may be that the contingent is to be used as an army of observation to prevent a counterstroke, so as to facilitate and secure the main offensive movement of the chief belligerent. In either case, however small may be our contribution to the allied force, we are using the unlimited form and aiming at an unlimited and not a mere territorial object.",

    "text": "an unlimited war. Our object was unlimited. It was nothing less than the overthrow of Napoleon. Complete success at sea had failed to do it, but that success had given us the power of applying the limited form, which was the most decisive form of offence within our means. Its substantial contribution to the final achievement of the object is now universally recognised. The general result, then, of these considerations is that war by contingent in the continental form seldom or never differs generically from unlimited war, for the conditions required by limited war are seldom or never present. But what may be called the British or maritime form is in fact the application of the limited method to the unlimited form, as ancillary to the larger operations of our allies—a method which has usually been open to us because the control of the sea has enabled us to select a theatre in effect truly limited.5 But what if the conditions of the struggle in which we wish to intervene are such that no truly limited theatre is available? In that case we have to choose between placing a contingent frankly at the disposal of our ally, or confining ourselves to coastal diversion, as we did at Frederick the Great's request in the early campaigns of the Seven Years' War. Such operations can seldom be satisfactory to either party. The small positive results of our efforts to intervene in this way have indeed done more than anything to discredit this form of war, and to brand it as unworthy of a first-class Power. Yet the fact remains that all the great continental masters of war have feared or valued British intervention of this character even in the most unfavourable conditions. It was because they looked for its effects rather in the threat than in the performance. They did not reckon for positive results at all. So long as such intervention took an amphibious form they knew its disturbing effect upon a European situation was always out of all proportion to the intrinsic strength employed or the positive results it could give. Its operative action was that it threatened positive results unless it were strongly met. Its effect, in short, was negative. Its value lay in its power of containing force greater than its own. That is all that can be claimed for it, but it may be all that is required. It is not the most drastic method of intervention, but it has proved itself the most drastic for a Power whose forces are not adapted for the higher method. Frederick the Great was the first great soldier to recognise it, and Napoleon was the last. For years he shut his eyes to it, laughed at it, covered it with a contempt that grew ever more irritable. In 1805 he called Craig's expedition a \"pygmy combination,\" yet the preparation of another combined force for an entirely different destination caused him to see the first as an advance guard of a movement he could not ignore, and he sacrificed his fleet in an impotent effort to deal with it. It was not, however, till four years later that he was forced to place on record his recognition of the principle. Then, curiously enough, he was convinced by an expedition which we have come to regard as above all others condemnatory of amphibious operations against the Continent. The Walcheren expedition is now usually held as the leading case of fatuous war administration. Historians can find no words too bad for it. They ignore the fact that it was a step—the final and most difficult step—in our post-Trafalgar policy of using the army to perfect our command of the sea against a fleet acting stubbornly on the defensive. It began with Copenhagen in 1807. It failed at the Dardanelles because fleet and army were separated; it succeeded at Lisbon and at Cadiz by demonstration alone. Walcheren, long contemplated, had been put off till the last as the most formidable and the least pressing. Napoleon had been looking for the attempt ever since the idea was first broached in this country, but as time passed and the blow did not fall, the danger came to be more and more ignored. Finally, the moment came when he was heavily engaged in Austria and forced to call up the bulk of his strength to deal with the Archduke Charles. The risks were still great, but the British Government faced them boldly with open eyes. It was now or never. They were bent on developing their utmost military strength in the Peninsula, and so long as a potent and growing fleet remained in the North Sea it would always act as an increasing drag on such development. The prospective gain of success was in the eyes of the Government out of all proportion to the probable loss by failure. So when Napoleon least expected it they determined to act, and caught him napping. The defences of Antwerp had been left incomplete. There was no army to meet the blow—nothing but a polyglot rabble without staff or even officers. For a week at least success was in our hands. Napoleon's fleet only escaped by twenty-four hours, and yet the failure was not only complete but disastrous.",

    "text": "Still so entirely were the causes of failure accidental, and so near had it come to success, that Napoleon received a thorough shock and looked for a quick repetition of the attempt. So seriously indeed did he regard his narrow escape that he found himself driven to reconsider his whole system of home defence. Not only did he deem it necessary to spend large sums in increasing the fixed defences of Antwerp and Toulon, but his Director of Conscription was called upon to work out a scheme for providing a permanent force of no less than 300,000 men from the National Guard to defend the French coasts. \"With 30,000 men in transports at the Downs,\" the Emperor wrote, \"the English can paralyse 300,000 of my army, and that will reduce us to the rank of a second-class Power.\"6 The concentration of the British efforts in the Peninsula apparently rendered the realisation of this project unnecessary—that is, our line of operation was declared and the threat ceased. But none the less Napoleon's recognition of the principle remains on record—not in one of his speeches made for some ulterior purpose, but in a staff order to the principal officer concerned. It is generally held that modern developments in military organisation and transport will enable a great continental Power to ignore such threats. Napoleon ignored them in the past, but only to verify the truth that in war to ignore a threat is too often to create an opportunity. Such opportunities may occur late or early. As both Lord Ligonier and Wolfe laid it down for such operations, surprise is not necessarily to be looked for at the beginning. We have usually had to create or wait for our opportunity—too often because we were either not ready or not bold enough to seize the first that occurred. The cases in which such intervention has been most potent have been of two classes. Firstly, there is the intrusion into a war plan which our enemy has designed without allowing for our intervention, and to which he is irrevocably committed by his opening movements. Secondly, there is intervention to deprive the enemy of the fruits of victory. This form finds its efficacy in the principle that unlimited wars are not always decided by the destruction of armies. There usually remains the difficult work of conquering the people afterwards with an exhausted army. The intrusion of a small fresh force from the sea in such cases may suffice to turn the scale, as it did in the Peninsula, and as, in the opinion of some high authorities, it might have done in France in 1871. Such a suggestion will appear to be almost heretical as sinning against the principle which condemns a strategical reserve. We say that the whole available force should be developed for the vital period of the struggle. No one can be found to dispute it nowadays. It is too obviously true when it is a question of a conflict between organised forces, but in the absence of all proof we are entitled to doubt whether it is true for that exhausting and demoralising period which lies beyond the shock of armies. CHAPTER SIX CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH IN LIMITED WAR The elements of strength in limited war are closely analogous to those generally inherent in defence. That is to say, that as a correct use of defence will sometimes enable an inferior force to gain its end against a superior one, so are there instances in which the correct use of the limited form of war has enabled a weak military Power to attain success against a much stronger one, and these instances are too numerous to permit us to regard the results as accidental. An obvious element of strength is that where the geographical conditions are favourable we are able by the use of our navy to restrict the amount of force our army will have to deal with. We can in fact bring up our fleet to redress the adverse balance of our land force. But apart from this very practical reason there is another, which is rooted in the first principles of strategy. It is that limited war permits the use of the defensive without its usual drawbacks to a degree that is impossible in unlimited war. These drawbacks are chiefly that it tends to surrender the initiative to the enemy and that it deprives us of the moral exhilaration of the offensive. But in limited war, as we shall see, this need not be the case, and if without making these sacrifices we are able to act mainly on the defensive our position becomes exceedingly strong. The proposition really admits of no doubt. For even if we be not in whole-hearted agreement with Clausewitz's doctrine of the strength of defence, still we may at least accept Moltke's modification of it. He held that the strongest form of war—that is, the form which economically makes for the highest development of strength in a given force—is strategic offensive combined with tactical defensive. Now these are in effect the conditions which limited war should give—that is, if the theatre and method be rightly chosen. Let it be remembered that the use of this form of war presupposes that we are able by superior readiness or mobility or by being more conveniently situated to establish ourselves in the territorial object before our opponent can gather strength to prevent us. This done, we have the initiative, and the enemy being unable by hypothesis to attack us at home, must conform to our opening by endeavouring to turn us out. We are in a position to meet his attack on ground of our own choice and to avail ourselves of such opportunities of counter-attack as his distant and therefore exhausting offensive movements are likely to offer. Assuming, as in our own case we always must assume, that the territorial object is sea-girt and our enemy is not able to command the sea, such opportunities are certain to present themselves, and even if they are not used will greatly embarrass the main attack—as was abundantly shown in the Russian nervousness during their advance into the Liaotung Peninsula, due to the fear of a counter-stroke from the Gulf of Pe-chi-li. The actual situation which this method of procedure sets up is that our major strategy is offensive—that is, our main movement is positive, having for its aim the occupation of the territorial object. The minor strategy that follows should be in its general lines defensive, designed, so soon as the enemy sets about dislodging us, to develop the utmost energy of counter-attack which our force and opportunities justify. Now if we consider that by universal agreement it is no longer possible in the present conditions of land warfare to draw a line between tactics and minor strategy, we have in our favour for all practical purposes the identical position which Moltke regarded as constituting the strongest form of war. That is to say, our major strategy is offensive and our minor strategy is defensive. If, then, the limited form of war has this element of strength over and above the unlimited form, it must be correct to use it when we are not strong enough to use the more exhausting form and when the object is limited; just as much as it is correct to use the defensive when our object is negative and we are too weak for the offensive. The point is of the highest importance, for it is a direct negation of the current doctrine that in war there can be but one legitimate object, the overthrow of the enemy's means of resistance, and that the primary objective must always be his armed forces. It raises in fact the whole question as to whether it is not sometimes legitimate and even correct to aim directly at the ulterior object of the war.",

    "text": "A weaker Power can successfully wage war against a stronger one, contrary to common belief and as proven by history. While the offensive is more impactful under suitable conditions, Clausewitz emphasizes that such conditions necessitate significant physical or moral superiority, or a high-risk tolerance.  Jomini, disagreeing slightly, believed this very propensity for risk led to Napoleon's downfall.  History and theory refute the notion of a single, universally applicable approach to warfare. Even in Germany, a reassessment of Clausewitz's true teachings seems underway. Von Caemmerer highlights Clausewitz's flexibility: when conditions disfavor a full-scale offensive, seizing a small enemy territory can be a viable alternative to annihilating their forces. However, Clausewitz saw this as a temporary measure, overlooking scenarios where limited war is the most efficient and effective approach due to a continental focus.  Limited objectives often arise in maritime conflicts. Britain’s historical preference for limited war, often attributed to a lack of warlike spirit, is better understood as a strategic adaptation to its island status. This approach has been successful even when allied with continental powers pursuing unlimited objectives. The choice between limited and unlimited war hinges on several factors: whether the political objective is inherently limited, if an abstractly unlimited objective can be concretized into a limited one, and whether strategic conditions favor limited war.",

Continental powers viewed Japan's actions as reckless, failing to comprehend limited war. Only Britain, with its maritime tradition, foresaw Japan's potential. The war's objective, determining Far Eastern dominance, appeared to demand total victory.  Japan, however, lacked the overwhelming superiority Clausewitz deemed necessary for such an approach.  Japan cleverly translated the abstract goal of asserting prestige into a concrete territorial objective: preserving Korean independence against Russian encroachment. Korea's geographical location and Russia's logistical challenges allowed for its isolation via naval power. This aligned with Clausewitz’s emphasis on objectives that strengthen, rather than weaken, home defense. Japan's strategy mirrored Britain's historical approach in the Low Countries or Portugal, using naval power to isolate and secure key territories. Japan's position was even more advantageous, as the Korean occupation directly strengthened its defense. Unlike Britain's Crimean campaign, which exposed the homeland, Japan's advance into Korea reinforced its security.",

    "text": "The Russo-Japanese War unfolded in three phases, mirroring classic maritime conflicts: (1) the initial offensive to seize the territorial objective (Korea); (2) securing the conquest by isolating it via naval power (requiring the destruction of the Russian fleet and Port Arthur); and (3) pressuring the enemy to accept the new status quo (culminating in the advance to Mukden). These phases overlapped. The Korean occupation had the secondary effect of bolstering Japanese defenses, while Togo's attack on Port Arthur, initially meant to cover the Korean landing, contributed significantly to isolating Port Arthur. In the later stages, the lines between isolating the conquest and applying general pressure blurred.  Japanese strategy during this period has been criticized for potentially losing sight of the limited war concept. Their eagerness to engage the Russian army allegedly led to insufficient focus on Port Arthur, resulting in costly delays and missed opportunities. This may be attributed to continental influences on the Japanese army.  German staff histories viewed the Korean occupation and Port Arthur's isolation as mere preludes to an advance on Liao-yang, neglecting the initial objective of securing Seoul, where the first major battle was anticipated.",

    "text": "surely their second was Port Arthur, with its fleet and arsenal, which they expected to reduce with little more difficulty than they had met with ten years before against the Chinese. Such at least was the actual progression of events, and a criticism which regards operations of such magnitude and ultimate importance as mere incidents of strategic deployment is only to be explained by the domination of the Napoleonic idea of war, against the universal application of which Clausewitz so solemnly protested. It is the work of men who have a natural difficulty in conceiving a war plan that does not culminate in a Jena or a Sedan. It is a view surely which is the child of theory, bearing no relation to the actuality of the war in question and affording no explanation of its ultimate success. The truth is, that so long as the Japanese acted on the principles of limited war, as laid down by Clausewitz and Jomini and plainly deducible from our own rich experience, they progressed beyond all their expectations, but so soon as they departed from them and suffered themselves to be confused with continental theories they were surprised by unaccountable failure. The expression \"Limited war\" is no doubt not entirely happy. Yet no other has been found to condense the ideas of limited object and limited interest, which are its special characteristics. Still if the above example be kept in mind as a typical case, the meaning of the term will not be mistaken. It only remains to emphasise one important point. The fact that the doctrine of limited war traverses the current belief that our primary objective must always be the enemy's armed forces is liable to carry with it a false inference that it also rejects the corollary that war means the use of battles. Nothing is further from the conception. Whatever the form of war, there is no likelihood of our ever going back to the old fallacy of attempting to decide wars by manoeuvres. All forms alike demand the use of battles. By our fundamental theory war is always \"a continuation of political intercourse, in which fighting is substituted for writing notes.\" However great the controlling influence of the political object, it must never obscure the fact that it is by fighting we have to gain our end. It is the more necessary to insist on this point, for the idea of making a piece of territory your object is liable to be confused with the older method of conducting war, in which armies were content to manoeuvre for strategical positions, and a battle came almost to be regarded as a mark of bad generalship. With such parading limited war has nothing to do. Its conduct differs only from that of unlimited war in that instead of having to destroy our enemy's whole power of resistance, we need only overthrow so much of his active force as he is able or willing to bring to bear in order to prevent or terminate our occupation of the territorial object. The first consideration, then, in entering on such a war is to endeavour to determine what the force will amount to. It will depend, firstly, on the importance the enemy attaches to the limited object, coupled with the nature and extent of his preoccupations elsewhere, and, secondly, it will depend upon the natural difficulties of his lines of communication and the extent to which we can increase those difficulties by our conduct of the initial operations. In favourable circumstances therefore (and here lies the great value of the limited form) we are able to control the amount of force we shall have to encounter.",

    "section": "Part Two: Theory of Naval War - Chapter One: Theory of the Object—Command of the Sea",
    "text": "The object of naval warfare must always be directly or indirectly either to secure the command of the sea or to prevent the enemy from securing it. The second part of the proposition should be noted with special care in order to exclude a habit of thought, which is one of the commonest sources of error in naval speculation. That error is the very general assumption that if one belligerent loses the command of the sea it passes at once to the other belligerent. The most cursory study of naval history is enough to reveal the falseness of such an assumption. It tells us that the most common situation in naval war is that neither side has the command; that the normal position is not a commanded sea, but an uncommanded sea. The mere assertion, which no one denies, that the object of naval warfare is to get command of the sea actually connotes the proposition that the command is normally in dispute. It is this state of dispute with which naval strategy is most nearly concerned, for when the command is lost or won pure naval strategy comes to an end. This truth is so obvious that it would scarcely be worth mentioning were it not for the constant recurrence of such phrases as: \"If England were to lose command of the sea, it would be all over with her.\" The fallacy of the idea is that it ignores the power of the strategical defensive. It assumes that if in the face of some extraordinary hostile coalition or through some extraordinary mischance we found ourselves without sufficient strength to keep the command, we should therefore be too weak to prevent the enemy getting it—a negation of the whole theory of war, which at least requires further support than it ever receives. And not only is this assumption a negation of theory; it is a negation both of practical experience and of the expressed opinion of our greatest masters. We ourselves have used the defensive at sea with success, as under William the Third and in the War of American Independence, while in our long wars with France she habitually used it in such a way that sometimes for years, though we had a substantial preponderance, we could not get command, and for years were unable to carry out our war plan without serious interruption from her fleet. So far from the defensive being a negligible factor at sea, or even the mere pestilent heresy it is generally represented, it is of course inherent in all war, and, as we have seen, the paramount questions of strategy both at sea and on land turn on the relative possibilities of offensive and defensive, and upon the relative proportions in which each should enter into our plan of war. At sea the most powerful and aggressively-minded belligerent can no more avoid his alternating periods of defence, which result from inevitable arrests of offensive action, than they can be avoided on land. The defensive, then, has to be considered; but before we are in a position to do so with profit, we have to proceed with our analysis of the phrase, \"Command of the Sea,\" and ascertain exactly what it is we mean by it in war. In the first place, \"Command of the Sea\" is not identical in its strategical conditions with the conquest of territory. You cannot argue from the one to the other, as has been too commonly done. Such phrases as the \"Conquest of water territory\" and \"Making the enemy's coast our frontier\" had their use and meaning in the mouths of those who framed them, but they are really little but rhetorical expressions founded on false analogy, and false analogy is not a secure basis for a theory of war. The analogy is false for two reasons, both of which enter materially into the conduct of naval war. You cannot conquer sea because it is not susceptible of ownership, at least outside territorial waters. You cannot, as lawyers say, \"reduce it into possession,\" because you cannot exclude neutrals from it as you can from territory you conquer. In the second place, you cannot subsist your armed force upon it as you can upon enemy's territory. Clearly, then, to make deductions from an assumption that command of the sea is analogous to conquest of territory is unscientific, and certain to lead to error. The only safe method is to inquire what it is we can secure for ourselves, and what it is we can deny the enemy by command of the sea.",

    "text": "Operating against sea-borne trade through sporadic attacks lacks the efficiency of a systematic approach to strategically control an enemy's maritime communications. A more sophisticated understanding of war recognizes that tactical commercial blockade (blockading ports) can be extended and supplemented by a strategic blockade of major trade routes.  There is no moral difference between the two. Accepting tactical blockade logically necessitates accepting strategic blockade.  Except for their effects on neutrals, there is no legal difference. Why reject this humane yet drastic process at sea if permitted on land? Land warfare allows contributions, requisitions, and occupation of towns, ports, and inland communications – all essential for conquest. Similar procedures at sea cause less suffering. Refusing control of sea communications logically entails refusing it on land.  Contributions on land equate to capture at sea. Denying maritime powers effective rights while granting military powers extreme rights eliminates their ultimate argument.  Abolishing private capture at sea may be humanitarian and strengthen a commercial maritime state, but it rests on fallacies: avoiding attack by solely relying on defense and believing war consists only of fleet and army battles. It ignores that battles are merely a means to exert pressure on citizens and their collective life.  Von der Goltz emphasizes the need to force peace by making the enemy feel war's burdens, seizing harbors, commercial centers, and lines of traffic. Denying us analogous means at sea negates the purpose of naval battles. Defeating enemy fleets becomes less impactful if we can't cripple their national activities.  Our fleet would be forced into barbarous acts like bombarding towns and coastal raids.",

    "section": "The Deterrent Effect of Private Capture and the Nature of Sea Command",
    "text": "If pressure methods following successful fighting were abolished, it might lead to the cessation of war between civilized states, as war would become impotent. International quarrels might resemble medieval disputes settled by champions, leading to legal procedures. However, the world is not ready for such a revolution.  Abolishing maritime interference with private property without similar land restrictions defeats humanitarian aims.  Commerce and finance influence foreign policy, and their potential losses in maritime war encourage peaceful solutions.  Abolishing private capture removes this deterrent; they might even profit from wartime government spending. Losses would be remote unless completely defeated, and aggressive wars are waged hoping for victory.  Humanity should not discard its best weapon against war.  We assume the right of private capture persists; without it, naval warfare is inconceivable.  The primary method of using naval victory is capturing or destroying enemy property, public or private. Compared to land occupation, economic pressure at sea begins immediately, often as the first act of hostility. While invaders ashore control private property, it's a military act, not secondary economic pressure. At sea, it is.  Maritime communications, unlike military communications (supply lines), correspond to a nation's internal communication lines.  This creates a key difference: maritime communications are mostly common to both belligerents, whereas land communications are separate. This merging of strategic offense and defense at sea is unknown on land. Attacking the enemy's sea communications also defends our own.  In land warfare, the opposite is usually true.  For example, in wars with France, communications with the Mediterranean, India, and America were identical to France's for much of their distance.  The same applied to wars with the Dutch and even Spain. Securing these lines for trade defense also positioned us to attack enemy trade. These positions were also crucial for defending against invasion or colonial attacks. Whether aiming for fleet action or economic pressure, occupying vital trade routes was key. While economic pressure on land ideally follows decisive victory, at sea, it begins immediately and may be the only way to force a decision.  This is justified because it's economical to use defensive positions for attack when it doesn't compromise them, and because interfering with trade both exerts economic pressure and undermines the enemy's financial strength.  Crippling enemy finances is a direct path to victory, and denying seaborne trade achieves this against maritime states.  Even when focused on destroying enemy forces, exploiting opportunities to weaken their finances is crucial.  Therefore, occupying enemy sea communications and confiscating property are primary, not secondary, naval operations.",

If not strong enough for complete control, we might achieve general or local control.  This is important because of the maxim \"the sea is all one.\"  This maxim correctly implies local control is usually temporary, as a sufficiently strong enemy fleet can theoretically disrupt our control of any sea area. It highlights fleets' high mobility compared to armies. However, when misinterpreted as requiring complete enemy fleet destruction before any overseas movement, it becomes dangerous. This seems to have influenced America's timid strategy against Spain. They had enough naval power for local, temporary control of the Gulf of Mexico, justifying immediate troop deployments to Cuba. They could also secure communication lines. Yet, Spain's undefeated fleet caused hesitation, nearly leading to disaster. The Japanese, with a hostile fleet present, initiated overseas movements without naval strikes, content to deny the enemy effective control, not absolute control. Our history is replete with such operations, where potential gains from overseas military action justified calculated risks, even without complete command of the sea.",

    "text": "By judicious use of our favourable geographical position, and of a certain system of protection, which must be dealt with later. For the purpose, then, of framing a plan of war or campaign, it must be taken that command may exist in various states or degrees, each of which has its special possibilities and limitations. It may be general or local, and it may be permanent or temporary. General command may be permanent or temporary, but mere local command, except in very favourable geographical conditions, should scarcely ever be regarded as more than temporary, since normally it is always liable to interruption from other theatres so long as the enemy possesses an effective naval force. Finally, it has to be noted that even permanent general command can never in practice be absolute. No degree of naval superiority can ensure our communications against sporadic attack from detached cruisers, or even raiding squadrons if they be boldly led and are prepared to risk destruction. Even after Hawke's decisive victory at Quiberon had completed the overthrow of the enemy's sea forces, a British transport was captured between Cork and Portsmouth, and an Indiaman in sight of the Lizard, while Wellington's complaints in the Peninsula of the insecurity of his communications are well known.\nBy general and permanent control we do not mean that the enemy can do nothing, but that he cannot interfere with our maritime trade and oversea operations so seriously as to affect the issue of the war, and that he cannot carry on his own trade and operations except at such risk and hazard as to remove them from the field of practical strategy. In other words, it means that the enemy can no longer attack our lines of passage and communication effectively, and that he cannot use or defend his own. To complete our equipment for appreciating any situation for which operations have to be designed, it is necessary to remember that when the command is in dispute the general conditions may give a stable or an unstable equilibrium. It may be that the power of neither side preponderates to any appreciable extent. It may also be that the preponderance is with ourselves, or it may be that it lies with the enemy. Such preponderance of course will not depend entirely on actual relative strength, either physical or moral, but will be influenced by the inter-relation of naval positions and the comparative convenience of their situation in regard to the object of the war or campaign. By naval positions we mean, firstly, naval bases and, secondly, the terminals of the greater lines of communication or trade-routes and the focal areas where they tend to converge, as at Finisterre, Gibraltar, Suez, the Cape, Singapore, and many others. Upon the degree and distribution of this preponderance will depend in a general way the extent to which our plans will be governed by the idea of defence or offence.\nGenerally speaking, it will be to the advantage of the preponderating side to seek a decision as quickly as possible in order to terminate the state of dispute. Conversely, the weaker side will as a rule seek to avoid or postpone a decision in hope of being able by minor operations, the chances of war, or the development of fresh strength, to turn the balance in its favour. Such was the line which France adopted frequently in her wars with us, sometimes legitimately, but sometimes to such an excess as seriously to demoralise her fleet. Her experience has led to a hasty deduction that the defensive at sea for even a weaker Power is an unmixed evil. Such a conclusion is foreign to the fundamental principles of war. It is idle to exclude the use of an expectant attitude because in itself it cannot lead to final success, and because if used to excess it ends in demoralisation and the loss of will to attack. The misconception appears to have arisen from insistence on the drawbacks of defence by writers seeking to persuade their country to prepare in time of peace sufficient naval strength to justify offence from the outset. Having now determined the fundamental principles which underlie the idea of Command of the Sea, we are in a position to consider the manner in which fleets are constituted in order to fit them for their task.\n\nCHAPTER TWO THEORY OF THE MEANS—THE CONSTITUTION OF FLEETS\nIn all eras of naval warfare fighting ships have exhibited a tendency to differentiate into groups in accordance with the primary function each class was designed to serve. These groupings or classifications are what is meant by the constitution of a fleet. A threefold differentiation into battleships, cruisers, and flotilla has so long dominated naval thought that we have come to regard it as normal, and even essential. It may be so, but such a classification has been by no means constant. Other ideas of fleet constitution have not only existed, but have stood the test of war for long periods, and it is unscientific and unsafe to ignore such facts if we wish to arrive at sound doctrine. The truth is, that the classes of ships which constitute a fleet are, or ought to be, the expression in material of the strategical and tactical ideas that prevail at any given time, and consequently they have varied not only with the ideas, but also with the material in vogue. It may also be said more broadly that they have varied with the theory of war, by which more or less consciously naval thought was dominated. It is true that few ages have formulated a theory of war, or even been clearly aware of its influence; but nevertheless such theories have always existed, and even in their most nebulous and intangible shapes seem to have exerted an ascertainable influence on the constitution of fleets.",

    "text": "In the case of Anson's threefold organisation, the relation is not far to seek, though it has become obscured by two maxims. The one is, that \"the command of the sea depends upon battleships,\" and the other, that \"cruisers are the eyes of the fleet.\" It is the inherent evil of maxims that they tend to get stretched beyond their original meaning. Both of these express a truth, but neither expresses the whole truth. On no theory of naval warfare can we expect to command the sea with battleships, nor, on the communication theory, can we regard the primary function of cruisers as being to scout for a battle-fleet. It is perfectly true that the control depends ultimately on the battle- fleet if control is disputed by a hostile battle-fleet, as it usually is. It is also true that, so far as is necessary to enable the battle-fleet to secure the control, we have to furnish it with eyes from our cruiser force. But it does not follow that this is the primary function of cruisers. The truth is, we have to withdraw them from their primary function in order to do work for the battle-fleet which it cannot do for itself.\n\nWell established as is the \"Eyes of the fleet\" maxim, it would be very difficult to show that scouting was ever regarded as the primary function of cruisers by the highest authorities. In Nelson's practice at least their paramount function was to exercise the control which he was securing with his battle-squadron. Nothing is more familiar in naval history than his incessant cry from the Mediterranean for more cruisers, but the significance of that cry has become obscured. It was not that his cruisers were not numerous in proportion to his battleships— they were usually nearly double in number—but it was rather that he was so deeply convinced of their true function, that he used them to exercise control to an extent which sometimes reduced his fleet cruisers below the limit of bare necessity. The result on a memorable occasion was the escape of the enemy's battle-fleet, but the further result is equally important. It was that the escape of that fleet did not deprive him of the control which he was charged to maintain. His judgment may have been at fault, but the strategical distribution of his force was consistent throughout the whole period of his Mediterranean command. Judged by his record, no man ever grasped more clearly than Nelson that the object of naval warfare was to control communications, and if he found that he had not a sufficient number of cruisers to exercise that control and to furnish eyes for his battle-fleet as well, it was the battle-fleet that was made to suffer, and surely this is at least the logical view.\n\nHad the French been ready to risk settling the question of the control in a fleet action, it would have been different. He would then have been right to sacrifice the exercise of control for the time in order to make sure that the action should take place and end decisively in his favour. But he knew they were not ready to take such a risk, and he refused to permit a purely defensive attitude on the part of the enemy to delude him from the special function with which he had been charged. If the object of naval warfare is to control communications, then the fundamental requirement is the means of exercising that control. Logically, therefore, if the enemy holds back from battle decision, we must relegate the battle-fleet to a secondary position, for cruisers are the means of exercising control; the battle-fleet is but the means of preventing their being interfered with in their work.",

    "text": "Put it to the test of actual practice. In no case can we exercise control by battleships alone. Their specialisation has rendered them unfit for the work, and has made them too costly ever to be numerous enough. Even, therefore, if our enemy had no battle-fleet we could not make control effective with battleships alone. We should still require cruisers specialised for the work and in sufficient numbers to cover the necessary ground. But the converse is not true. We could exercise control with cruisers alone if the enemy had no battle-fleet to interfere with them. If, then, we seek a formula that will express the practical results of our theory, it would take some such shape as this. On cruisers depends our exercise of control; on the battle-fleet depends the security of control. That is the logical sequence of ideas, and it shows us that the current maxim is really the conclusion of a logical argument in which the initial steps must not be ignored. The maxim that the command of the sea depends on the battle-fleet is then perfectly sound so long as it is taken to include all the other facts on which it hangs. The true function of the battle-fleet is to protect cruisers and flotilla at their special work. The best means of doing this is of course to destroy the enemy's power of interference. The doctrine of destroying the enemy's armed forces as the paramount object here reasserts itself, and reasserts itself so strongly as to permit for most practical purposes the rough generalisation that the command depends upon the battle-fleet.\n\nOf what practical use then, it may be asked, is all this hairsplitting? Why not leave untainted the conviction that our first and foremost business is to crush the enemy's battle-fleet, and that to this end our whole effort should be concentrated? The answer is to point to Nelson's dilemma. It was a dilemma which, in the golden age of naval warfare, every admiral at sea had had to solve for himself, and it was always one of the most difficult details of every naval war plan. If we seek to ensure the effective action of the battle-fleet by giving it a large proportion of cruisers, by so much do we weaken the actual and continuous exercise of control. If we seek to make that control effective by devoting to the service a large proportion of cruisers, by so much do we prejudice our chance of getting contact with and defeating the enemy's battle-fleet, which is the only means of perfecting control. The correct solution of the dilemma will of course depend upon the conditions of each case—mainly upon the relative strength and activity of the hostile battle-fleet and our enemy's probable intentions. But no matter how completely we have tabulated all the relevant facts, we can never hope to come to a sound conclusion upon them without a just appreciation of all the elements which go to give command, and without the power of gauging their relative importance. This, and this alone, will ultimately settle the vital question of what proportion of our cruiser force it is right to devote to the battle-fleet. If the doctrine of cruiser control be correct, then every cruiser attached to the battle-fleet is one withdrawn from its true function. Such withdrawals are inevitable. A squadron of battleships is an imperfect organism unable to do its work without cruiser assistance, and since the performance of its work is essential to cruiser freedom, some cruisers must be sacrificed. But in what proportion? If we confine ourselves to the view that command depends on the battle-fleet, then we shall attach to it such a number as its commander may deem necessary to make contact with the enemy absolutely certain and to surround himself with an impenetrable screen. If we knew the enemy was as anxious for a decision as ourselves, such a course might be justified. But the normal condition is that if we desire a decision it is because we have definite hopes of success, and consequently the enemy will probably seek to avoid one on our terms. In practice this means that if we have perfected our arrangements for the destruction of his main fleet he will refuse to expose it till he sees a more favourable opportunity. And what will be the result? He remains on the defensive, and theoretically all the ensuing period of inaction tends to fall into his scale. Without stirring from port his fleet is doing its work. The more closely he induces us to concentrate our cruiser force in face of his battle-fleet, the more he frees the sea for the circulation of his own trade, and the more he exposes ours to cruiser raids.",

    "text": "Experience, then, and theory alike dictate that as a general principle cruisers should be regarded as primarily concerned with the active occupation of communications, and that withdrawals for fleet purposes should be reduced to the furthest margin of reasonable risk. What that margin should be can only be decided on the circumstances of each case as it arises, and by the personal characteristics of the officers who are responsible. Nelson's practice was to reduce fleet cruisers lower than perhaps any other commander. So small indeed was the margin of efficiency he left, that in the campaign already cited, when his judgment was ripest, one stroke of ill luck—a chance betrayal of his position by a neutral—availed to deprive him of the decision he sought, and to let the enemy's fleet escape. We arrive, then, at this general conclusion. The object of naval warfare is to control maritime communications. In order to exercise that control effectively we must have a numerous class of vessels specially adapted for pursuit. But their power of exercising control is in proportion to our degree of command, that is, to our power of preventing their operations being interfered with by the enemy. Their own power of resistance is in inverse proportion to their power of exercising control; that is to say, the more numerous and better adapted they are for preying on commerce and transports, the weaker will be their individual fighting power. We cannot give them as a whole the power of resisting disturbance without at the same time reducing their power of exercising control. The accepted solution of the difficulty during the great period of Anson's school was to provide them with a covering force of battle units specially adapted for fighting. But here arises a correlative difficulty. In so far as we give our battle units fighting power we deny them scouting power, and scouting is essential to their effective operation. The battle-fleet must have eyes. Now, vessels adapted for control of communications are also well adapted for \"eyes.\" It becomes the practice, therefore, to withdraw from control operations a sufficient number of units to enable the battle-fleet to cover effectively the operations of those that remain. Such were the broad principles on which the inevitable dilemma always had to be solved, and on which Anson's organisation was based. They flow naturally from the communication theory of maritime war, and it was this theory which then dominated naval thought, as is apparent from the technical use of such phrases as \"lines of passage and communication.\" The war plans of the great strategists from Anson and Barham can always be resolved into these simple elements, and where we find the Admiralty grip of them loosened, we have the confusion and quite unnecessary failures of the War of American Independence. In that mismanaged contest the cardinal mistake was that we suffered the enemy's battle-fleets to get upon and occupy the vital lines of \"passage and communication\" without first bringing them to action, an error partly due to the unreadiness of a weak administration, and partly to an insufficient allocation of cruisers to secure contact at the right places. So far, then, the principles on which our naval supremacy was built up are clear. For the enemies with whom we had to deal Anson's system was admirably conceived. Both Spain and France held the communication theory so strongly, that they were content to count as success the power of continually disturbing our control without any real attempt to secure it for themselves. To defeat such a policy Anson's constitution and the strategy it connoted were thoroughly well adapted and easy to work. But it by no means follows that his doctrine is the last word. Even in his own time complications had begun to develop which tended to confuse the precision of his system. By the culminating year of Trafalgar there were indications that it was getting worn out, while the new methods and material used by the Americans in 1812 made a serious rent in it. The disturbances then inaugurated have continued to develop, and it is necessary to consider how seriously they have confused the problem of fleet constitution.",

    "text": "Firstly, there is the general recognition, always patent to ourselves, that by far the most drastic, economical, and effective way of securing control is to destroy the enemy's means of interfering with it. In our own service this \"overthrow\" idea always tended to assert itself so strongly, that occasionally the means became for a time more important than the end; that is to say, circumstances were such that on occasions it was considered advisable to sacrifice the exercise of control for a time in order quickly and permanently to deprive the enemy of all means of interference. When there was reasonable hope of the enemy risking a decision this consideration tended to override all others; but when, as in Nelson's case in the Mediterranean, the hope was small, the exercise of control tended to take the paramount place. The second complexity arose from the fact that however strong might be our battleship cover, it is impossible for it absolutely to secure cruiser control from disturbance by sporadic attack. Isolated heavy ships, taking advantage of the chances of the sea, could elude even the strictest blockade, and one such ship, if she succeeded in getting upon a line of communication, might paralyse the operations of a number of weaker units. They must either run or concentrate, and in either case the control was broken. If it were a squadron of heavy ships that caused the disturbance, the practice was to detach against it a division of the covering battle-fleet. But it was obviously highly inconvenient and contrary to the whole idea on which the constitution of the fleet was based to allow every slight danger to cruiser control to loosen the cohesion of the main fleet. It was necessary, then, to give cruiser lines some power of resistance. This necessity once admitted, there seemed no point at which you could stop increasing the fighting power of your cruisers, and sooner or later, unless some means of checking the process were found, the distinction between cruisers and battleships would practically disappear. Such a means was found in what may be called the \"Intermediate\" ship. Frigates did indeed continue to increase in size and fighting power throughout the remainder of the sailing era, but it was not only in this manner that the power of resistance was gained. The evil results of the movement were checked by the introduction of a supporting ship, midway between frigates and true ships-of-the-line.",

    "text": "…and taking her place in the line, the 50-gun ship came to be essentially a type for stiffening cruiser squadrons. They most commonly appear as the flagships of cruiser commodores, or stationed in terminal waters or at focal points where sporadic raids were likely to fall and be most destructive. The strategical effect of the presence of such a vessel in a cruiser line was to give the whole line in some degree the strength of the intermediate ship; for any hostile cruiser endeavouring to disturb the line was liable to have to deal with the supporting ship, while if a frigate and a 50-gun ship got together they were a match even for a small ship-of-the-line. In sailing days, of course, this power of the supporting ship was weak owing to the imperfection of the means of distant communication between ships at sea and the non-existence of such means beyond extreme range of vision. But as wireless telegraphy develops it is not unreasonable to expect that the strategic value of the supporting or intermediate ship will be found greater than it ever was in sailing days, and that for dealing with sporadic disturbance the tendency will be for a cruiser line to approximate more and more in power of resistance to that of its strongest unit. For fleet service a cruiser's power of resistance was hardly less valuable; for though we speak of fleet cruisers as the eyes of the fleet, their purpose is almost equally to blindfold the enemy. Their duty is not only to disclose the movements of the enemy, but also to act as a screen to conceal our own. The point was specially well marked in the blockades, where the old 50-gun ships are almost always found with the inshore cruiser squadron, preventing that squadron being forced by inquisitive frigates. Important as this power of resistance in the screen was in the old days, it is tenfold more important now, and the consequent difficulty of keeping cruisers distinct from battleships is greater than ever. The reason for this is best considered under the third and most serious cause of complexity. The third cause is the acquisition by the flotilla of battle power. It is a feature of naval warfare that is entirely new.\nFor all practical purposes it was unknown until the full development of the mobile torpedo. It is true that the fireship as originally conceived was regarded as having something of the same power. During the Dutch wars —the heyday of its vogue—its assigned power was on some occasions actually realised, as in the burning of Lord Sandwich's flagship at the battle of Solebay, and the destruction of the Spanish-Dutch fleet at Palermo by Duquesne. But as the \"nimbleness\" of great-ships increased with the ripening of seamanship and naval architecture, the fireship as a battle weapon became almost negligible, while a fleet at anchor was found to be thoroughly defensible by its own picket-boats. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century indeed the occasions on which the fireship could be used for its special purpose was regarded as highly exceptional, and though the type was retained till the end of the century, its normal functions differed not at all from those of the rest of the flotilla of which it then formed part. Those functions, as we have seen, expressed the cruising idea in its purest sense. It was numbers and mobility that determined flotilla types rather than armament or capacity for sea-endurance. Their primary purpose was to control communications in home and colonial waters against weakly armed privateers. The type which these duties determined fitted them adequately for the secondary purpose of inshore and despatch work with a fleet. It was, moreover, on the ubiquity which their numbers gave them, and on their power of dealing with unarmed or lightly armed vessels, that we relied for our first line of defence against invasion. These latter duties were of course exceptional, and the Navy List did not carry as a rule sufficient numbers for the purpose. But a special value of the class was that it was capable of rapid and almost indefinite expansion from the mercantile marine. Anything that could carry a gun had its use, and during the period of the Napoleonic threat the defence flotilla rose all told to considerably over a thousand units. Formidable and effective as was a flotilla of this type for the ends it was designed to serve, it obviously in no way affected the security of a battle-fleet. But so soon as the flotilla acquired battle power the whole situation was changed, and the old principles of cruiser design and distribution were torn to shreds.",

    "text": "The battle-fleet became a more imperfect organism than ever. Formerly it was only its offensive power that required supplementing. The new condition meant that unaided it could no longer ensure its own defence. It now required screening, not only from observation, but also from flotilla attack. The theoretical weakness of an arrested offensive received a practical and concrete illustration to a degree that war had scarcely ever known. Our most dearly cherished strategical traditions were shaken to the bottom. The \"proper place\" for our battle-fleet had always been \"on the enemy's coasts,\" and now that was precisely where the enemy would be best pleased to see it. What was to be done? So splendid a tradition could not lightly be laid aside, but the attempt to preserve it involved us still deeper in heresy. The vital, most difficult, and most absorbing problem has become not how to increase the power of a battle-fleet for attack, which is a comparatively simple matter, but how to defend it. As the offensive power of the flotilla developed, the problem pressed with an almost bewildering intensity. With every increase in the speed and sea-keeping power of torpedo craft, the problem of the screen grew more exacting. To keep the hostile flotilla out of night range the screen must be flung out wider and wider, and this meant more and more cruisers withdrawn from their primary function. And not only this. The screen must not only be far flung, but it must be made as far as possible impenetrable. In other words, its own power of resistance must be increased all along the line. Whole squadrons of armoured cruisers had to be attached to battle-fleets to support the weaker members of the screen. The crying need for this type of ship set up a rapid movement for increasing their fighting power, and with it fell with equal rapidity the economic possibility of giving the cruiser class its essential attribute of numbers. As an inevitable result we find ourselves involved in an effort to restore to the flotilla some of its old cruiser capacity, by endowing it with gun armament, higher sea-keeping power, and facilities for distant communication, all at the cost of specialisation and of greater economic strain. Still judged by past experience, some means of increasing numbers in the cruising types is essential, nor is it clear how it is possible to secure that essential in the ranks of the true cruiser. No point has been found at which it was possible to stop the tendency of this class of vessel to increase in size and cost, or to recall it to the strategical position it used to occupy. So insecure is the battle-squadron, so imperfect as a self-contained weapon has it become, that its need has overridden the old order of things, and the primary function of the cruising ship inclines to be no longer the exercise of control under cover of the battle-fleet. The battle-fleet now demands protection by the cruising ship, and what the battle-fleet needs is held to be the first necessity. Judged by the old naval practice, it is an anomalous position to have reached. But the whole naval art has suffered a revolution beyond all previous experience, and it is possible the old practice is no longer a safe guide. Driven by the same necessities, every naval Power is following the same course. It may be right, it may be wrong; no one at least but the ignorant or hasty will venture to pass categorical judgment. The best we can do is to endeavour to realise the situation to which, in spite of all misgivings, we have been forced, and to determine its relations to the developments of the past. It is undoubtedly a difficult task. As we have seen, there have prevailed in the constitution of fleets at various times several methods of expressing the necessities of naval war. The present system differs from them all.",

    "text": "On the one hand, we have the fact that the latest developments of cruiser power have finally obliterated all logical distinction between cruisers and battleships, and we thus find ourselves hand in hand with the fleet constitution of the old Dutch wars. On the other, however, we have armoured cruisers organised in squadrons and attached to battle-fleets not only for strategical purposes, but also with as yet undeveloped tactical functions in battle. Here we come close to the latest development of the sailing era, when \"Advanced\" or \"Light\" squadrons began to appear in the organisation of battle-fleets. The system arose towards the end of the eighteenth century in the Mediterranean, where the conditions of control called for so wide a dispersal of cruisers and so great a number of them, that it was almost imperative for a battle-squadron in that sea to do much of its own scouting. It was certainly for this purpose that the fastest and lightest ships-of-the-line were formed into a separate unit, and the first designation it received was that of \"Observation Squadron.\" It remained for Nelson to endeavour to endow it with a tactical function, but his idea was never realised either by himself or any of his successors. Side by side with this new element in the organisation of a battle-fleet, which perhaps is best designated as a \"Light Division,\" we have another significant fact. Not only was it not always composed entirely of ships-of-the-line, especially in the French service, but in 1805, the year of the full development, we have Sir Richard Strachan using the heavy frigates attached to his battle-squadron as a \"Light Division,\" and giving them a definite tactical function. The collapse of the French Navy put a stop to further developments of either idea. Whither they would have led we cannot tell. But it is impossible to shut our eyes to the indication of a growing tendency towards the system that exists at present. It is difficult at least to ignore the fact that both Nelson and Strachan in that culminating year found the actuality of war calling for something for which there was then no provision in the constitution of the fleet, but which it does contain to-day. What Nelson felt for was a battleship of cruiser speed. What Strachan desired was a cruiser fit to take a tactical part in a fleet action. We have them both, but with what result? Anson's specialisation of types has almost disappeared, and our present fleet constitution is scarcely to be distinguished from that of the seventeenth century. We retain the three-fold nomenclature, but the system itself has really gone. Battleships grade into armoured cruisers, armoured cruisers into protected cruisers. We can scarcely detect any real distinction except a twofold one between vessels whose primary armament is the gun and vessels whose primary armament is the torpedo. But even here the existence of a type of cruiser designed to act with flotillas blurs the outline, while, as we have seen, the larger units of the flotilla are grading up to cruiser level. We are thus face to face with a situation which has its closest counterpart in the structureless fleets of the seventeenth century. That naval thought should have so nearly retraced its steps in the course of two centuries is curious enough, but it is still more striking when we consider how widely the underlying causes differ in each case. The pressure which has forced the present situation is due most obviously to two causes. One is the excessive development of the \"intermediate\" ship originally devised for purposes of commerce protection, and dictated by a menace which the experience of the American War had taught us to respect. The other is the introduction of the torpedo, and the consequent vulnerability of battle-squadrons that are not securely screened. Nothing of the kind had any influence on the fleet constitution of the seventeenth century. But if we seek deeper, there is a less obvious consideration which for what it is worth is too striking to be ignored. It has been suggested above that the constitution of fleets appears to have some more or less recognisable relation to the prevalent theory of war. Now, amongst all our uncertainty we can assert with confidence that the theory which holds the field at the present day bears the closest possible resemblance to that which dominated the soldier-admirals of the Dutch war. It was the \"Overthrow\" theory, the firm faith in the decisive action as the key of all strategical problems. They carried it to sea with them from the battlefields of the New Model Army, and the Dutch met them squarely. In the first war at least their commerce had to give place to the exigencies of throwing into the battle everything that could affect the issue. It is not of course pretended that this attitude was dictated by any clearly conceived theory of absolute war. It was due rather to the fact that, owing to the relative geographical conditions, all attempts to guard trade communications were useless without the command of the home waters in the North Sea, and the truth received a clinching moral emphasis from the British claim to the actual dominion of the Narrow Seas. It was, in fact, a war which resembled rather the continental conditions of territorial conquest than the naval procedure that characterised our rivalry with France. Is it then possible, however much we may resist the conclusion in loyalty to the eighteenth-century tradition, that the rise of a new naval Power in the room of Holland must bring us back to the drastic, if crude, methods of the Dutch wars, and force us to tread under foot the nicer ingenuity of Anson's system? Is it this which has tempted us to mistrust any type of vessel which cannot be flung into the battle? The recurrence of a formidable rival in the North Sea was certainly not the first cause of the reaction. It began before that menace arose. Still it has undoubtedly forced the pace, and even if it be not a cause, it may well be a justification.

    "section": "Concentration in Naval Strategy",
    "text": "Strategy is often described as the art of assembling the utmost force at the right time and place; and this method is called \"Concentration.\" At first sight the term seems simple and expressive enough, but on analysis it will be found to include several distinct ideas, to all of which the term is applied indifferently. The result is a source of some confusion, even to the most lucid writers. \"The word concentration,\" says one of the most recent of them, \"evokes the idea of a grouping of forces. We believe, in fact, that we cannot make war without grouping ships into squadrons and squadrons into fleets.\"11 Here in one sentence the word hovers between the formation of fleets and their strategical distribution. Similar looseness will embarrass the student at every turn. At one time he will find the word used to express the antithesis of division or dispersal of force; at another, to express strategic deployment, which implies division to a greater or less extent. He will find it used of the process of assembling a force, as well as of the state of a force when the process is complete. The truth is that the term, which is one of the most common and most necessary in strategical discussion, has never acquired a very precise meaning, and this lack of precision is one of the commonest causes of conflicting opinion and questionable judgments. No strategical term indeed calls more urgently for a clear determination of the ideas for which it stands. Military phraseology, from which the word is taken, employs \"concentration\" in three senses. It is used for assembling the units of an army after they have been mobilised. In this sense, concentration is mainly an administrative process; logically, it means the complement of the process of mobilisation, whereby the army realises its war organisation and becomes ready to take the field. In a second sense it is used for the process of moving the army when formed, or in process of formation, to the localities from which operations can best begin. This is a true strategical stage, and it culminates in what is known as strategic deployment. Finally, it is used for the ultimate stage when the army so deployed is closed up upon a definite line of operations in immediate readiness for tactical deployment—gathered up, that is, to deal a concentrated blow. Well as this terminology appears to serve on land, where the processes tend to overlap, something more exact is required if we try to extend it to the sea. Such extension magnifies the error at every step, and clear thinking becomes difficult. Even if we set aside the first meaning, that is, the final stage of mobilisation, we have still to deal with the two others which, in a great measure, are mutually contradictory. The essential distinction of strategic deployment, which contemplates dispersal with a view to a choice of combinations, is flexibility and free movement. The characteristic of an army massed for a blow is rigidity and restricted mobility. In the one sense of concentration we contemplate a disposal of force which will conceal our intention from the enemy and will permit us to adapt our movements to the plan of operations he develops. In the other, strategic concealment is at an end. We have made our choice, and are committed to a definite operation.",

    "section": "Defining Naval Concentration",
    "text": "Clearly, then, if we would apply the principles of land concentration to naval warfare it is desirable to settle which of the two phases of an operation we mean by the term. Which meaning, then, is most closely connected with the ordinary use of the word? The dictionaries define concentration as \"the state of being brought to a common point or centre,\" and this coincides very exactly with the stage of a war plan which intervenes between the completion of mobilisation and the final massing or deployment for battle. It is an incomplete and continuing act. Its ultimate consequence is the mass. It is a method of securing mass at the right time and place. As we have seen, the essence of the state of strategic deployment to which it leads is flexibility. In war the choice of time and place will always be influenced by the enemy's dispositions and movements, or by our desire to deal him an unexpected blow. The merit of concentration, then, in this sense, is its power of permitting us to form our mass in time at one of the greatest number of different points where mass may be required. It is for this stage that the more recent text-books incline to specialise concentration—qualifying it as \"strategic concentration.\" But even that term scarcely meets the case, for the succeeding process of gathering up the army into a position for tactical deployment is also a strategical concentration. Some further specialisation is required. The analytical difference between the two processes is that the first is an operation of major strategy and the other of minor, and if they are to be fully expressed, we have to weight ourselves with the terms \"major and minor strategic concentration.\" Such cumbrous terminology is too forbidding to use. It serves only to mark that the middle stage differs logically from the third as much as it does from the first. In practice it comes to this. If we are going to use concentration in its natural sense, we must regard it as something that comes after complete mobilisation and stops short of the formation of mass. In naval warfare at least this distinction between concentration and mass is essential to clear appreciation. It leads us to conclusions that are of the first importance. For instance, when once the mass is formed, concealment and flexibility are at an end. The further, therefore, from the formation of the ultimate mass we can stop the process of concentration the better designed it will be. The less we are committed to any particular mass, and the less we indicate what and where our mass is to be, the more formidable our concentration. To concentration, therefore, the idea of division is as essential as the idea of connection. It is this view of the process which, at least for naval warfare, a weighty critical authority has most strongly emphasised. \"Such,\" he says, \"is concentration reasonably understood—not huddled together like a drove of sheep, but distributed with a regard to a common purpose, and linked together by the effectual energy of a single will.\"12 Vessels in a state of concentration he compares to a fan that opens and shuts. In this view concentration connotes not a homogeneous body, but a compound organism controlled from a common centre, and elastic enough to permit it to cover a wide field without sacrificing the mutual support of its parts.",

    "text": "De Ruyter. It was a situation that could not be solved by a simple application of what the French call the masse centrale. The only way to secure both places from attack was to divide the fleet, just as in 1801 Nelson in the same theatre was compelled to divide his defence force. In neither case was division a fault, because it was a necessity. The fault in Monk's and Rupert's case was that they extended their reach with no proper provision to preserve cohesion. Close cruiser connection should have been maintained between the two divisions, and Monk should not have engaged deeply till he felt Rupert at his elbow. This we are told was the opinion of most of his flag-officers. They held that he should not have fought when he did. His correct course, on Kempenfelt's principle, would have been to hang on De Ruyter so as to prevent his doing anything, and to have slowly fallen back, drawing the Dutch after him till his loosened concentration was closed up again. If De Ruyter had refused to follow him through the Straits, there would have been plenty of time to mass the fleet. If De Ruyter had followed, he could have been fought in a position from which there would have been no escape. The fault, in fact, was not strategical, but rather one of tactical judgment. Monk over-estimated the advantage of his surprise and the relative fighting values of the two fleets, and believed he saw his way to victory single-handed. The danger of division is being surprised and forced to fight in inferiority. This was not Monk's case. He was not surprised, and he could easily have avoided action had he so desired. To judge such a case simply by using concentration as a touchstone can only tend to set up such questionable habits of thought as have condemned the more famous division which occurred in the crisis of the campaign of 1805, and with which we must deal later. Apart from the general danger of using either words or maxims in this way, it is obviously specially unwise in the case of concentration and division. The current rule is that it is bad to divide unless you have a great superiority; yet there have been numerous occasions when, being at war with an inferior enemy, we have found our chief embarrassment in the fact that he kept his fleet divided, and was able thereby to set up something like a deadlock. The main object of our naval operations would then be to break it down. To force an inferior enemy to concentrate is indeed the almost necessary preliminary to securing one of those crushing victories at which we must always aim, but which so seldom are obtained. It is by forcing the enemy to attempt to concentrate that we get our opportunity by sagacious dispersal of crushing his divisions in detail. It is by inducing him to mass that we simplify our problem and compel him to choose between leaving to us the exercise of command and putting it to the decision of a great action. Advocates of close concentration will reply that that is true enough. We do often seek to force our enemy to concentrate, but that does not show that concentration is sometimes a disadvantage, for we ourselves must concentrate closely to force a similar concentration on the enemy. The maxim, indeed, has become current that concentration begets concentration, but it is not too much to say that it is a maxim which history flatly contradicts. If the enemy is willing to hazard all on a battle, it is true. But if we are too superior, or our concentration too well arranged for him to hope for victory, then our concentration has almost always had the effect of forcing him to disperse for sporadic action.",

    "section": "British Naval Strategy in 1805",
    "text": "So certain was this result, that in our old wars, in which we were usually superior, we always adopted the loosest possible concentrations in order to prevent sporadic action. True, the tendency of the French to adopt this mode of warfare is usually set down to some constitutional ineptitude that is outside strategical theory, but this view is due rather to the irritation which the method caused us, than to sober reasoning. For a comparatively weak belligerent sporadic action was better than nothing, and the only other alternative was for him to play into our hands by hazarding the decision which it was our paramount interest to obtain. Sporadic action alone could never give our enemy command of the sea, but it could do us injury and embarrass our plans, and there was always hope it might so much loosen our concentration as to give him a fair chance of obtaining a series of successful minor decisions. Take, now, the leading case of 1805. In that campaign our distribution was very wide, and was based on several concentrations. The first had its centre in the Downs, and extended not only athwart the invading army's line of passage, but also over the whole North Sea, so as to prevent interference with our trade or our system of coast defence either from the Dutch in the Texel or from French squadrons arriving north-about. The second, which was known as the Western Squadron, had its centre off Ushant, and was spread over the whole Bay of Biscay by means of advanced squadrons before Ferrol and Rochefort. With a further squadron off the coast of Ireland, it was able also to reach far out into the Atlantic in order to receive our trade. It kept guard, in fact, not only over the French naval ports, but over the approaches to the Channel, where were the home terminals of the great southern and western trade-routes. A third concentration was in the Mediterranean, whose centre under Nelson was at Sardinia. It had outlying sub-centres at Malta and Gibraltar, and covered the whole ground from Cape St. Vincent outside the Straits to Toulon, Trieste, and the Dardanelles. When war broke out with Spain in 1804, it was considered advisable to divide this command, and Spanish waters outside the Straits were held by a fourth concentration, whose centre was off Cadiz, and whose northern limit was Cape Finisterre, where it joined the Ushant concentration. For reasons which were personal rather than strategical this arrangement was not continued long, nor indeed after a few months was there the same need for it, for the Toulon squadron had changed its base to Cadiz. By this comprehensive system the whole of the European seas were controlled both for military and trade purposes. In the distant terminal areas, like the East and West Indies, there were nucleus concentrations with the necessary connective machinery permanently established, and to render them effective, provision was made by which the various European squadrons could throw off detachments to bring up their force to any strength which the movements of the enemy might render necessary. Wide as was this distribution, and great as its reach, a high degree of cohesion was maintained not only between the parts of each concentration, but between the several concentrations themselves. By means of a minor cruiser centre at the Channel Islands, the Downs and Ushant concentrations could rapidly cohere. Similarly the Cadiz concentration was linked up with that of Ushant at Finisterre, and but for personal friction and repulsion, the cohesion between the Mediterranean and Cadiz concentrations would have been equally strong. Finally, there was a masterly provision made for all the concentrations to condense into one great mass at the crucial point off Ushant before by any calculable chance a hostile mass could gather there. For Napoleon's best admirals, \"who knew the craft of the sea,\" the British fleet thus disposed was in a state of concentration that nothing but a stroke of luck beyond the limit of sober calculation could break. Decrès and Bruix had no doubt of it, and the knowledge overpowered Villeneuve when the crisis came. After he had carried the concentration which Napoleon had planned so far as to have united three divisions in Ferrol, he knew that the outlying sections of our Western Squadron had disappeared from before Ferrol and Rochefort. In his eyes, as well as those of the British Admiralty, this squadron, in spite of its dispersal in the Bay of Biscay, had always been in a state of concentration. It was not this which caused his heart to fail. It was the news that Nelson had reappeared at Gibraltar, and had been seen steering northward. It meant for him that the whole of his enemy's European fleet was in a state of concentration. \"Their concentration of force,\" he afterwards wrote, \"was at the moment more serious than in any previous disposition, and such that they were in a position to meet in superiority the combined forces of Brest and Ferrol,\" and for that reason, he explained, he had given up the game as lost.",

    "text": "principles are at least equally valid when a coalition places us in inferiority. The leading case is the home campaign of 1782. It was strictly on defensive lines. Our information was that France and Spain intended to end the war with a great combined effort against our West Indian islands, and particularly Jamaica. It was recognised that the way to meet the threat was to concentrate for offensive action in the Caribbean Sea everything that was not absolutely needed for home defence. Instead, therefore, of trying to be strong enough to attempt the offensive in both areas, it was decided to make sure of the area that was most critical. To do this the home fleet had to be reduced so low relatively to what the enemy had in European waters that offence was out of the question. While Rodney took the offensive area, Lord Howe was given the other. His task was to prevent the coalition obtaining such a command of home waters as would place our trade and coasts at their mercy, and it was not likely to prove a light one. We knew that the enemy's plan was to combine their attack on the West Indies with an attempt to control the North Sea, and possibly the Straits of Dover, with a Dutch squadron of twelve to fifteen of the line, while a combined Franco-Spanish fleet of at least forty sail would occupy the mouth of the Channel. It was also possible that these two forces would endeavour to form a junction. In any case the object of the joint operations would be to paralyse our trade and annoy our coasts, and thereby force us to neglect the West Indian area and the two Spanish objectives, Minorca and Gibraltar. All told we had only about thirty of the line on the home station, and though a large proportion of these were three-deckers, a good many could not be ready for sea till the summer. Inferior as was the available force, there was no thought of a purely passive defence. It would not meet the case. Something must be done to interfere with the offensive operations of the allies in the West Indies and against Gibraltar, or they would attain the object of their home campaign. It was resolved to effect this by minor counterstrokes on their line of communications to the utmost limit of our defensive reach. It would mean a considerable stretch of our concentration, but we were determined to do what we could to prevent reinforcements from reaching the West Indies from Brest, to intercept French trade as occasion offered, and, finally, at almost any risk to relieve Gibraltar. In these conditions the defensive concentration was based on a central mass or reserve at Spithead, a squadron in the Downs to watch the Texel for the safety of the North Sea trade, and another to the westward to watch Brest and interrupt its transatlantic communications. Kempenfelt in command of the latter squadron had just shown what could be done by his great exploit of capturing Guichen's convoy of military and naval stores for the West Indies. Early in the spring he was relieved by Barrington, who sailed on April 5th to resume the Ushant position. His instructions were not to fight a superior enemy unless in favourable circumstances, but to retire on Spithead. He was away three weeks, and returned with a French East India convoy with troops and stores, and two of the ships of-the-line which formed its escort.",

    "text": "Up to this time there had been no immediate sign of the great movement from the south. The Franco-Spanish fleet which had assembled at Cadiz was occupied ineffectually in trying to stop small reliefs reaching Gibraltar and in covering their own homeward-bound trade. The Dutch, however, were becoming active, and the season was approaching for our Baltic trade to come home. Ross in the North Sea had but four of the line to watch the Texel, and was in no position to deal with the danger. Accordingly early in May the weight of the home concentration was thrown into the North Sea. On the 10th Howe sailed with Barrington and the bulk of the fleet to join Ross in the Downs, while Kempenfelt again took the Ushant position. Only about half the Brest Squadron had gone down to join the Spaniards at Cadiz, and he was told his first duty was to intercept the rest if it put to sea, but, as in Barrington's instructions, if he met a superior squadron he was to retire up Channel under the English coast and join hands with Howe. In spite of the fact that influenza was now raging in the fleet, he succeeded in holding the French inactive. Howe with the same difficulty to face was equally successful. The Dutch had put to sea, but returned immediately they knew of his movement, and cruising off the Texel, he held them there, and kept complete command of the North Sea till our Baltic trade was safe home. By the end of May it was done, and as our intelligence indicated that the great movement from Cadiz was at last about to begin, Howe, to whom a certain discretion had been left, decided it was time to shift the weight to his other wing and close on Kempenfelt. The Government, however, seemed to think that he ought to be able to use his position for offensive operations against Dutch trade, but in the admiral's opinion this was to lose hold of the design and sacrifice cohesion too much to reach. He informed them that he had not deemed it advisable to make detachments from his squadron against the trade, \"not knowing how suddenly there might be a call, for the greater part of it at least, to the westward.\" In accordance, therefore, with his general instructions he left with Ross a strong squadron of nine of the line, sufficient to hold in check, and even \"to take and destroy,\" the comparatively weak ships of the Dutch, and with the rest returned to the westward.13 His intention was to proceed with all possible expedition to join Kempenfelt on the coast of France, but this, owing to the ravages of the influenza, he was unable to do. Kempenfelt was forced to come in, and on June 5th the junction was made at Spithead. For three weeks, so severe was the epidemic, they could not move. Then came news that the Cadiz fleet under Langara had sailed the day Howe had reached Spithead, and he resolved to make a dash with every ship fit to put to sea to cut it off from Brest. He was too late. Before he could get into position the junction between Langara and the Brest squadron was made, and in their full force the allies had occupied the mouth of the Channel. With the addition of the Brest ships the combined fleet numbered forty of the line, while all Howe could muster was twenty-two, but amongst them were seven three-deckers and three eighties, and he would soon be reinforced. Three of Ross's smallest ships were recalled, and five others were nearly ready, but for these Howe could not wait. The homeward-bound Jamaica convoy was at hand, and at all hazards it must be saved. What was to be done?",

    "text": "So soon as he sighted the enemy he realised that a successful action was out of the question. Early in the morning of July 12th, \"being fifteen leagues S.S.E. from Scilly,\" Langara with thirty-six of the line was seen to the westward. \"As soon,\" wrote Howe, \"as their force had been ascertained, I thought proper to avoid coming to battle with them as then circumstanced, and therefore steered to the north to pass between Scilly and the Land's End. My purpose therein was to get to the westward of the enemy, both for protecting the Jamaica convoy and to gain the advantage of situation for bringing them to action which the difference in our numbers renders desirable.\" By a most brilliant effort of seamanship the dangerous movement was effected safely that night, and it proved an entire success. Till Howe was met with and defeated, the allies would not venture into the Channel, and his unprecedented feat had effectually thrown them off. Assuming apparently that he must have passed round their rear to seaward, they sought him to the southward, and there for a month beat up and down in ineffective search. Meanwhile Howe, sending his cruisers ahead to the convoy's rendezvous off the south-west coast of Iceland, had taken his whole fleet about two hundred miles west of the Skelligs to meet it. Northerly winds prevented his reaching the right latitude in time, but it mattered little. The convoy passed in between him and the south of Ireland, and as the enemy had taken a cast down to Ushant, it was able to enter the Channel in safety without sighting an enemy's sail. Ignorant of what had happened, Howe cruised for a week practising the ships \"in connected movements so particularly necessary on the present occasion.\" Then with his fleet in fine condition to carry out preventive tactics in accordance with Kempenfelt's well-known exposition,14 he returned to seek the enemy to the eastward, in order to try to draw them from their station at Scilly and open the Channel. On his way he learnt the convoy had passed in, and with this anxiety off his mind he bore up for the Lizard, where his reinforcements were awaiting him. There he found the Channel was free. From lack of supplies the enemy had been forced to retire to port, and he returned to Spithead to make preparations for the relief of Gibraltar. While this work was going on, the North Sea squadron was again strengthened that it might resume the blockade of the Texel and cover the arrival of the autumn convoys from the Baltic. It was done with complete success. Not a single ship fell into the enemy's hands, and the campaign, and indeed the war, ended by Howe taking the mass of his force down to Gibraltar and performing his remarkable feat of relieving it in the face of the Spanish squadron. For the power and reach of a well-designed concentration there can be no finer example. If, now, we seek from the above and similar examples for principles to serve as a guide between concentration and division we shall find, firstly, this one. The degree of division we shall require is in proportion to the number of naval ports from which the enemy can act against our maritime interests and to the extent of coastline along which they are spread. It is a principle which springs from the soul of our old tradition that we must always seek, not merely to prevent the enemy striking at our heart, but also to strike him the moment he attempts to do anything. We must make of his every attempt an opportunity for a counterstroke. The distribution this aim entailed varied greatly with different enemies. In our wars with France, and particularly when Spain and Holland were in alliance with her, the number of the ports to be dealt with was very considerable and their distribution very wide. In our wars with the Dutch alone, on the other hand, the number and distribution were comparatively small, and in this case our concentration was always close. This measure of distribution, however, will never stand alone. Concentration will not depend solely upon the number and position of the enemy's naval ports. It will be modified by the extent to which the lines of operation starting from those ports traverse our own home waters. The reason is plain. Whatever the enemy opposed to us, and whatever the nature of the war, we must always keep a fleet at home. In any circumstances it is essential for the defence of our home trade terminals, and it is essential as a central reserve from which divisions can be thrown off to reinforce distant terminals and to seize opportunities for counterstrokes. It is \"the mainspring,\" as Lord Barham put it, \"from which all offensive operations must proceed.\" This squadron, then, being permanent and fixed as the foundation of our whole system, it is clear that if, as in the case of the French wars, the enemy's lines of operation do not traverse our home waters, close concentration upon it will not serve our turn. If, on the other hand, as in the case of the Dutch wars, the lines do traverse home waters, a home concentration is all that is required. Our division will then be measured by the amount of our surplus strength, and by the extent to which we feel able to detach squadrons for offensive action against the enemy's distant maritime interests without prejudicing our hold on the home terminals of his lines of operation and our power of striking directly he moves. These remarks apply, of course, to the main fleet operations. If such an enemy has distant colonial bases from which he can annoy our trade, minor concentrations must naturally be arranged in those areas. Next we have to note that where the enemy's squadrons are widely distributed in numerous bases, we cannot always simplify the problem by leaving some of them open so as to entice him to concentrate and reduce the number of ports to be watched. For if we do this, we leave the unwatched squadrons free for sporadic action. Unless we are sure he intends to concentrate with a view to a decisive action, our only means of simplifying the situation is to watch every port closely enough to interfere effectually with sporadic action. Then, sporadic action being denied him, the enemy must either do nothing or concentrate. The next principle is flexibility. Concentration should be so arranged that any two parts may freely cohere, and that all parts may quickly condense into a mass at any point in the area of concentration. The object of holding back from forming the mass is to deny the enemy knowledge of our actual distribution or its intention at any given moment, and at the same time to ensure that it will be adjusted to meet any dangerous movement that is open to him. Further than this our aim should be not merely to prevent any part being overpowered by a superior force, but to regard every detached squadron as a trap to lure the enemy to destruction. The ideal concentration, in short, is an appearance of weakness that covers a reality of strength.",

    "text": "have done, and so philosophical the method they have adopted, that a very natural tendency has arisen to assume that their broad-based conclusions are of universal application. That the leading lines which they have charted are in a certain sense those which must govern all strategy no one will deny. They are the real pioneers, and their methods must be in the main our methods, but what we have to remember is that the country we have to travel is radically different from that in which they acquired their skill. A moment's consideration will reveal how far-reaching the differences are. Let us ask ourselves what are the main ideas around which all the military lore turns. It may be taken broadly that the general principles are three in number. Firstly, there is the idea of concentration of force, that is, the idea of overthrowing the enemy's main strength by bringing to bear upon it the utmost accumulation of weight and energy within your means; secondly, there is the idea that strategy is mainly a question of definite lines of communication; and thirdly, there is the idea of concentration of effort, which means keeping a single eye on the force you wish to overthrow without regard to ulterior objects. Now if we examine the conditions which give these principles so firm a footing on land, we shall find that in all three cases they differ at sea, and differ materially. Take the first, which, in spite of all the deductions we have to make from it in the case of limited wars, is the dominating one. The pithy maxim which expresses its essence is that our primary objective is the enemy's main force. In current naval literature the maxim is applied to the sea in some such form as this: \"The primary object of our battle-fleet is to seek out and destroy that of the enemy.\" On the surface nothing could look sounder, but what are the conditions which underlie the one and the other? The practical value of the military maxim is based upon the fact that in land warfare it is always theoretically possible to strike at your enemy's army, that is, if you have the strength and spirit to overcome the obstacles and face the risks. But at sea this is not so. In naval warfare we have a far-reaching fact which is entirely unknown on land. It is simply this—that it is possible for your enemy to remove his fleet from the board altogether. He may withdraw it into a defended port, where it is absolutely out of your reach without the assistance of an army. No amount of naval force, and no amount of offensive spirit, can avail you. The result is that in naval warfare an embarrassing dilemma tends to assert itself. If you are in a superiority that justifies a vigorous offensive and prompts you to seek out your enemy with a view to a decision, the chances are you will find him in a position where you cannot touch him. Your offence is arrested, and you find yourself in what, at least theoretically, is the weakest general position known to war.",

    "text": "This was one of our earliest discoveries in strategy. It followed indeed immediately and inevitably upon our discovery that the most drastic way of making war was to concentrate every effort on the enemy's armed forces. In dealing with the theory of war in general a caveat has already been entered against the too common assumption that this method was an invention of Napoleon's or Frederick's, or that it was a foreign importation at all. In the view at least of our own military historians the idea was born in our Civil Wars with Cromwell and the New Model Army. It was the conspicuous feature that distinguished our Civil War from all previous wars of modern times. So astonishing was its success—as foreign observers remarked—that it was naturally applied by our soldier-admirals at sea so soon as war broke out with the Dutch. Whatever may be the claims of the Cromwellian soldiers to have invented for land warfare what is regarded abroad as the chief characteristic of the Napoleonic method, it is beyond doubt that they deserve the credit of it at sea. All three Dutch wars had a commercial object, and yet after the first campaign the general idea never was to make the enemy's commerce a primary objective. That place was occupied throughout by their battle-fleets, and under Monk and Rupert at least those objectives were pursued with a singleness of purpose and a persistent vehemence that was entirely Napoleonic. But in the later stages of the struggle, when we began to gain a preponderance, it was found that the method ceased to work. The attempt to seek the enemy with a view to a decisive action was again and again frustrated by his retiring to his own coasts, where either we could not reach him or his facilities for retreat made a decisive result impossible. He assumed, in fact, a defensive attitude with which we were powerless to deal, and in the true spirit of defence he sprang out from time to time to deal us a counterstroke as he saw his opportunity. It was soon perceived that the only way of dealing with this attitude was to adopt some means of forcing the enemy to sea and compelling him to expose himself to the decision we sought. The most cogent means at hand was to threaten his commerce. Instead, therefore, of attempting to seek out his fleet directly, our own would sit upon the fairway of his homeward-bound trade, either on the Dogger Bank or elsewhere, thereby setting up a situation which it was hoped would cost him either his trade or his battle-fleet, or possibly both. Thus in spite of the fact that with our increasing preponderance our preoccupation with the idea of battle decision had become stronger than ever, we found ourselves forced to fall back upon subsidiary operations of an ulterior strategical character. It is a curious paradox, but it is one that seems inherent in the special feature of naval war, which permits the armed force to be removed from the board altogether.",

    "text": "The second distinguishing characteristic of naval warfare which relates to the communication idea is not so well marked, but it is scarcely less important. It will be recalled that this characteristic is concerned with lines of communication in so far as they tend to determine lines of operation. It is a simple question of roads and obstacles. In land warfare we can determine with some precision the limits and direction of our enemy's possible movements. We know that they must be determined mainly by roads and obstacles. But afloat neither roads nor obstacles exist. There is nothing of the kind on the face of the sea to assist us in locating him and determining his movements. True it is that in sailing days his movements were to some extent limited by prevailing winds and by the elimination of impossible courses, but with steam even these determinants have gone, and there is practically nothing to limit the freedom of his movement except the exigencies of fuel. Consequently in seeking to strike our enemy the liability to miss him is much greater at sea than on land, and the chances of being eluded by the enemy whom we are seeking to bring to battle become so serious a check upon our offensive action as to compel us to handle the maxim of \"Seeking out the enemy's fleet\" with caution. The difficulty obtruded itself from the moment the idea was born. It may be traced back—so far at least as modern warfare is concerned—to Sir Francis Drake's famous appreciation in the year of the Armada. This memorable despatch was written when an acute difference of opinion had arisen as to whether it were better to hold our fleet back in home waters or to send it forward to the coast of Spain. The enemy's objective was very uncertain. We could not tell whether the blow was to fall in the Channel or Ireland or Scotland, and the situation was complicated by a Spanish army of invasion ready to cross from the Flemish coast, and the possibility of combined action by the Guises from France. Drake was for solving the problem by taking station off the Armada's port of departure, and fully aware of the risk such a move entailed, he fortified his purely strategical reasons with moral considerations of the highest moment. But the Government was unconvinced, not as is usually assumed out of sheer pusillanimity and lack of strategical insight, but because the chances of Drake's missing contact were too great if the Armada should sail before our own fleet could get into position.",

    "text": "Whatever the nature of the war in which we are engaged, whether it be limited or unlimited, permanent and general command of the sea is the condition of ultimate success. The only way of securing such a command by naval means is to obtain a decision by battle against the enemy's fleet. Sooner or later it must be done, and the sooner the better. That was the old British creed. It is still our creed, and needs no labouring. No one will dispute it, no one will care even to discuss it, and we pass with confidence to the conclusion that the first business of our fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. No maxim can so well embody the British spirit of making war upon the sea, and nothing must be permitted to breathe on that spirit. To examine its claim to be the logical conclusion of our theory of war will even be held dangerous, yet nothing is so dangerous in the study of war as to permit maxims to become a substitute for judgment.\n\nLet us examine its credentials, and as a first step put it to the test of the two most modern instances. Both of them, it must be noted, were instances of Limited War, the most usual form of our own activities, and indeed the only one to which our war organisation, with its essential preponderance of the naval element, has ever been really adapted. The first instance is the Spanish-American War, and the second that between Russia and Japan. In the former case the Americans took up arms in order to liberate Cuba from Spanish domination—a strictly limited object. There is no evidence that the nature of the war was ever clearly formulated by either side, but in just conformity with the general political conditions the American war plan aimed at opening with a movement to secure the territorial object. At the earliest possible moment they intended to establish themselves in the west of Cuba in support of the Colonial insurgents. Everything depended on the initiative being seized with decision and rapidity. Its moral and physical importance justified the utmost risk, and such was the conformation of the sea which the American army had to pass, that a strictly defensive or covering attitude with their fleet could reduce the risk almost to security. Yet so unwisely dominated were the Americans by recently rediscovered maxims, that when on the eve of executing the vital movement they heard a Spanish squadron was crossing the Atlantic, their own covering force was diverted from its defensive position and sent away to \"seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it.\"  Puerto Rico was the most obvious point at which to seek it, and thither Admiral Sampson was permitted to go, regardless of the elementary truth that in such cases what is obvious to you is also usually obvious to your enemy. The result was that not only did the Americans fail to get contact, but they also uncovered their own army's line of passage and paralysed the initial movement. In the end it was only pure chance that permitted them to retrieve the mistake they had made. Had the Spanish squadron put into a Cuban port in railway communication with the main Royalist army, such as Cienfuegos or Havana, instead of hurrying into Santiago, the whole campaign must have been lost.",

    "text": "\"It appears now,\" wrote Admiral Mahan, in his Lessons of the War with Spain, \"not only that the eastward voyage of our Havana division was unfortunate, but it should have been seen beforehand to be a mistake, because inconsistent with a well and generally accepted principle of war, the non-observance of which was not commanded by the conditions. The principle is that which condemns eccentric movements. By the disregard of rule in this case we uncovered both Havana and Cienfuegos, which it was our object to close to the enemy's division.\" Whether or not we regard Admiral Mahan's exposition of the error as penetrating to the real principle that was violated, the movement was in fact not only eccentric, but unnecessary. Had the Americans been content to keep their fleet concentrated in its true defensive position, not only would they have covered their army's line of passage and their blockade of the territorial objective, but they would have had a far better chance of bringing the Spaniards to action. The Spaniards were bound to come to them or remain outside the theatre of operations where they could in no way affect the issue of the war except adversely to themselves by sapping the spirit of their own Cuban garrison. It is a clear case of the letter killing the spirit, of an attractive maxim being permitted to shut the door upon judgment. Strategical offence in this case was not the best defence. \"Seeking out the enemy's fleet\" was almost bound to end in a blow in the air, which not only would fail to gain any offensive result, but would sacrifice the main defensive plank in the American war plan upon which their offensive relied for success. To stigmatise such a movement as merely eccentric is to pass very lenient censure. In the Russo-Japanese War we have a converse case, in which judgment kept the aphorism silent. It is true that during the earlier stage of the naval operations the Japanese did in a sense seek out the enemy's fleet, in so far as they advanced their base close to Port Arthur; but this was done, not with any fixed intention of destroying the Russian fleet—there was small hope of that at sea—but rather because by no other means could they cover the army's lines of passage, which it was the function of the fleet to secure, the true offensive operations being on land. Never except once, under express orders from Tokio, did either Admiral Togo or Admiral Kamimura press offensive movements in such a way as to jeopardise the preventive duty with which the war plan charged them. Still less in the later stage, when everything depended on the destruction of the Baltic fleet, did Admiral Togo \"seek it out.\" He was content, as the Americans should have been content, to have set up such a situation that the enemy must come and break it down if they were to affect the issue of the war. So he waited on the defensive, assured his enemy must come to him, and thereby he rendered it, as certain as war can be, that when the moment for the tactical offensive came his blow should be sure and sudden, in overwhelming strength of concentration, and decisive beyond all precedent. Clearly, then, the maxim of \"seeking out\" for all its moral exhilaration, for all its value as an expression of high and sound naval spirit, must not be permitted to displace well-reasoned judgment. Trusty servant as it is, it will make a bad master, as the Americans found to their serious jeopardy. Yet we feel instinctively that it expresses, as no other aphorism does, the secret of British success at sea. We cannot do without it; we cannot do with it in its nakedness. Let us endeavour to clothe it with its real meaning, with the true principles that it connotes. Let us endeavour to determine the stuff that it is made of, and for this purpose there is no better way than to trace its gradual growth from the days when it was born of the crude and virile instinct of the earliest masters.",

    "section": "Seeking Out the Enemy's Fleet: Early Doctrine and Challenges",
    "text": "The government's initial strategy against the Spanish Armada leaned towards a cautious defensive, prioritizing the protection of vital positions. This contrasted with Drake's advocacy for a more aggressive approach, urging the fleet to seek out the Armada before it could fully mobilize. Permission for this proactive maneuver was eventually granted, but unfavorable weather forced the English fleet to return to port, highlighting the risks of such operations. While the government's caution was initially justified, Drake's emphasis on the importance of timing and disrupting enemy mobilization offered valuable lessons.\n\nThe principle of seeking out and destroying the enemy's fleet became more prominent during the Anglo-Dutch wars of the seventeenth century. In these purely naval conflicts, the focus shifted towards decisive fleet actions. Tromp, a Dutch admiral, recognized the inherent tension between protecting trade and engaging the enemy's main fleet, emphasizing the need for clear strategic priorities. The Cromwellian government's subsequent reforms embraced this principle, establishing a dedicated navy of warships and prioritizing the destruction of enemy naval power over attacks on trade.\n\nThis new doctrine led to significant victories but also revealed its limitations. Overemphasis on fleet actions sometimes neglected the need for sustained control of the sea, as demonstrated by the Dutch raid on Sheerness and Chatham during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. This highlighted the importance of achieving decisive victories, particularly in narrow seas where pursuit and decisive engagement were more challenging. Consequently, naval strategy evolved to focus not just on seeking out the enemy, but on forcing them into battle under favorable conditions. Strategies like disrupting enemy trade far from their coasts were developed to achieve this, foreshadowing tactics that would prove successful in later conflicts.",

    "text": "The evolution of the \"seeking out\" doctrine continued in later conflicts. Charles II conceived a plan to lure the Dutch fleet into battle by feigning a military expedition, highlighting the potential of combined operations. While this specific attempt failed, the concept of using military threats to force a naval engagement remained relevant. Anson attempted a similar strategy during the Seven Years' War, positioning his fleet to intercept the French fleet if they attempted to interfere with a British expedition.  Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, albeit not directly orchestrated through this method, demonstrates a case where a combined expedition indirectly led to a decisive naval engagement. The Battle of Lissa further underscores the complexities of such strategies, where the Italians misjudged the British feint and suffered a defeat.\n\nHistory suggests that enemy attempts to attack British territory or interests have often created opportunities for decisive naval victories.  From La Hogue and Quiberon to the Nile, these instances reinforce the idea that such enemy actions can ultimately play into British hands.  Therefore, \"seeking out\" isn't simply a matter of chasing the enemy fleet, but of maneuvering to achieve favorable conditions for a decisive victory, considering military and political factors. If a military offensive is paramount, naval efforts should support it. However, if the military offensive depends on securing naval control, as in cases where the enemy fleet threatens the army's movement, achieving naval superiority becomes the priority.",

    "text": "Cornwallis's which serves well to mark their attitude. It was one he gave to Admiral Cotton, his second in command, in July 1804 on handing over to his charge the Western Squadron off Ushant: \"If the French put to sea,\" he says, \"without any of your vessels seeing them, do not follow them, unless you are absolutely sure of the course they have taken. If you leave the entrance of the Channel without protection, the enemy might profit by it, and assist the invasion which threatens His Majesty's dominions, the protection of which is your principal object.\" It is indeed a common belief that Nelson never permitted himself but a single purpose, the pursuit of the enemy's fleet, and that, ignoring the caution which Cornwallis impressed upon Cotton, he fell into the simple trap. But it has to be noted that he never suffered himself to be led in pursuit of a fleet away from the position he had been charged to maintain, unless and until he had made that position secure behind him. His famous chase to the West Indies is the case which has led to most misconception on the point from an insufficient regard to the surrounding circumstances. Nelson did not pursue Villeneuve with the sole, or even the primary, object of bringing him to action. His dominant object was to save Jamaica from capture. If it had only been a question of getting contact, he would certainly have felt in a surer position by waiting for Villeneuve's return off St. Vincent or closing in to the strategical centre off Ushant. Further, it must be observed that Nelson by his pursuit did not uncover what it was his duty to defend. The Mediterranean position was rendered quite secure before he ventured on his eccentric movement. Finally, we have the important fact that though the moral effect of Nelson's implacable persistence and rapidity was of priceless value, it is impossible to show that as a mere strategical movement it had any influence on the course of the campaign. His appearance in the West Indies may have saved one or two small islands from ransom and a good deal of trade from capture. It may also have hastened Villeneuve's return by a few days, but that was not to our advantage. Had he returned even a week later there would have been no need to raise the Rochefort blockade. Barham would have had enough ships at his command to preserve the whole of his blockades, as he had intended to do till the Curieux's news of Villeneuve's precipitate return forced his hand before he was ready. If we desire a typical example of the way the old masters used the doctrine of seeking out, it is to be found, not in Nelson's magnificent chase, but in the restrained boldness of Barham's orders to Cornwallis and Calder. Their instructions for seeking out Villeneuve were to move out on his two possible lines of approach for such a time and such a distance as would make decisive action almost certain, and at the same time, if contact were missed, would ensure the preservation of the vital defensive positions. Barham was far too astute to play into Napoleon's hands, and by blindly following his enemy's lead to be jockeyed into sacrificing the position which his enemy wished to secure. If our maxim be suffered to usurp the place of instructed judgment, the almost inevitable result will be that it will lead us into just the kind of mistake which Barham avoided.",

    "section": "II. BLOCKADE",
    "text": "Under the term blockade we include operations which vary widely in character and in strategical intention. In the first place, blockade may be either naval or commercial. By naval blockade we seek either to prevent an enemy's armed force leaving port, or to make certain it shall be brought to action before it can carry out the ulterior purpose for which it puts to sea. That armed force may be purely naval, or it may consist wholly or in part of a military expedition. If it be purely naval, then our blockade is a method of securing command. If it be purely military, it is a method of exercising command, and as such will be dealt with when we come to consider defence against invasion. But in so far as military expeditions are normally accompanied by a naval escort, operations to prevent their sailing are not purely concerned with the exercise of command. Naval blockade, therefore, may be regarded for practical purposes as a method of securing command and as a function of battle-squadrons. Commercial blockade, on the other hand, is essentially a method of exercising command, and is mainly an affair of cruisers. Its immediate object is to stop the flow of the enemy's sea-borne trade, whether carried in his own or neutral bottoms, by denying him the use of trade communications. From the point of view of the conduct of war, therefore, we have two well-defined categories of blockade, naval and commercial. But our classification must go further; for naval blockade itself is equally varied in intention\n\n, and must be subdivided. Strictly speaking, the term implies a desire to close the blockaded port and to prevent the enemy putting to sea. But this was not always the intention. As often as not our wish was that he should put to sea [pg 182] [pg 183] [pg 184] that we might bring him to action, and in order to do this, before he could effect his purpose, we had to watch the port with a fleet more or less closely. For this operation there was no special name. Widely as it differed in object from the other, it was also usually called blockade, and Nelson's protest against the consequent confusion of thought is well known. \"It is not my intention,\" he said, \"to close-watch Toulon\"; and again, \"My system is the very contrary of blockading. Every opportunity has been offered the enemy to put to sea.\" It is desirable, therefore, to adopt terms to distinguish the two forms. \"Close\" and \"open\" express the antithesis suggested by Nelson's letter, and the two terms serve well enough to mark the characteristic feature of each operation. Close blockade, it is true, as formerly conceived, is generally regarded as no longer practicable; but the antithetical ideas, which the two forms of blockade connote, can never be eliminated from strategical consideration. It must always be with the relations of these two forms, whatever shape they may take in future, that the strategy of naval blockade is chiefly concerned. With regard to commercial blockade, in strict analysis it should be eliminated from an inquiry that concerns methods of securing command and postponed to that section of exercising command which deals with the attack and defence of trade. It is, however, necessary to treat certain of its aspects in conjunction with naval blockade for two reasons: one, that as a rule naval blockade is indissolubly united to a subordinate commercial blockade; and the other, that the commercial form, though its immediate object is the exercise of control, has almost invariably an ulterior object which is concerned with securing control; that is to say, while its immediate object was to keep the enemy's commercial ports closed, its ulterior object was to force his fleet to sea. Commercial blockade, therefore, has an intimate relation with naval blockade in its open form. We adopt that form when we wish his fleet to put to sea, and commercial blockade is usually the most effective means we have of forcing upon him the movement we leave him free to attempt. By closing his commercial ports we exercise the highest power of injuring him which the command of the sea can give us. We choke the flow of his national activity afloat in the same way that military occupation of his territory chokes it ashore. He must, therefore, either tamely submit to the worst which a naval defeat can inflict upon him, or he must fight to release himself. He may see fit to choose the one course or the other, but in any case we can do no more by naval means alone to force our will upon him. In the long run a rigorous and uninterrupted blockade is almost sure to exhaust him before it exhausts us, but the end will be far and costly. As a rule, therefore, we have found that where we had a substantial predominance our enemy preferred to submit to commercial blockade in hope that by the chances of war or the development of fresh force he might later on be in a better position to come out into the open. That he should come out and stake the issue in battle was nearly always our wish, and it was obvious that too rigorous a naval blockade was not the way to achieve the desired end, or to reap the strategical result which we might expect from paralysing his commerce. Consequently where the desire for a decision at sea was not crossed by higher military considerations, as in the case of imminent invasion, or where we ourselves had an important expedition in hand, it was to our interest to incline the enemy's mind towards the bolder choice. The means was to tempt him with a prospect of success, either by leading him to believe the blockading force was smaller than it was, or by removing it to such a distance as would induce him to attempt to evade it, or both. A leading case of such an open blockade was Nelson's disposition of his fleet off Cadiz when he was seeking to bring Villeneuve to action in 1805. But merely to leave a port open does not fulfil the idea of open blockade, and in this case to opportunity and temptation Nelson added the pressure of a commercial blockade of the adjacent ports in hope of starving Villeneuve into the necessity of taking to the sea. Finally, in a general comparison of the two forms, we have to observe that close blockade is characteristically a method of securing local and temporary command. Its dominating purpose will usually be to prevent the enemy's fleet acting in a certain area and for a certain purpose. Whereas open blockade, in that it aims at the destruction of an enemy's naval force, is a definite step towards securing permanent command.",

    "text": "Enough has now been said to show that the question of choice between close and open blockade is one of extreme complexity. Our naval literature, it is true, presents the old masters as divided into two schools on the subject, implying that one was in favour of the close form always, and the other of the open form. We are even led to believe that the choice depended on the military spirit of the officer concerned. If his military spirit was high, he chose the close and more exacting form; if it were low, he was content with the open and less exacting form. True, we are told that men of the latter school based their objections to close blockade on the excessive wear and tear of a fleet that it involved, but it is too often suggested that this attitude was no more than a mask for a defective spirit. Seldom if ever are we invited to compare their decisions with the attendant strategical intention, with the risks which the conditions justified, or with the expenditure of energy which the desired result could legitimately demand. Yet all these considerations must enter into the choice, and on closer examination of the [pg 185] [pg 186] [pg 187] leading cases it will be found that they bear a striking and almost constant relation to the nature of the blockade employed. In considering open blockade, three postulates must be kept in mind. Firstly, since our object is to get the enemy to sea, our position must be such as will give him an opportunity of doing so. Secondly, since we desire contact for a decisive battle, that position must be no further away from his port than is compatible with bringing him to action before he can effect his purpose. Thirdly, there is the idea of economy—that is, the idea of adopting the method which is least exhausting to our fleet, and which will best preserve its battle fitness. It is on the last point that the greatest difference of opinion has existed. A close blockade always tended to exhaust a fleet, and always must do so. But, on the other hand, it was contended that the exhaustion is compensated by the high temper and moral domination which the maintenance of a close blockade produces in a good fleet, whereas the comparative ease of distant and secure watch tended to deterioration. Before considering these opposed views, one warning is necessary. It is usually assumed that the alternative to close blockade is watching the enemy from one of our own ports, but this is not essential. What is required is an interior and, if possible, a secret position which will render contact certain; and with modern developments in the means of distant communication, such a position is usually better found at sea than in port. A watching position can in fact be obtained free from the strain of dangerous navigation and incessant liability to attack without sacrifice of sea training. With this very practical point in mind, we may proceed to test the merits of the two forms on abstract principles. It was always obvious that a close naval blockade was one of the weakest and least desirable forms of war. Here again when we say \"weakest\" we do not mean \"least effective,\" but that it was exhausting, and that it tended to occupy a force greater than that against which it was acting. This was not because a blockading fleet, tempered and toughened by its watch, and with great advantage of tactical position, could not be counted on to engage successfully a raw fleet of equal force issuing from port, but because in order to maintain its active efficiency it required large reserves for its relief. So severe was the wear and tear both to men and ships, that even the most strenuous exponents of the system considered that at least a fifth of the force should always be refitting, and in every case two admirals were employed to relieve one another. In 1794 one of the highest authorities in the service considered that to maintain an effective close blockade of Brest two complete sets of flag-officers were necessary, and that no less than one-fourth of the squadron should always be in port.16 Now these weaknesses, being inherent in close blockade, necessarily affected the appreciation of its value. The weight of the objection tended of course to decrease as seamanship, material, or organisation improved, but it was always a factor. It is true also that it seems to have had more weight with some men than with others, but it will appear equally true, if we endeavour to trace the movement of opinion on the subject, that it was far from being the sole determinant. It was in the Seven Years' War under Anson's administration that continuous and close blockade was first used systematically, but it was Hawke who originated it. In the first three campaigns the old system of watching Brest from a British western port had been in vogue, but it had twice failed",

    "text": "To prevent a French concentration in the vital Canadian theatre, in the spring of 1759, Hawke commanded the Channel Fleet with instructions for watching Brest. He proposed remaining off the port instead of returning to Torbay, arguing that preventing the French squadron's sailing was better than pursuing it after departure. This \"close blockade\" proved successful, primarily because the French ceased transatlantic efforts. However, adverse weather occasionally forced the British fleet to revert to an \"open blockade,\" providing the French opportunities to escape southward. While effective against eastward or northward movements, this system's efficacy in transatlantic scenarios was questionable. During the American War of Independence, Howe, despite being a fine officer, favored reverting to open blockade. With the vital theatre across the Atlantic and no invasion threat, and given British naval superiority in the Seven Years' War versus inferiority during the American Revolution, Howe prioritized containing the enemy in home waters rather than closing Brest.  He believed a barely superior squadron could not reliably prevent enemy escape, especially after storms. While the 1805 blockade of Ganteaume seemingly contradicts this, the blockading squadron, though barely superior, possessed ample reserves. Howe's strategy involved open blockade from Spithead or St. Helen's, protecting British trade and harassing the enemy's, while conserving ships and training recruits. Kempenfelt supported this approach, particularly for winter, advocating port-based preparation for the next campaign.  This preference for open blockade aimed at maximizing fleet readiness, prioritizing winter preparation and summer tactical exercises. However, its relative lack of success during the American Revolution stemmed from factors beyond its inherent design: the need to relieve Gibraltar, inadequate winter preparations, and failures to decisively engage the French upon contact. The system's flaw lay in execution, not conception.  Howe continued his system in the subsequent war, prompting the French to put to sea, leading to the Battle of the First of June.  Open blockade continued the following winter, and the French fleet's disastrous January 1795 cruise validated Kempenfelt's predictions. Subsequent French raids on Ireland in 1796, however, drew criticism of Howe's approach.  Unlike the defensive posture of 1800, in 1796, Britain pursued offensive action against French trade and territory to pressure peace negotiations, while also anticipating war with Spain.  Closing Brest would have hindered offensive operations. The home fleet was distributed in three active squadrons (North Sea, Brest, and westward cruising) with a general reserve at Portsmouth for flexibility and training.  This disposition aimed to maintain offensive capability and defensive security, even if it didn't entirely prevent the Irish landings, which were hindered by the disposition and ultimately disrupted by winter weather. By 1800, under St. Vincent, Hawke's close blockade system was revived as Napoleon's rise and the looming invasion threat mirrored the Seven Years' War context. The blockade's intensity increased as the invasion threat grew, with Cornwallis and Gardner enforcing strict control over Brest.  In contrast, Nelson in the Mediterranean did not employ close blockade despite facing a similar invasion threat.  This difference highlights the varied applications of blockade strategies.",

    "text": "[pg 197] [pg 198] to action. Occasional expressions in his letters give colour to such a view, but his dispositions show clearly that his desire to bring the fleet to action was kept in scientific subordination to the defensive duty with which he was charged. Close blockade was the most effectual means of securing this end, but in his case one of the conditions, which we have found always accompanying successful close blockade, was absent. He had no such preponderance of force as would enable him to nourish it up to the point of perfect continuity. In the circumstances the close form was too weak or exhausting for him to use with the force at his disposal. If this case be not considered conclusive as to Nelson's views, we have a perfectly clear endorsement from his pen in 1801. It is a particularly strong testimony, for he was at the time actually charged with defence against the invasion of England. With several cruiser squadrons he had to prevent the enemy's force issuing from a number of ports extending from Flushing to Dieppe, and he was directing the operations from the Downs. On the approach of winter he was impressed with the inexpediency of attempting to continue a close blockade, and wrote to the Admiralty as follows: \"I am of opinion, and submit to their Lordships' better judgment, that care should be taken to keep our squadrons compact and in good order ... under Dungeness to be their principal station.... In fine weather our squadrons to go out and show themselves, but never to risk either being crippled or drawn into the North Sea; thus we shall always be sure of an effective force, ready to act as occasion calls for it.\"18 The case of course is not entirely in point, for it concerns the question of direct resistance to invasion and not to securing general command. Its value is that it gives Nelson's views on the broad question of balancing the risks— that is, the risk of relaxing close watch against the risk of destroying the efficiency of the ships by maintaining it too rigorously. With Nelson holding this view, it is not surprising to find that as late as 1804 naval opinion was not quite settled on the relative advantages of close and open blockade even in the case of threatened invasion. Just a year before Trafalgar was fought, Cornwallis pressed the Admiralty for more strength to enable him to keep his blockade efficient. Lord Melville, who at this time had Barham at his elbow, replied recommending the \"policy of relaxing the strictness of blockade, formerly resorted to.\" He protested the means available were insufficient for \"sustaining the necessary extent of naval force, if your ships are to be torn to pieces by an eternal conflict with the elements during the tempestuous months of winter.\"19 Melville was craving for a decisive action to end the insupportable strain. \"Allow me to remind you,\" he added, \"that the occasions when we have been able to bring our enemy to battle and our fleets to victory have generally been when we were at a distance from the blockading station.\" In the end, as we know, Cornwallis had his way, and the verdict of history has been to approve the decision for its moral effect alone. Such conflicts must always arise. \"War,\" as Wolfe said, \"is an option of difficulties,\" and the choice must sway to the one side or the other as the circumstances tend to develop the respective advantages of each form. We can never say that close blockade is better than open, or the reverse. It must always be a matter of judgment.",

    "text": "Are there, then, no principles which we can deduce from the old practice for the strengthening of judgment? Certain broad lines of guidance at least are to be traced. The main question will be, is it to our advantage, in regard to all the strategical conditions, to keep the enemy in and get him to sea for a decision? Presumably it will always be our policy to get a decision as soon as possible. Still that desire may be overridden by the necessity or special advantage of closely blockading one or more of his squadrons. This situation may arise in two ways. Firstly, it may be essential to provide for the local and temporary command of a certain theatre of operations, as when an invasion threatens in that area, or when we wish to pass a military expedition across it, or from special exigencies in regard to the attack or defence of commerce. Secondly, even where we are seeking a great decision, we may blockade one squadron closely in order to induce a decision at the point most advantageous to ourselves; that is to say, we may blockade one or more squadrons in order to induce the enemy to attempt with one or more other squadrons to break that blockade. In this way we may lead him either to expose himself to be struck in detail, or to concentrate where we desire his concentration. For any of these reasons we may decide that the best way of realising our object is to use close blockade, but the matter does not end there. We have still to consider whether close blockade is within the limit of the force we have available, and whether it is the best method of developing the fullest potentialities of that force. Close blockade being the more exhausting form will require the greater strength; we cannot blockade closely for any length of time without a force relatively superior; but if by open blockade of a squadron we permit it to put to sea with contact assured, we know that, even with a slightly inferior force, we can so deal with it as to prevent its getting local control sufficient to break down our mobile flotilla defence or to interfere seriously with our trade. Finally, there is the question of risk. In the old days, before free movement and wireless telegraphy, and before the flotilla had acquired battle power, there was always to be faced the risk of not getting contact in time to prevent mischief. This consideration was specially dominant where the enemy had a squadron within or near the [pg 199] [pg 200] [pg 201] critical theatre of operations. Therefore when the invasion threatened, our developed policy was to blockade Brest closely at almost any sacrifice. There was always a vague possibility that by evasion or chance of wind a squadron so close to the line of invasion might get sufficient temporary command in the vital area before it could be brought to action. It was a possibility that was never realised in the Narrow Seas, and since mobility of fleets and means of distant communication have so greatly increased in range and certainty, and since the power of resistance in the flotilla has become so high, the risk is probably much less than ever, and the field for open blockade is consequently less restricted.",

    "text": "In dealing with the theory of sea command, attention was called to the error of assuming that if we are unable to win the command we therefore lose it. It was pointed out that this proposition, which is too often implied in strategical discussion, denies in effect that there can be such a thing as strategical defensive at sea, and ignores the fact that the normal condition in war is for the command to be in dispute. Theory and history are at one on the point. Together they affirm that a Power too weak to win command by offensive operations may yet succeed in holding the command in dispute by assuming a general defensive attitude. That such an attitude in itself cannot lead to any positive result at sea goes without saying, but nevertheless even over prolonged periods it can prevent an enemy securing positive results, and so give time for the other belligerent to dominate the situation by securing his ends ashore.\n\nIt is seldom that we have been forced even for a time to adopt such an attitude, but our enemies have done so frequently to our serious annoyance and loss. In the Seven Years' War, for instance, the French by avoiding offensive operations likely to lead to a decision, and confining themselves to active defence, were able for five campaigns to prevent our reducing Canada, which was the object of the war. Had they staked the issue on a great fleet action in the first campaign, and had the result been against them, we could certainly have achieved our object in half the time. In the end, of course, they failed to prevent the conquest, but during all the time the catastrophe was postponed France had abundant opportunity of gaining offensively elsewhere territory which, as she at all events believed, would have compelled us to give up our conquest at the peace. Again, in our last great naval war Napoleon by avoiding general actions was able to keep the command in dispute till by alliances and otherwise he had gathered force which he deemed sufficient to warrant a return to the offensive. Eventually that force proved unequal to the task, yet when it failed and the command passed to his enemy, he had had time to consolidate his power so far that the loss of his fleet seemed scarcely to affect it, and for nine years more he was able to continue the struggle.\n\nSuch examples—and there are many of them—serve to show how serious a matter is naval defence in the hands of a great military Power with other means of offence. They tell us how difficult it is to deal with, and how serious therefore for even the strongest naval Power is the need to give it careful study. And not for this reason only, but also because the strongest naval Power, if faced with a coalition, may find it impossible to exert a drastic offensive anywhere without temporarily reducing its force in certain areas to a point relatively so low as to permit of nothing higher than the defensive. The leading case of such a state of affairs, which we must further consider presently, was our own position in the War of American Independence, when, as we have seen, in order to secure an adequate concentration for offence in the West Indies we were forced to reduce our home fleet to defensive level.\n\nWhat, then, do we mean by naval defence? To arrive at a right answer we must first clear our mind of all confusing shadows cast by the accidents of land defence. Both on land and at sea defence means of course taking certain measures to defer a decision until military or political developments so far redress the balance of strength that we are able to pass to the offensive. In the operations of armies the most usual means employed are the holding of positions and forcing our superior enemy to exhaust his strength in attacking them. Consequently the idea of military defence is dominated by the conception of entrenched positions and fortresses.",

    "text": "In naval warfare this is not so. At sea the main conception is avoiding decisive action by strategical or tactical activity, so as to keep our fleet in being till the situation develops in our favour. In the golden age of our navy the keynote of naval defence was mobility, not rest. The idea was to dispute the control by harassing operations, to exercise control at any place or at any moment as we saw a chance, and to prevent the enemy exercising control in spite of his superiority by continually occupying his attention. The idea of mere resistance was hardly present at all. Everything was counterattack, whether upon the enemy's force or his maritime communications. On land, of course, such methods of defence are also well known, but they belong much more to guerilla warfare than to regular operations. In regular warfare with standing armies, however brilliantly harassing operations and counter-attack are used, the fundamental conception is the defended or defensible position. Similarly at sea, although the essence of defence is mobility and an untiring aggressive spirit rather than rest and resistance, yet there also defended and defensible positions are not excluded. But they are only used in the last resort. A fleet may retire temporarily into waters difficult of access, where it can only be attacked at great risk, or into a fortified base, where it is practically removed from the board and cannot be attacked at all by a fleet alone. But the occasions on which such expedients can be used at sea are far rarer than on land. Indeed except for the most temporary purposes they can scarcely be regarded as admissible at sea, however great their value on land. The reason is simple. A fleet withdrawing to such a position leaves open to the enemy the ulterior object, which is the control of sea communications, whereas on land an army in a good position may even for a prolonged period cover the ulterior object, which is usually territory. An army in position, moreover, is always doing something to exhaust its opponent and redress the unfavourable balance, but a fleet in inactivity is too often permitting the enemy to carry on operations which tend to exhaust the resources of its own country.\n\nFor a maritime Power, then, a naval defensive means nothing but keeping the fleet actively in being-not merely in existence, but in active and vigorous life. No phrase can better express the full significance of the idea than \"A fleet in being,\" if it be rightly understood. Unfortunately it has come to be restricted, by a misunderstanding of the circumstances in which it was first invented, to one special class of defence. We speak of it as though it were essentially a method of defence against invasion, and so miss its fuller meaning. If, however, it be extended to express defence against any kind of maritime attack, whether against territory or sea communications, its broad truth will become apparent, and it will give us the true conception of the idea as held in the British service.",

It is further interesting as a pure case of naval defence, with no ulterior object other than control of home waters. In the minds of the Government there was no apprehension of any definite attempt to invade across the Channel, but the invasion of Ireland was in full progress, and all nourishment of it must be stopped and our own communications kept free. There was, moreover, serious anxiety lest the French should extend their operations to Scotland, and there was Killigrew's homeward-bound convoy approaching. The situation was one that obviously could not be solved effectually except by winning a general command of the sea, but in Torrington's judgment it could be rendered innocuous by holding the command in dispute. His design, therefore, was to act upon the defensive and prevent the enemy achieving any positive result until he was in a position to fight them with a fair chance of victory. A temporary defensive he considered was the only way to win the command, while to hazard a decision in inferior strength was the best way to lose it. Nothing could be in closer harmony with the principles of good strategy as we understand them now. It was undoubtedly in advance of anything that had been done up to that time, and it was little wonder if the Government, as is usually said, failed to appreciate the design. Their rejection of it has come in for very severe criticism. But it would seem that they misunderstood rather than failed to appreciate. The Earl of Nottingham, who was at the head of the Government, believed, as his reply to the admiral clearly shows, that Torrington meant to retire to the Gunfleet at once; whereas it is equally clear to us that the Gunfleet was to be his extreme point, and that he did not mean to retire so far unless the French forced him. The Minister failed, as others have done since, to grasp what the admiral meant by \"A fleet in being.\" He thought that in Torrington's view a fleet safe in port and not in contact with the enemy was \"in being,\" whereas Torrington had no such idea. As Nottingham conceived the admiral's intention he saw that although it might preserve the fleet, it would expose everything else to destruction; that is, he was oppressed with the special characteristic of naval warfare which always permits action against the ulterior object when the enemy denies you any chance of acting against his armed force. Under this misapprehension, which indeed was not justified by the words of Torrington's despatch, he procured from the Queen an order in these terms: \"We apprehend,\" it ran, \"the consequences of your retiring to the Gunfleet to be so fatal, that we choose rather you should upon any advantage of the wind give battle to the enemy than retreat farther than is necessary to get an advantage upon the enemy.\" It was, however, left to his discretion to proceed to the westward to complete his concentration that way, provided, it said, \"you by no means ever lose sight of the French fleet whereby they may have opportunity of making attempts upon the shore or in the rivers of Medway or Thames, or get away without fighting.\" This order has been very hardly dealt with by modern critics, although it clearly contemplates true preventive observation, and even, as the last words suggest, the idea contained in Nelson's well-known saying, \"that by the time the enemy had beat our fleet soundly they would do us no more harm this year.\" It is true that Nelson could rely on the proved superiority of the British at that time unit for unit, but it is also true that Nottingham and his colleagues in the Government had information which led them greatly to underestimate Tourville's strength. This was evident on the face of Nottingham's despatch which covered the order, so evident indeed that Torrington might well perhaps have suspended the execution of an order so obviously based on incorrect information. But knowing probably what intrigues were going on against him at Court, he chose to regard it as a peremptory command to engage whenever he found himself to windward. Much as a more scientific view of naval strategy may admire Torrington's conception, there seems no reason for losing temper over the Government's plan. It was certainly one way of solving the problem, and seeing how large were our reserves, a defeat need not have meant disaster. Still, it was doubtless dictated by an inability to grasp, the strategical strength of Torrington's novel plan, a plan which was not only safer, but was calculated to achieve greater positive results in the end. The real fallacy of the Government's plan was that although it had a specious appearance of a bold offensive, it could have achieved nothing but a negative result. The most a battle could have given in the circumstances could only have left the command in dispute, and the worst would have given the enemy a positive result, which must have gravely compromised William's campaign in Ireland.",

    "text": "On these lines Torrington replied to the Government. Dealing with their anxiety for the ships to the westward and the Mediterranean convoy, whose danger was their expressed reason for forbidding him the Gunfleet, he pointed out that they could not run much hazard if they took care of themselves. For, as he repeated, \"while we observe the French, they cannot make any attempt on ships or shore without running great hazard, and if we are beaten, all is exposed to their mercy.\" Thus without specially noticing the Minister's misinterpretation of his despatch, he intimated that his intention was observation, and not simple retreat. By the time Torrington sent this reply he had been pressed back as far as Beachy Head; it was no longer possible to get to the westward; and the following day, finding himself to windward, he attacked. But still confirmed in his idea of defence, and carrying it on to his tactics, he refused to give the French the chance of a real decision, and disengaged as soon as a drop in the wind permitted. So far he felt justified in interpreting orders which he knew were founded on false information. He was sure, as he said in justification of the way he fought the action, \"that the Queen could not have been prevailed with to sign an order for it, had not both our weakness and the strength of the enemy been disguised to her.\" So severely was his fleet crippled that he believed his plan could no longer act. \"What the consequences of this unfortunate battle may be,\" he wrote in his Journal, \"God Almighty only knows, but this I dare be positive in, had I been left to my liberty I had prevented any attempt upon the land, and secured the western ships, Killigrew, and the merchantmen.\" Actually in all this he was successful. Slowly retiring eastward he drew the French after him as far as Dover before he ran to the Nore; and Tourville was unable to get back to the westward, till all the endangered ships were safe in Plymouth. In spite of Torrington's being forced to fight an action at the wrong time and place, his design had so far succeeded. Not only had he prevented the French doing anything that could affect the issue of the war, but he had completely foiled Tourville's plan of destroying the British fleet in detail. That he had done, but retribution by passing to the offensive was no longer in his power.",

    "text": "That Tourville or his Government was impressed with the efficacy of the method was demonstrated the following year, when he in his turn found himself in an inferiority that denied him hope of a successful battle decision. During the summer he kept his fleet hovering off the mouth of the Channel without giving the British admiral a chance of contact. His method, however, differed from that of Torrington, and he only achieved his negative object by keeping out of sight of his enemy altogether. In his opinion, if a fleet remained at sea in close observation of an active enemy an action could not be avoided. \"If (the admiral),\" he wrote in his memorandum on the subject, \"be ordered to keep the sea to try to amuse the enemy and to let them know we are in a position to attack in case they attempt a descent, I think it my duty to say that in that case we must make up our mind to have to fight them in the end; for if they have really sought an action, they will have been able to fight, seeing that it is impossible to pirouette so long near a fleet without coming to grips.\"20 This is as much as to say that a sure point of temporary retreat is necessary to \"a fleet in being,\" and this was an essential part of Torrington's idea. In Torrington's and Tourville's time, when ships were unhandy and fleet tactics in their infancy, the difficulty of avoiding action, when a determined enemy had once got contact, were undoubtedly great, unless a port of retreat was kept open. But as the art of naval warfare developed, the possibilities of \"a fleet in being\" were regarded as much wider, at least in the British service. It was nearly a hundred years before we were again forced to use the same device on a large scale, and then it was believed that superior speed and tactical precision were factors that could be counted on to an almost unlimited extent. In the darkest days of the War of American Independence we have a memorandum of the subject by Kempenfelt, which not only gives the developed idea of \"a fleet in being\" and the high aggressive spirit that is its essence, but also explains its value, not merely as a defensive expedient, but as a means of permitting a drastic offensive even when you are as a whole inferior. \"When you know the enemy's designs,\" he says, \"in order to do something effectual you must endeavour to be superior to them in some part where they have designs to execute, and where, if they succeed, they would most injure you. If your fleet is divided as to be in all places inferior to the enemy, they will have a fair chance of succeeding everywhere in their attempts. If a squadron cannot be formed sufficient to face the enemy's at home, it would be more advantageous to let your inferiority be still greater in order by it to gain the superiority elsewhere.\" \"When inferior to the enemy, and you have only a squadron of observation to watch and attend upon their motions, such a squadron should be composed of two-decked ships only [that is, ships of the highest mobility] as to assure it purpose. It must have the advantage of the enemy in sailing, else under certain circumstances it will be liable to be forced to battle or to give up some of its heavy sailers. It is highly necessary to have such a flying squadron to hang on the enemy's large fleet, as it will prevent their dividing into separate squadrons for intercepting your trade or spreading their ships for a more extensive view. You will be at hand to profit from any accidental separation or dispersion of their fleet from hard gales, fogs, or other causes. You may intercept supplies, intelligence, &c, sent to them. In fine, such a squadron will be a check and restraint upon their motions, and prevent a good deal of the mischief they might otherwise do.\" Three years before, when first called to be Chief of the Staff in the Channel, he had emphasised the same points. \"Much,\" he wrote in July 1779, \"I may say all, depends upon this fleet. 'Tis an inferior against a superior fleet. Therefore the greatest skill and address is requisite to counteract the designs of the enemy, to watch and seize the favourable opportunity for action, and to catch the advantage of making the effort at some or other feeble part of the enemy's line; or if such opportunities don't offer, to hover near the enemy, keep him at bay, and prevent his attempting anything but at risk and hazard; to command their attention, and oblige them to think of nothing but being on their guard against your attack.\"21 It was on these lines the war was conducted. The West Indian area, in which lay the enemy's principal object, was treated as the offensive theatre and the home waters as the defensive. Inferior as was the Channel fleet to the home fleet of the allies, its defensive operations proved adequate to prevent their achieving any success. Nor was this all, for Kempenfelt was able to demonstrate the positive side of his theory in the most brilliant and convincing manner. In dealing with concentration we have seen how, in command of such a flying squadron as he postulated, he was able off Ushant to seize a favourable opportunity for action, which resulted in his capturing a convoy of military stores essential to the French operations in the West Indies under the nose of De Guichen with an escort of nearly twice his force. Nelson certainly shared Kempenfelt's views as to the possibilities of an inferior fleet kept actively in being. \"As to our fleet,\" he wrote from the Mediterranean in 1796, \"under such a commander-in-chief as Sir John Jervis nobody has any fear ... We are now twenty-two sail of the line. The combined fleet will not be above thirty-five.... I will venture my life Sir John Jervis defeats them. I do not mean by a regular battle, but by the skill of our admiral and the activity and spirit of our officers and seamen. This country is the most favourable possible for that skill with an inferior fleet; for the winds are so variable, that some one time in twenty-four hours you must be able to attack a part of a large fleet, and the other will be becalmed or have a contrary wind. Therefore I hope the Government will not be alarmed for our safety.\" Such a conception of the defensive may indeed be said to have become current in the British service. It was part of the reasoning which in 1805, after Villeneuve's escape from the Mediterranean, decided Sir John Orde to fall back on Ushant instead of entering the Straits. \"I dare believe,\" he wrote, \"Lord Nelson will be found in condition with his twelve of the line and numerous frigates to act on the defensive without loss and even to hang on to the",

    "text": "skirts of the enemy's fleet should it attempt any material service, especially when encumbered with troops.\" In all this consideration of the potentialities of \"a fleet in being\" operating defensively it must never be forgotten that we are dealing with its possibilities in relation to a general command of the sea—to its general power of holding such command in dispute, as Torrington used it. Its power of preventing a particular operation, such as oversea invasion, is another matter, which will always depend upon the local conditions. If the \"fleet in being\" can be contained in such a way that it is impossible for it to reach the invading line of passage, it will be no bar to invasion. In 1690, so far as Torrington's fleet was concerned, the French, had they been so minded, might have made a descent, say, at Portsmouth while Torrington was at the Nore. But Torrington's fleet was not the only factor. His retreat forced Tourville to leave behind him unfought the squadrons of Shovel and Killigrew, and so far as commanding a line of invasion passage was concerned Tourville was himself as well contained as Torrington. The conditions of naval defence against invasion are in fact so complex compared with those of general naval defence that they must be treated later as a special branch of the subject.\n\nThe doctrine of the \"Fleet in being\" as formulated and practised by Torrington and developed by Kempenfelt goes no further than this, that where the enemy regards the general command of a sea area as necessary to his offensive purposes, you may be able to prevent his gaining such command by using your fleet defensively, refusing what Nelson called a regular battle, and seizing every opportunity for a counterstroke. To use it as it was used by the French in the case of Tourville's famous deterrent cruise, where the whole object of the French was offensive and could not be obtained except by offence, is quite another thing. It is indeed difficult to understand the admiration with which his campagne au large has been treated in France. He kept the sea off the mouth of the Channel for fifty days in the summer of 1691, and for forty of those days our Channel fleet was making no systematic effort to seek him out. He had been sent to sea in hope of intercepting our great \"Smyrna convoy,\" which was then the backbone of our oversea trade. Russell with the British main fleet simply took positions to cover its approach until it was safe, knowing presumably that Tourville must come to him if he wished to accomplish his purpose. When the convoy was safe Russell proceeded off Ushant, that is, between the enemy and his base. Tourville's communications were thus cut, his line of retreat threatened, and he seized the first opportunity to elude Russell and to return into port. Beyond taking a few ships from one of the West India convoys, he accomplished nothing. The central French offensive in Ireland was broken at the battle of the Boyne, and the prestige of England at sea was restored. It is true our trade suffered in the North Sea, but this was not directly due to the concentration which Tourville's cruise forced upon us, but rather to the failure of the Dutch—apparently by a misunderstanding-to provide for an effective blockade of Dunkirk.\n\nTo British eyes it will seem that the heresy which was latent in Tourville's instructions was a seed that choked all the finer aspirations of the French navy. In 1691 the plan of his cruise may possibly be defended as sufficiently aggressive, since, seeing how unstable was William's new throne, a resounding blow at British trade, combined with an expected victory in Ireland, might have been enough to upset it. But afterwards the idea was stretched to occasions it would not fit. It seems to have bred a belief that where the object of the war plainly depended on winning a real command of the sea, that object could yet be attained by naval defensive operations. Many times it is true a policy which had starved the navy of France left no other course open to her seamen, and had they in their inferiority attempted the offensive, the end must have been swifter if not more certain. In criticising the maritime history of France we must be careful to distinguish policy from strategy. It was not always the defensive strategy that was bad, but the policy that condemned her admirals to negative operations. Seeing that she was a continental Power with continental aspirations, it was often a policy from which her military exigencies permitted no escape. Nevertheless the policy was twice accursed: it cursed her when she was weak, and cursed her when she was strong. The prolonged use of the defensive bred a habit of mind which seems to have rendered her incapable of striking hard when she had the strength. In no other way at least can we account for the behaviour of so high-spirited a nation when her chance of revenge came in the War of American Independence. It is here in its moral reactions lies the danger of the defensive, a danger so insidious in its working as to tempt us never to utter the word. Yet with the voice of Torrington, Kempenfelt, and Nelson in our ears, it would be folly to ignore it for ourselves, and still more to ignore the exhausting strain its use by our enemy may impose upon us. It must be studied, if for no other reasons than to learn how to break it down. Nor will the study have danger, if only we keep well in view the spirit of restless and vigilant counter-attack which Kempenfelt and Nelson regarded as its essence. True, some of the conditions which in the days of sails made for opportunity have passed away, but many still remain. Shifts of wind and calms will no longer bring them, but weather thick or violent can yet make seamanship, nimbleness, and cohesion tell as it always did; and there is no reason to doubt that it is still possible for hard sea-training to make \"the activity and spirit of our officers and seamen\" give the results which Nelson so confidently expected.",

    "section": "II. Minor Counter-Attacks",
    "text": "For the weaker of two belligerents minor-attack has always exercised a certain fascination. Where a Power was so inferior in naval force that it could scarcely count even on disputing command by fleet operations, there remained a hope of reducing the relative inferiority by putting part of the enemy's force out of action. Such hopes were rarely realised. In 1587 Drake succeeded in stopping the Spanish invasion by such a counter-attack on the Cadiz division of the Armada while it was still unmobilised. In 1667 the Dutch achieved a similar success against our Chatham division when it was demobilised and undefended, and thereby probably secured rather more favourable terms of peace. But it cannot be said that the old wars present any case where the ultimate question of command was seriously affected by a minor counterattack. The advent of the torpedo, however, has given the idea a new importance that cannot be overlooked. The degree of that importance is at present beyond calculation. There is at least no evidence that it would be very high in normal conditions and between ordinarily efficient fleets. The comparative success of the opening Japanese attack on the Port Arthur squadron is the only case in point, and where only one case exists, it is necessary to use extreme caution in estimating its significance. Before we can deduce anything of permanent value we must consider very carefully both its conditions and results.\n\nTo begin with, it was a new experience of a new class of weapon, and it by no means follows that the success of a new expedient will be repeated with anything like equal result. It will not be irrelevant again to recall the case of fireships. At the outset of the sailing era in 1588, this device prepared the way for a decisive success against a fleet in the open. In the succeeding wars the new weapon found a prominent place in the organisation of sea- going fleets, but its success was never repeated. Against ships in ill-defended harbours it did occasionally produce good results, and during the infancy of tactics its moral and even material effects in fleet actions were frequently demonstrated. But as naval science developed and the limitations of the weapon were more accurately measured, it was able to achieve less and less, till in the eighteenth century it was regarded as almost negligible. Even its moral effect was lost, and it ceased to be considered as a battle unit. Now, if we examine closely the Port Arthur case, we shall find it pointing to the existence of certain inherent conditions not dissimilar from those which discredited fireships as a decisive factor in war. In spite of the apparently formidable nature of a surprise attack by torpedo the indications from the one case in point are that these conditions make for greater power in the defence than in the attack. The first condition relates to the difficulty of locating the objective accurately. It is obvious that for this kind of operation the most precise intelligence is essential, and of all intelligence the most difficult to obtain in war is the distribution of an enemy's fleet from day to day. The Japanese had fairly certain information that the bulk of the Port Arthur squadron was lying in the outer anchorage, but it had been constantly moving, and there was a report that three battleships had just been detached from it. The report was false, but the result was that of the five divisions of destroyers which the Japanese had available, two were diverted against Dalny, where no enemy was found. Such uncertainty must always exist, and in no circumstances is it likely to be less than where, as in the Japanese case, the attack is made before declaration, and while the ordinary channels of intelligence are still open. Further, it is to be noted that in spite of the fact that relations for some weeks had been highly strained, and a surprise torpedo attack was regarded as probable, the Russians had taken no precautions to confuse their enemy. It is obvious that measures to prevent accurate locating can, and should, be taken in such cases. We may go further. From confusing the enemy by such means it is but a step to lead him to a wrong conclusion, and to lay for him a trap which may swallow up the bulk of his destroyer force in the first hours of the war. It is to be feared, however, that the risks of such an eventuality are so great in minor counter-attacks of this nature, that it will probably be very difficult to tempt an inferior enemy to expose his flotilla in this way. This view receives emphasis from the second point which the Port Arthur case serves to demonstrate, and that is the great power of even the flimsiest defence against such attacks; in other words, the chances of success can scarcely ever be great enough to justify the risk. Everything was in favour of the Japanese. Orders had been issued in the Russian squadron for two or three nights previously to prepare for a torpedo attack, but so low had discipline fallen, that the orders were obeyed in a very perfunctory manner. Guns were not loaded, their crews were not at quarters, nor were the nets got out. The only real precaution taken was that two destroyers and no more had been sent out as guard patrol, but even they were forbidden to fire on anything they met until they had reported to the admiral or had themselves been fired on. Defence against a surprise attack could scarcely have been more feeble, and yet so high was the nervous tension in the attacking force, that it proved stronger than could reasonably have been expected. The mere existence of the patrol and the necessity of evading it threw the Japanese approach into a confusion from which it was unable to recover entirely, and the attack lost its essential momentum and cohesion. Again, defective as were the arrangements in the squadron itself, and lax as were its training and discipline, no torpedo hits were made, so far as we can judge, after the Russian guns and searchlights got into play. Such development of strength in the defence seems inherent in the conditions of minor attack, and there appears to be no reason for expecting better results for such attacks in normal cases. But in deducing principles from the Port Arthur case, it must always be remembered that it was far from normal. It was a blow before declaration, when the menace of strained relations, though realised, had been almost entirely ignored by the Russians. In such exceptional and almost incredible circumstances a minor attack might always be counted on for a certain measure of success. To this we have to add the fact that the Russian squadron was not ordinarily efficient, but appears to have fallen into a lax condition such as could scarcely recur in the case of any other naval Power. Finally, we must ask what, with every condition abnormally in favour of the attack, was the actual material result? Did it have any real influence on the ultimate question of command? It is true that it so far swung the balance in favour of the Japanese that they were able to exercise the local control long enough to land their troops and isolate Port Arthur. But the Japanese plan for securing ultimate command rested on their power of taking Port Arthur by military operation and sustaining the siege from the sea. Yet in spite of every condition of success the physical effect of the blow was so small, that even without the help of an adequate dockyard the squadron recovered from it and became potent again before the siege could even be formed. The minor attacks which followed the first blow were all failures, and whether delivered at the port or upon the squadron in the open had no appreciable effect whatever. At the same time it must be remembered that since that war the art of torpedo warfare has developed very rapidly. Its range and offensive power have increased in a higher ratio than the means of resisting it. Still those means have advanced, and it is probable that a squadron in a naval port or in a properly defended anchorage is not more easy to injure than it ever was; while a squadron at sea, so long as it constantly shifts its position, still remains very difficult to locate with sufficient precision for successful minor attack. The unproved value of submarines only deepens the mist which overhangs the next naval war. From a strategical point of view we can say no more than that we have to count with a new factor, which gives a new possibility to minor counterattack. It is a possibility which on the whole tells in favour of naval defence, a new card which, skilfully played in combination with defensive fleet operations, may lend fresh importance to the \"Fleet in being.\" It may further be expected that whatever",

    "text": "In methods of exercising command are included all operations not directly concerned with securing command or with preventing its being secured by the enemy. We engage in exercising command whenever we conduct operations which are directed not against the enemy's battle-fleet, but to using sea communications for our own purposes, or to interfering with the enemy's use of them. Such operations, though logically of secondary importance, have always occupied the larger part of naval warfare. Naval warfare does not begin and end with the destruction of the enemy's battle-fleet, nor even with breaking his cruiser power. Beyond all this there is the actual work of preventing his passing an army across the sea and of protecting the passage of our own military expeditions. There is also the obstruction of his trade and the protection of our own. In all such operations we are concerned with the exercise of command. We are using the sea, or interfering with its use by the enemy; we are not endeavouring to secure the use or to prevent the enemy from securing it.\n\nThe two categories of operation differ radically in conception and purpose, and strategically they are on wholly different planes. Logically, of course, operations for exercising command should follow those for securing command; that is to say, that since the attainment of command is the special object of naval warfare, and since that command can only be obtained permanently by the destruction of the enemy's armed forces afloat, it follows that in strictness no other objects should be allowed to interfere with our concentration of effort on the supreme end of securing command by destruction. War, however, is not conducted by logic, and the order of proceeding which logic prescribes cannot always be adhered to in practice. We have seen how, owing to the special conditions of naval warfare, extraneous necessities intrude themselves which make it inevitable that operations for exercising command should accompany as well as follow operations for securing command. War being, as it is, a complex sum of naval, military, political, financial, and moral factors, its actuality can seldom offer to a naval staff a clean slate on which strategical problems can be solved by well-turned syllogisms. The naval factor can never ignore the others. From the outset one or more of them will always call for some act of exercising command which will not wait for its turn in the logical progression. To a greater or less extent in all ordinary cases both categories of operation will have to be put in motion from the beginning.\n\nHence the importance of realising the distinction between the two generic forms of naval activity. In the hurry and stress of war confusion between them is easy. By keeping a firm grip upon the difference we can see at least what we are doing. We can judge how far any given operation that may be called for is a sacrifice of security to exercise, how far such a sacrifice may be justified, and how far the one end may be made to serve the other. By applying the distinction as a test much error may be avoided. The risk we take may be great, but we shall be able to weigh it accurately against the value of the end, and we shall take it with our eyes open and of set purpose. Above all, it will enable the Staff to settle clearly for each squadronal commander what is to be his primary objective, and what the object or purpose of the operations entrusted to him. It is above all in this last consideration, and particularly in the determination of the objective, that lies the main practical value of the distinction. This will become clear the moment we begin to consider defence against invasion, which naturally takes the first place amongst operations for the exercise of control.",

    "text": "Of all the current assumptions, not one is so confusing for the finer adjustments of strategy as that which affirms that the primary objective of our fleet is always the enemy's fleet. Of the battle-fleet and its attendant units it is of course true, so long at least as the enemy has a battle-fleet in being. It is true, that is, of all operations for securing control, but of operations for exercising control it is not true. In the case we have now to consider—defence against invasion—the objective of the special operations is, and always has been, the enemy's army. On this fundamental postulate our plans for resisting invasion have always been constructed from the year of the Armada to 1805.\n\nIn the old service tradition the point was perfectly well established. Admirals' instructions constantly insist on the fact that the transports are the \"principal object.\" The whole disposition of the fleet during Hawke's blockade in 1759 was based on keeping a firm hold on the transports in the Morbihan, and when he sought to extend his operations against the Rochefort squadron, he was sharply reminded by Anson that \"the principal object of attention at this time\" was, firstly, \"the interception of the embarkations of the enemy at Morbihan,\" and secondly, \"the keeping of the ships of war from coming out of Brest.\" Similarly Commodore Warren in 1796, when he had the permanent frigate guard before Brest, issued orders to his captains that in case of encountering enemy's transports under escort they were \"to run them down or destroy them in the most expeditious manner possible previous to attacking the ships of war, but to preserve such a situation as to effect that purpose when directed by signal.\" Lord Keith's orders when watching Napoleon's flotilla were to the same effect. \"Directing your chief attention,\" they run, \"to the destruction of the ships, vessels, or boats having men, horses, or artillery on board (in preference to that of the vessels by which they are protected), and in the strict execution of this important duty losing sight entirely of the possibility of idle censure for avoiding contact with an armed force, because the prevention of debarkation is the object of primary importance to which every other consideration must give way.\"\n\nIn tactics, then, the idea was the same as in strategy. The army was the primary objective round which all dispositions turned. In the French service the strength and soundness of the British practice was understood at least by the best men. When in 1805 Napoleon consulted Ganteaume as to the possibility of the flotilla of transports effecting its passage by evasion, the admiral told him it was impossible, since no weather could avail to relax the British hold sufficiently. \"In former wars,\" he said, \"the English vigilance was miraculous.\"",

    "text": "To this rule there was no exception, not even when circumstances rendered it difficult to distinguish between the enemy's fleet and army as objectives. This situation could occur in two ways. Firstly, when the invading army was designed to sail with the battle-fleet, as in the case of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt; and secondly, when, although the design was that the two should operate on separate lines, our system of defence forced the fleet to come up to the army's line of passage in order to clear it, as happened in the case of the Armada and the French attempt of 1744. In the latter case the invading army, whose objective was unknown, was at Dunkirk, and a French fleet was coming up the Channel to cover the passage. Sir John Norris, in command of the home fleet, was in the Downs. Though his name is now almost forgotten, he was one of the great founders of our naval tradition, and a strategist of the first order. In informing the Government of his plan of operations, he said he intended to proceed with his whole squadron off Dunkirk to prevent the transports sailing. “But,” he says, “if they should unfortunately get out and pass us in the night and go northward, I intend to detach a superior force to endeavour to overtake and destroy them; and with the remainder of my squadron either to fight the French fleet now in the Channel, or observe them and cover the country as our circumstances will admit of; or I shall pursue the embarkation with all my strength.” In this case there had been no time to organise a special squadron or flotilla, in the usual way, to bar the line of passage, and the battle-fleet had to be used for the purpose. This being so, Norris was not going to allow the presence of an enemy’s battle-fleet to entice him away from his grip on the invading army, and so resolutely did he hold to the principle, that he meant if the transports put to sea to direct his offensive against them, while he merely contained the enemy’s battle-fleet by defensive observation. In the Egyptian case there was no distinction between the two objectives at all. Napoleon’s expedition sailed in one mass. Yet in the handling of his fleet Nelson preserved the essential idea. He organised it into three “sub-squadrons,” one of six sail and two of four each. “Two of these sub-squadrons,” says Berry, his flag-captain, “were to attack the ships of war, while the third was to pursue the transports and to sink and destroy as many as it could”; that is, he intended, in order to make sure of Napoleon’s army, to use no more than ten, and possibly only eight, of his own battleships against the eleven of the enemy. Many other examples could be given of British insistence on making the enemy’s army the primary objective and not his fleet in cases of invasion. No point in the old tradition was more firmly established. Its value was of course more strongly marked where the army and the fleet of the enemy endeavoured to act on separate lines of operation; that is, where the army took the real offensive line and the fleet the covering or preventive line, and where consequently for our own fleet there was no confusion between the two objectives. This was the normal case, and the reason it was so is simple enough. It may be stated at once, since it serves to enunciate the general principle upon which our traditional system of defence was based. An invasion of Great Britain must always be an attempt over an uncommanded sea. It may be that our fleet predominates or it may be that it does not, but the command must always be in dispute. If we have gained complete command, no invasion can take place, nor will it be attempted. If we have lost it completely no invasion will be necessary, since, quite apart from the threat of invasion, we must make peace on the best terms we can get.",

    "text": "Now, if the sea be uncommanded, there are obviously two ways in which an invasion may be attempted. Firstly, the enemy may endeavour to force it through our naval defence with transports and fleet in one mass. This was the primitive idea on which the Spanish invasion of Philip the Second was originally planned by his famous admiral, Santa-Cruz. Ripening military science, however, was able to convince him of its weakness. A mass of transports and warships is the most cumbrous and vulnerable engine of war ever known. The weaker the naval defence of the threatened country, the more devoutly will it pray the invader may use this device. Where contact with the enemy’s fleet is certain, and particularly in narrow seas, as it was in this case, such a course will give the defender all the chances he could desire, and success for the invader is inconceivable, provided always we resolutely determine to make the army in its transports our main objective, and are not to be induced to break our head against its escort. Where, however, contact is not certain, the invasion over an uncommanded sea may succeed by evasion of the defender’s battle-fleet, as it did in the case of Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt. But that operation belongs to an entirely different category from that which we are now considering. None of the factors on which the traditional system of British defence is based were present. It was an operation over an open sea against a distant and undetermined objective that had no naval defence of its own, whereas in our own case the determining factors are permanent naval defence, an approximately determined objective, and a narrow sea where evasion by any force of invasion strength is impossible. Napoleon’s exploit was in fact nothing more than the evasion of an open blockade which had no naval defence beyond it. The vital importance of these things will appear as we proceed and note the characteristics which marked every attempt to invade England. From such attempts we of course exclude the various descents upon Ireland, which, not being of invasion strength, fall into another class, to be dealt with hereafter. Since the expedient of forcing an invasion by the strength of a powerful battleship escort has always been rejected as an inadmissible operation, the invader has had no choice but to adopt a separate line for his army, and operate with his fleet in such a way as may promise to prevent the enemy controlling that line. That, in short, is the problem of invasion over an uncommanded sea. In spite of an unbroken record of failure scored at times with naval disaster, continental strategists from Parma to Napoleon have clung obstinately to the belief that there is a solution short of a complete fleet decision. They have tried every conceivable expedient again and again. They have tried it by simple surprise evasion and by evasion through diversion or dispersal of our naval defence. They have tried it by seeking local control through a local naval success prepared by surprise, or by attempting to entice our fleet away from home waters to a sufficient extent to give them temporarily local superiority. But the end has always been the same.",

The covering fleet operates from a distance to draw the enemy away. The defender blockades the army's departure ports or establishes coastal defenses. This reveals the invasion plan's first flaw: the narrower the sea, the easier it is to monitor.  The invader must then arm their transports, prompting the defender to strengthen their defenses with cruisers, requiring the invader to deploy a battle squadron.  The British battle-fleet traditionally positioned itself between the invader's fleet and their invasion base.  To break this hold, the invader must either win a decisive battle or divide their fleet to reinforce the transport escort.  Dividing the fleet is risky, as it weakens both parts and exposes them to defeat in detail. This forces the invader to either commit their entire fleet to the army or abandon the attempt until sea control is achieved. The British system relies on a flotilla blockade, reinforced as needed, and covered by the battle-fleet.  The flotilla's situation dictates the reinforcements and the battle-fleet's actions.",

Parma, the military commander, needed the Spanish fleet to protect his crossing, support the landing, and maintain supply lines. The English, anticipating this, blockaded Parma with a flotilla and squadron.  This forced the Spanish fleet to attempt breaking the blockade, facing unfavorable conditions due to the English fleet's covering position. The English could harass the Spaniards in familiar waters, close to their supplies, culminating in a decisive battle in the confined waters necessary for the army's passage.  The French attempt of 1744 provides a contrasting example of near-complete surprise.  England was vulnerable, with a weakened navy and divided forces. The French planned a winter attack on London, with the army from Dunkirk and the fleet from Brest.  Secrecy was paramount. Dunkirk was secretly rebuilt, transports were chartered covertly, and false intelligence misled the British. Marshal Saxe, however, required an escort for the crossing due to the presence of privateers and cruisers in the Thames. This necessitated detaching a division from the Brest fleet, the fatal flaw mirroring the Spanish Armada scenario.",

News of the Pretender's departure from Rome prompted this action. The British government only learned of the Dunkirk preparations much later.  Mistaking the French transports for the Brest fleet, they ordered Norris to pursue them, a move he protested due to the Brest fleet's presence to the west. This diversion, though historically seen as fortunate, actually hampered Norris's ability to destroy the Brest fleet. Roquefeuil's orders were to engage the British fleet or prevent its concentration while detaching a division to escort the transports to Dunkirk.  This division of the fleet, a recurring consequence of attempting invasion without naval superiority, worried both Roquefeuil and Barraille, who preferred keeping the fleet together until reaching the Isle of Wight.

    "text": "A reconnaissance in thick weather led a commander to believe the enemy fleet was present, causing him to detach a portion of his forces.  Unaware of the enemy's true position, the opposing commander began embarking troops, but bad weather delayed the operation. This delay inadvertently saved the exposed expedition from an imminent attack by fireships and bomb vessels. A similar near-disaster occurred for another squadron. Rumors of enemy movements caused anxiety and a desire for full fleet escort.  Unknowing of the enemy's superior force, the squadron commander moved to support the troop embarkation and was nearly surprised. A calm, followed by a gale, allowed the French to escape, but their transports were destroyed.  This resulted in securing command of home waters for the remainder of the war.  This incident highlights the typical degradation of well-laid invasion plans, forcing clumsy concentrations of the battle fleet and transports, which allowed for an advantageous counterattack by the defending force.  In a subsequent invasion project (1759), a new plan involved launching the army from three dispersed points to avoid a large transport gathering. A concentration of the Brest fleet was planned to support this operation. The defending fleet, facing two potential blockades, employed the strategy of using cruiser squadrons to monitor the dispersed army divisions, ready to pursue them if they escaped, while a flotilla contained the third, immobile division.  This strategy forced the enemy to concentrate their fleet, leading to a decisive naval battle and thwarting the invasion attempt. The small Dunkirk division, though evading detection, achieved little due to its size, and its escort was destroyed after landing troops in Ireland. Thus, another attempted invasion resulted in the loss of the enemy's fleet.",

    "text": "The 1779 invasion project further emphasized these principles, demonstrating their effectiveness even with an inferior home fleet.  The plan involved expeditionary forces at Cherbourg and Havre, to be united at sea under the cover of a combined Spanish and French fleet, aiming to seize Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. Cruiser squadrons and flotillas were deployed to watch the French coasts.  The French outmaneuvered the British by joining the Spanish fleet before the British could reach their station.  Despite the enemy's superior numbers and a large invasion force, the British navy remained confident.  The key was to keep the unwieldy combined fleet at sea and to the westward, exploiting its lack of mobility.  Even with the enemy off the Channel, the British admiral believed a smaller, more agile fleet could harass and prevent the enemy from achieving their objectives.  He intended to take station west of Scilly to protect trade and engage the enemy if they entered the Channel.  Later, needing supplies, he sailed not to Plymouth but to St. Helen's, a move criticized at the time but consistent with prioritizing the invading army. This positioning prevented invasion until the fleet was defeated.  The allies attempted to bring the British to battle but were forced to return to Brest without achieving anything.  The British defensive strategy, focused on forcing the enemy fleet to escort the transports, proved effective. Even if the allies could have returned, the British could have continued their defense with increasing advantage as winter approached.  The Great War projects followed similar patterns, exploring various invasion schemes.  Napoleon initially considered a stealthy crossing in flat boats, but this was abandoned for a more complex plan involving multiple departure points and a planned naval concentration.",

    "text": "across in flat-boats, he was met with the usual flotilla defence. Then came his only new idea, which was to arm his transport flotilla to the point of giving it power to force a passage for itself. We replied by strengthening our flotilla. Convinced by experiment that his scheme was now impracticable, he set his mind on breaking the blockade by the sudden intrusion of a flying squadron from a distance. To this end various plausible schemes were worked out, but plan after plan melted in his hand, till he was forced to face the inevitable necessity of bringing an overwhelming battle force up to his transports. The experience of two centuries had taught him nothing. By a more distant concentration than had ever been attempted before he believed he could break the fatal hold of his enemy. The only result was so severely to exhaust his fleet that it never could get within reach of the real difficulties of its task, a task which every admiral in his service knew to be beyond the strength of the Imperial Navy. Nor did Napoleon even approach a solution of the problem he had set himself— invasion over an uncommanded sea. With our impregnable flotilla hold covered by an automatic concentration of battle-squadrons off Ushant, his army could never even have put forth, unless he had inflicted upon our covering fleet such a defeat as would have given him command of the sea, and with absolute control of the sea the passage of an army presents no difficulties. Of the working of these principles under modern conditions we have no example. The acquisition of free movement must necessarily modify their application, and since the advent of steam there have been only two invasions over uncommanded seas—that of the Crimea in 1854, and that of Manchuria in 1904—and neither of these cases is in point, for in neither was there any attempt at naval defence. Still there seems no reason to believe that such defence applied in the old manner would be less effective than formerly. The flotilla was its basis, and since the introduction of the torpedo the power of the flotilla has greatly increased. Its real and moral effect against transports must certainly be greater than ever, and the power of squadrons to break a flotilla blockade is more restricted. Mines, again, tell almost entirely in favour of defence, so much so indeed as to render a rapid coup de main against any important port almost an impossibility. In the absence of all experience it is to such theoretical considerations we must turn for light. Theoretically stated, the success of our old system of defence depended on four relations. Firstly, there is the relation between the rapidity with which an invasion force could be mobilised and embarked, and the rapidity with which restlessness in foreign ports and places d'armes could be reported; that is to say, the chance of surprise and evasion are as the speed of preparation to the speed of intelligence. Secondly, there is the relation of the speed of convoys to the speed of cruisers and flotilla; that is to say, our ability to get contact with a convoy after it has put to sea and before the expedition can be disembarked is as the speed of our cruisers and flotilla to the speed of the convoy. Thirdly, there is the relation between the destructive power of modern cruisers and flotillas against a convoy unescorted or weakly escorted and the corresponding power in sailing days. Fourthly, there is the relation between the speed of convoys and the speed of battle-squadrons, which is of importance where the enemy's transports are likely to be strongly escorted. On this relation depends the facility with which the battle-squadron covering our mobile defence can secure an interior position from which it may strike either the enemy's battle-squadron if it moves or his convoy before it can complete its passage and effect the landing. All these relations appear to have been modified by modern developments in favour of the defence. In the first ratio, that of speed of mobilisation to speed of intelligence, it is obviously so. Although military mobilisation may be still relatively as rapid as the mobilisation of fleets, yet intelligence has outstripped both. This is true both for gaining and for conveying intelligence. Preparations for oversea invasion were never easy to conceal, owing to the disturbance of the flow of shipping that they caused. Elaborate precautions were taken to prevent commercial leakage of intelligence, but they never entirely succeeded. Yet formerly, in the condition of comparative crudeness with which international trade was then organised, concealment was relatively easy, at least for a time. But the ever-growing sensitiveness of world-wide commerce, when market movements are reported from hour to hour instead of from week to week, has greatly increased the difficulty. And apart from the rapidity with which information may be gathered through this alert and intimate sympathy between Exchanges, there is the still more important fact that with wireless the speed of conveying naval intelligence has increased in a far higher ratio than the speed of sea transit. As regards the ratio between cruiser and convoy speeds, on which evasion so much depends, it is the same. In frigate days the ratio appears to have been not more than seven to five. Now in the case at any rate of large convoys it would be nearly double. Of the destructive power of the flotilla, growing as it does from year to year, enough has been said already. With the advent of the torpedo and submarine it has probably increased tenfold. In a lesser degree the same is true of cruisers. In former days the physical power of a cruiser to injure a dispersing convoy was comparatively low, owing to her relatively low excess of speed and the restricted range and destructive power of her guns. With higher speed and higher energy and range in gun power the ability of cruisers to cut up a convoy renders its practical annihilation almost certain if once it be caught, and consequently affords a moral deterrent against trusting to evasion beyond anything that was known before. The increased ratio of battle-fleet speed to that of large convoys is equally indisputable and no less important, for the facility of finding interior positions which it implies goes to the root of the old system. So long as our battle- fleet is in a position whence it can cover our flotilla blockade or strike the enemy's convoy in transit, it forces his battle-fleet in the last resort to close up on the convoy, and that, as Kempenfelt pointed out, is practically fatal to the success of invasion.",

    "section": "II. Attack and Defence of Trade",
    "text": "The base idea of the attack and defence of trade may be summed up in the old adage, \"Where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.\" The most fertile areas always attracted the strongest attack, and therefore required the strongest defence; and between the fertile and the infertile areas it was possible to draw a line which for strategical purposes was definite and constant. The fertile areas were the terminals of departure and destination where trade tends to be crowded, and in a secondary degree the focal points where, owing to the conformation of the land, trade tends to converge. The infertile areas were the great routes which passed through the focal points and connected the terminal areas. Consequently attack on commerce tends to take one of two forms. It may be terminal or it may be pelagic, terminal attack being the more profitable, but demanding the greater force and risk, and pelagic attack being the more uncertain, but involving less force and risk. These considerations lead us directly to the paradox which underlies the unbroken failure of our enemies to exercise decisive pressure upon us by operations against our trade. It is that where attack is most to be feared, there defence is easiest. A plan of war which has the destruction of trade for its primary object implies in the party using it an inferiority at sea. Had he superiority, his object would be to convert that superiority to a working command by battle or blockade. Except, therefore, in the rare cases where the opposed forces are equal, we must assume that the belligerent who makes commerce destruction his primary object will have to deal with a superior fleet. Now, it is true that the difficulty of defending trade lies mainly in the extent of sea it covers. But, on the other hand, the areas in which it tends to congregate, and in which alone it is seriously vulnerable, are few and narrow, and can be easily occupied if we are in superior force. Beyond those areas effective occupation is impossible, but so also is effective attack. Hence the controlling fact of war on commerce, that facility of attack means facility of defence. Beside this fundamental principle we must place another that is scarcely less important. Owing to the general common nature of sea communications, attack and defence of trade are so intimately connected that the one operation is almost indistinguishable from the other. Both ideas are satisfied by occupying the common communications. The strongest form of attack is the occupation of the enemy's terminals, and the establishment of a commercial blockade of the ports they contain. But as this operation usually requires the blockade of an adjacent naval port, it also constitutes, as a rule, a defensive disposition for our own trade, even when the enemy's terminal area does not overlap one of our own. In the occupation of focal areas the two ideas are even more inseparable, since most, if not all, such areas are on lines of communication that are common. It will suffice, therefore, to deal with the general aspect of the subject from the point of view of defence. It was in conformity with the distinction between fertile and infertile areas that our old system of trade defence was developed. Broadly speaking, that system was to hold the terminals in strength, and in important cases the focal points as well. By means of a battle-squadron with a full complement of cruisers they were constituted defended areas, or \"tracts\" as the old term was, and the trade was regarded as safe when it entered them. The intervening trade-routes were left as a rule undefended. Thus our home terminals were held by two battle- squadrons, the Western Squadron at the mouth of the Channel, and the North Sea or Eastern Squadron with its headquarters usually in the Downs. To these was added a cruiser squadron on the Irish station based at Cork, which was sometimes subordinate to the Western Squadron and sometimes an independent organisation. The area of the Western Squadron in the French wars extended, as we have seen, over the whole Bay of Biscay, with the double function, so far as commerce was concerned, of preventing the issue of raiding squadrons from the enemy's ports, and acting offensively against his Atlantic trade. That of the North Sea squadron extended to the mouth of the Baltic and the north-about passage. Its main function during the great naval coalitions against us was to check the operations of Dutch squadrons or to prevent the intrusion of French ones north-about against our Baltic trade. Like the Western Squadron, it threw out divisions usually located at Yarmouth and Leith for the protection of our coastwise trade from privateers and sporadic cruisers acting from ports within the defended area. Similarly, between the Downs and the Western Squadron was usually one or more smaller squadrons, mainly cruisers, and generally located about Havre and the Channel Islands, which served the same purpose for the Norman and North Breton ports. To complete the system there were flotilla patrols acting under the port admirals and doing their best to police the routes of the coastwise and local traffic, which then had an importance long since lost. The home system of course differed at different times, but it was always on these general lines. The naval defence was supplemented by defended ports of refuge, the principal ones being on the coast of Ireland to shelter the ocean trade, but others in great numbers were provided within the defended areas against the operations of privateers, and the ruins of batteries all round the British shores testify how complete was the organisation. A similar system prevailed in the colonial areas, but there the naval defence consisted normally of cruiser squadrons stiffened with one or two ships-of-the-line mainly for the purpose of carrying the flag. They were only occupied by battle-squadrons when the enemy threatened operations with a similar force. The minor or interior defence against local privateers was to a large extent local; that is, the great part of the flotilla was furnished by sloops built or hired on the spot, as being best adapted for the service. Focal points were not then so numerous as they have become since the development of the Far Eastern trade. The most important of them, the Straits of Gibraltar, was treated as a defended area. From the point of view of commerce-protection it was held by the Mediterranean squadron. By keeping watch on Toulon that squadron covered not only the Straits, but also the focal points within the sea. It too had its extended divisions, sometimes as many as four, one about the approaches to Leghorn, one in the Adriatic, a third at Malta, and the fourth at Gibraltar. In cases of war with Spain the latter was very strong, so as to secure the focal area against Cartagena and Cadiz. On one occasion indeed, in 1804-5, as we have seen, it was constituted for a short time an independent area with a special squadron. But in any case the Gibraltar area had its own internal flotilla guard under the direction of the port admiral as a defence against local privateers and pirates. The general theory of these defended terminal and focal areas, it will be seen, was to hold in force those waters which converging trade made most fertile, and which therefore furnished an adequate field for the operations of raiding squadrons. In spite of the elaborate defensive system, such squadrons might, and sometimes did, intrude by surprise or stealth, and were then able to set at defiance both convoy escorts and the cruiser outposts. But, as experience proved, the system of terminal defence by battle-squadrons made it impossible for such raiding squadrons to remain long enough on the ground to cause any serious interruption or to do serious harm.

    "text": "The traditional system of commerce protection relied on a network of defended areas connected by undefended routes.  Defended areas, like ports and coastal regions, were secured by a superior fleet, ensuring local control.  The open ocean routes were not patrolled but relied on the convoy system. Merchant ships were grouped and provided with escorts, theoretically cruisers, to protect against sporadic attacks. Often, ships-of-the-line returning from or deploying to distant stations provided supplementary escort, creating an economical system integrated with foreign reliefs. Dedicated battle units were assigned for convoy duty only when necessary, such as when valuable convoys were threatened or enemy ships-of-the-line were at large.  This method was a corollary to the defended areas concept.  Enemies, attracted to the resource-rich defended areas, were less likely to deploy squadrons to the less valuable open routes. However, the convoy system had weaknesses. Convoys themselves could attract enemy squadrons, negating the routes' assumed safety. While enemy ports were within our defended areas and under surveillance, the possibility of a squadron escaping remained, forcing a response and potentially disrupting our dispositions. The Trafalgar campaign exemplifies this, where the escape of the Toulon squadron temporarily broke our defended chain and forced a concentration of the Western Squadron, even though this jeopardized the protection of approaching East and West Indies convoys.  This vulnerability to disruption was the convoy system's biggest strategic flaw, mitigated somewhat by assigning secret routes to convoys when squadronal interference was suspected. Modern advancements have significantly altered the conditions of commerce protection, making historical deductions less reliable. Key changes include the abolition of privateering, reduced warship ranges, and the development of wireless telegraphy.",

    "section": "Impact of Modern Developments",
    "text": "Privateering significantly impacted commerce warfare in the past.  A large number of captured vessels, often numbering in the hundreds or thousands, were attributed to privateers.  Smaller privateers operating near their bases, disrupting coastal and local traffic, inflicted significant damage, particularly in the West Indies and home waters.  While the actual losses might not have been substantial, the psychological impact was considerable, forcing governments to divert resources to counter them. This disrupted larger strategic arrangements as small privateers exploited gaps in the protective system.  Suppressing them required deploying numerous small cruisers, detracting from larger strategic efforts. The proximity of enemy ports facilitated privateer escapes, making suppression ineffective. This situation resembled a people's war, where traditional strategic methods proved inadequate, similar to Napoleon's struggles against Spanish guerillas or British difficulties in South Africa. Abolishing privateering has seemingly removed this disruptive element. However, the Declaration of Paris might be circumvented by commissioning merchant vessels as warships.  This practice likely won't extend beyond larger privately owned vessels, and any attempt to revive large-scale privateering would effectively repudiate international law.  Furthermore, conditions favoring this type of warfare no longer exist in home waters. In the past, trade concentrated in the Thames, with distribution handled by small coastal vessels, vulnerable to short-range privateers. With multiple distribution centers and inland transport, the Channel is no longer the sole artery, mitigating this vulnerability. This simplification of the problem allows for a more strategic approach to commerce protection, favoring defense over attack. The reduced range of warships is another important change.  Previously, ships could cruise for six months with occasional resupply, enjoying unrestricted movement.  Modern warships have shorter ranges, limiting them to brief operations within defended areas or extended voyages to undefended waters with limited cruising time.  High-speed chases quickly deplete fuel, forcing returns, dependent on precarious prize refueling.  Manning prizes reduces speed and jeopardizes return through defended areas.  Sinking prizes, while an option, carries moral baggage and practical difficulties, especially with larger ships, as destruction takes time and reduces evasion chances. This limits operations on major trade routes, rendering the notion of cruisers \"infesting\" these routes hyperbolic.  Maintaining such a presence would require a massive fleet, achievable only by nations with clear naval superiority.",

    "section": "Wireless Telegraphy and its Impact",
    "text": "Wireless telegraphy has drastically altered the dynamics of commerce protection. Cruisers can no longer linger in productive areas, as attacking a single wireless-equipped merchantman risks alerting adversaries.  Once a cruiser's location is known, nearby ships can be warned, forcing the cruiser to relocate frequently, further reducing its endurance. These developments make pelagic operations more difficult and uncertain, challenging the old system's basis – the convoy system.  The added security offered by convoys might no longer outweigh their economic disadvantages and strategic liabilities.  Several factors further enhance trade security by allowing more route choices. Steamships aren't restricted to specific wind-driven courses, improved navigation reduces reliance on established landfalls, and multiple distribution ports have diversified trade flows, making attacks more challenging. These factors, combined with the practical difficulties of sporadic operations, make evading enemy cruisers easier for individual vessels and lessen the need for escorts. The significant increase in transoceanic trade since 1815, coupled with the unlikelihood of a proportionate increase in enemy cruiser strength, further diminishes the value of convoys. The potential damage to trade depends largely on the ratio of enemy cruiser strength to trade volume. This leads to a broader question about the relationship between trade volume and the difficulty of defending it. The old defense system included a final element beyond defended areas and undefended routes. While frigates were \"on cruise,\" they weren't patrolling the routes randomly.  They formed a vital part of the system, operating in the fertile region where routes converged outside the defended areas. This region attracted enemy cruisers and large privateers and posed the greatest risk to convoys nearing terminals. Powerful cruiser groups and even battleship divisions were deployed from defended areas to meet and reinforce incoming convoys' escorts. Outward-bound convoys received similar reinforcement until clear of the danger zone. This system, regularly used for both home and colonial areas, wasn't route patrolling, but an outpost system, extending defended areas and reinforcing convoys during high-risk periods. Less vital focal points were protected by smaller, more economical forces.  This outer defensive layer, crucial for the system's effectiveness, was seamlessly integrated with the inner defended areas.",

This seemingly sound conclusion rests on two questionable assumptions: a nation's vulnerability is directly proportional to its trade volume, and the difficulty of defending trade is also proportional to its volume, suggesting naval strength should be compared to trade volume.

    "text": "The effectiveness of trade warfare depends on inflicting enough damage to force the enemy to accept peace terms. The pressure must be insupportable, significantly impacting finance or national activities. A small percentage of trade destruction has little effect, while a larger percentage can significantly influence the war's outcome. Vulnerability is measured by the percentage of destruction achievable. A cruiser's destructive power is limited by its capacity to handle prizes, a limitation further restricted by modern developments.  Given the low capacity and high trade volume, the limit of destructive power against a well-defended nation is relatively low, likely below historically sustainable levels. Thus, vulnerability is inversely proportional to trade volume. The strain of trade defence is related not to volume, but to the number and exposure of terminals and focal points.  The required defence force depends on the enemy's base distribution and naval strength.",

    "text": "The War of 1812 exemplifies the relation of trade defence to terminal areas. Increased exposure of the West Indies and North America to both the US and French fleets necessitated a disproportionate increase in our protective force despite unchanged trade volume. The Far East presents a changed problem due to increased terminal areas, requiring eastward extension of defended areas, absorbing more force and prolonging the chain of concentrations. While minor hostile bases within defended areas pose less threat to trade directly, they can disrupt defence as torpedo bases, requiring more complex arrangements. The principle of defended areas remains valid, needing adaptation to new tactical possibilities. Modern material developments favor defence over attack. Two key rules emerge: trade vulnerability is inversely proportional to volume, and facility of attack means facility of defence, particularly given modern developments. Facility of attack, requiring speed and endurance, comes at the cost of armor/armament or increased size, both hindering numbers and therefore facilitating defence.",

    "text": "The attack and defence of oversea expeditions are governed in a large measure by the principles of attack and defence of trade. In both cases it is a question of control of communications, and in a general way it may be said, if we control them for the one purpose, we control them for the other. But with combined expeditions freedom of passage is not the only consideration. The duties of the fleet do not end with the protection of the troops during transit, as in the case of convoys, unless indeed, as with convoys, the destination is a friendly country. In the normal case of a hostile destination, where resistance is to be expected from the commencement of the operations, the fleet is charged with further duties of a most exacting kind. They may be described generally as duties of support, and it is the intrusion of these duties which distinguish the naval arrangements for combined operations most sharply from those for the protection of trade. Except for this consideration there need be no difference in the method of defence. In each case the strength required would be measured by the dangers of interference in transit. But as it is, that standard will not serve for combined expeditions; for however small those risks, the protective arrangements must be sufficiently extensive to include arrangements for support.\n\nBefore dealing with this, the most complex aspect of the question, it will be well to dismiss attack. From the strategical point of view its principles differ not at all from those already laid down for active resistance of invasion. Whether the expedition that threatens us be small or of invasion strength, the cardinal rule has always been that the transports and not the escort must be the primary objective of the fleet. The escort, according to the old practice, must be turned or contained, but never treated as a primary objective unless both turning and containing prove to be impracticable. It is needless to repeat the words of the old masters in which this principle lies embalmed. It is seldom that we find a rule of naval strategy laid down in precise technical terms, but this one is an exception. In the old squadronal instructions, \"The transports of the enemy are to be your principal object,\" became something like a common form. Nor did this rule apply only to cases where the transports were protected by a mere escort. It held good even in the exceptional cases where the military force was accompanied or guarded by the whole available battle strength of the enemy. We have seen how in 1744 Norris was prepared to follow the French transports if necessary with his whole force, and how in 1798 Nelson organised his fleet in such a way as to contain rather than destroy the enemy's battle-squadron, so that he might provide for an overwhelming attack upon the transports. Exceptions to this as to all strategical rules may be conceived. Conditions might exist in which, if the enemy's battle-fleet accompanied his transports, it would be worth our while, for ulterior objects of our own, to risk the escape of the transports in order to seize the opportunity of destroying the fleet. But even in such a case the distinction would be little more than academical; for our best chance of securing a decisive tactical advantage against the enemy's fleet would usually be to compel it to conform to our movements by threatening an attack on the transports. It is well known that it is in the embarrassment arising from the presence of transports that lies the special weakness of a fleet in charge of them.",

    "text": "There is, however, one condition which radically differentiates comparatively small expeditions from great invasions and that is the power of evasion. Our experience has proved beyond dispute that the navy alone cannot guarantee defence against such expeditions. It cannot be sure of preventing their sailing or of attacking them in transit, and this is especially the case where an open sea gives them a free choice of route, as in the case of the French expeditions against Ireland. It is for this reason that, although an adequate navy has always proved sufficient to prevent an invasion, for defence against expeditions it must be supplemented by a home army. To perfect our defence, or, in other words, our power of attack, such an army must be adequate to ensure that all expeditions small enough to evade the fleet shall do no effective harm when they land. If in numbers, training, organisation, and distribution it is adequate for this purpose, an enemy cannot hope to affect the issue of the war except by raising his expeditions to invasion strength, and so finding himself involved in a problem that no one has ever yet solved for an uncommanded sea. Still, even for expeditions below invasion strength the navy will only regard the army as a second line, and its strategy must provide in the event of evasion for co-operation with that line. By means of a just distribution of its coastal flotilla it will provide for getting contact with the expedition at the earliest moment after its destination is declared. It will press the principle of making the army its objective to the utmost limit by the most powerful and energetic cruiser pursuit, and with wireless and the increased ratio of cruiser speed, such pursuit is far more formidable than it ever was. No expedition nowadays, however successful its evasion, can be guaranteed against naval interruption in the process of landing. Still less can it be guaranteed against naval interference in its rear or flanks while it is securing its front against the home army. It may seek by using large transports to reduce their number and secure higher speed, but while that will raise its chance of evasion, it will prolong the critical period of landing. If it seek by using smaller transports to quicken disembarkation, that will decrease its chances of evasion by lowering its speed and widening the sea area it will occupy in transit. All the modern developments in fact which make for defence in case of invasion over an uncommanded sea also go to facilitate timely contact with an expedition seeking to operate by evasion. Nor must it be forgotten, since the problem is a combined one, that the corresponding developments ashore tell with little less force in favour of the defending army. Such appear to be the broad principles which govern an enemy's attempts to act with combined expeditions in our own waters, where by hypothesis we are in sufficient naval strength to deny him permanent local command. We may now turn to the larger and more complex question of the conduct of such expeditions where the naval conditions are reversed.",

    "text": "…or, as in the case of our attack on St. Malo in 1758, took up a position between the enemy's squadron and the expedition's line of operation. If, however, the theatre of operation was not within a terminal area, or lay within a distant one that was weakly held, the expedition was given its own covering squadron, in which the local squadron was more or less completely merged. Whatever, in fact, was necessary to secure the local control was done, though, as we have seen, and must presently consider more fully, this necessity was not always the standard by which the strength of the covering squadron was measured.\n\nThe strength of the covering squadron being determined, the next question is the position or \"tract\" which it should occupy. Like most other strategical problems, it is \"an option of difficulties.\" In so far as the squadron is designed for support—that is, support from its men, boats, and guns—it will be desirable to station it as near as possible to the objective; but as a covering squadron, with the duty of preventing the intrusion of an enemy's force, it should be as far away as possible, so as to engage such a force at the earliest possible moment of its attempt to interfere. There is also the paramount necessity that its position must be such that favourable contact with the enemy is certain if he tries to interrupt. Usually such certainty is only to be found either in touch with the enemy's naval base or in touch with your own landing force. Where the objective is the local naval base of the enemy these two points, of course, tend to be identical strategically, and the position of the covering squadron becomes a tactical rather than a strategical question. But the vital principle of an independent existence holds good, and no matter how great the necessity of support, the covering squadron should never be so deeply engaged with the landing force as to be unable to disentangle itself for action as a purely naval unit in time to discharge its naval function. In other words, it must always be able to act in the same way as a free field army covering a siege.\n\nWhere the objective of the expedition is not the local naval base, the choice of a position for the covering squadron will turn mainly on the amount of support which the army is likely to require. If it cannot act by surprise, and serious military resistance is consequently to be expected, or where the coast defences are too strong for the transport squadron to overpower, then the scale will incline to a position close to the army, though the extent to which, under modern conditions, ships at sea can usefully perform the delicate operation of supporting an infantry attack with gun fire, except by enfilading the enemy's position, remains to be proved. A similar choice will be indicated where strong support of men and boats is required, as when a sufficiency of flat-boats and steam towage cannot be provided by the transports and their attendant squadron; or again where the locality is such that amphibious operations beyond the actual landing are likely to be called for, and the assistance of a large number of boats and seamen acting with the army is necessary to give it the amphibious tactical mobility which it would otherwise lack. Such cases occurred at Quebec in 1759, where Saunders took his covering battle-squadron right up the St. Lawrence, although its covering functions could have been discharged even better by a position several hundreds of miles away from the objective; and again in 1800 at Alexandria, where Lord Keith ran the extremest hazard to his covering functions in order to undertake the supply of General Abercromby's army by inland waters and give him the mobility he required.",

    "text": "If, on the other hand, the transport squadron is able to furnish all the support necessary, the covering squadron will take station as close as possible to the enemy's naval base, and there it will operate according to the ordinary laws of blockade. If nothing is desired but to prevent interference, its guard will take the form of a close blockade. But if there be a subsidiary purpose of using the expedition as a means of forcing the enemy to sea, the open form will be employed; as, for instance, in Anson's case above cited, when he covered the St. Malo expedition not by closely blockading Brest, but by taking a position to the eastward at the Isle de Batz.\n\nIn the Japanese operations against Manchuria and the Kuantung Peninsula these old principles displayed themselves in undiminished vitality. In the surprise descents against Seoul and at Takusan the work of support was left entirely with the transport squadron, while Admiral Togo took up a covering position far away at Port Arthur. The two elements of the fleet were kept separate all through. But in the operations for the isolation and subsequent siege of Port Arthur they were so closely united as to appear frequently indistinguishable. Still, so far as the closeness of the landing place to the objective permitted, the two acted independently. For the actual landing of the Second Army the boats of the covering squadron were used, but it remained a live naval unit all through, and was never organically mingled with the transport squadron. Its operations throughout were, so far as modern conditions permit, on the lines of a close blockade. To prevent interference was its paramount function, undisturbed, so far as we are able to judge, by any subsidiary purpose of bringing the enemy to decisive action. All through the operations, however, there was a new influence which tended to confuse the precision of the old methods. Needless to say it was the torpedo and the mine. Their deflective pressure was curious and interesting.",

    "text": "In our own operations against Sebastopol, to which the Port Arthur case is most closely comparable, the old rules still held good. On the traditional principle, dating from Drake's attack on San Domingo in 1585, a landing place was chosen which gave the mean between facility for a coup de main and freedom from opposition; that is, it was chosen at the nearest practicable point to the objective which was undefended by batteries and out of reach of the enemy's main army. In the handling of the covering squadron Admiral Dundas, the Commander-in-Chief, gave it its dual function. After explaining the constitution of the transport squadron he says, \"The remainder of my force ... will act as a covering squadron, and where practicable assist in the general disembarkation.\" With these two objects in mind he took a station near enough to the landing place to support the army with his guns if it were opposed, but still in sight of his cruisers before Sebastopol, and at such a distance that at the first sign of the Russians moving he would have time to get before the port and engage them before they could get well to sea; that is, he took a position as near to the army as was compatible with preventing interference, or, it may be said, his position was as near to the enemy's base as was compatible with supporting the landing. From either aspect in fact the position was the same, and its choice presented no complexity owing mainly to the fact that for the first time steam simplified the factors of time and distance. In the Japanese case the application of these principles was not so easy. In selecting the nearest undefended point for a landing, it was not only batteries, or even the army in Port Arthur, or the troops dispersed in the Liaotung Peninsula that had to be considered, but rather, as must always be the case in the future, mines and mobile torpedo defence. The point they chose was the nearest practicable bay that was unmined. It was not strictly out of mobile defence range, but it so happened that it lay behind islands which lent themselves to the creation of fixed defences, and thus it fulfilled all the recognised conditions. But in so far as the defences could be turned by the Russian fleet a covering squadron was necessary, and the difficulty of choosing a position for it was complicated by the fact that the objective of the combined operations was not merely Port Arthur itself, but also the squadron it contained. It was necessary, therefore, not only to hold off that squadron, but to prevent its escape. This indicated a close blockade. But for close blockade a position out of night torpedo range is necessary, and the nearest point where such a position could be secured was behind the defences that covered the disembarkation. Consequently, in spite of what the strategical conditions dictated, the covering squadron was more or less continuously forced back upon the army and its supporting force, even when the support of the battle-squadron was no longer required. In the conditions that existed nothing was lost. For the lines of the Japanese fixed defences were so near to the enemy's base, that by mining the entrance of the port Admiral Togo ensured that the enemy's exit would be slow enough for him to be certain of getting contact from his defended anchorage before the Russians could get far to sea. What would happen in a case when no such position could be secured is another matter. The landing place and supply base of the army must be secured against torpedo attack, and the principle of concentration of effort would suggest that the means of defence should not be attenuated by providing the covering squadron with a defended anchorage elsewhere. Thus it would appear that unless the geographical conditions permit the covering squadron to use one of its own national bases, the drift of recent developments will be to force it back on the army, and thus tend to confuse its duties with those of the transport squadron. Hence the increased importance of keeping clear the difference in function between the two squadrons.",

    "text": "To emphasise the principle of the covering squadron, these two cases may be contrasted with the Lissa episode at the end of the Austro-Italian War of 1866. In that case it was entirely neglected, with disastrous results. The Austrian admiral, Tegethoff, with an inferior fleet had by higher order been acting throughout on the defensive, and was still in Pola waiting for a chance of a counter-stroke. Persano with the superior Italian fleet was at Ancona, where he practically dominated the Adriatic. In July the Italians, owing to the failure of the army, were confronted with the prospect of being forced to make peace on unfavourable terms. To improve the position Persano was ordered to take possession of the Austrian island of Lissa. Without any attempt to organise his fleet on the orthodox British principle he proceeded to conduct the operation with his entire force. Practically the whole of it became involved in amphibious work, and as soon as Persano was thus committed, Tegethoff put to sea and surprised him. Persano was unable to disentangle a sufficient force in time to meet the attack, and having no compact squadron fit for independent naval action, he was decisively defeated by the inferior enemy. According to British practice, it was clearly a case where, if the operation were to be undertaken at all, an independent covering squadron should have been told off either to hold Tegethoff in Pola or to bring him to timely action, according to whether the island or the Austrian fleet was the primary objective. The reason it was not done may be that Persano was not given a proper landing force, and he seems to have considered that the whole strength of his fleet was needed for the successful seizure of the objective. If so, it is only one more proof of the rule that no matter what fleet support the landing operations may require, it should never be given in an imperfectly commanded sea to an extent which will deny the possibility of a covering squadron being left free for independent naval action. The length to which the supporting functions of the fleet may be carried will always be a delicate question. The suggestion that its strength must be affected by the need of the army for the men of the fleet or its boats, which imply its men as well, will appear heretical. A battle-squadron, we say, is intended to deal with the enemy's battle- squadron and its men to fight the ships, and the mind revolts at the idea of the strength of a squadron being fixed by any other standard. Theoretically nothing can seem more true, but it is an idea of peace and the study. The atmosphere of war engendered a wider and more practical view. The men of the old wars knew that when a squadron is attached to a combined expedition it is something different from a purely naval unit. They knew, moreover, that an army acting oversea against hostile territory is an incomplete organism incapable of striking its blow in the most effective manner without the assistance of the men of the fleet. It was the office, then, of the naval portion of the force not only to defend the striking part of the organism, but to complete its deficiencies and lend it the power to strike. Alone and unaided the army cannot depend on getting itself ashore, it cannot supply itself, it cannot secure its retreat, nor can it avail itself of the highest advantages of an amphibious force, the sudden shift of base or line of operation. These things the fleet must do for it, and it must do them with its men.",

The frigates to blockade.\" (Meaning, of course, to blockade the objective and prevent reinforcements reaching it from the mainland, always one of the supporting functions of the squadron attached to the transports.) \"The line-of-battle ships,\" he adds, \"to furnish us with the number of men necessary for land operations.\" In this case our permanent blockading squadrons supplied the cover, and what Maitland meant was that the battleships he asked for were to be added to the transport squadron not as being required for escort, but for support. St. Vincent, who was then First Lord, not only endorsed his request, but gave him for disembarkation work one more ship-of-the-line than he had asked for. At this time our general command of the sea had been very fully secured, and we had plenty of naval force to spare for its exercise.

    "text": "the expedition under Admiral Christian and General Abercromby was being prepared for the West Indies, the admiral in concert with Jervis drew up a memorandum as to the naval force required.26 The force he asked for was considerable. Both he and Jervis considered that the escort and local cover must be very strong, because it was impossible to count on closing either Brest or Toulon effectually by blockade. But this was not the only reason. The plan of operations involved three distinct landings, and each would require at least two of the line, and perhaps three, \"not only as protection, but as the means by which flat-boats must be manned, cannon landed, and the other necessary services of fatigue executed.\" Christian also required the necessary frigates and three or four brigs \"to cover [that is, support] the operations of the smaller vessels [that is, the landing flotillas doing inshore work].\" The main attack would require at least four of the line and seven frigates, with brigs and schooners in proportion. In all he considered, the ships-of-the-line [the frigates being \"otherwise employed\"] would have to provide landing parties to the number of 2000 men \"for the flat-boats, landing and moving guns, water, and provisions,\" and this would be their daily task. The military force these landing parties were to serve amounted to about 18,000 men. Lord Barham, it must be said, who as Sir Charles Middleton was then First Sea Lord, objected to the requirements as excessive, particularly in the demand for a strong escort, as he considered that the transit could be safeguarded by special vigilance on the part of the permanent blockading squadrons. The need for large shore parties he seems to have ignored. His opinion, however, is not quite convincing, for from the first he had taken up an antagonistic attitude to the whole idea of the expedition. He regarded the policy which dictated it as radically unsound, and was naturally anxious to restrict the force that was to be spent upon it. His opposition was based on the broad and far-sighted principles that were characteristic of his strategy. He believed that in view of the threatening attitude of Spain the right course was to husband the navy so as to bring it up to a two-Power standard for the coming struggle, and to keep it concentrated for decisive naval action the moment Spain showed her hand. In short, he stoutly condemned a policy which entailed a serious dissipation of naval force for a secondary object before a working command of the sea had been secured. It was, in fact, the arrangements for this expedition which forced him to resign before the preparations were complete. But it is to be observed that his objections to the plan were really due, not to the principle of its organisation, but to our having insufficient force to give it adequate naval support without prejudicing the higher consideration of our whole position at sea.27",

    "text": "It is obvious that the foregoing considerations, beyond the strategical reactions already noted, will have another of the first importance, in that they must influence the choice of a landing place. The interest of the army will always be to fix it as near to the objective as is compatible with an unopposed landing. The ideal was one night's march, but this could rarely be attained except in the case of very small expeditions, which could be landed rapidly at the close of day and advance in the dark. In larger expeditions, the aim was to effect the landing far enough from the objective to prevent the garrison of the place or the enemy's local forces offering opposition before a footing was secured. The tendency of the navy will usually be in the opposite direction; for normally the further they can land the army away from the enemy's strength, the surer are they of being able to protect it against naval interference. Their ideal will be a place far enough away to be out of torpedo range, and to enable them to work the covering and the transport squadron in sound strategical independence. To reduce these divergencies to a mean of efficiency some kind of joint Staff is necessary, and to ensure its smooth working it is no less desirable to ascertain, so far as possible, the principles and method on which it should proceed. In the best recent precedents the process has been for the Army Staff to present the limits of coast-line within which the landing must take place for the operation to have the desired effect, and to indicate the known practicable landing points in the order they would prefer them. It will then be for the Naval Staff to say how nearly in accordance with the views of the army they are prepared to act. Their decision will turn on the difficulties of protection and the essentials of a landing place from the point of view of weather, currents, beach and the like, and also in a secondary measure upon the extent to which the conformation of the coast will permit of tactical support by gun-fire and feints. If the Naval Staff are unwilling to agree to the point or points their colleagues most desire, a question of balance of risk is set up, which the higher Joint Staff must adjust. It will be the duty of the Naval Staff to set out frankly and clearly all the sea risks the proposal of the army entails, and if possible to suggest an alternative by which the risk of naval interference can be lessened without laying too heavy a burden on the army. Balancing these risks against those stated by the army, the superior Staff must decide which line is to be taken, and each service then will do its best to minimise the difficulties it has to face.",

    "text": "Whether the superior Staff will incline to the naval or the military view will depend upon whether the greater danger likely to be incurred is from the sea or on land. Where the naval conditions are fairly well known the line of operations can be fixed in this way with much precision. But if, as usually happens, the probable action of the enemy at sea cannot be divined with sufficient approximation, then assuming there is serious possibility of naval interference, the final choice within the limited area must be left to the admiral. The practice has been to give him instructions which define in order of merit the points the army desire, and direct him to select the one which in the circumstances, as he finds them, he considers within reasonable risk of war. Similarly, if the danger of naval interference be small and the local conditions ashore imperfectly known, the final choice will be with the general, subject only to the practicable possibilities of the landing place he would choose. During the best period of our old wars there was seldom any difficulty in making things work smoothly on these lines. After the first inglorious failure at Rochefort in 1757 the practice was, where discretion of this kind had been allowed, for the two commanders-in-chief to make a joint coast-reconnaissance in the same boat and settle the matter amicably on the spot. It was on these lines the conduct of our combined operations was always arranged thenceforth. Since the elder Pitt's time it has never been our practice to place combined expeditions under either a naval or a military commander-in-chief and allow him to decide between naval and military exigencies. The danger of possible friction between two commanders-in-chief came to be regarded as small compared with the danger of a single one making mistakes through unfamiliarity with the limitations of the service to which he does not belong. The system has usually worked well even when questions arose which were essentially questions for a joint superior Staff. The exceptions indeed are very few. A fine example of how such difficulties can be settled, when the spirit is willing, occurred in the Crimea. The naval difficulties, as we have already seen, were as formidable as they could well be short of rendering the whole attempt madness. When it came to the point of execution a joint council of war was held, at which sat the allied Staffs of both services. So great were the differences of opinion between the French and British Generals, and so imperfectly was the terrain known, that they could not indicate a landing place with any precision. All the admirals knew was that it must be on an open coast, which they had not been able to reconnoitre, where the weather might at any time interrupt communications with the shore, and where they were liable to be attacked by a force which, until their own ships were cleared of troops, would not be inferior. All these objections they laid before the Council General. Lord Raglan then said the army now perfectly understood the risk, and was prepared to take it. Whereupon the allied admirals replied that they were ready to proceed and do their best to set the army ashore and support it at any point that should be chosen. There remains a form of support which has not yet been considered, and that is diversionary movements or feints by the fleet to draw the enemy's attention away from the landing place. This will naturally be a function of the covering battle-squadron or its attendant cruisers and flotilla. The device appears in Drake's attack on San Domingo in 1585, an attack which may be regarded as our earliest precedent in modern times and as the pattern to which all subsequent operations of the kind conformed so far as circumstances allowed. In that case, while Drake landed the troops a night's march from the place, the bulk of the fleet moved before it, kept it in alarm all night, and at dawn made a demonstration with the boats of forcing a direct landing under cover of its guns. The result was the garrison moved out to meet the threat and were surprised in flank by the real landing force.",

    "text": "Passing from this simple case to the most elaborate in our annals, we find Saunders doing the same thing at Quebec. In preparation for Wolfe's night landing he made a show of arrangements for a bombardment of Montcalm's lines below the city, and in the morning with the boats of the fleet began a demonstration of landing his marines. By this device he held Montcalm away from Wolfe's landing place till a secure footing had been obtained. Similar demonstrations had been made above the city, and the combined result was that Wolfe was able to penetrate the centre of the French position unopposed. Such work belongs of course to the region of tactics rather than of strategy, but the device has been used with equal effect strategically. So great is the secrecy as well as the mobility of an amphibious force, that it is extremely difficult for an enemy to distinguish a real attack from a feint. Even at the last moment, when a landing is actually in progress, it is impossible for the defenders to tell that all the troops are being landed at the one point if a demonstration is going on elsewhere. At Quebec it was not till Montcalm was face to face with Wolfe that he knew he had to deal with the whole British force. Still less from a strategical point of view can we be certain whether a particular landing represents an advance guard or is a diversionary operation to mask a larger landing elsewhere. This is a special difficulty when in the case of large operations the landing army arrives in echelon like the Second Japanese army. In that instance the naval feint was used strategically, and apparently with conspicuous effect. The Russians were always apprehensive that the Japanese would strike for Newchuang at the head of the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, and for this reason General Stakelberg, who had command of the troops in the peninsula, was not permitted to concentrate for effective action in its southern part, where the Japanese had fixed their landing place. Admiral Togo, in spite of the strain on his fleet in effecting and securing the disembarkation of the army, detached a cruiser squadron to demonstrate in the Gulf. The precise effect of this feint upon the Russian Staff cannot be measured with certainty. All we know is that Stakelberg was held back from his concentration so long that he was unable to strike the Japanese army before it was complete for the field and able to deal him a staggering counter-stroke. This power of disturbing the enemy with feints is of course inherent in the peculiar attributes of combined expeditions, in the facility with which their line of operation can be concealed or changed, and there seems no reason why in the future it should be less than in the past. Good railway connections in the theatre of the descent will of course diminish the effect of feints, but, on the other hand, the means of making them have increased. In mine-sweeping vessels, for instance, there is a new instrument which in the Russo-Japanese War proved capable of creating a very strong impression at small cost to the fleet. Should a flotilla of such craft appear at any practicable part of a threatened coast and make a show of clearing it, it will be almost a moral impossibility to ignore the demonstration. On the whole then, assuming the old methods are followed, it would seem that with a reasonable naval preponderance the power of carrying out such operations over an uncommanded sea is not less than it has proved to be hitherto. The rapidity and precision of steam propulsion perhaps places that power higher than ever. It would at any rate be difficult to find in the past a parallel to the brilliant movement on Seoul with which the Japanese opened the war in 1904. It is true the Russians at the last moment decided for political reasons to permit the occupation to take place without opposition, but this was unknown to the Japanese, and their arrangements were made on the assumption that their enemy would use the formidable means at his disposal to obstruct the operation. The risk was accepted, skillfully measured, and adequately provided for on principles identical with those of the British tradition. But, on the other hand, there has been nothing to show that where the enemy has a working command of the sea the hazard of such enterprises has been reduced. Against an enemy controlling the line of passage in force, the well-tried methods of covering and protecting an oversea expedition will no more work to-day than they did in the past. Until his hold is broken by purely naval action, combined work remains beyond all legitimate risk of war.",

    "text": "The study for officers is the art of war, specialising in Naval Strategy. The true method of procedure then is to get hold of a general theory of war, and so ascertain the exact relations of Naval Strategy to the whole. War is a form of political intercourse, a continuation of foreign politics which begins when force is introduced to attain our ends. OBJECTS. We seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be ulterior or immediate. Immediate objects (also called \"Primary\") are the ends of particular operations or movements. But it must be remembered that every primary object has also its ulterior object; that is, every operation must be regarded, not only from the point of view of its special object, but also as a step to the end of the campaign or war. Strategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view. Classified by the object it is Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor Strategy, with primary objects. This also means that every operation of an army or fleet must be regarded in a double light, i.e., it must be planned and conducted in relation (1) to the general progress of the war; (2) to the object to which it is immediately directed. Major Strategy (always regarding the ulterior object) has for its province the plan of the war, and includes: (1) Selection of the immediate or primary objects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object; (2) Selection of the force to be used, i.e., it determines the relative functions of the naval and military forces. NOTE.—Major Strategy in its broadest sense has also to deal with the whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship. It regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled together; they are instruments of war. But it also has to keep in view constantly the politico-diplomatic position of the country (on which depends the effective action of the instrument), and its commercial and financial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is maintained). The friction of these two considerations is inherent in war, and we call it the deflection of strategy by politics. It is usually regarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every strategical problem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question of grand strategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and vice versa. For a line of action or an object which is expedient from the point of view of strategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and vice versa. To decide a question of grand strategy without consideration of its diplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither strategy or diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This interaction has to be accepted by commanding officers as part of the inevitable \"friction of war.\" A good example is Pitt's refusal to send a fleet into the Baltic to assist Frederick the Great during the Seven Years War, for fear of compromising our relations with the Scandinavian Powers.",

NOTE.—Naval Strategy, being only a part of General Strategy, is subject to the same friction as Major Strategy, though in a less degree. Individual commanders have often to take a decision independently of the central government, or headquarters; they should, therefore, always keep in mind the possible ulterior effects of any line of action they may take, endeavouring to be sure that what is strategically expedient is not diplomatically inexpedient.

    "section": "Nature of object. Offensive and defensive.",
    "text": "The solution of every strategical problem, whether of Major or Minor Strategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in view. All objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative. A positive object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for ourselves. A negative object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent his gaining something. Where the object is positive, Strategy is offensive. Where the object is negative, Strategy is defensive. EXAMPLE.—When Togo attacked Rojesvensky his primary object was offensive, i.e., to capture or destroy the Russian Fleet. His ulterior object was to maintain the defensive function which had been assigned to the Japanese Fleet. NOTES.—This is a good example of true defensive; that is, Togo's operations, though drastically offensive in action, were all strictly within the strategical defensive sphere assigned to him. The Offensive, being positive in its aim is naturally the more effective form of war (i.e., it leads more directly to a final decision), and, as a rule, should be adopted by the stronger Power. The Defensive, being negative in its aim, is naturally the stronger form of war; i.e., it requires less force, and, as a rule, is adopted by the weaker Power. NOTE.—The general truth of this proposition is not affected by apparent exceptions where the contrary appears to be true. The Offensive must not be confused with the Initiative. It is possible to seize the Initiative, under certain conditions, by taking a defensive position from which the enemy is bound to dislodge us or abandon the operation. In most cases where the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive, it is due to his doing so before the enemy's mobilization or concentration is complete, whereby the attacking force is able to deal in succession with locally inferior forces of the enemy. The advantages of the Offensive are well known. Its disadvantages are:— (1) That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its communications. (2) That it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground. (3) That it continually increases the difficulty of retreat. The advantages of Defence are chiefly:— (1) Proximity to base. (2) Familiar ground. (3) Facility for arranging surprise by counter attack. NOTE.—In modern Naval warfare these advantages—that is, the advantages of fighting on your own ground—are specially high as giving greater facility for the use of mine and torpedo.",

    "text": "The disadvantages are mainly moral or when the enemy's objective or line of operations cannot be ascertained, but this disadvantage can be neutralised when it is possible to secure an interior position. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEFENSIVE. True Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike. NOTE.—When the Dutch burnt our ships at Chatham, we were not acting on the defensive, we had laid them up and were doing nothing at all. The strength and the essence of the defensive is the counter-stroke. A well designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack. A general defensive policy may consist of a series of minor offensive operations. The maxim is: If you are not relatively strong enough to assume the offensive, assume the defensive till you become so— (1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or otherwise; (2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or securing allies. Except as a preparation or a cover for offensive action the defensive is seldom or never of any use; for by the defensive alone we can never acquire anything, we can only prevent the enemy acquiring. But where we are too weak to assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive, and wait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and permitting us to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's; we then pass to the offensive, for which our defensive has been a preparation. As a cover or support for the offensive, the defensive will enable us to intensify the attack; for by assuming the defensive in one or more minor theatres of operation we can reduce our forces in those theatres to a minimum, and concentrate to a maximum for the offensive in the most important theatre. OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS USED WITH A DEFENSIVE INTENTION (A) Counter attacks. (B) Diversions. (A) Counter attacks are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes himself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this form of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the \"surprise advantage of defence.\" (B) Diversions are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside the limit of his theatre of offensive operations. Diversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention, and to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they should divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be small. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less likely they are to divert a force greater than their own. It is only their power of diverting or containing a larger force than their own that justifies the breach of the law of concentration which they involve. This power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities are most highly developed in combined expeditions.",

They have a positive object, i.e., they aim to acquire something from the enemy; whereas diversions have a negative object, i.e., they aim at preventing the enemy doing or acquiring something. Being in the category of the weaker form of war, eccentric attacks are usually made in greater force than diversions. EXAMPLES.—Diversion.—Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force, about 4,000 men. Object, according to official instructions, \"a diversion on the coasts of United States of America in favour of the army employed in the defence of Canada\"; i.e., the intention was negative— preventative—defensive. 2. Eccentric Attack.—Operations against New Orleans in 1815. Intended force 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, \"to obtain command of embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to occupy some important and valuable possession, by the restoration of which the conditions of peace might be improved, &c.\"; i.e., the intention was positive—to acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) and Belleisle (eccentric attack) in the Seven Years War. Note 2.—This distinction gives a threefold classification of combined expeditions, as used by Elizabethan strategists. Raids = Diversions. Incursions = Eccentric attacks. Invasions = True direct offence. Compare these with Sir John Ardagh's classification (Report of Royal Commission on Reserve Forces, 1904):— \"Raids,\" not exceeding 10,000 men. \"Small expeditions,\" not exceeding 50,000 men. \"Dangerous invasion,\" not exceeding 150,000 men.",

(1) War with limited object (\"limited war\") is where we merely seek to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions, or interests; e.g., Spanish-American War, where the object was the liberation of Cuba. (2) War with an unlimited object is where we seek to overthrow the enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must agree to do our will (become subservient); e.g., Franco-German War. NOTE.—Ulterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as the immediate (primary or secondary) objects which lead up to them; e.g., ulterior objects may be offensive, while one or more of the immediate objects may be defensive, and vice versâ. EXAMPLE 1.—Japanese position in the late war. Ulterior object of the war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive (positive). Function or ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was defensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack and destroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive). EXAMPLE 2.—In the Spanish-American War the ulterior object of the war was (for the Americans) to eject the Spanish Government from Cuba. This was offensive. The ulterior object of the fleet was to prevent the Spaniards sending reinforcements or interfering with the intended American invasion. This was defensive. The primary object of the fleet was to bring the Spanish Fleet to action. This was offensive.",

    "text": "Consequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be defensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another. Where the operations are defensive in character any special movement or movements may be offensive. OBJECTIVE Limited and unlimited wars. An objective is \"any point or force against which an offensive movement is directed.\" Thus where the object in any theatre of operation is to get command of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet will usually be the objective. LINES OF OPERATION A line of operation is \"the area of land or sea through which we operate from our base or starting point to reach our objectives.\" Lines of operation may be exterior or interior. We are said to hold the interior lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of operations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more quickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a position is called an interior position. \"Exterior Lines\" and \"Exterior Position\" are the converse of these. LINES OF COMMUNICATION This expression is used of three different things:— (1) Lines of supply, running from the base of operations to the point which the operating force has reached. (2) Lines of lateral communication by which several forces engaged in one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to each other's support. (3) Lines of retreat, which are lines of supply reversed, i.e., leading back to the base. These three ideas are best described by the term \"lines of passage and communication,\" which we had in use at the end of the eighteenth century. Ashore, lines of passage and communication are roads, railways, waterways, &c. At sea, they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the normal course of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the force to be supplied. In Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of communication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on communications, but probably it does so even more than Land Strategy, as will appear from a consideration of maritime communications, and the extent to which they are the main preoccupation of Naval operations. MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS The various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet may have to operate are:— (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond to the communications of armies operating ashore). These tend to increase in importance strategically with the increasing hunger of modern fleets (for coal, ammunition, &c). (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea base, that is communication between the advanced and the main base. (3) Trade Routes, that is the communications upon which depend the national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the \"lateral\" or connecting communications between various parts of belligerents' possessions. N.B.—Such \"lines of passage and communication\" are the preoccupation of Naval Strategy; that is to say, problems of Naval Strategy can be reduced to terms of \"passage and communication\" and this is probably the best method of solving them.",

    "section": "Naval Strategy as Passage and Communication",
    "text": "NAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A QUESTION OF PASSAGE AND COMMUNICATION By \"Naval Strategy\" we mean the art of conducting the operations of the Fleet. Such operations must always have for their object \"passage and communication\"; that is, the Fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own communications and seizing those of the enemy. PROOF I.—Deductive.—We say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command of the sea. What does this mean? It is something quite different from the Military idea of occupying territory, for the sea cannot be the subject of political dominion or ownership. We cannot subsist upon it (like an army on conquered territory), nor can we exclude neutrals from it. Admiral Colomb's theory of \"conquest of water territory,\" therefore, involves a false analogy, and is not safe as the basis of a strategical system. What then is the value of the sea in the political system of the world? Its value is as a means of communication between States and parts of States. Therefore the \"command of the sea\" means the control of communications in which the belligerents are adversely concerned. COROLLARY.—The command of the sea can never be, like the conquest of territory, the ulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime war, as were approximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century, but it may be a primary or immediate object, and even the ulterior object of particular operations. PROOF II.—Inductive, from history or past experience.—History shows that the actual functions of the Fleet (except in purely maritime wars) have been threefold. 1. The prevention or securing of alliances (i.e., deterring or persuading neutrals as to participating in the war). EXAMPLES.—The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the alliance of the Kingdom of Naples. In the first case there came a crisis when it was more important to demonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining Louis XIV than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the second, the Neapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not. 2. The protection or destruction of commerce. 3. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore. NOTE.—The above is the best working \"Definition of Naval Strategy,\" as emphasising its intimate connection with diplomatic, financial, and military aspects of major strategy. These functions may be discharged in two ways:— (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed (bombardment, landing, raiding parties, &c). (2) By getting command of the sea, i.e., establishing ourselves in such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against their territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours. NOTE.—The power of the second method, by controlling communications, is out of all proportion to the first—direct attack. Indeed, the first can seldom be performed with any serious effect without the second. Thus, from this point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is mainly a question of communications. But not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the Fleet must discharge part of its function by direct action before there is time to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and military considerations may deflect normal operation of Naval Strategy.) EXAMPLE.—Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the unshaken Toulon Fleet. Japanese invasion of Manchuria.",

    "section": "Command of the Sea and Blockade",
    "text": "COMMAND OF THE SEA Command of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command of the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we have (a) adequate Naval positions; (b) an adequate Fleet to secure the command when war breaks out. VARIOUS CONDITIONS OF COMMAND 1. It may be (a) general; (b) local. (a) General command is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act dangerously against our line of passage and communication or to defend his own, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere seriously with our trade or our military or diplomatic operations. This condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send squadrons to sea. NOTE.—Command of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do absolutely nothing, but that he cannot seriously interfere with the undertakings by which we seek to secure the object of the war, or to force our will upon him. (b) Local command implies a state of things in which we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in one or more theatres of operation. 2. Both local and general command may be (a) temporary; (b) permanent. (a) Temporary command is when we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in all or some theatres of operation during the period required for gaining the object in view (i.e., the object of a particular operation or of a particular campaign). This condition existed after Togo's first action. (b) Permanent command is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the situation, i.e., when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his maritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This condition existed after Tsushima. 3. Command, whether general, local, or temporary, may be in three different states:— (a) With us. (b) With the enemy. (c) In dispute. If in dispute, it may be that:— (1) We have preponderance. (2) Our enemy has preponderance. (3) Neither side preponderates. COMMAND IN DISPUTE The state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it is the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and frequently all through it. The state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, i.e., till one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea. It is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of dispute by seeking a decision. Hence the French tradition to avoid decisive actions as a rule when at war with England. The truth of this appears from the fact that general command of the sea is not essential to all oversea operations. In a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate in one theatre of operations, and so secure the local or temporary command sufficient for obtaining the special object in view. The weaker Power may take advantage of such local concentration to operate safely elsewhere. Rule 1. So long as a state of dispute can force the preponderating Power to concentrate, operating by evasion is possibly open to the weaker. Rule 2. In a state of dispute although the weaker Power may not be able to obstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able to defend its own. EXAMPLES.—This condition of dispute existed during the first three years of the Seven Years War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a decision by defeating Conflans and De la Cloue; also in the Great War up to Trafalgar. SHOULD COMMAND OF THE SEA ALWAYS BE THE PRIMARY OBJECT? When the preponderating Power fails or neglects to get command (i.e., leaves the general command in dispute), the disadvantage to him is not so much the danger to his own operations as the facility given to the enemy for carrying out counter operations elsewhere. Under certain conditions, therefore, it may not be the primary function of the fleet to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it, because general command may be in dispute while local command may be with us, and political or military considerations may demand of us an operation, for which such local command is sufficient, and which cannot be delayed until we have obtained a complete decision. From the above it will appear \"command of the sea\" is too loose an expression for strategical discussion. For practical purposes should be substituted \"control of passage and communication.\" The question then in the consideration of any proposed operation or line of operations will be, not \"Have we the command of the sea?\" but \"Can we secure the necessary lines of communication from obstruction by the enemy?\"",

    "section": "Methods of Securing Control and Blockade",
    "text": "METHODS OF SECURING CONTROL 1. Permanent general control can only be secured by the practical annihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions. 2. Local and temporary control may be secured by:— (a) A defensive action not necessarily entirely successful (containing). (b) Forcing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion). (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing). (d) Blockade. BLOCKADE Blockades are of two natures, according to the object review. The object may be:— i. Close blockade to prevent the enemy putting to sea. The object being usually to secure local or temporary control. ii. Observation blockade, to force the enemy to put to sea by occupying the common lines of communications (see below). In this case you are seeking a decision as a step towards general control. Both natures are operations upon the lines of passage and communication, but in case (1) the primary intention is defensive, to secure our own line; in case (2) the primary intention is offensive, to seize the enemy's line and compel him to expose himself in an attempt to recover it. GENERAL RULES FOR CONDUCTING BLOCKADES In case (1) (defensive intention) blockade should be as close as is compatible with security from torpedo attack. In case (2) (offensive intention) it should be as distant as is compatible with bringing enemy to action if he comes out. Examples:—Case (1): First stage of Togo's blockade of Port Arthur. Case (2): Nelson off Toulon. Confusion of the two: Sampson's attempt to close Santiago simultaneously with an attempt to force Cervera to sea. THE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS Since the whole idea of command of the sea and the whole theory of blockade rest on the control of communications, neither can be fully apprehended without a thorough understanding of the nature of maritime communications. Ashore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend to run more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they meet in the theatre of operations or the objective point. At sea the reverse is the case; for in maritime warfare the great lines of communications of either belligerent tend to run approximately parallel, if, indeed, they are not identical. Thus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the Eastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines of communication would be identical. This was also the case in all our imperial wars with France. This peculiarity is the controlling influence of",

    "section": "Maritime Warfare and Naval Strategy",
    "text": "Nearly all our current maxims of Naval strategy can be traced to the pressure it exerts on Naval thought. It is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval strategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and confusion, which has arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to the sea without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the communications and operations against them in each case. On land the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's communications at once is that as a rule we cannot do so without exposing our own. At sea, on the contrary, since the great lines are common to both, we cannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's. Therefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get your fleet into such a position that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded.\n\nEXAMPLE.—This was usually done in our old wars with France, by our getting a fleet off Brest before the French could sail. Hence the maxim \"that the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's coast,\" \"the enemy's coast is our true frontier,\" and the like. But these maxims are not universally true, witness Togo's strategy against Rojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast. Take again the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. Here again Togo's practice was the reverse of the maxim. The true maxim is \"The primary object of the fleet is to secure communications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them unsafe it must be put out of action.\" The enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always.\n\nEXAMPLE.—Opening of War of Spanish Succession. The operations of 1702 were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish trade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own lines of passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief theatre of operation. These last two lines were identical. 1703.—Chief operations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and particularly of Portugal, and with same object in view, Rooke's official instructions directed that the French fleet was to be ignored unless it threatened our communications.\n\nRESULT.—By 1704 we had gained a Naval position from which France could not eject us, and she abandoned struggle for sea communications. But nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c., is sound and applicable:— (a) Because for us general permanent command is usually essential to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the enemy's fleet. (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt to control the common communications. (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex (i.e., the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a blow which solve all the difficulties; e.g., Sir Palmes Fairborne's solution of the problem in 1703 (England in the Mediterranean, Vol. II., p. 234). Also it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective way of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" (i.e., forcing an action on him) is to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of campaign. This was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon fleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally, but by the operation of inevitable strategical law). Compare Togo's strategy and that of the Americans in 1898. Practically all great Naval actions have been brought about in this way, that is they have been the outcome on an effort to clear essential communications from the enemy's fleet, e.g., Gravelines, La Hogue, Quiberon, Trafalgar, Tsushima. Similarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about because our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade communications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet.\n\nFINAL NOTE In applying the maxim of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" it should be borne in mind:— (1) That if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably find it in a place where you cannot destroy it except at heavy cost. (2) That seeing that the defensive is a stronger form of war than the offensive, it is prima facie better strategy to make the enemy come to you than to go to him and seek a decision on his own ground.",

    "section": "War Course Notes on Strategy - Part One: General Principles and Definitions",
    "text": "War is the application of force to the attainment of political ends. We seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be ulterior or primary. Primary objects are the special objects of particular operations or movements which we undertake in order to gain the ulterior object of the campaign. Consequently it must be remembered that every particular operation or movement must be regarded, not only from the point of view of its special object, but also as a step to the end of the campaign or war. Strategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view.\n\nMAJOR AND MINOR STRATEGY\nThere are two kinds—Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor Strategy, with primary objects. Every operation of an army or fleet must be planned and conducted in relation (1) to the general plan of the war; (2) to the object to which it is immediately directed. Major Strategy, always regarding the ulterior object, has for its province the plan of the war and includes:\n(1) Selection of the immediate or primary objects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object;\n(2) Selection of the force to be used, i.e., it determines the relative functions of the naval and military forces.\n\nMajor Strategy in its broadest sense deals with the whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship which regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled together as the instrument of war. But it also has to keep in constant touch with the political and diplomatic position of the country (on which depends the effective action of the instrument), and the commercial and financial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is maintained). The friction due to these considerations is inherent in war, and is called the deflection of strategy by politics. It is usually regarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every strategical problem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question of major strategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and vice versâ. For a line of action or an object which is expedient from the point of view of strategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and vice versâ. To decide a question of Major Strategy, without consideration of its diplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither strategy or diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This inter-action has to be accepted as part of the inevitable \"friction of war.\" A good example is Pitt's refusal to send a fleet into the Baltic to assist Frederick the Great during the Seven Years' War, for fear of compromising our relations with the Scandinavian Powers.\n\nMinor Strategy has for its province the plans of operations. It deals with—\n(1) The selection of the \"objectives,\" that is, the particular forces of the enemy or the strategical points to be dealt with in order to secure the object of the particular operation.\n(2) The direction of the force assigned for the operation.\n\nMinor Strategy may, therefore, be of three kinds:—\n(1) Naval, where the immediate object is to be attained by a fleet only.\n(2) Military, where the immediate object is to be attained by an army only.\n(3) Combined, where the immediate object is to be attained by army and navy together.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that what is usually called Naval Strategy or Fleet Strategy is only a sub-division of Strategy, and that therefore Strategy cannot be studied from the point of view of naval operations only. Naval Strategy, being a part of General Strategy, is subject to the same friction as Major Strategy, though in a less degree. Individual commanders have often to take a decision independently of the central government or headquarters; they should, therefore, always keep in mind the possible ulterior effects of any line of action they may take, endeavouring to be sure that what is strategically expedient is not diplomatically inexpedient.",

    "text": "Upon the nature of the object depends the fundamental distinction between offensive and defensive, upon which all strategical calculation must be based. Consequently, the solution of every strategical problem, whether of Major or Minor Strategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in view. All objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative. A positive object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for ourselves. A negative object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent his gaining something. Where the object is positive, Strategy is offensive. Where the object is negative, Strategy is defensive. This is the only certain test by which we can decide whether any particular operation is offensive or defensive. Ulterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as the primary or secondary objects which lead up to them; e.g., ulterior objects may be offensive, while one or more of the primary objects may be defensive, and vice versâ. For example, in the Russo-Japanese War the ulterior object of the war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive (positive). The ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was defensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack and destroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive).\n\nRelation of Offensive to Defensive\nThe Offensive, being positive in its aim, is naturally the more effective form of war and, as a rule, should be adopted by the stronger Power. The Defensive, being negative in its aim, is the more lasting form of war, since it requires less force to keep what one has than to take what is another's, and, as a rule, is adopted by the weaker Power. In most cases where the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive, it is due to his doing so before the enemy's mobilization or concentration is complete, whereby the attacking force is able to deal in succession with locally inferior forces of the enemy. The advantages of the Offensive are well known. Its disadvantages are:— That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its communications, and that it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground. The advantages of the Defensive are chiefly:— Proximity to the base of supply and repair stations, familiar ground, facility for arranging surprise by counter attack, and power of organising in advance. The disadvantages of the Defensive are mainly moral. They become, however, real and practical when the enemy's objective or line of operations cannot be ascertained, for then we have to spread or attenuate our force to cover all probable objectives, but this disadvantage can be neutralised when it is possible to secure an interior position.\n\nFunctions and Characteristics of the Defensive\nTrue Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike. To assume the defensive does not necessarily mean that we do not feel strong enough to attack. It may mean that we see our way by using the defensive to force certain movements on the enemy which will enable us to hit harder. A well-designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack. Unless it does this it will not deflect the enemy's strategy in our favour. Thus, in 1756, the French, by assuming the defensive in the Channel, threatened an attack on our coasts, and concealed their attack on Minorca. This power inherent in the defensive is peculiarly strong in naval warfare, since the mobility of fleets enables them to pass instantaneously from the defensive to the offensive without any warning. When we assume the defensive because we are too weak for the offensive, we still do not lay aside attack. The whole strength and essence of the defensive is the counter-stroke. Its cardinal idea is to force the enemy to attack us in a position where he will expose himself to a counter-stroke.",

    "text": "Because it is only by using the defensive in the minor or less important theatres of operation that the forces in those theatres can be reduced to the minimum of security, and the maximum of concentration can thereby be obtained in the main theatre. In considering the defensive as a general plan of campaign the maxim is: If not relatively strong enough to assume the offensive, assume the defensive till you become so— (1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or otherwise; (2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or securing allies. It must always be remembered that, except as a preparation or a cover for offensive action, the defensive is seldom or never of any use; for by the continued use of the defensive alone nothing can be acquired, though the enemy may be prevented from acquiring anything. But where we are too weak to assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive, and wait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and permitting us to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's; we then pass to the offensive, for which our defensive has been a preparation. At sea we have had little occasion for the defensive as a general plan. But that is no reason for neglecting its study. In despising the defensive ourselves we have consistently ignored the strength it gives our enemies. The bulk of our naval history is the story of how we have been baffled and thwarted by our enemies assuming the defensive at sea in support of their offensive on land. We have seldom succeeded in treating this attitude with success, and it is only by studying the defensive we can hope to do so. Offensive Operations used with a Defensive Intention (A) Counter attacks. (B) Diversions. Counter attacks are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes himself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this form of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the \"surprise advantage of defence.\" Diversions are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside the limit of his theatre of offensive operations. Diversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention, and to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they should divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be small. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less likely they are to divert a force greater than their own. Diversions involve a breach of the law of concentration, and it is only their power of diverting or containing a larger force than their own that justifies their use. This power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities are most highly developed in combined expeditions. Diversions must be carefully distinguished from eccentric attacks. Eccentric attacks are true offensive movements. They have a positive object, i.e., they aim to acquire something from the enemy; whereas diversions have a negative object, i.e., they aim at preventing the enemy doing or acquiring something. Eccentric attacks are usually made in greater force than diversions. Examples.—Diversion.—Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force, about 4,000 men. Object, according to official instruction, \"a diversion on the coasts of United States of America in favour of the army employed in the defence of Canada\"; i.e., the intention was negative—preventive—defensive. Eccentric Attack.—Operations against New Orleans in 1815. Intended force, 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, \"to obtain command of the embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to occupy some important and valuable possession, by the restoration of which the conditions of peace might be improved, &c.\"; i.e., the intention was positive—to acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) with those against Martinique and Belleisle (eccentric attacks) in the Seven Years' War. This distinction gives a threefold classification of combined expeditions, as used by Elizabethan strategists, viz., raids, incursions, and invasions. These correspond respectively with our modern diversions, eccentric attacks, and true direct offensive.",

    "section": "Limited and Unlimited Wars, Plans of War",
    "text": "LIMITED AND UNLIMITED WARS From the nature of the ulterior object we get an important classification of wars, according to whether such object is limited or unlimited. (1) War with limited object (\"limited war\") is where the object is merely to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions or interests; e.g., Spanish-American War, where the object was the liberation of Cuba. (2) War with an unlimited object is where the object is to overthrow the enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must agree to do our will (become subservient); e.g., Franco- German War. PLANS OF WAR System of Operations Having determined the nature of the war by the nature of its object (i.e., whether it is offensive or defensive and whether it is limited or unlimited), Strategy has to decide on the system of operations or \"plan of the war.\" Apart from the means at our disposal a plan of war depends mainly upon— (1) The theatre of the war. (2) The various theatres of operation available within it. 1. Theatre of the War.—Usually defined as \"All the territory upon which the hostile parties may assail each other.\" This is insufficient. For an Island Power the theatre of war will always include sea areas. Truer definition: \"Geographical areas within which must lie the operations necessary for the attainment of the ulterior objects of the war and of the subordinate objects that lead up to them.\" A \"theatre of war\" may contain several \"theatres of operations.\" 2. Theatre of Operations.—Is generally used of the operations of one belligerent only. An \"operation\" is any considerable strategical undertaking. A \"theatre of operations\" is usually defined as embracing all the territory we seek to take possession of or to defend. A truer definition is: \"The area, whether of sea or land or both, within which the enemy must be overpowered before we can secure the object of the particular operation.\" Consequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be defensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another. Where the operations are defensive in character any special movement or movements may be offensive. As the plan of war determines the theatres of operation in the theatre of war, so in each theatre of operation it determines the lines of operation and the objectives. Objective An objective is \"any point or force against which an offensive movement is directed.\" Thus, where the object in any theatre of operation is to get command of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet will usually be the objective. \"Objective\" in ordinary use is frequently confused with \"object.\" For purposes of strategical discussion it is desirable to keep them sharply distinguished. Objective is the end of some particular movement or operation, and is the special concern of the officer in command. Object is the end of a system of operations and is the special concern of the general staff or director of the war. An objective is some definite point which we wish to get from the enemy or prevent his occupying, or some part of his strength which we wish to destroy. It is incorrect to use the term of anything we already possess. Thus, Vladivostock is often said to have been Rojesvensky's objective. It was, strictly speaking, only his destination. To reach it and concentrate with the units already there was the primary object of the operations entrusted to him. He had no true objective before him except Togo's fleet. An objective is always subordinate to some object. It is a step to the attainment of that object. Lines of Operation A line of operation is \"the area of land or sea through which we operate from our base or starting point to reach our objectives.\" Lines of operation may be exterior or interior. We are said to hold the interior lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of operations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more quickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a position is called an interior position. \"Exterior Lines\" and \"Exterior Positions\" are the converse of these. Lines of Communication This expression is used of three different things:— (1) Lines of supply, running from the base of operations to the point which the operating force has reached. (2) Lines of lateral communication by which several forces engaged in one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to each other's support. (3) Lines of retreat, which are usually lines of supply reversed, i.e., leading back to the base. For naval purposes these three ideas are best described by the term \"lines of passage and communication,\" which were in use at the end of the 18th century, and they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the normal course of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the force to be supplied. Maritime Communications The various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet may have to operate are:— (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond to the communications of armies operating ashore). These have greatly increased in importance strategically with the increased dependence of modern fleets on a regular supply of coals, stores, ammunition, &c. (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea base, that is, communication between the advanced and the main base. (3) Trade Routes, that is, the communications upon which depend the national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the \"lateral\" or connecting communications between various parts of belligerents' possessions. In Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of communication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on communications, but probably it does so, as will appear from a consideration of Maritime Communications, and the extent to which they are the main preoccupation of naval operations; that is to say, all problems of Naval Strategy can be reduced to terms of \"passage and communication,\" and this is probably the best method of solving them.",

    "section": "Naval Strategy: Passage and Communication",
    "text": "PART TWO NAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A QUESTION OF PASSAGE AND COMMUNICATION NAVAL STRATEGY DEFINED By \"Naval Strategy\" we mean the art of conducting the major operations of the fleet. Such operations have for their object \"passage and communication\"; that is, the fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own communications and seizing those of the enemy. We say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command of the sea. This means something quite different from the military idea of occupying territory, for the sea cannot be the subject of political dominion or ownership. We cannot subsist upon it (like an army on conquered territory), nor can we exclude neutrals from it. The value of the sea in the political system of the world is as a means of communication between States and parts of States. Therefore the \"command of the sea\" means the control of communications in which the belligerents are adversely concerned. The command of the sea can never be, like the conquest of territory, the ulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime war, as were approximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century, but it may be a primary or immediate object, and even the ulterior object of particular operations. History shows that the actual functions of the fleet (except in purely maritime wars) have been threefold:— 1. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore. 2. The protection or destruction of commerce. 3. The prevention or securing of alliances (i.e., deterring or persuading neutrals as to participating in the war). EXAMPLES.—The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the alliance of the Kingdom of Naples. In the first case, there came a crisis when it was more important to demonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining Louis XIV, than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the second, the Neapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not. In this way we get a Definition of the Aim of Naval Strategy, expressed in terms of the actual functions of the fleet. For practical purposes it will be found the most useful definition as emphasising the intimate connection of Naval Strategy with the diplomatic, financial, and military aspects of Major Strategy. These functions of the fleet may be discharged in two ways:— (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed (bombardment, landings, raiding parties, &c.). (2) By getting command of the sea, i.e., establishing ourselves in such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against the enemy's territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours. The power of the second method, by controlling communications, is out of all proportion to that of the first— direct attack. Indeed, the first can seldom be performed with any serious effect without the second. Thus, from this point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is mainly a question of communications. But not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the fleet must discharge part of its function by direct action against territory before there is time to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and military considerations may deflect the normal operation of Naval Strategy.) EXAMPLES.—Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the unshaken Toulon Fleet. Holmes's capture of Emden in 1758. Still, the fact remains that the key to the effective performance of the fleet's duties is almost always to secure communications as soon as possible by battle. COMMAND OF THE SEA Command of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command of the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we have adequate naval positions, and an adequate fleet to secure the command when war breaks out. Command of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do absolutely nothing, but that he cannot seriously interfere with the undertakings",

    "section": "Various Conditions of Command",
    "text": "1. It may be (a) general; (b) local. (a) General command is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act dangerously against our line of passage and communication or to use or defend his own, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere seriously with our trade or our military or diplomatic operations. This condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send squadrons to sea. (b) Local command implies a state of things in which we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in one or more theatres of operation. 2. Both general and local command may be (a) temporary; {b) permanent. {a) Temporary command is when we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in all or some theatres of operation during the period required for gaining the object in view (i.e., the object of a particular operation or of a particular campaign). This condition existed after Togo's first action. It was also that at which Napoleon aimed in his instructions to Villeneuve in 1805. (b) Permanent command is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the situation, i.e., when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his maritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This condition existed after Tsushima. Command in Dispute The state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it is the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and frequently all through it. The state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, i.e., till one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea. It is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of dispute by seeking a decision. Hence the French tradition to avoid decisive actions as a rule when at war with England. It must be remembered that general command of the sea is not essential to all oversea operations. In a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate or be induced to concentrate in one theatre of operations, and so secure the local or temporary command sufficient for obtaining the special object in view, while the weaker Power takes advantage of such local concentration to operate safely elsewhere. Thus in a state of dispute, although the weaker Power may not be able to obstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able to defend its own. EXAMPLES.—This condition of dispute existed during the first three years of the Seven Years' War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a decision by defeating Conflans and De la Clue; also in the Great War up to Trafalgar.",

    "text": "METHODS OF SECURING CONTROL. 1. Permanent general control can only be secured by the practical annihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions. 2. Local and temporary control may be secured by— (a) An action not necessarily entirely successful (containing). (b) Inducing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion). (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing). (d) Blockade. Action of a Fleet off an Enemy's Port A belligerent fleet off an enemy's port may carry out three different operations, for certain purposes; each quite separate from the others, and intended to obtain an entirely different result:— (1) Close Blockade.—This is to prevent the enemy's fighting ships from putting to sea. In this case the object is to secure local control for some purpose that is not purely naval, such as was carried out by the Japanese off Port Arthur in 1904, so as to enable their transports to cross the Yellow Sea without fear of molestation from any of the Russian ships in Port Arthur. Since the cruisers in Vladivostok were able to emerge (that port not being blockaded), the operation was not complete, and a danger of interference always existed. This method of blockade is far more difficult to carry out in the present day, than formerly; owing to the existence of submarines and torpedo craft, the blockading ships have to remain further away from the port; there have to be inner lines of cruisers, scouts and destroyers; and quick concentration takes longer owing to the greater space covered by the blockading force, and more ships of all natures are required for the same reason. Greater and more vigilance are required than in former days, because the enemy's ships can come out regardless of weather (thick weather would be their opportunity), and it is most important that not a single craft, from a battleship to a torpedo boat, be allowed to escape. This method of blockade includes the commercial blockade, and all countries would be informed of its having been established. (2) Commercial Blockade.—To prevent floating commerce from entering or leaving the blockaded harbour. The blockading force would not be powerful enough to prevent a squadron of battleships or cruisers from entering or leaving the port blockaded; and it would not be instituted outside a fortified military port, or one containing a strong naval force. But it would be able to stop scouts and torpedo craft from entering or emerging, unless in very great numbers; and if unable to stop them from emerging, would give warning of their escape and the direction in which they are going. In both these forms of blockade it is usual, as a matter of courtesy, to allow neutral armed ships belonging to foreign navies to enter and leave for their own purposes, presumably connected with the subjects of their own country who are in the blockaded port. This, however, is not a right, and the country to which the blockading ships belong has a right to refuse it, and to back her refusal by force. All countries must be notified of a properly instituted commercial blockade, in accordance with International Agreement.",

    "section": "Observing a Port and Concentration",
    "text": "(3) Observing a Port.—This, with its subsidiary operations, should be conducted in such a way as to induce the enemy to put to sea, the object of observing the port being primarily a naval one, viz., to bring him to decisive action. The principal observing force (consisting of battleships and cruisers) would be either in one squadron, or more, provided that they were in supporting reach of each other, and so placed as to be able to cut off the enemy's fleet on emerging from the port observed before it can get dangerously near its probable objective, and yet sufficiently far out to ensure a battle before it can regain the shelter of its own ports. It is also worth noting that the battle should, if possible, be fought so as to make it difficult for the enemy's damaged ships to obtain the shelter of a friendly neutral's harbours before being captured. The observed port must be watched closely, so that immediate notice of the enemy's exit may be given; and this would be done by small cruisers, scouts and destroyers, which should be strong and numerous enough to attack any torpedo craft trying to get to sea. In order to induce the enemy's main force to put to sea it is important that every means be used to prevent his knowing that our fleet is observing the port, or if that be impossible, to do nothing which will lead him to suppose that his port is being observed. This operation is not a blockade. Subsidiary operations to induce the enemy's fleet to put to sea, may take the form of a diversion on the enemy's coast, or against some important part of his sea-borne trade, either by the observing fleet or by a force affiliated to it, or by any oversea movements calculated to interfere seriously with the enemy's war plan. Concentration The guiding feature of modern preparation for war is to be ready for rapid action. It is true at sea, more even than on land, that upon the first movements depend the initiative, the power of controlling the enemy's strategy, and of making him conform to our movements. This readiness for rapid action will depend on a proper distribution of the fleet so as to meet all the requirements. The distribution of the fleet should be dominated by the idea of concentration, but it must be understood clearly what concentration means. Clausewitz says:—“The best strategy is always to be sufficiently strong, at first generally, then at the decisive point. There is therefore no higher or simpler law for strategy than this—keep your forces together.” The maxim “Keep your forces together” does not, however, necessarily mean keeping them all concentrated in one mass, but rather keeping them so disposed that they can unite readily at will. At sea it is more difficult than on land to foretell where the decisive point will be; but since it is quicker and easier at sea to concentrate forces at any particular point than on land, in applying this maxim for our purposes, the rule should be to dispose the forces at sea so as to be able to concentrate them in time at the decisive point so soon as this point is determined, and also so as to conceal from the enemy what it is intended to make the decisive point. If the forces are rightly disposed within due limits, adequate control of all the lines of passage and communication can be assured, and if the enemy undertakes any operations it should be possible to ensure that sufficient forces can be concentrated in time to defeat his object. On the other hand, if the forces are concentrated in one mass, there can be little chance of deceiving or confusing the enemy, while it gives him an opportunity of successfully carrying out some operation by evasion.",

    "text": "THE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS Since the whole idea of command of the sea rests on the control of communications, it cannot be fully apprehended without a thorough understanding of the nature of maritime communications. Ashore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend as a rule to run more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they meet in the theatre of operations or the objective point. At sea, the reverse is frequently the case; for in maritime warfare the great lines of communications of either belligerent often tend to run approximately parallel if, indeed, they are not identical. Thus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the Eastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines of communication would be identical. This was also the case in all our imperial wars with France. This peculiarity is the controlling influence of maritime warfare. Nearly all our current maxims of Naval Strategy can be traced to the pressure it exerts on naval thought. It is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval Strategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and confusion which have arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to the sea without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the communications and the operations against them in each case. On land, the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's communications at once is that, as a rule, we cannot do so without exposing our own. At sea, on the contrary, when the great lines are common to both, we cannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's. Therefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get our fleet into such a position that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded. This was usually done in our old wars with France, by our attempting to get a fleet off Brest before the French could sail. Hence the maxims “That the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's coast,” “The enemy's coast is our true frontier,” and the like. But these maxims are not universally true; witness Togo's strategy against Rojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast. Take, again, the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. Here, again, Togo's practice was the reverse of the maxim. The true maxim is “The primary object of the fleet is to secure communications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them unsafe it must be put out of action.” The enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always. EXAMPLE.—Opening of the War of the Spanish Succession. The operations of 1702 were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish trade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own lines of passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief theatre of operation. These last two lines were identical. In 1703, the chief operations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and particularly of Portugal. Rooke's official instructions directed that the French fleet was to be ignored unless it threatened the common communications. RESULT.—By 1704 we had gained a naval position from which France could not eject us, and she abandoned the struggle for sea communications. But nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c., is sound and applicable— (a) Because for us general permanent command is usually essential to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the enemy's fleet. (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt to dispute the control of the common communications. (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex (i.e., the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a blow which will solve all the difficulties; e.g., Sir. Palmes Fairborne's solution of the problem in 1703. Also it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective way of “seeking out the enemy's fleet” (i.e., forcing an action on him) is to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of campaign. This was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon Fleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally, but by the operation of strategical law). Practically all great naval actions have been brought about in this way, that is, they have been the outcome of an effort to clear essential communications from the enemy's fleet;",

    "text": "Similarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about because our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade communications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet. In applying the maxim of \"seeking out the enemy's fleet\" it should be borne in mind that if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably find it in a place where you cannot destroy it, except at very heavy cost. It is far better to make it come to you, and this has often been done by merely sitting on the common communications.\nAgain, if you seek out the enemy's fleet without being certain of getting contact, you may merely assist it in evading you, and enable it to get into a position on your own communications, from which it may be very costly to dislodge it. It was for this reason that the Elizabethan Government kept the fleet in home waters in 1588. Sampson, in the Spanish-American War, was actually permitted to make this mistake. By going to seek out Cervera without being sure of contact, he left him a clear run into Cienfuegos or even Havana, which it was the main function of the fleet to prevent. Captain Mahan has since modified this maxim as follows:—“Seek out the enemy's fleet, if you are sure of getting contact.\" A truer maxim would seem to be \"Seek contact with the enemy's fleet in the most certain and favourable manner that is open to you.\" To seek out the enemy's fleet is only one way of doing this, and not always the best way. It must be remembered that other conditions being equal, it is an obvious advantage to fight in your own waters rather than in those of the enemy, and more likely to ensure that a defeat of the enemy will be decisive.",

Its positive function was minor and diversionary only. It also had a political object as a demonstration to further our efforts to form a Baltic coalition against Russia, which entirely failed. Public opinion mistaking the whole situation expected direct positive results from this fleet, even the capture of St. Petersburg. Such an operation would have converted the war from a limited one to an unlimited one. It would have meant the \"overthrow of the enemy,\" a task quite beyond the strength of the allies without the assistance of the Baltic Powers, and even so their assistance would not have justified changing the nature of the war, unless both Sweden and Russia had been ready to make unlimited war and nothing was further from their intention.",

    "text": "9 In justice to Wellington, it should be said that his complaints were due to false reports that exaggerated a couple of insignificant captures into a serious interruption. 10 But not without analogous precedent. In the later Middle Ages small craft were assigned the function in battle of trying to wedge up the rudders of great ships or bore holes between wind and water. See Fighting Instructions (Navy Record Society), p. 13. 11 Daveluy, L'Esprit de la Guerre Navale, vol. i, p. 27, note. 12 Mahan, War of 1812, i, 316. 13 The Dutch were believed to have sixteen of the line—one seventy-four, seven sixty-eights, and the rest under sixty guns. In Ross's squadron were one three-decker and two eighties. 14 See post, pp. 222-24. 15 Nelson to Barham, 29 August 1805. 16 Captain Philip Patton to Sir Charles Middleton, 27 June 1794. Barham Papers, ii, 393. Patton had probably wider war experience than any officer then living. He was regarded as possessing a very special knowledge of personnel, and as vice admiral became second sea lord under Barham in 1804. 17 Barham Papers, i, 302. 18 To Evan Nepean, 4 September 1801.

In acknowledging the order from Ushant he wrote, \"The instructions ... are nearly the same as have generally been given. I can therefore only guess why a copy of the order was sent to me.\"—Admiralty, In-Letters, 129, 28 September 1805. 25 The Japanese in the late war attempted to do this work by means of a highly organized Army Disembarkation Staff, but except in perfect conditions of weather and locality it does not seem to have worked well, and in almost all cases the assistance of the navy was called in. 26 Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian was an officer of high distinction with a remarkable record of battle service. He had been serving as Howe's second captain just before his promotion to flag rank in 1795, and died as Commander-in-Chief at the Cape at the early age of fifty-one. 27 On analogous grounds almost every military critic has condemned the policy of this disastrous expedition as involving a dispersal of our slender military force at a time when everything called for its concentration in Europe. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SOME PRINCIPLES OF MARITIME STRATEGY *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.

    "section": "Introduction: The Sea is One",
    "text": "Shakespeare, in his immortal sea drama The Tempest, said, “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep,” referring to the small and confined dimensions of our individual lives. It is a haunting passage, and one I have thought about a great deal. The play opens with a massive storm at sea, and the line has always had profoundly nautical implications for me. In my nearly four decades as a Navy sailor, when all the days I spent on the deep ocean, out of sight of land, are totaled, they add up to nearly eleven years. The endless vistas of the open ocean, upon which I gazed for more than a decade of my life, provide quite a setting for such dreaming. And in those days, when I looked at the ocean, I always felt a sense of seeing the same view that millions upon millions of other deep-sea mariners, coastal sailors, and even land dwellers close to the ocean saw. Like the fishermen, traders, pirates, harbor pilots, and indeed sailors of every ilk who went down to the sea in ships of all kinds, we have all seen the same ocean views. In a way, it is like looking at eternity; to gaze upon it for an hour, a day, a month, or a lifetime reminds us gently that our time is limited, and we are but a tiny part of the floating world. In addition to simply warning us not to overimagine the importance of our own small voyages on this earth, Shakespeare’s line also makes us consider quite literally what we are indeed made of. It is worth remembering that each of us is, essentially, largely made of water. When a human baby is born, it is composed of roughly 70 percent water. It has always fascinated me that roughly the same proportion of the globe is covered by water—just over 70 percent. Both our planet and our bodies are dominated by the liquid world, and anyone who has sailed extensively at sea will understand instinctively the primordial tug of the oceans upon each of us when we look upon the sea. I still dream about being on a ship, and part of why I wanted to write a book about the oceans is in response to those dreams. It often happens as I nod off on my now landlocked bed that I dream of the faint rumble of a ship’s engines and feel the rolling of the waves pushing and rocking the hull of my ship. When I rise and head up to the bridge, it is always on a bright day, with the clouds hanging in front of the bow and the ship pushing through the sea. I never know exactly where the dream will take me but I always end up approaching the shore, and when I do, I feel a pang of regret to leave the ocean. The approaches to land are always difficult in my dreams, and the ship often finds herself running out of deep water and becomes rapidly in danger of foundering on a beach or up a river or upon a reef. I always wake up before the ship finally impales herself ashore, and I always wish I had stayed farther out to sea. The British navy, which dominated the world’s oceans for so many years, truly and deeply understood the interconnected character of the global waterways. “The sea is one” is an expression you will hear from a Brit. I heard it first when I was eighteen years old and a second-year student, called a midshipman, at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. My navigation instructor was a crusty British lieutenant commander, who seemed incredibly old and salty—he was probably in his mid-thirties, and who could imagine being so ancient? This Old Man of the Sea was a crack hand with a sextant, a nautical almanac, and a tide table to be sure, but what he really taught me was the way in which all the world’s oceans are at once connected—obvious enough given the continuous flow of water around the continents—but also separate. He would painstakingly discuss each of the great global bodies of water—the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Arctic oceans—as well as the major tributary bodies: the Mediterranean Sea, the South China Sea, the Caribbean. The lieutenant commander could talk for an hour about a particular strait between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and how the water looked in the winter, and why it was a crucial passage. I learned a great deal from him, not only about the science and art of navigating a destroyer, but also about oceanography, maritime history, global strategy, and how the tools of empire so often were dusted with dried salt, like the taffrails of a sailing cutter. You could drop a plumb line from my days as a teenager at Annapolis through the arc of nearly four decades as a Navy officer and finally end up on the pages of this book. The oceans were the place I spent much of the early years of my career. I sailed through them all, validating the lessons he taught me, improving my own ship handling and navigational skills, and learning to lead men and women at sea. As my understanding and appreciation of the international system increased—accelerated by a PhD at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, where I am now a very deskbound admiral—I came to understand the influence of the sea on geopolitics. It is no coincidence that so many of the great national enterprises of the past two thousand years were influenced by sea power, and that continues to be true today. The sea is one indeed, particularly as a geopolitical entity, and will continue to exert an enormous influence on how global events unfold—from the high tension of the South China Sea, to the cocaine smuggling of the Caribbean, to the piracy off the coasts of Africa, to the unfortunate reemergence of a new cold war in the Greenland-Iceland–United Kingdom gap in the North Atlantic. Some observers may not be interested in the geopolitics of the oceans, but they will haunt our policy and our choices in this turbulent twenty-first century. The oceans will matter deeply to every aspect of human endeavor. When we go to sea—whether in a warship for a nine-month combat cruise, or a week on a Carnival cruise liner, or just a day sail out of sight of land—we are launching ourselves into another dimension altogether. The world shudders and shakes beneath us, the wind cuts more sharply with nothing to slow its pace, the weather skims by our unprotected hull, the dolphins sometimes swim alongside for hours—it is a very different world. In a primal sense, we are “an ocean away” every time we go to sea and can no longer see the land. When you are on a hull, however large or small, and come up on the deck and slowly pivot around to see nothing but the ocean stretching away from you, stop and measure the moment in the passage of your life: you are seeing the same view, the same endless ocean that Alexander the Great saw as he sailed the eastern Mediterranean, that Napoleon gazed upon on his long, sad voyage to exile in the South Atlantic, and that Halsey saw as he lashed his Fast Carrier Task Force into combat in the western Pacific. In that sense, as a sailor, you are at once an ocean away from the world of the land, but also connected to a long, unbroken chain of men and women who have set their course for the open ocean. It is those two important aspects of the oceans that I have tried to capture in this volume: the personal experience of a mariner at sea, and the geopolitics of the oceans and how they constantly influence events ashore. Only by understanding both the individual and personal experiences of sailors and trying to pour that distinct nautical culture into the larger questions of how the oceans drive the international system can we fully appreciate the value and the challenge of the sea. In that sense, this is a book that could have been written by many different sailors at any point in the long, long history of our collective human voyages both over the ocean and through time. Writing it now, in this century, is simply an attempt to take a vivid snapshot of those two tendrils of human experience—a sailor’s life at sea and the strategic impact of the oceans—upon the vast water world we call earth. Let’s get under way.",

As a young midshipman, I was initially reluctant, but the vastness and beauty of the ocean changed my perspective entirely. The Pacific's immensity is difficult to grasp, exceeding all landmasses combined. Its scattered islands, collectively known as Oceania, represent millennia of human habitation.  The remarkable feat of settling these islands using outrigger canoes, currents, and stars highlights the ingenuity and courage of the Austronesians. My later voyages across the Pacific underscored its scale, from the West Coast to Hawaii, Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia.  The journey involved navigating by sextant, experiencing the 'crossing the line' ceremony, and appreciating the unique cultures of the Pacific islands.",

Reaching Australia, the warm welcome in Sydney reflected the enduring bond between the US and Australia. The Australians' gratitude for US Navy support in World War II remains strong.  Their military prowess was evident in later collaborations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

To understand Magellan's voyage, picture a globe with eastern Australia and Indonesia at the bottom left. It's a water world, with only slivers of North America and Northeast Asia visible.  Until the 1500s, Europeans had little knowledge of what lay west of the Americas. Vasco Núñez de Balboa's discovery and claim of the Pacific in 1513 sparked a maritime scramble. Magellan, a Portuguese sailing for Spain, named the Pacific (mistakenly believing it calm). His five-ship expedition, starting in 1519 with about 250 men, sought a westward route to Asia for spices and gold. Magellan drastically underestimated the Pacific's size.  After a difficult passage through the Strait of Magellan at South America's tip, they entered the Pacific. The vastness of the ocean became apparent as they sailed west from Chile. In 1521, they reached Guam, then the Philippines, where Magellan was killed in interisland conflict. His crew recorded his demise, highlighting his importance to the expedition.",

Recognizing the importance of Pacific mapping for sea power and global influence, the British tasked Cook with exploring the vast ocean.  From 1768 until his death in 1779, Cook's three voyages aboard the Endeavour, Discovery, Resolution, and Adventure covered over 150,000 sea miles. Accompanied by naturalist Joseph Banks, Cook charted numerous Pacific locations, including Alaska, western Canada, Kamchatka, Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji, New Caledonia, Easter Island, and New Zealand. He also explored Antarctica, Australia, and both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Cook's meticulous mapping opened the Pacific to the world, leaving a lasting legacy for mariners.",

Lured by the fur trade, they established outposts like Fort Ross north of San Francisco. Overhunting and the burden of their vast empire led to their retreat from Fort Ross in the 1840s and the sale of Alaska to the U.S. in 1867.  Despite their short-lived presence, they contributed significantly to scientific exploration. The United States entered the Pacific gradually. Ships from Boston traded with China, but a permanent presence began with California's acquisition in 1848. The Gold Rush spurred westward migration, and the whaling industry shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Growing trade with China further fueled interest in the Pacific. The advent of coal-powered ships in the 1860s necessitated coaling stations, driving the annexation of Hawaii in 1898 with Pearl Harbor as its strategic hub.",

    "section": "Geopolitical Comparison: Japan and Great Britain",
    "text": "A key geopolitical question is why Japan, despite similarities to Great Britain (island nation, maritime prowess, limited resources), didn't develop a similar global empire. Both faced invasion threats, possessed strong military traditions, and produced skilled sailors.  However, Britain created a vast empire, while Japan remained largely isolated for centuries, emerging aggressively only in the 20th century. This difference can be partly attributed to the Pacific's geography. The Pacific's immense size and the small Asian littoral facing it made eastward voyages daunting. Unlike Britain, separated from Europe by the narrow English Channel, Japan had a wider distance from rivals and fewer aggressive neighbors. The vast Pacific also served as a natural buffer. Early Mongol invasions in the 13th century were repelled, aided by typhoons. After continental forays in the 16th century, including failed Korean invasions, Japan adopted a policy of isolation, viewing seafaring as \"going outside.\"  China, similarly, focused on landward threats, building the Great Wall and viewing European influence with suspicion.  Zheng He's 15th-century voyages westward were an exception, but ultimately China prioritized landward defense.",

    "text": "the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and East Africa, resulting in only a transitory impression on the locals and the withering away of the Chinese fleet when political tides turned against exploration. Looking to the east at the enormous range of the Pacific did not engage the Chinese geopolitical imagination any more than it did the Japanese (or that of any other Pacific culture for that matter). In the end, it was the Europeans, ironically, who would well and truly cross the Pacific and seek to connect the two worlds in a fashion beyond episodic trade and missionary work. And no individual act of opening the Pacific world could have been more dramatic than the voyage of American commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry to Japan in the 1850s. At that point, Japan had held itself more or less aloof from the world for more than 250 years. It had developed a deeply homogenous and intensely internally focused national culture, including limited trade and engagement even in the commercial sphere. But the United States was irresistibly pulled toward Japan. Pacific whaling operations, so crucial to the American economy, shifted from the South Pacific to the North off the coast of Hokkaido. The increasing trade with China made the home islands of Japan very advantageous as logistic bases to facilitate sea lanes of communication. U.S. president Millard Fillmore therefore produced a letter and directed Commodore Perry to deliver it, with the objective of gaining access to Japanese ports. Although the use of force was authorized, Perry had studied Japan and decided to take another, more diplomatic approach. Sailing in paddle-wheel steamboats, he came loaded with gifts and did all in his power to act the part of imperial representative of a great power. He sailed into Tokyo Bay in July 1853 with the intent to communicate using what we would think of today as a “soft power” approach—sensitivity to culture, avoiding a resort to military force, using economic and diplomatic levers as a first choice, and laying out a compelling geopolitical case to other actors. His ships were deeply impressive to the Japanese, and he augmented the squadron size over the winter. By March 1854, he had managed to execute the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first such cross- Pacific instrument that provided for the rights of shipwrecked sailors and refueling rights at two Japanese ports. It was the beginning of European engagement with Japan, involving most of the major powers—notably Russia and Great Britain. The internal Japanese debate over modernization crested with a two-year civil war and the return of the emperor in the so-called Meiji Restoration. Suddenly Japan was quite literally on the march—and more important, in terms of naval developments, sailing to sea. Japan’s industrial base sprinted into the late nineteenth century, rapidly developing significant military capability in its army and navy. Midshipmen were sent to Great Britain and the United States for naval educations, and the dockyards of Japan began to produce very capable, large warships. The Pacific, after centuries of being seen as a vast empty buffer zone, started to loom on the Japanese geopolitical map as a potential zone of conquest. In terms of naval strategy, the Japanese, unsurprisingly, began to think like Great Britain. Like the British, they were an island nation hanging off the coast of a huge continent, and they worried about China and Russia, the great land powers. Because Korea was essentially a strip of buffer zone between themselves and the Chinese, it became logical in their eyes that they should dominate and hold it as a means of putting space between themselves and the vastly larger Chinese Empire. This led to the first of two important wars for Japan—both of which had significant naval components—the Sino-Japanese War of 1894.",

    "text": "It began when Japan’s navy attacked a Chinese troop convoy heading to reinforce Chinese troops in Korea—before war was declared, by the way—demonstrating the propensity to seize on surprise that they would again use five decades later in attacking the United States at Pearl Harbor. The war was short and sharp, and Japanese naval forces comported themselves well. Of note, the naval tactical debate of the period was about whether massive armor or heavy guns were most important in maritime combat, and the Battle of Yalu did not clearly demonstrate the superiority of either. What did emerge was the efficacy of using maneuverability and speed, as the Japanese did under Admiral Sukeyuki Ito. He split his force into a “Flying Squadron” of fast ships and a slower but still capable main squadron, and was able to rake the Chinese ships throughout the engagement with more rapid fire from faster ships. Over the next few months, the war became a rout, and ended in 1895 with Japan consolidating its possession of Korea, Formosa, and various other islands. In terms of geostrategic position, Japan was in the driver’s seat in the eastern Pacific. Now it needed to shore up its northern flank, which led to war with Russia. • • • THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY the cause of the Russo-Japanese War. After Japan’s victory over China, it was Russia that pushed against the Japanese Empire, demanding the demilitarization of the Korean Peninsula and taking Port Arthur as a warm-weather port. The Russians cooperated with other European powers and pushed hard against Japan’s expansion. This led to a war in 1904 for which the Russians were unprepared both militarily and politically. Militarily, the Russian fleet was split all around the periphery of that vast state and needed time to consolidate its forces. Politically, the rumblings that would eventually lead to the Russian Revolution and the fall of the czar were already apparent, and the ruling claque in St. Petersburg could not fully focus on the external conflict that was brewing on Russia’s Pacific coast. The Japanese, although numerically inferior, were able to concentrate their forces and attack early, preventing the Russians from building up strategically to challenge them. Fresh off the defeat of the Chinese fleet, the Japanese fleet again launched its first powerful attack before war was declared—a night torpedo raid conducted by Japanese destroyers that damaged important Russian warships caught in harbor. Despite the arrival of a dynamic new Russian admiral, Stepan Makarov (who died in a mine strike shortly thereafter), and the long sail of the Baltic Squadron to Pacific waters, the Russians never gained the tactical upper hand, and with the help of the interior strategic position and relatively newer technology, the Japanese prevailed. The Russians ended up losing their Pacific fleet and the key base of Port Arthur in January 1905. The final blow to Russia in the Pacific came when the Baltic Squadron was destroyed in May 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima, losing fifty of the fifty-three ships that had sailed from the Baltic beginning in October of the previous year. Faced with this complete loss of their fleet, the Russians were forced to settle the war in an agreement negotiated by U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt—for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Russians lost the war because they were outfought tactically in each engagement, but mainly because they failed strategically to concentrate their forces and were defeated piecemeal. This, by the way, constituted a crucial lesson for the United States on the importance of building a Panama Canal—otherwise the U.S. fleet would be essentially separated for months by the necessity to sail around the southern tip of South America to combine forces. An interesting side note was that the age- old principle of warship captains’ “striking their colors” and surrendering their ships was practiced for the last time in the Russo-Japanese War by the Russians. When the commanders came home, they were court-martialed and sentenced to death, ending for all intents and purposes the idea of surrender. Today, in the U.S. Navy and most other naval forces, the philosophy is definitely not one of striking the colors in gracious surrender, but rather “don’t give up the ship” and be willing to fight to the end.",

    "text": "It was the occupation and buildup of the Hawaiian Islands that truly vaulted the United States into power in the Pacific. Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu, is a spectacular natural harbor, and I can vividly remember the first time I sailed into it in the late 1970s. I was still a very inexperienced deck watch officer, and the captain decreed that I should take the conn into port. It was blowing hard, and the breeze worried me as I tried to line up the ship and glide into the berth, something I’d watched my very salty captain do several times. I had foolishly declined to use an offered tug, and didn’t heed the advice of the experienced harbor pilot who was there to advise us: I wanted to do it all by myself, like a defiant toddler. Unfortunately for me, I simply kept too much “way” on the ship (meaning we were moving too fast) and managed to bang the stern hard against the pier, scraping off a lot of paint and putting a small, insignificant, but deeply embarrassing dent in the after starboard quarter of the ship. My captain sidled over and offered an observation from Admiral Ernest King, the tall, hard-driving Navy leader during the Second World War: “The mark of a great ship handler is never getting into a situation requiring great ship handling”—in other words, use the tugs and listen to the pilot. Lesson learned. After recovering my composure, I walked around the beautiful naval station later that day and realized that I was in America’s gateway to the Pacific, and the heart of the U.S. Navy. So much of the Navy’s modern ethos is tied up with the Pacific campaigns of World War II, and when I thought in those long ago days of the legendary officers who led the service through the war, I contemplated how comparatively small and circumscribed my own career would probably be —the cold war of the 1970s didn’t seem to offer much chance of massive fleet combat. Admirals like Nimitz, Spruance, Halsey, Kinkaid, and the other giants of the Pacific War had a sense of the vast landscape of the ocean that permitted them to construct the enormous, sweeping, island-hopping campaign that ultimately defeated the Japanese Empire. So much of the Navy’s mental map begins at Pearl Harbor and opens out from there to the endless distances of the ocean; so it was fitting and shattering at the same time to be attacked without warning in early December 1941 as war came to the United States. In order to understand the severity and totality of the Pacific Theater of World War II, you need to imagine the vast scale of the region and pair it with the fact that for the first time in history, military operations would cover the far reaches of the Pacific north of the equator and a good distance south. As the late William Manchester illustrates clearly in his excellent biography of five-star general of the Army Douglas MacArthur, American Caesar, the area of operations “covered mileage equivalent to that from the English Channel to the Persian Gulf—twice the farthest conquests of Alexander, Caesar, or Napoleon”—a comparison the ego-driven general would have enjoyed. That vast emptiness, which had taken outrigger canoes decades and steamships months to cross, could now be traversed in weeks. Technology did not just increase the power of ships but added new dimensions to war. Above the water, aircraft and radar altered the calculus of range. Below the surface, submarines could menace military ships and civilian shipping alike with little to no warning. The Pacific Ocean’s first experience as an arena of total war came at a time when war at sea was suddenly profoundly different from ages past.",

    "text": "The early morning hours of December 7, 1941, on Hawaii were punctuated by the sound of airplane propellers and air raid sirens. Japanese naval aviation launched what was the largest air attack in history at that time. Planned by the brilliant and colorful Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, a graduate of Harvard and lover of American culture, the Pearl Harbor raid devastated both the U.S. fleet in harbor and its ground-based aircraft. But the jewels of the U.S. fleet, the aircraft carriers that were the primary target of the raid, were, by a stroke of dumb luck, out of the area when the attack happened and spared destruction. The battleships Arizona, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and California were not so lucky—caught in port on a quiet Sunday with much of their crews ashore, they were pounded by the Japanese and sunk. My wife, Laura, is today the “ship’s sponsor” for a new Navy destroyer, the USS John Finn, named for a Pearl Harbor Medal of Honor recipient, a high honor of which she is justifiably proud. She christened the ship in 2015 and will be part of the ship’s commissioning as well, continuing to have a relationship with the captain and crew throughout the life of the vessel. As a result, we have spent a fair amount of time learning about those terrible hours as an unexpected strike literally blew up the gorgeous harbor before the unbelieving eyes of Navy sailors. Chief Petty Officer John Finn organized a machine gun nest and returned fire with a “pickup” crew of sailors, receiving many shrapnel wounds in the process. He fought proudly through the rest of the war, and lived to be more than one hundred years old, always remembering the way the world changed forever on that quiet Sunday morning. That same day, on the other side of the Pacific, 5,500 miles away from Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces assaulted the United States in the Philippines. Just as in Hawaii, ground-based aircraft in the Philippines were devastated by the Japanese air assault. Unlike Hawaii, the Philippines were not one of the world’s most isolated island chains. Their proximity to occupied Indochina meant that Japan’s air assault could be followed by a ground invasion. Despite valiant resistance by American forces in the mountain redoubt of Corregidor on the Bataan Peninsula, the islands fell and would remain occupied until 1945. The Japanese war machine was churning in high gear and had not lost a battle. Things looked bleak in early 1942 for the United States and its Pacific allies. American fortunes turned upward at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese war plan conceived of surprise attacks across the vast Pacific in order to dislocate American efforts and put Japan in the best position possible to deal with America’s demographic and industrial superiority. But in the waters around the small island of Midway, the United States was victorious despite having far fewer ships on hand in the early days of the war. Through another stroke of luck (just as at Pearl Harbor), the American carriers remained hidden from the",

    "text": "Japanese because a mechanical failure delayed the departure of a Japanese reconnaissance plane by fifteen minutes. Unsure of the exact location of the U.S. fleet, the Japanese commanders nonetheless decided to switch the weapons carried by their planes from bombs (to target the American fortresses on Midway Island) to torpedoes (to target the American fleet). The cat-and-mouse game came out in the Americans’ favor as the Japanese aircraft were caught on the decks of their carriers in mid-transition between armaments thanks to the fifteen-minute delay. These aircraft were nearly defenseless and were largely destroyed on deck. The result was a catastrophe for the Japanese as four of Japan’s carriers, the same ones that had participated in the Pearl Harbor raid, were sent to the bottom of the Pacific along with Japan’s hopes of holding out against America’s numerical superiority later in the war. As one of the Japanese combatants at Midway, Commander Masatake Okumiya (later a lieutenant general in the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force), said in the book Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan, “The Pacific War was started by men who did not understand the sea and fought by men who did not understand the air.” With the victory at Midway, the Americans could begin to advance across the Pacific in two prongs. The first prong, led by the Navy under Admiral Chester Nimitz, went across the North Pacific by hopping from island to island, using the islands once coveted as coaling stations as refueling points for ships and aircraft. Meanwhile, the South Pacific campaign was led by the Army general Douglas MacArthur, pushing up from his exile in Australia back toward the Philippines. The people fighting under his command found conditions as brutal as their compatriots in the North Pacific; the jungles of Indonesia and New Guinea bore deadly traps and virulent diseases. Those same passages of water like the Torres Strait, which one day I would be so nervous about navigating, were then full of Japanese defenses that posed a vastly more lethal threat than simply submerged reefs. The going was hard for both campaigns. But the slow, methodical pace yielded fruit, resources were cut off from the Japanese, U.S. industrial might began to tell, and Japan’s strategic options were increasingly foreclosed. Japan’s eventual capitulation was inevitable, although the island-by-island defenses were at times fanatical. The prospect of a land invasion of the home islands was predicted to cost enormous casualties on both sides—leading to the decision to use nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The long war, culminating in the two atomic bombs, the firebombing of Tokyo, and the subsequent psychological impact of the occupation, headed up by General MacArthur, devastated the Japanese home islands. For Japan, it would be a long period of rebuilding and a withdrawal from global military and security affairs for many years.",

    "text": "It is worth remembering the other two admirals who led the fight in the Pacific, serving under the iconic Nimitz: Admiral William “Bull” Halsey (although he hated the nickname) and Admiral Raymond Spruance. Halsey’s life was brilliantly captured in Admiral Bill Halsey: A Naval Life by Thomas Alexander Hughes, and Spruance’s equally well in The Quiet Warrior by Thomas Buell. The two men could not have been more different: Halsey impulsive, tempestuous, and loud, while Spruance was quiet, cerebral, and deeply reflective. But Nimitz harnessed their different personalities and skill sets and together they led the grandest naval campaign in history, equal to the challenges of distance, time, and determined resistance. Their names remain irrevocably bound to the Pacific Ocean, and will remain so as long as sailors go to sea in warships. Sadly, conflict would not disappear from the region as the Korean War would break out several years after the end of World War II, and of course the U.S. war in Vietnam would follow just over a decade later. But on the vast expanse of ocean itself, the Pacific once again became peaceful. To be sure, there were cold war tensions above and below the waves. The Soviet navy, under the long tenure of Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, expanded its presence in the Pacific for the first time since Russia’s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Submarines armed with nuclear warheads prowled the oceans to provide a stealthy nuclear deterrent while surface ships on both sides tried their best to find and track their opponents. But the islands and the peoples themselves were largely untouched. The period of U.S. trusteeship over the islands it seized from Japan in the western Pacific morphed into the Compact of Free Association, an agreement with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau, which continues to this day. The return of peace, the economic revival of Japan, and the emergence of new economic powerhouses in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong led transpacific trade to overtake transatlantic trade for the first time in the 1980s. That trend also continues. Are we living in a Pacific Century? It is hard to say. Certainly the Obama administration thought so, announcing a “pivot to the Pacific” several years ago that ended up being more sound than light given events in the Middle East and the resurgence of Russia. But the Pacific region still boasts most of the world’s largest and most powerful countries, and economic power is moving inexorably that way. The United States, China, Japan, and Russia all frequently call themselves Pacific powers, and the region is home to a host of other vibrant countries as well, including Australia, Korea, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, Colombia, and Chile. Almost half of the world’s trade happens along the Pacific Rim. And this is just the beginning, especially as India begins to engage in the Pacific in more significant ways. Countries across the Pacific Rim are developing ways to spur economic development of the region, whether it is through the TransPacific Partnership (an agreement that I hope one day will be ratified by all parties) or China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (which I hope evolves into a responsible actor), to unlock the region’s potential.",

    "text": "Although the Pacific has a great deal of potential, it is still a region of great risk. Overfishing remains a dangerous strain on the sustainability of global fish stocks, as does the continued increase of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Human pollution is taking a toll on the region’s ecosystem with a Texas-size island of plastic circulating both above and below the surface of the Pacific. On the environmental front, the Pacific Ocean experiences terrible typhoons that menace the region, particularly the areas on the front lines such as the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The increasing frequency of these storms (regarded by many scientists as the result of global climate change) will be a source of untold suffering and economic backsliding unless the players in the region make sensible investments in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) capabilities. Military and civilian agencies around the region need to work together to ensure that they are equipped to deal with these challenges. On the geopolitical and security front, one powerful indicator worth watching closely is the increasingly tense state of the ongoing arms race around the Pacific —which is real and growing. It will have a tendency to increase the possibility of open conflict in the region, and will require delicate diplomacy as military options tempt nations to use the military forces upon which they have spent a great deal of national wealth. And the vast majority of the systems are designed to be used either on, below, or from the sea to attack neighbors around the rim of the western Pacific.",

    "text": "Data from 2013 to the present reveal a preference to modernize systems rather than simply increase the size of the active force within a country. The trends in the macrodata are striking. According to The Military Balance, defense spending in Asia broadly (including India) rose 9 percent, from $326 billion to $356 billion from 2013 to 2015. As points of comparison, defense spending over the same period of time in the United States fell 6 percent, from $633 to $597 billion, and in Europe fell 12 percent, from $281 billion to $246 billion. How do we temper this arms race and ensure the security of the Pacific Rim? North Korea, the most unpredictable and dangerous nation on the Pacific Rim, has more than doubled its military spending to about $10 billion from 2013 to 2015. While it is notoriously difficult to assess the actual spending inside this isolated nation, recent nuclear tests combined with long-range missile testing and road-mobile launchers are obvious causes for concern. The North Koreans will continue to prioritize high levels of defense spending, even in the face of harsh new sanctions and a weakened economic environment—the young leader, Kim Jong-un, knows that only through military might will he retain his grip on power internally and maintain some level of influence in the region. China is the source of a disproportionately large portion of the increase in Pacific Ocean defense spending. China increased its defense spending by 26 percent to almost $147 billion between 2013 and 2016—and these numbers tell just part of the story; actual defense spending may well be more than $200 billion. The most visible display of China’s aggressive approach is the construction of artificial islands that serve as a handful of “3,000-acre aircraft carriers” (a U.S. 100,000-ton aircraft carrier is only 7 acres, by the way) on permanent station in the disputed regions of the South China Sea. This policy decision puts China at odds with many nations throughout the region. Building radar and missile systems as well as airfields on its artificial islands is another key investment. Other Chinese technological and strategic advances can be seen in China’s investment in advanced fighters such as the J-20 and the J-31, the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile known as the “carrier killer,” and its own nascent attempts at building an aircraft carrier fleet. These advances, when combined with its focus on offensive cyber, will enable China to push past its current so-called antiaccess/area denial (A2/AD) strategy to a more active defense, which would improve its ability to project offensive power. This will be a game changer in the region. Strategically, China is by far the biggest military spender in the region, but must also cover more territory both ashore and at sea than other Asian nations. The shift from ”peaceful development” to the notion of “active defense” is likely designed to mask internal problems and attempt to shift the focus of its population away from its own contradictions to external challenges. Capable missiles like the DF-21D alter the risk calculation for the United States, especially for carriers. Finally, there is quite a bit of focus on China’s aircraft carrier program. Chinese carriers are not competitive relative to those of the United States. However, as a “prestige platform,” they are symbolically important and conceivably useful in maritime combat against smaller powers in the region. The irony here is that China’s carrier is threatened by the very same A2/AD technologies it champions as Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam all up their game in that regard. Strategically speaking, the Chinese carrier program is not a game changer, but it will unnerve many smaller neighbors. Given all of this, it is important to think about American capabilities and potential responses at sea. The United States, with its six heavy nuclear-powered carriers and dozens of sophisticated air defense cruisers and destroyers plus long-range bombers operating from Guam, still has a powerful maritime position in the region. The construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea plus the increased capability of the long-range ship attack missiles by China shift, but do not fully reverse, the balance of power in Asia, especially given the strength of U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea.",

    "text": "Other nations in and around the Pacific are likewise ramping up spending, including Japan, which announced an increase to its 2016 defense budget, the first such increase in more than a decade. The stated policy focus of Japan’s drive for security is “seamless integration” with the United States. Japan is adding significant missile defense, airborne surveillance, and advanced aircraft to its already highly capable forces. Another ambitious capability acquisition includes the desire to field an Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade by 2017. This capability will integrate ground, naval, air, cyber, and space domains. Japan’s technological edge makes it the second most powerful navy in the world, and its air force and army are quite capable as well. Ensuring that its security policy matches its defense capacity and capability enhances its importance to the United States in a collective defense scenario. Although Japan’s record defense budget of $42 billion in 2016 is relatively low when compared with China’s, its focus is clear and local and will reduce operational seams to complement its most important treaty ally: the United States. Japan has reduced spending for its Ground Self-Defense Force and increased both Air and Maritime Self-Defense Forces—clearly showing that its priorities are aligned with its policy shift to support collective defense. These investments are relevant in a confrontational scenario with China. On the other hand, China’s spending on defense must cover more territory and focus on internal security. While the exact ratio of external-to-internal defense spending is unclear, we do know that internal defense concerns will continue to act as a brake on its external ambitions. South Korea continues to invest in technology while increasing the quality (as opposed to quantity) of its personnel. Although the South Korean defense budget increased 6 percent from 2013 to 2015, it shed 4 percent of its manpower in the same period. It is acquiring major systems: upgrading its fleet of F-16 jet fighters, seeking an F-X program to develop a sixth-generation fighter, and developing a new unmanned airborne vehicle for its army and marine corps. While still reliant on the United States for air and missile defense, South Korea continues to pursue a Korean-operated air and missile defense in light of the threats it faces from Pyongyang. Meanwhile, Australia, another staunch ally of the United States, has increased defense spending by about 7 percent and focused on combat aircraft and ships, including upgrades to its diesel submarine force. While beyond the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean, India is notable as the only country, besides China, that increased the size of its active military personnel roster between 2013 and 2015 (2 percent, the same as China). This came in tandem with a significant increase to its military budget. A central focus of this increase serves to drive defense production within India’s borders in",

    "text": "Much has been made about the twenty-first century being the Age of the Pacific. And indeed, many metrics would suggest that the Pacific—especially when considered as the Indo-Pacific, to include the waters surrounding South Asia and the Indian subcontinent—will be the dominant sea space of this unfolding century. The Obama administration’s famous “pivot to the Pacific” (now tempered as a “rebalance to the Pacific” in the wake of events in the Middle East and Europe) seemed to validate that concept. Yet no matter where the world is headed in terms of the importance of the oceans relative to one another, there is one inescapable fact about the Atlantic: it will always be the cradle of our civilization as we know it, especially when the Mediterranean is included in its broad remit, and also when we consider that it formed the nexus of exchange between European nations, newly formed North American states, Latin American civilizations, the Caribbean, and Africa.  The Pacific Ocean is undergoing a significant military buildup. China’s navy is growing rapidly, both in size and capability, causing concern among its neighbors. India is also modernizing its fleet, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” initiative. New procurement runs the gamut across sectors: new tactical helicopters, new Rafale fighters (despite continuing issues in the negotiations between France and India), and additional heavy airlift transports—with a significant uptick in spending on American systems. Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and other actors are likewise stepping up their defense spending with a focus on a potential war at sea. This maritime arms race in Asia comes from each state’s perception of external threats. A worst-case scenario would see the region falling into the so-called Thucydides trap, where miscalculation of intentions leads to armed conflict—either between the United States and China globally, or possibly between China and Japan in the region. The best chance we have to avoid conflict rests in maritime diplomacy. This must begin with a continued high-level U.S.-Chinese conversation about points of friction, from artificial islands (and the resultant “freedom of navigation” patrols by the United States) to cyber intrusions to balance of trade disagreements. The United States should encourage cooperation between its allies in the region (i.e., Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and others) in a way that does not create an Asian cold war between China and a U.S.-led bloc of nations. Additionally, Pacific Rim nations should be encouraged to use their militaries for exercises, training, and other confidence-building measures—like the U.S.-organized RIMPAC annual exercise, which has seen solid Chinese participation. This helps build confidence and military-to-military cooperation. And the nations of the region can also work together on soft-power projects using their militaries for disaster relief, humanitarian operations, and medical diplomacy in the coming decades. The Pacific Ocean arms race is real and it is dangerous. Transparency, cooperation, and diplomacy can mitigate the potential for open conflict. Now is the time to put such mechanisms in place—before nations are tempted to reach for the military instrument and exercise hard power in addressing their geopolitical concerns.",

    "text": "Despite the tensions and the risks in our modern Pacific Rim, the odds are better than even that the region will develop peacefully. None of the societies have a long tradition of imperialist behavior, and most have found ways to cooperate and collaborate in a variety of dimensions, despite the arms buildup. Other than North Korea, which is by far the most dangerous actor in the region, there seems little likelihood of any of the nations’ moving to open warfare as an instrument of policy. There will probably be some flash points in and around the South China Sea, but the chances of nation-on-nation high-level combat are low. The Pacific Ocean that I sailed into in the 1970s as a naïve, young, and unformed officer as the cold war unfolded was a more dangerous place. Today’s major actors—Japan, Korea, China, the United States—all know well the devastation of a Pacific war at sea. The strength of commerce, depth of culture, and quality of human capital of the nations in the region all point to the potential for a positive trajectory of growth. While the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula present challenges and tension, hopefully the Pacific will live up to its name as the twenty-first century sails along; much will depend on the willingness of the actors around its vast littoral to work together around the ocean that binds their fate together in so many ways. On the other hand, the potential for an explosive war—perhaps on the Korean Peninsula, or between Japan and China—looms on the horizon like a tempest headed our way. The twenty-first century in the Pacific has many unexpected twists ahead.",

    "text": "When I think of the Atlantic Ocean, I am occasionally reminded of Louis Malle’s small masterpiece of a film, Atlantic City, which came out in 1980. Set in that city, it features an aging Burt Lancaster as a fading mobster named Lou seeking to help a young Canadian on the run, played by Susan Sarandon. Musing on the beauty and power of the Atlantic Ocean when he was a young up-and-comer, Lou says in all sincerity, “You should have seen the Atlantic Ocean back then.” Somehow I doubt the Atlantic had changed a great deal over the few decades of Lou’s life, but its power to impress has been with mankind for centuries. The Atlantic Ocean is the world’s second largest, after the Pacific, covering more than 40 million square miles (more than ten times the size of the United States*) and about 20 percent of the earth’s surface. The name derives from the ancient Greek mythological character Atlas, who in legend supported the world on his shoulders. The ocean is really composed of two distinct regions, often referred to as “basins,” one on either side of the equator, and overall forms the letter S if viewed from space. Any casual observer looking at the west coast of Africa and the east coast of South America would quickly guess that the two continents drifted apart at some point in prehistory, the space between them creating the landscape of the ocean’s sea bottom. The Atlantic has two key tributary seas—the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, as well as an important strategic gap to the north (the Greenland-Iceland–United Kingdom gap), which was a nautical zone of competition and near conflict in the cold war. To the south, it is connected with its two sister oceans, the Pacific and the Indian, by a relatively small strait, the Drake Passage to the Pacific, and by a broad expanse of ocean water to the Indian Ocean in the east. Including the two tributary seas, it is bordered by nearly a hundred nations and territories, ranging in size and economic power from the vast scope and scale of the United States and Brazil to tiny countries like Belize and Montserrat.",

    "text": "…and killing submarines—a so-called multimission warship. Given that the ship was named for Captain John Barry, a Revolutionary War hero of Irish descent, we were sent across the North Atlantic in the early summer of 1994, bound initially for goodwill visits in Ireland. After a brief stop there, we would head into potential combat operations in the Arabian Gulf. As we sailed across the broad expanse of the rolling Atlantic over that Memorial Day, I was struck by the differences and similarities we experienced compared with early voyagers. We had all the comforts of home—good hot food and showers, pleasant bunk rooms, communications with family and friends back home (although limited compared with today), plenty of fuel brought out to us at sea by wide-ranging oilers (ships designated to act as at-sea gas stations). While our accommodations were not luxurious, compared with a Viking long ship we were living like kings at sea, sailing in a well-heeled palace—a very different world. But the impetus was the same: we sailed on a mission for our country, left our families for a long, seven-month voyage, faced real danger in our ultimate destination—the volatile Arabian Gulf in the time of Saddam Hussein—and felt between us the same bond that sailors have felt going back two thousand years or more. We were hardly Vikings, nor faced the sea in such a dramatic way, but we were in every sense part of the long story of the Atlantic Ocean. We knew where we were headed, but not what would unfold. In the end, that uncertainty and sense of adventure is a significant part of what draws many of us to the oceans.\n\nThe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw key improvements in sailing technology. The frail, single-mast Viking ship—which was really a simple adaptation of what the Greeks and Romans used in the Mediterranean nearly a millennium earlier—gave way to multiple masts, a bowsprit to carry sail in front of the ship, and a handful of sails. The compass came into general use, as well as simple means of measuring speed using knotted ropes (hence the term “knots” for the speed of a ship). The necessity of “dead reckoning,” which is using landmarks ashore to plot a course, was gradually resolved by using celestial means to navigate, which improved gradually. As trade goods—especially spices, gold, jewelry, perfumes, dyes, and gems—began to flow, the appetite for longer and longer voyages increased.",

The most iconic of these intrepid figures was Infante Henrique of Portugal, Duke of Viseu, who earned the sobriquet Prince Henry the Navigator. He lived in the first half of the fifteenth century and launched many expeditions throughout the early 1400s that sailed down the Atlantic and explored the coast of Africa… Their great voyages of discovery inspired Europeans, exploited Africans (often with extreme brutality), and created the connections between the Atlantic and Indian oceans over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Some have called this the dawn of the Oceanic Age. My first sea voyage into Lisbon and up the Tagus River was in 1962 on SS Constitution, while our family was headed to Athens for my father’s three-year tour as the assistant naval attaché. An infantry officer at the time, he was not particularly enamored of sea voyages, but I remember loving the experience of being under way. Our first port after departing Boston was Lisbon, and we sailed up the Tagus on a hot summer day. Even as a seven-year-old boy, I was enchanted by the ships swaying on the waterfront, the wide and beautiful river, the gleaming white tower from which each of the Portuguese captains after the early 1500s departed on the voyages that opened the world. Decades later, I would return to Lisbon as a grizzled four-star admiral with many commands at sea and too many sea miles under my belt to remember—and the magic of that tower felt the same.",

    "section": "The Rise of Atlantic Power",
    "text": "Sea power stayed central to maritime warfare. The Seven Years’ War in the mid-1700s can be regarded as the first truly global conflict, with France and England fighting in the Atlantic and its tributary seas, the Mediterranean and Caribbean, as well as in the Pacific and ashore in all of those locations. Britain developed a strategy that served it well for the next three hundred years of aligning with a continental European power to create a geopolitical balance against its major foe—in this case France. The English would hit at various points around the world, including a central campaign against French colonies globally and against France’s fleet in the Atlantic, while holding French ships in port by blockading and counting on continental allies (in this case, Prussia) to threaten France ashore. Sometimes known as “Pitt’s Plan” after the creative geostrategic genius William Pitt, who conceived it, some variation on this approach continued to be seminal for England for the next three centuries. France tried to respond by defending its colonies and threatening to invade England. In the end, British mastery of the seas was decisive, and Britain ended with possession of Canada and significant gains in the Caribbean Sea. The Seven Years’ War demonstrated the power of a global naval force and control of the sea lanes of communication as the key to winning wars. What is notable in the gradual progress of the Europeans across the Atlantic is the degree to which exploration led inexorably to transformation. In addition to the technical improvements in sailing technique, sails, rigging, and hull form that flowed from the requirement for longer voyages and the urgent need to sail opposing the wind, the other major transformation was the result of the discovery and return to Europe of new agrarian products. Diet began to change in Europe as a result of the flora and fauna hauled back, initially as curiosities, then increasingly as commercial products. This has been called the Columbian Exchange or the New World Exchange. Just as the Europeans brought “guns, germs, and steel” to Africa and the Americas across the Atlantic Ocean (as writer Jared Diamond describes in his classic work of the same name), the New World sent products back. Tomatoes, potatoes, rubber, vanilla, chocolate, corn, and tobacco came from the New World, while Europe sent onions, citrus, bananas, mangos, wheat, and rice. Livestock sailed largely from Europe to the Americas, fundamentally changing lives there—horses, pigs, donkeys, dogs, cats, bees, and chickens were all introduced as a result of the Atlantic bridge. Discovery of the two new continents created new trade routes for the Europeans, including, over time, the flow of human slaves to the Americas to work plantations (notably sugar, cotton, and tobacco) with finished products then returning to Europe. This “Middle Passage” of human slaves was tragic and horrific, and indeed has come to reflect the worst moments of Atlantic history. Slavery formed but one part of an enormous migration across the Atlantic that has continued to this day, resulting in the eventual settlement of more than a billion people in the Americas today. All of this helped create the basis in the eighteenth century for the Industrial Revolution, which was enhanced by the trade in raw materials and the flow of humans across the Atlantic. With the increase in trade and commerce, and the attendant rise in industrial capability, came great-power geopolitics. Gradually, the five imperial powers of the Atlantic Ocean—France, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal—embroiled themselves in a series of colonial wars that required the Atlantic to serve as a maritime battlefield, a logistic bridge to support military campaigns in the Americas, and a highway for the economic advancement that fueled the wars. Over the next two centuries, what might be termed the “Wars of the Atlantic” were fought both ashore in the Americas and in Europe, as well as at sea. Essentially the competition was over the products of the New World—the riches that flowed from gold, silver, slaves, sugar, tobacco, fish, furs, manufactured goods, and the markets themselves. The imperial powers realized that what we would call today “sea control” was an essential element of national power. While a coherent theoretical framework to describe their strategies would have to wait another couple of centuries and the writings of Alfred Thayer Mahan, this was sea power at play on a broader scale than had ever been seen in human history. The rise of great oceangoing vessels—both commercial and warships—created the engine of sea control and power projection that came to dominate global politics for centuries and still exists today. All of that was birthed in the Atlantic Ocean.",

    "section": "The American Revolution and the Atlantic",
    "text": "In the United States, the relatively small region of New England began to develop as the first truly global maritime hub for the Americas. Rudimentary shipyards began to emerge in the decades leading up to the American Revolution, and the independence and wealth they generated were central to the ability of the colonies to eventually break away from the British crown. Naturally, the disputes at the heart of the revolution fell out of the Atlantic trade, from the imposition of taxation without representation to the growing sense of liberty and freedom owed to men and women who had sailed into the unknown and created a new political entity with increasingly different norms and behaviors. The trading routes grew increasingly complex, to include lumber, meat, grain, tar, resin, pitch, rice, and indigo by the middle of the 1700s; literally thousands of ships were engaged in this trade, with hundreds of warships protecting and escorting them, as well as fighting a series of skirmishes, battles, and wars at sea. Alongside this legitimate trade and military protection, of course, was a flourishing pirate culture centered in the Caribbean, an area that afforded many advantages to piratical activity, as we’ll see: many small inlets and bays, tiny islands, temperate weather most of the year, and the natural geopolitical chaos resulting from five national entities competing in a relatively small space. All of this trade, wealth, and geostrategic competition acted as a complex and combustible mix that was eventually ignited by the ideas of the Enlightenment. This helped create the conditions for the American Revolution, in which the Atlantic again played a major role. Following the French and Indian Wars (the North American portion of the Seven Years’ War), the British crown was in a less advantageous position, caught between unrest at home, continued anger and resentment on the part of fellow imperial power France, and a sense in the American colonies that their burden and obligation to Britain was too high a cost to bear. Gradually increasing taxes and tariffs led to significant unrest in the colonies, catalyzed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773—an act that did not go down well in Britain and led to further restrictions on the colonies, including the closure of the port of Boston. By 1775, the northern colonies in particular were in a state of rebellion, and the battles of Lexington and Concord (essentially shootings and skirmishes) led to full-blown war. No revolution in history has been embraced unanimously. About a third of the American population at the time of the revolution wanted to remain loyal to the crown, about a third were more or less ambivalent, and a third were strongly pro-independence at the outset. But once combat was joined in New England, the tide turned in the colonies and a revolutionary spirit strengthened. While the Americans hardly possessed a significant navy compared with Great Britain, they were aided by the French, still smarting from their losses in the French and Indian Wars and eager to weaken the position of their rival in the Americas. The colonists marshaled their small vessels and attacked British interests where and when they could—afloat on Lake Champlain and ashore into Canada. Surprisingly, they were also able to carry the war into British waters by deploying privateers and the first vessels of the Continental Navy. Massive British troop deployments to the colonies as well as total control over the Atlantic seaways took a toll on the lightly armed American ships. Americans quickly realized that British control over the Atlantic was a key element they had to overcome to be successful. Only when France entered the war in 1778 were the Americans able to begin to establish some level of what we would today call sea control in the approaches to our shores.",

    "section": "John Paul Jones and the War at Sea",
    "text": "By the 1780s, American naval officers, including the iconic John Paul Jones, had scored real victories at sea in the North Atlantic. Jones sailed into Irish and British waters, first in the Ranger and later in the Bonhomme Richard, conducting a guerre de course, or war against shipping. His small squadron of lightly armed ships attacked a British convoy and captured the heavily armed English ship Serapis in 1779. This was perhaps the most famous U.S. naval engagement of the revolution, in which the British captain asked Captain Jones —his ship nearly sunk under his feet—if he wanted to strike his colors (surrender to the enemy). His reply, “I have not yet begun to fight,” has been memorized by generations of midshipmen at Annapolis (including a young plebe named Stavridis in the summer of 1972). John Paul Jones, by the way, is probably the only famous American naval officer many citizens could name from the early days of the republic. He was quite widely traveled across the Atlantic. While he tends to be revered as the “father of the American navy,” in fact he was a mercenary who fought for both the United States and the Russian Empire, rising to the rank of rear admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy. He wasn’t particularly happy with the way he was treated (he was a prickly Scot) throughout the Revolutionary War and returned to Europe for better pay and larger commands, but was eventually outmaneuvered in court politics. In 1792, he died penniless in Paris and was buried in a French cemetery. His star rose considerably after his death, however, when Theodore Roosevelt took an interest in him and had him exhumed, and in 1905 Jones sailed once again across the Atlantic, in the American warship USS Brooklyn, escorted by three other cruisers. Jones was then buried with enormous pomp and circumstance, first in Bancroft Hall (home of the Brigade of Midshipmen at Annapolis), and ultimately in a gorgeous black marble crypt under the massive chapel at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. He is probably the only person who crossed the Atlantic over the course of three centuries, from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth. Luckily for the nascent United States, the French were trying to turn the tide of the battle by helping resupply American forces across the Atlantic, conducting harrying attacks on the British where they could, and drawing up plans for an invasion in the southern colonies. Ultimately, the French Marquis de Lafayette proved to be the reliable ally the colonies needed, conducting a decisive and vital campaign at Yorktown in southern Virginia. The battle—truly a campaign conducted over months—showed the value of sea power. First and foremost, it was enabled by sea control across the Atlantic; it also illustrated the strategic mobility that sea power can confer as the Americans were able to shift forces smoothly and apply combat power at the point of maximum need. As forces converged via sea on Yorktown in the late summer and early autumn of 1781, the naval fight in the Atlantic turned into a tough, close-in battle between British and French warships. The French mauled the British and forced them to sail north to try to bring more troops to the embattled British general ashore, Lord Cornwallis. But time was against the British, and Cornwallis was forced to surrender as a result of superior sea power—in this case supplied by the French, our oldest and first ally. By 1783, the British had greater geopolitical challenges and turbulence at home, and the Treaty of Paris ended the war and recognized the independence of the new United States, stretching from the Great Lakes to Florida. The Atlantic seacoast of the United States was our nation’s first and most prominent geographic feature, and our doorway to the world opened through it as we achieved our first real degree of independence.",

    "section": "The Napoleonic Wars and the Atlantic",
    "text": "The next great series of campaigns in which the Atlantic played the central role was the long conflict unleashed in Europe by the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. The long duel between Napoleon’s France and the nations he conquered or persuaded to fight with him against the coalition led by Great Britain rumbled along through the end of the 1700s and the first decade of the 1800s. It was a geopolitical fight that ultimately turned upon Britain’s use of sea power to maintain its independence, blockade French power, fight over distant colonies, and continue to function economically despite Napoleon’s domination of the continent. Perhaps the most iconic sailor in history, Britain’s Viscount Horatio Nelson, was a key figure in the long fight. He fought battles on all sides of the Atlantic—in the Caribbean, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean—and crossed it dozens of times in the course of the Napoleonic Wars. His two early successful battles against the French were crucial: in Egypt, the Battle of the Nile probably saved British India from French conquest, and in Denmark, he managed at the Battle of Copenhagen to force Napoleon to the bargaining table. His influence on the British navy is felt to this day. It is worth knowing that in this age of transparency and political correctness, Lord Nelson would never have passed a U.S. Senate confirmation process. He was subject to violent seasickness and had various other medical challenges. He was a short and scrawny figure, standing well under five feet six inches, who eventually lost both an eye and an arm in combat. Nelson had a long-running affair with Emma Hamilton, who might charitably be called a courtesan, with whom he fathered a daughter out of wedlock. He consistently took delight in countering the tight, regimented tactics of maritime combat at the time, and his ability to weld together a “band of brothers” from among the various sea captains serving under him was instrumental in creating the best fighting force ever to sail the oceans up to that day. What really mattered about Lord Nelson was his centrality to the fate of his nation in the latter part of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth; as a continental land power, France under Napoleon sought to dominate the maritime power of the world, Great Britain. He was fundamental to Great Britain’s ability to execute a classic maritime strategy of dominating the lanes of communication across the Atlantic and around the littoral seas of the European continent while maintaining economic vitality from colonies around the world. By 1805, Napoleon was actively seeking an invasion force to attack Great Britain.",

    "section": "The Influence of Sea Power on the Atlantic: Trafalgar and the Rise of the US Navy",
    "text": "The British pursued the French fleet (and its Spanish allies) vigorously, knowing full well that defeating it was the key to ensuring the safety—indeed, the sanctity—of the British Isles. The British knew that their strategic center of gravity (which has been described in war as “that about which all else revolves”) was the English Channel and the ability to control it via sea power. This pursuit led ultimately to one of the most famous sea battles in history, the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. Fought off the coast of Spain in the eastern center of the Atlantic Ocean, it brought together two massive battle fleets. Tactically it was notable for the production of Nelson’s memorandum on how to fight the battle, which he promulgated just before the fight. Nelson knew that he would not have clear and instantaneous communication with his nearly forty major warships, and that the fog of war and the probability of heavy weather would make precise command and control impossible. As he said in the memorandum, “Something must be left to chance; nothing is sure in a sea fight.” He lays out the basic direction and tactics of the fight, but then includes the most crucial line, one that is often quoted by sailors headed into combat: “In case signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy.” That spirit of independence in command, and the resultant tradition of taking action with real initiative, lives on in the U.S. and British navies—and in those of many allied forces—to this day.\nOn that October morning, the normally roiling Atlantic was strangely calm. Nelson deployed his forces in two long columns, spreading the nearly thirty ships out and bearing down on the Spanish and French fleets, seeking to force them to fight. Nelson was able to drive into the center of the enemy’s line. Just before the battle, Nelson wrote out a will and a prayer, which included the words, “May humanity after victory be the predominant feature of the British fleet.” He then launched a signal that any British sailor can quote: “England expects that every man will do his duty.” He certainly did, and tragically, he was killed by a sniper’s bullet a few hours later while he stood on the quarterdeck of his ship, fully exposed to enemy fire and wearing all his medals and decorations, inspiring his men. He died in agony belowdecks in his flagship, HMS Victory, as it rocked on the unnaturally calm Atlantic. The battle was a brilliant success, resulting in the capture of fifteen of the French and Spanish fleets’ most capable warships. Thus ended the attempts of Napoleon to invade the United Kingdom, demonstrating the “influence of sea power upon history,” as the American naval historian Alfred Thayer Mahan described it decades later in his classic work of maritime strategy. Ironically, the ultimate loser of Trafalgar, Napoleon, eventually ended his life deep in the southern Atlantic. After successfully escaping from his first exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba, he was defeated at Waterloo and sent far, far from Europe: to the tiny, volcanic island of St. Helena. A vastly diminished figure, Napoleon’s life closed in on him, dampening his exuberant demeanor and saddening his small retinue of loyal courtiers. A superb portrait of both the island and his final days is Julia Blackburn’s book The Emperor’s Last Island, which is as much about the island and the ocean as it is about Napoleon. Bonaparte died there in 1821 after six long years in exile on a tiny rock measuring five by ten miles. He spent much of his final years staring endlessly across the waves of the Atlantic, the one venue he could never conquer.\nThe next chapter of note in the geopolitical history of the Atlantic was the rise of the U.S. Navy, born of necessity in the turbulent years after the revolution. The two principal political parties of the time, Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists and Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans (who, by the way, were not the fathers of today’s Republican Party; that party devolved from the Whigs and other groups), were on opposite sides of the “big navy” issue. The Federalists wanted a serious seagoing navy, arguing that American interests would be expanding over time and that the simple existence of the Atlantic Ocean would be insufficient to protect the young nation. Jefferson felt that the real expansion of the United States would be to the south and west, and that agriculture, not nautical concerns, would be at the heart of the new nation’s business. In essence, they were both right—and thus the U.S. Navy was grudgingly constructed in stops and starts over the several decades following the revolution.",

    "text": "The Navy Department was created in the final years of the eighteenth century in time for an undeclared war with France (the so-called Quasi-War, fought largely in the Caribbean from 1798 to 1800). Despite Jefferson’s aversion to relatively big ships, a declaration of war against the United States by the Barbary pirates forced the by then president to launch a series of expeditions to the Mediterranean to deal with pirates preying on U.S. shipping in the first decade of the nineteenth century. In 1803, young, aggressive naval heroes like Commodore Edward Preble and Lieutenant Stephen Decatur burnished their strong reputations through their campaigns in the Mediterranean, operating from a base on the island of Sicily. Eventually, this foray across the Atlantic ended in victory for the young United States. Yet despite this outcome and the seemingly obvious lesson that real sea power was necessary to help guard the nation, the Republicans in office decided that a strategy of small ships—gunboats—and coastal forts could be used to protect the Atlantic coastline. Such forts still exist in a chain running all along the eastern Atlantic seacoast of the United States. They proved quite inadequate, of course, during the War of 1812 with Great Britain. It was lucky that the early construction program for six medium-size frigates—lionized in Ian Toll’s brilliant book Six Frigates—was completed by this point despite the emphasis by the administration on the gunboat-and-fortress strategy. Soon the Atlantic was again a battleground for the United States and Great Britain, in a war that stemmed from lingering resentments on both sides after the successful revolution and was catalyzed by the boarding of an American warship, USS Chesapeake, by sailors from HMS Leopard in 1807. The Brits came aboard after firing on an unprepared Chesapeake and forcibly removed four sailors suspected of being British deserters (only one of them was proved to be so). This enraged the American public and, coupled with trade restrictions levied by Britain on the neutral U.S. merchant fleet, led to a high level of tension between the two nations. By 1812, events had spun out of control and the United States—with a navy that numbered a grand total of eighteen seagoing warships —declared war on the British Empire, with hundreds of heavy warships and centuries of nautical warfare experience. Fortunately for the United States, the British viewed the War of 1812 as a sideshow, and never devoted a significant level of sea power to prosecuting it. The British executed largely by blockade, while American warships tried to conduct raids on British maritime shipping. A series of small-scale battles on the Atlantic had some surprisingly successful outcomes for the Americans, with battles coming out roughly a draw over the years of the war. In the end, while good for American morale, the sea battles were not the drivers in determining the overall outcome of the conflict. The United States fared badly in the War of 1812 because of the combination of the effect of the British blockade on U.S. commerce and the successful invasion of the United States by British troops, who gleefully burned the capital of the young nation, Washington, D.C. While American maritime operations in the North were marginally successful, they did not sway the direction of the war. Fortunately for the Americans, the British had larger matters to deal with than their upstart former colonies. Eventually, given other pressing matters globally and war fatigue in Great Britain, the British were content to come to the negotiating table, ending the war and planting the seeds for the “special relationship” that continues to this day (albeit with occasional subsequent periods of tension between the Atlantic cousins).",

    "section": "The American Civil War at Sea",
    "text": "From the end of the War of 1812 to the Civil War, the Atlantic was relatively peaceful, and the world saw a period of less conflict after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Nevertheless, a different type of revolution (that of naval technology) was happening at sea, spurred by inventions and ideas flowing from the war years. Navies began the transition from sail to steam and started to apply serious levels of metal armor to the sides of their ships. Instead of smoothbore cannons that had to be brought to bear at extremely close range, rifled gun barrels led to great improvements in range and accuracy. The initial ideas of fire control, or the way in which guns are sighted using optical targeting systems, were developed and implemented. And instead of hammering home a charge with a muzzle loading system (a slow and ponderous process), the use of percussion-fired projectiles emerged—with significant gains in efficiency and rate of fire. Much of the testing and use of these new technologies happened on training ranges created off the Atlantic coasts of both Europe and the United States. While there were outbreaks of warfare in the littoral seas of the Atlantic —the Gulf of Mexico in the Mexican-American War, the Baltic and Black seas in the Crimean War—for the main part of this four-decade period the Atlantic was not the perennial battleground it had been for the preceding three centuries. However, that changed with the advent of the Civil War in the United States. The Atlantic became a zone of real conflict again in the 1860s as two American battle flotillas, one from the North and the other from the South (quite small by European standards), squared off on the inland lakes and rivers, the littoral and coastal waters, and occasionally the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The key tactic by the North was the immediate installation of a blockade, which it could put in place because it had the advantage of having inherited a preponderance of ships by virtue of the general loyalty of seagoing officers to the Union. As a result of the disparity in the number of ships between the two sides, the South never matched the North on a ship-by-ship basis. Instead, the South pursued a strategy of privateering and the offering of letters of marque, as well as commerce raiding on a selective basis. The Confederacy also tried to procure ships from a generally sympathetic Europe and attempted to convince other nations that the blockade existed only on paper—something that was true for a year or so before the North became more organized and systematic in enforcing it by putting its assortment of more than two hundred ships to sea over time. New technologies from the “ironclad” armored vessels on both sides (such as CSS Virginia and the oddly turreted, low-slung Union Monitor) and torpedoes (which are called mines today) were on display. Commerce raiding by the South had some impact (especially the morale-raising exploits of CSS Alabama under Captain Raphael Semmes), but could not in any sense turn the tide of the war. As was the case ashore, over time the vastly greater industrial might, employable population, and advanced technologies of the Union made the end more or less inevitable. The North prevailed at sea on the Atlantic as it did ashore, and the blockade was crucial in choking off the South’s ability to resist. While it mainly supported the North’s efforts on land, the Atlantic nevertheless allowed the North to implement a successful war strategy.",

    "text": "In much the same way that new technologies transformed the fight between the North and South during the Civil War, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century also transformed Americans’ relationship with the Atlantic. Advances in shipbuilding techniques expanded the zone of competition between nations beyond naval warfare; commerce in and of itself began to be a tool of statecraft. This was manifested at sea in the rise of various shipping lines and individual packet ships. SS James Monroe will sail into history as the first vessel to leave on a schedule regardless of wind and weather, and initial shipping lines included the Black Ball Line, the Red Star Line, and the Swallowtail Line, all of which began to become operational in the third decade of the 1800s. These were of course initially sailing ships, usually called clipper ships, and they competed for speed records. One of Donald McKay’s clippers, Lightning, sailed 436 miles in a day, the single-day longest distance recorded by a sailing vessel, and a record that still stands.* The net effect of these new technologies gave a certain psychological power to the growing sense that the seas in general were shrinking. This was especially true for the North Atlantic. As steam vessels became more commonplace by mid-century, the ocean appeared further reduced, facilitated by the advent of transatlantic telegraph cables that the increasingly big ships were able to place on the sea floor and operate with reliability by the 1860s. Before the cables became fully operational, normal communications had to be transported in a vessel, a voyage of generally ten to fourteen days. When telegraph cables became reliable, a message could flow across the Atlantic within minutes. Queen Victoria sent a telegram of congratulations to President James Buchanan to open the line, directed to his summer residence in the Bedford Springs Hotel in Pennsylvania. She said that she hoped the link would create “an additional link between the nations whose friendship is founded on their common interest and reciprocal esteem.” The president replied, “It is a triumph more glorious, because far more useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle. May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations, and an instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion, civilization, liberty, and law throughout the world.”* Despite these advances, it is worth remembering how challenging the sea remained for mariners. Even a casual student of the Atlantic knows the story of the doomed Titanic, the “unsinkable ship” that was lost after hitting an iceberg. Leaving aside the fairly accurate film and its associated doomed love story paralleling the fate of the ship, the sinking remains a cautionary tale of the hubris of man and the capricious nature of the high seas. As I sailed across the north Atlantic in the mid-1990s, a century and a half later, the story of",

    "section": "The Importance of Sea Power and the First World War",
    "text": "Titanic was not far from my mind—even in a high-tech, solid-steel, brand-new U.S. Navy destroyer. Following the short but bitter Spanish-American War, the next significant set of battles on the Atlantic were those of the First World War. The United States tried to avoid being pulled into the war, but eventually was drawn fully into the conflict. Fortunately, by that point in the nation’s history our navy had improved dramatically. This was a direct result of the combined strategic thinking of Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce and Captain (later rear admiral) Alfred Thayer Mahan and the energy and political advocacy of Theodore Roosevelt. Mahan and Luce conducted their collaboration at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and Mahan produced a series of seminal books that used the prism of history to describe the importance of sea power. Mahan became a sort of intellectual mentor to Roosevelt, who became the youngest president in American history in 1901. As president, Roosevelt drove a naval construction program that created a true blue-water navy of powerful battleships and cruisers. He pushed through the creation of the Panama Canal, intervened frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean, and used the emergence of new technologies to improve the sea power capabilities of the United States. Big battleships were able to speed through the waters at nearly 20 knots and were armed with massive eight-inch guns. Smokeless powder, greater range, and faster, more accurate torpedoes were also developed. The airplane was emerging, and Roosevelt’s policy to “speak softly and carry a big stick” specifically envisioned an oceangoing navy as the ultimate big stick. After the collapse of European alliances in 1914, “the lights went out in Europe” and the Atlantic again became a field of maritime battle. Both Britain and Germany possessed powerful fleets centered on battleships.  Most of the German ships had fairly limited cruising ranges, which further convinced the British that they were designed to attack England. As the two massive battle fleets of Great Britain and Imperial Germany each sought a “decisive fleet action,” the scene of potential battle became the North Sea. The two countries fought a series of inconclusive engagements, including at Dogger Bank in 1915 and at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Several Atlantic battles also took place in the far South Atlantic. Despite the actions at sea, the land armies quickly bogged down across the center of Europe and the war turned into a slugging match of attrition on land. This led the Allies to seek alternatives: they seized on the idea of a maritime campaign in the Mediterranean. With the urging of Winston Churchill, the British launched the Dardanelles/Gallipoli campaign. It was a fiasco. Nevertheless, these actions were of less strategic importance than the war against shipping waged by both sides. The Germans responded to a British blockade with their own U-boat campaign.",

By 1915, the U-boat campaigns had increased in strategic importance, and in May 1916 they sank the Lusitania. The killing of 128 Americans helped pull the United States into the war, although not immediately. The declaration of unrestricted U-boat warfare at the end of 1916 both accelerated the British response and forced the Allies to institute a system of convoys. As the United States joined the war, additional new technologies came on line, including early radar and sonar systems. The United States’ increased participation turned the tide of the war. The Atlantic became a bridge across which flowed war materials, supporting soldiers and Marines, and trade and commerce that fueled the Allied efforts. It was during the First World War that the idea of the North Atlantic community of nations evolved, with geopolitical commentators like Walter Lippmann referring to “the profound web of interest which joins together the western world.” Tragically, the United States essentially rejected the construct of an Atlantic community after the First World War, declined membership in the League of Nations, and embarked on a course of isolationism.",

This reflects a certain strain of isolationist DNA that has run through our nation’s psychology for two centuries.  In the run-up to the Second World War, despite efforts to limit naval construction by treaties, the major world nations all rebuilt their fleets. Collective security died a premature death along with the League of Nations, and fascism began its rise in Germany, Italy, and Spain. Britain and France desperately wanted to avoid another world war and looked away as Hitler annexed various territories and nations in Europe. Appeasement failed, as it always does, and Germany invaded Poland in 1939. The United Kingdom and France both declared war on Germany, and Europe was again plunged into war.",

    "text": "On the Atlantic, at least, the British had a significant advantage because Germany had not invested in significant capital ships. This allowed Britain to maintain its independence even after the fall of France in 1940. Yet even with a relatively small fleet, the Germans were able to strike at British sea power with their U-boats.  By mid-1941, the situation for Great Britain was dire. The U.S. Navy was conducting essentially an undeclared war in the North Atlantic, with Navy destroyers attacking U-boats. When the United States entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Battle of the Atlantic was already well under way. Victory at sea in the Atlantic during World War II would turn on the battle to defeat German submarines. As the Germans “flooded the zone” with U-boats, the Allies reached back to World War I tactics. The Germans operated in wolf packs, improved their surveillance and targeting ability, and instituted a system of logistics to resupply the raiders at sea. The Allies reinstituted a complex system of convoys, added significant antisubmarine warfare warships, and increased the use of new technologies, including surface radar and sonar. U-boat attacks ranged as far as the coast of the United States and deep into the Caribbean. In the summer and fall of 1940, German tactics sank hundreds of thousands of tons of Allied shipping each month. Turning the tide after the U.S. entry into the war required cracking the communications code used by Axis powers to target submarines against specific Allied convoys and shipping. It also hinged on improvements in radar and sonar, and the attrition of U-boats.  There were also significant operations in Arctic waters as the Allies sought to resupply Russia through northern convoys. Despite Allied momentum in the Atlantic, the Germans launched a second surge of U-boat attacks in the spring of 1942.  The Allies responded by instituting new tactics. They also recracked the cipher, and by early 1943 there was improvement. Two factors were crucial to the Allies’ newfound success: first was the Allied ability to more effectively attack U-boats; and second was the U.S. industrial machine’s production of overwhelming numbers of convoy escort warships. By late spring of 1943, the worst had passed. Despite German hopes of a technological breakthrough, it was clear that the Allies would gradually kill enough U-boats to permit the safe transfer of sufficient U.S. troops to Europe to win the war.  As Churchill said, “The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war.” The real keys to defeating the U-boats in the Atlantic were longer-range aircraft, radar, improvements in depth charges and sonar, British intelligence and code-breaking skills, tactics of avoidance, and optical devices like the Leigh Light.",

    "text": ", “Are we headed into a new cold war?” The answer is “probably not.” I am certainly old enough to remember the cold war, in which I spent a great deal of time on the broad Atlantic tracking Soviet platforms. The cold war was millions of well-trained troops on both sides facing one another across the Fulda Gap in Central Europe; it was two huge battle fleets playing cat and mouse from the High North and Arctic Circle to the bottom of the world off the coast of South America; it was two huge nuclear arsenals on a hair-trigger alert, twenty thousand warheads ready to utterly destroy the world. We are not remotely in that world today, and that is a very good thing, but we do need to be mindful of the geopolitics of the oceans or we risk stumbling back into that late-twentieth-century world. What was the cold war like in the Atlantic? First and foremost, it was a battle for control—really complete surveillance and the positioning of strategic and tactical assets—in the Greenland-Iceland–United Kingdom (GIUK) gap. This zone of thousands of miles of empty ocean became critical strategically because whichever side controlled it would be able to monitor and channel all the maritime traffic (including subsurface) into and out of the North Atlantic. It therefore controlled the flow of men and material to Europe in the case of a Soviet attack on western Europe. Unlike the Germans in World War II, the Soviets had a huge and capable seagoing fleet; allowing them to break out of northern ports and flow into the GIUK gap would have ceded control over the supply routes to Europe—the precise thing that Germany strove for so mightily with its U-boat fleets. Thus in the cold war, there was a constant maneuver between the Soviet Union (and its Warsaw Pact allies) and the NATO forces led by the United States for control of the gap. This required significant deployments of U.S. combat power to Iceland, Canada, Denmark, and of course the United Kingdom itself. Combat power was also stationed at bases in the Northeast of the United States. The operative maritime forces were long-range P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare aircraft, formidable hunter-killer machines used to find Soviet submarines; nuclear attack submarines of the United States and our allies; satellite coverage of the deep ocean; and occasional deployments of flotillas of destroyers and cruisers (like mine) with significant sonar, torpedo, and other sensors suitable to pursue submarines. The Soviets deployed their ballistic missile submarines (equipped with long-range missiles tipped with nuclear weapons) as well as flotillas of submarines and surface ships. While not exactly crowded up there, it was a “target rich zone” for antisubmarine forces. The Atlantic was also increasingly a huge trade path for the expansive economies of western (free) Europe and the United States. As the Europeans moved gradually toward a better state of economic union, it became increasingly clear that this commercial connection across the Atlantic would be vital for the United States as well.",

    "text": "There was a final bloody spurt of combat in the deep southern reaches of the Atlantic Ocean as the twentieth century moved to a close: the Falklands War. In the spring of 1982, over the course of ten weeks, Great Britain and Argentina fought a short, sharp war that cost a thousand lives, sank sixteen ships, and saw more than a hundred aircraft destroyed. It was fought over the Falkland Islands, which had been (and still are) a British protectorate with a British population but are long claimed as the Malvinas Islands by the Argentines. The classic description of the battle from the British perspective is Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward’s One Hundred Days, his memoir of leading the British flotilla that wrested the islands back from Argentine invaders after a demanding campaign fought as winter drew on in the southern latitudes. While the two nations still disagree over ownership of the islands, another round of violent conflict appears unlikely. The war has been studied by naval strategists and historians and provides a good example of the vulnerability of surface ships to air attack in the era of cruise missiles. As I progressed through my cold war career in the Navy, I would often open up Sir Sandy’s brilliant book to help me think through how best to prepare my various at-sea commands for potential combat around the world. It was the final spasm of international violence in the long history of the Atlantic in the twentieth century and, let us hope, the last. The Atlantic today is, for essentially the first time in its long history, a zone of cooperation and peace from the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Antarctic in the far South. While there are still a few lingering territorial issues to resolve— some African littoral claims, islands in the Caribbean, and the aforementioned Falkland Islands/Malvinas in the South Atlantic—the ocean itself and almost all of its tributary seas are in a relative state of peace. Only the eastern Mediterranean and to some degree the Black Sea present the potential for serious conflict. This is a remarkable change to a body of water that has long been viewed, correctly, as the canvas of war upon which too many admirals have quite enthusiastically painted in blood.",

    "text": "THE INDIAN OCEAN THE FUTURE SEA India is the center around which its ocean turns. Map created by Joannes van Braam, 1726. The Indian Ocean will remain a driving economic force in the world oceans for decades to come. The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water—20 percent of the world’s surface and third in size behind the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. If you were to drop the entire continental United States on top of the Indian Ocean, it would fit quite comfortably within its borders as a sort of very large island. In fact, you could probably squeeze three continental United States into the water space and be able to navigate comfortably around them. Yet with all that space—and a sense of real openness for a sailor—the Indian Ocean itself has relatively less human and geopolitical history than either of the other two major oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific. And it is worth noting that even the tributary seas—the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the Red Sea—have become particularly important in a geopolitical sense only in the post–World War II era with the rise of global shipping and the export of oil from the Gulf region. While that absence of global impact is about to change as India rises in its global ambition and reach, it is still relatively a tabula rasa in geopolitical terms. I first entered the Indian Ocean from the east, through the Strait of Malacca, in the mid-1980s. I was operations officer in a brand-new AEGIS air defense cruiser, USS Valley Forge. AEGIS is a hi-tech, automated command and control and weapons system that can detect, track, and shoot down multiple targets simultaneously. Our mission was to head through the Indian Ocean to the Arabian Gulf at best speed, first taking on fuel and supplies at Diego Garcia, a small island and British possession in the center of the vast ocean space. As the operations officer, I had prepared the charts and set the course, and took the first watch as we drove out between Indonesia and Malaysia and headed toward the Indian Ocean, watching the stars open above us in the unlit sky. We sped through the long Strait of Malacca after departing Singapore. The night watch was a blur of huge tankers, coastal junks and small boats, and occasionally other warships flashing their signal lights at us. Singapore guards the eastern entrance to the Malacca Strait, one of the busiest in the world, and its multinational character—with Malay, Chinese, Indian, Anglo, and many other residents—makes it a gateway city in every sense of the word. As you get under way from its busy ports and take on speed entering the very crowded Strait of Malacca, you have a sense much like coming through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea—yet knowing that unlike the Med, the Indian Ocean is essentially a vast open seaway. After that long night watch, I was still on the bridge as the sea and anchor detail officer of the deck as we came off navigation detail (additional watches set for close-to-land or very dense traffic maneuvering) and watched the sun rise up as we entered the broad reaches of the Andaman Sea off the western coast of Thailand. Suddenly, we were in an enormous expanse of open water, and we shaped our course for the southwest and the tiny atoll of Diego Garcia. Sailing across the Indian Ocean, unlike the Med, a sailor is hit by a sense of wide-open space, much like the central and western Pacific. While you occasionally pass other ships, it is a relatively rare moment to be within visual distance of another vessel.",

    "text": "As you stand the long, boring watches, you can easily imagine slipping back over the centuries and seeing, across the horizon, not a smokestack rising where the next ship should be, but instead a set of huge sails as one of the great hulls of the British or Dutch East India Company bears down upon you, the classic northeast monsoons and equatorial currents driving it straight at you. Or so it felt to a very young lieutenant who had probably read too many novels set in the nineteenth century by George MacDonald Fraser, C. S. Forester, and Patrick O’Brian. But actually it is apt to think of a trading ship rather than a warship coming over the horizon. For the Indian Ocean’s most salient characteristic is that unlike its massive cousins the Atlantic and Pacific, and as particularly distinct from the perpetual battlefield of the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean has been primarily a zone of trade. Beginning with the earliest Indian civilizations of the Harappans in the Indus Valley nearly three thousand years before Christ, there have been frequent trading ventures along the coast of modern India and Pakistan, across the Red Sea between the Arabian Gulf and Africa, and indeed between the ancient Mediterranean and the early societies of the Indian Ocean littoral. The engine that drove all of this through the long centuries of the age of sail was mother nature: the monsoon winds, the powerful and perpetual wind patterns that drove ships of trade and of war in the days before mechanical propulsion, coupled with the equatorial currents. In an oddly named document, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written by an ancient Greek of Alexandria whose name is lost to the ages, we see evidence of the commercial potential of the Red Sea, the African coast, and the Indian subcontinent as well. This is matched by discoveries from more than two thousand years ago of Greek amphorae, coins, and other physical evidence of trade in the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean. The ancient sailors knew of and mastered the monsoons, which provided the ability to transit significant distances. These winds are predictable and therefore recordable. In the fall and winter, the northeast monsoon blows down from Asia toward the Indian Ocean, accompanied by currents that can reinforce voyages in that direction. This is reversed in the spring and summer as southwest monsoons blow back from the Indian Ocean toward Asia and the currents reverse themselves. While their appearance is not always guaranteed, it is sufficiently reliable to have powered the ability for trading across the seemingly endless sea relatively early in the course of human development. Ancient Indian civilizations probably began sailing the waters of the Indian Ocean as early as the fifth century B.C. As the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers emptied into the northern Arabian Gulf, the conflict between the Persian Sassanian Empire and various Indian empires (Harappan, Mauryan, Guptan) flared back and forth. There is little evidence of major sea battles as was the case in the Mediterranean, largely because the geography is so different. The strategic geography of the Indian Ocean is one of vast, open space—essentially one massive littoral, with the exception of the two inland seas, the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea. While there were sporadic naval engagements across these two areas, most of the major warfare was focused on the land and the holding of territory. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks traded with the Indian and Persian civilizations, as well as conducting wars. Trade goods included myrrh, incense, ebony, oil, wood, crafts, crops, livestock, and gold and other metals. The brief but impactful life and adventures of Alexander the Great influenced the rise of trade, opening new cities and extending cultural influence, including the founding of the great Egyptian trading city of Alexandria and even ports on the Arabian Gulf. As a young junior officer ashore for the first time in Kuwait, I was fascinated by the ruins of a Greek temple. The Egyptians and the Greeks both traded across the Red Sea, and when Rome conquered Egypt around the time of Christ, Rome became part of the expanding level of trading in the Indian Ocean. Roman Alexandria became a kind of early hub for the trading runs into the Indian Ocean—the goods included textiles from distant China, glass and crafts, and—as was to be a constant driver in Indian Ocean trade—spices, notably black pepper. At the same time, on the eastern side of the Arabian Gulf, the various Persian empires opened new ports and began both importing and exporting across the Gulf. In addition to the goods above, pearls, carpets, and horses were part of the mix. The strategic value of the Strait of Hormuz, which guards the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, began to emerge. You can drop a plumb line through the more than two millennia since the Persians established forts and seaports to control the narrow choke point to the present day, which continues to occupy the attention of the world.",

The threat was from missile strikes or even missile boats attacking tankers bound in and out of the Gulf during the long war between Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Iran under the ayatollahs. Our job was an uncomfortable one: to come close aboard to the massive oil tankers—ten times our size by tonnage—and use our highly sophisticated radar and missile systems to defend them from attack.

The British East India Company (1600) and the Dutch East India Company adopted this model, aiming to establish commercial trade for state power. The Dutch concentrated on the eastern Indian Ocean, including present-day Sri Lanka and parts of Indonesia, also establishing a foothold in Cape Town. Their initial trade focused on spices and coffee. The British aimed to control the Indian landmass, establishing forts and bases around its periphery during the 1600s and early 1700s. Despite imperial competition among the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, local powers largely controlled the trade routes. The Chinese, lacking colonial ambitions and a strong navy, participated in trade through loans, cooperative arrangements, and chandlery. Each imperial power established its own bases, with the Dutch centering on Batavia (Jakarta). Britain and the Netherlands gradually consolidated power, overcoming occasional indigenous challenges. Britain emerged as the dominant power by the end of the 18th century, controlling Oman, Kenya, and India, effectively creating a \"British lake\" in the Indian Ocean.  British focus shifted from maritime dominance to land control, recognizing the importance of controlling sea lanes for control over India. They faced challenges from France, the Dutch, piracy, and slave trading, which they overcame through conquest, alliances, trade agreements, and technological advancements like steam power and the Suez Canal.",

The Suez Canal symbolized the power of connections – geographical, civilizational, and personal. It became a crucial British interest, especially until the late 1960s.  The canal’s speed and mobility allowed the British to strengthen their Indian Ocean dominance. Throughout the 19th century, they focused on controlling rivals, suppressing uprisings, combating slavery and piracy, rather than engaging in large-scale battles. Piracy was concentrated between the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, particularly around the Strait of Malacca, facilitated by the geography that offered safe havens.  The British and Dutch collaborated to reduce piracy and slavery, facing challenges from pirate regimes backed by local rulers.",

France retained some islands, Portugal held territories like Mozambique and Goa, the Dutch controlled the Dutch East Indies, and Italy acquired Eritrea and Somalia. Technological advancements, like the steam engine and the Suez Canal, increased human movement across the Indian Ocean. Indians, Chinese, Malays, Indonesians, and Filipinos migrated, often as indentured laborers under harsh conditions. The opium trade, encouraged by colonial powers, flourished between India, Java, and China, leading to the First Opium War.

The international community cannot agree on much, but on the view of piracy as an ancient scourge that is punishable by any sovereign nation there is universal agreement. Therefore, my task was to gain additional resources and warships from a broader coalition than just the twenty-eight NATO nations. We cast a wide net, including some traditionally non-NATO-aligned countries: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Iran all responded in a positive way—either sending ships, participating with intelligence, or at a minimum providing logistic and refueling support. This was quite unprecedented: a grand nautical coalition that included the United States and Canada from North America, more than thirty European nations, and five aforementioned countries that do not wake up in the morning looking for ways to cooperate with NATO, to say the least. Thus we saw in the Indian Ocean a good example of a strategic approach that provides a means to cobble together nations that are normally at one another’s throats. That we could in the process significantly knock down piracy was equally good. By 2013, as I was departing NATO, we had just a couple of ships and a small handful of mariners still being held. The bottom had been knocked out of the piracy business, and many of the pirates had been apprehended and remanded to justice. Not a single ship has been pirated at sea off the coast of East Africa in the past couple of years. Partly, this is because of progress ashore as well, fueled by the good work of the European Union. But in terms of reducing piracy in a region of the world that has seen it often, this is a rare good story of coordination at sea, and full of lessons for seeking other zones of cooperation on the world’s oceans.",

There are endless discussions about the emerging conflicts, the flow of refugees, and competition over vital hydrocarbons, as well as the geopolitical impact of the two “major oceans.” Yet the twenty-first century will be more about the Indian Ocean than either of the other two—and the sooner we fully realize that in the United States, the better. We cannot forget the facts of the case: The Indian Ocean, while admittedly smaller than the Atlantic or the Pacific, consists of nearly a quarter of the waters on the globe, especially when one counts its major subordinate seas, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Across its vast expanse move 50 percent of all shipping and containers and 70 percent of all oil, making it quite literally the crossroads of globalization. Nearly forty nations border it, with more than a third of the world’s population. And it is the beating heart of the Islamic world, with Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the Gulf States all having coastal access to the Indian Ocean. More than 90 percent of the world’s Islamic population is in this massive catchment basin. And it is highly militarized and constantly in a high state of tension. The highest potential nuclear conflict in the world today is between Pakistan and India—two huge, capable, professional, and nuclear-capable militaries. Iran is an adventurist state with an innovative and battle-trained military force. Many of the other nations along the littoral have internal conflicts and significant chaos along their borders, particularly in East Africa. Piracy, while reduced over the past several years, remains a threat both along the coast of East Africa and in the Strait of Malacca connecting the Indian Ocean with the Pacific.",

    "text": "The history of the Indian Ocean certainly does not inspire confidence in the potential for peaceful governance in the twenty-first century. As we have seen, throughout the centuries its trade routes have inspired competition and conflict since East met West with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1497. The British conquest of India and the commercial muscle of the British East India Company dominated the region for a time in the nineteenth century, but the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and great-power maneuvering during World War II led into the long twilight of the cold war when American, Soviet, Chinese, and Indian vessels played cat and mouse. There are other flashpoints centered in the Indian Ocean beyond India and Pakistan. There is no love lost between China and India in the region, particularly as China continues to expand its commercial influence and basing throughout the Indian Ocean littoral. There is piratical activity along the East African littoral and throughout the western Indonesian archipelago. In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, the Sunni-Shi’a conflict continues to play out at sea as it does ashore. Yemen is on fire in a manifestation of Sunni-Shi’a conflict as Houthi rebels seek dominance of the poverty-stricken nation. Much of this is well documented in Robert Kaplan’s superb treatment of the region, Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power. The salient question for the United States is simple: What is our role? How can we help create U.S. security and stability in the global oceanic commons upon which we depend for so much of our international trade? First, we must recognize the vital importance of the Indian Ocean itself. On our maps and globes, it tends to be depicted as split (in order to give primacy to “our” oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific). Our strategic and geopolitical mental map reflects this, and in all of our thinking—from the Pentagon to our Fortune 500 companies to our academic and humanitarian institutions—we should consciously consider the importance of this vast body of water and its littoral nations.",

It will soon overtake China as the world’s most populous nation, it is led by a dynamic and globally oriented leader in Prime Minister Modi, its lingua franca is English, and—above all—it is a vibrant, legitimate democracy with whom we share fundamental values. Too often in the international conferences I attend all over the world we end up discussing China, the United States, and the European Union—important to be sure—but never even mention India. In this century, the rise of India may be the most important single geopolitical driver, and its engagement in the Indian Ocean will be an enormous part of that. Third, we must deploy and operate in the region with all of our forces. This most obviously requires a strong and deployable Navy and Air Force, but the Army and Marines have work to do as well. The Department of Defense should be building more exercises in the region like the recently completed Exercise Malabar, which brought U.S., Indian, and Japanese forces together in naval exercises. Fourth, we should continue the global counterpiracy campaign, which has shown real success off the coast of East Africa. When we can bring together not only NATO, European, and Asian allies but also Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Iran, there are few things we cannot successfully do. Within the turbulence of the Indian Ocean, counterpiracy operations are something almost everyone can agree upon—we can help lead that effort. Fifth, one enormous key to unlocking the potential of the region is solving two difficult challenges: the Indian-Pakistani conflict, centered on the disputed Kashmir but in reality the result of religious, cultural, and historical differences; and the Shi’a-Sunni divide, which continues to make the Arabian Gulf volatile. These are long-term challenges, but whatever U.S. diplomacy can do to reduce tensions and avoid open confrontation will be helpful.",

    "text": "Sixth, the Arabian Gulf will not simply be a “lesser but included” subset of the Indian Ocean. Because of its particular place as the fault line between the Sunni and Shi’a worlds, it will demand a significant level of U.S. involvement in order to fulfill our objectives there: freedom of the high seas and an open sea lane of communication through the Strait of Hormuz, particularly for oil; capable allies in the Sunni Arab world, led by Saudi Arabia; a functioning modus vivendi with Iran; and an environmentally safe region given the high potential for ecological disasters. In 2016, we saw several incidents of U.S. warships involved in disturbing scenarios in and around both the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. There is today a particularly high general state of tension with Iran at sea, in spite of the negotiated nuclear arms agreement. Since the agreement and the lifting of sanctions, Iranian naval forces—and particularly the Revolutionary Guard—have become emboldened. In January, they came upon two U.S. Navy riverine craft operating innocently in their waters (one had broken down, the other was helping, and both had poor navigation and communication equipment readiness). In a violation of international law and seafaring custom, the U.S. Navy sailors were not assisted but instead were disarmed, put into humiliating stress positions, and taken into port. The Iranians used video of the sailors to further humiliate them, in direct contravention of international norms. Late in 2016, U.S. Navy destroyers operating in international waters off the coast of Yemen were attacked by cruise missiles fired by Houthi rebels, who probably had Iranian training, targeting, and concurrence, considering the staunch Iranian support for the Houthis. Both incidents are harbingers of much more tension to come, particularly in the Arabian Gulf, but also in the northern Indian Ocean. Above all, we simply need to factor the huge Indian Ocean and the smaller but vital Arabian Gulf fully into our thinking—they must not be forgotten as we sail into the twenty-first century. There will clearly be greater impact from this heretofore less noticed but still enormous body of water, and sailors will find the Indian Ocean far less domesticated than its twin cousins, the Atlantic and Pacific. How the geopolitics of the Indian Ocean unfolds will be a crucial vector for the overall trends of twenty-first-century geopolitics.",

    "section": "The Mediterranean: Cradle of Naval Warfare",
    "text": "Mankind’s geopolitical journey upon the seas began in earnest on the waters of the Mediterranean. Through the centuries of man’s sailing across the ocean’s waves, it was in the Mediterranean Sea that sailors created and then perfected the idea of war at sea. As a result, no other body of water can lay claim to such a central place in early global history—at least when it comes to war. If the remains of long-dead mariners were suddenly to float unencumbered to the surface, you could easily walk the length of the Mediterranean over the bones of warriors who died at sea. The Med is close to a million square miles in area, more than 2,400 miles from east to west, and is spread out along 23,000 long miles of coastline. Yet the opening strait, the only part that links the Med to the vast Atlantic Ocean, is less than ten miles wide at the highly strategic Strait of Gibraltar—which was known to the Greeks and Romans as the Pillars of Hercules. Another way to think about the size of the Mediterranean would be to imagine the Med superimposed over a map of the United States. The Strait of Gibraltar would be roughly where San Diego is located on the West Coast. The Suez Canal and the approaches to the Red Sea would be on the northeast coast of Florida, near Jacksonville. The top of the Adriatic Sea would be almost to the Canadian border, just west of the Great Lakes; and the Libyan Gulf of Sidra would touch the Gulf of Mexico. Highway 66, stretching all across the United States, would fit from east to west. This is a big body of water, to say the least. And most important, it has a series of fateful geographic features that appear again and again in the long throw of Mediterranean history: the narrowness of the opening in the west, of course, but also the enormous central importance of the largest island, Sicily—a prize over which nations have fought for more than three thousand years. Likewise, the dagger of Italy thrusting toward Africa and effectively bifurcating the Med is a geographic feature that will continue to make itself known. Its length and central position, with excellent ports both east and west, gave rise to Roman trade and enabled its sea power through the long Pax Romana. And to the south of Sicily, its smaller but almost equally strategic cousin Malta will appear repeatedly in the strategic drama of the Med. Continuing east, the rocky island terrain of the Aegean has been a maritime battleground that echoes today as Greek and Turkish warships and aircraft conduct a delicate dance of confrontation that seems to belie their common NATO alliance membership and reminds us of Christian and Muslim hatreds from a thousand years ago that drove events through the eastern Med. Here the key islands are Cyprus, dominating the approaches to the Levant, and Crete, long and bulky, guarding the entrances to the Aegean. To the north of course is the Black Sea, truly deserving of its own place in the books of history, but forever serving as a sort of “Med in miniature” through the millennia, with many of the same conflicts playing out north of the strategic passage of the Bosporus. And to the south, the flat terrain of the North African desert, the rich delta of the Nile, and the harsh land crossing the Suez all play a continuing part in the history, politics, and culture of the Med. The name of the sea itself derives from the Latin word mediterraneus, which can be translated as “inland” or as the “middle place between the land.” The Romans thought of it, appropriately, as the mare nostrum, “our sea.” From the beginning of recorded Western history, it functioned as a sort of global commons in a relatively confined space, providing a path for trade, an accessible source of protein, a field of transport, a ready battlefield, and a natural barrier. And it supplied much to the imagination of man as well. As the geography of the Mediterranean gradually revealed itself through the centuries, the legends grew of what lay beyond the Strait of Gibraltar. Dragons, sea monsters, the gates to Hades, the lost city of Atlantis—all occupied a",

    "text": "The Mediterranean Sea holds a significant place in popular imagination and culture.  Ancient sailors, rowing their triremes, seldom ventured beyond the Strait of Gibraltar due to fear of the unknown.  The Mediterranean has played a central role in both the development of war-fighting technology and maritime strategy. From battering rams and multilayered oars to marines, cannons, fire control systems, sophisticated sailing techniques, and eventually steam, combustion engines, and nuclear power – each advance in naval combat was tested and refined in the Mediterranean. For a modern sailor, passing through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean feels like entering an ancient arena of battle. The sense of being hemmed in, surrounded by history, is palpable. I remember sailing the USS Forrestal through the Strait in the early 1980s, struck by the small scale of the waterway and the proximity of land.  The Mediterranean's weather is famously fickle, from beautiful calm to terrible storms. During that cruise, we experienced gorgeous summer weather, but as fall approached, the mistrals threatened.  The sense of history in every port – Athens, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Alexandria, Syracuse, Naples, Cartagena, Tunis – was palpable.  The cold war was in full bloom, and the US maintained two carrier battle groups in the Mediterranean.  One was typically in the western Mediterranean, with access to allied ports and easier logistics.  The eastern Mediterranean, however, was heavily influenced by Russia, and operations there were considered dangerous.  The question that kept recurring to me was: why was the Mediterranean such an early crucible of war and conquest? First, its location as a crossroads between competing civilizations made it a birthplace of maritime geopolitics.  The Mediterranean enabled contact and conflict between Europe, Africa, and Asia. Its geography provided access for invading fleets, and its natural divisions created smaller zones for fighting. Second, the Mediterranean is dotted with strategic islands like Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, Crete, and the Aegean islands, providing stepping stones for expanding empires. These islands enabled bases from which fleets could operate.  Despite the opportunities for trade and war, the ancients faced challenges: unpredictable weather, the need to develop deep-ocean navigation, and the construction of reliable ships. As mankind honed its seafaring and fighting abilities, the Mediterranean became a fighting cage where warring nations clashed.",

The Minoans, centered on Crete (2500-1200 BC), were natural sailors who controlled islands north of Crete.  Mainland Greek societies paid tribute to them. Their story is intertwined with Greek legends, including Theseus and the Minotaur. An earthquake, perhaps the origin of the Atlantis legend, likely destroyed much of their society. A Greek general once suggested to me that a surviving Minoan society could have united the Greek world and dominated the Mediterranean.  At the eastern end of the Mediterranean, the Phoenician civilization (3000-500 BC) thrived as traders. Their ships carried goods from Britain, the Baltic, and Africa. Their trading ports spread throughout the Mediterranean, and Carthage, in present-day Tunisia, rose to prominence. The Carthaginians, descended from Phoenicians, built an empire encompassing Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, parts of Spain, and coastal Africa.

The first Persian expedition was thwarted by a storm. A second attempt, an amphibious attack at Marathon, also failed.  The Persians returned a decade later with overwhelming force under King Xerxes. The Greeks, significantly outnumbered, faced a critical moment. The Athenian fleet, led by Themistocles, positioned itself in Salamis Bay.  Themistocles’s speech exhorted his men to fight for their families, city, and freedom. Their motivation, coupled with superior technology, led to victory.  This victory hinted at a potential Greek golden age, but internal conflicts prevented them from creating a significant empire. It was the Romans who ultimately created the “inner sea” and ruled it.",

Egypt also became a crucial stepping-stone on routes to India.  In 1798, Nelson’s and Napoleon’s fleets played a game of cat and mouse across the Mediterranean.  Finally, Nelson cornered and destroyed Napoleon's fleet at the Battle of the Nile, solidifying British naval dominance throughout the 19th century.  This pivotal victory prepared the British for future successes and marked a turning point in Nelson's career.

    "text": "The Mediterranean Sea served as a training, engagement, and intelligence gathering venue during the Cold War. Its relatively shallow depth made it unsuitable for large-scale fleet actions in the era of nuclear submarines.  While not the intense battlefield of previous centuries, the Med witnessed low-intensity conflicts and maneuvers between the US and Soviet fleets. A notable incident was the 1985 Achille Lauro terrorist attack, where the Palestine Liberation Front attacked an Italian cruise liner, resulting in the execution of an American citizen.  Later, US Freedom of Navigation operations against Libya led to the downing of Libyan fighters.  Strikes against Libya followed the 1986 bombing of a German discotheque frequented by US servicemen. The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 further intensified naval operations in the Gulf of Sidra. The focus shifted from large-scale Cold War posturing to more complex operations.  The end of the Cold War brought initial exuberance but also destabilizing forces. The Balkans erupted in the 1990s as Yugoslavia disintegrated.  Ethnic and religious tensions fueled a brutal war in Bosnia, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions displaced. The Srebrenica massacre in 1995, where thousands of Muslim men and boys were killed, was a particularly horrific event.  A second conflict arose when Kosovo broke away from Serbia in 1998.  The international community intervened with air and sea operations, including strikes, an arms embargo, and logistical support for ground forces.  Maritime forces played a key role in enforcing the arms embargo, preventing weapons from reaching Serbian aggressors. While a rough peace was eventually established, the underlying tensions remained.",

While not as powerful as the Soviet navy, the Russian fleet poses a challenge to US interests.  Russia's annexation of Crimea and influence in eastern Ukraine provides a strategic foothold in the Black Sea.  Crimea's importance to Russia's Black Sea dominance is paramount, and its return is unlikely.  Historically, the Black Sea has been a region of contention, particularly between Russia and Turkey. After the Cold War, it became a volatile area with new NATO members and ongoing disputes involving Ukraine, Georgia, and Russia. Smugglers and extremists also utilize the Black Sea as a route to Europe. Russia's relationship with the Assad regime in Syria further complicates the situation. Russia maintains naval access and bases along the Syrian coast, a strategic link to the Arab world.  This clashes with the US and other NATO allies, who seek Assad's removal due to his actions in the Syrian civil war. The eastern Mediterranean resembles the volatile Balkans of a century ago.  The rise of the Islamic State adds another layer of complexity.  While not yet controlling coastal regions, ISIS's influence is growing in Libya, a potential gateway to Europe.  The group has also contributed to the refugee crisis, with millions fleeing to Europe and neighboring countries.

The Islamic State's stated goal of conquering Rome and its medieval-inspired rhetoric and actions underscore the symbolic importance of Rome as a target. While a conventional attack is unlikely, ISIS could infiltrate migrant boats or use small craft to reach Italy. A strike on a Christian holy site in Rome aligns with ISIS's strategy and narrative. Italy is responding by increasing security alerts, enhancing patrols, sharing intelligence, and projecting strength.

    "text": "Italy should specifically ask that a NATO task force be established for surveillance and patrol across the Med. When Turkey felt threatened by Syrian air activity several years ago, NATO responded by sending Patriot batteries to southern Turkey to defend Turkish sovereign airspace. Those batteries remain in place today. In the case of Italian concerns about Islamic State infiltration, the use of standing NATO maritime task forces would be a very real possibility to support the overloaded Italian coast guard and navy. Second, amp up the maritime intelligence collection processes across the Med. The Italians need access to the highest levels of intelligence being collected today in Libya. This means not only working through NATO channels, but also approaching the Arab nations in the anti–Islamic State coalition (Egypt, the UAE, and possibly Tunisia) for assistance. There is no substitute for on-the-ground assets, and these are thin for the Italians despite their close commercial ties to Libya—so Italy should work it through not only high-tech USA/NATO/NSA sources, but also the Arab networks. Much of this can be sea based, with intelligence collection assets operating from coastal shipping. Third, focus on the maritime dimension, using NATO navies in the Med. This means sortieing the Italian fleet and coast guard to patrol and map the patterns of movement across the 100-to-200–nautical mile stretch of the central Mediterranean; using long-range patrol aircraft from Sicilian bases; cooperating fully with neighboring Malta, which sits astride the sea lane; and employing high-endurance unmanned drones to maintain a high-quality, real-time sense of maritime domain awareness. Fourth and most important, develop a strategy for addressing the problem at its source: in Libya. Given the chaos and increasing anarchy in Libya, it is tempting to simply write it off and hope that the revolution ultimately burns itself out. Indeed, many observers express a certain longing for the “good old days” of stability under Muammar Gaddafi. But eventually, Libya will succeed —it has big oil reserves (especially on a per capita basis), an educated population, and enviable geography close to Europe with a huge seacoast. Europe—our closest ally in the world—needs a stable Mediterranean. This will mean engaging more directly in the coastal regions of the Levant to diminish the threat from the Islamic State and the flow of illegal migrants and refugees. It will also mean a maritime strategy to help move Libya toward a more stable situation. This means exploring a UN or EU peacekeeping mission, supporting the relatively moderate internationally recognized government centered in Tobruk, and cooperating closely with Egyptian efforts to take on the Islamic State in military terms with targeting, intelligence, destroying their financial base by cutting off access to Arab banks and, potentially, air strikes. Here in the United States, we should support Italy in helping lead a European approach to stabilizing Libya. Just as Churchill looked at Italy as a relatively easy gateway to Europe, the Islamic State has geographic, political, and symbolic interests in sailing across the Med to Italy and across the Aegean to Greece. It will seek to accelerate its reach across the eastern and central Med. And Russian adventurism will continue in and around the eastern Med and the Black Sea. It is clear the Med will continue to be a fickle and changing geopolitical body of water, and one where more security operations at sea loom ahead on the horizon.",

People often ask me why I keep a painting of a doomed ship on the wall. Why not a valiant and heroic U.S. Navy ship, perhaps the carrier Enterprise or the destroyer Barry, both of which passed under my command? The answer is twofold—first, and most important, the painting reminds me that your ship can blow up underneath you at any moment, so you better have a Plan B and, metaphorically speaking, know where the life rafts are located. The second reason is perhaps a bit obscure, but important to me. After the Maine was sunk, the Navy salvaged the ship nearly fifty years later, and virtually all of the evidence points to the conclusion that she was not sunk by Spanish saboteurs after all. It appears the explosion was internal, most probably from a boiler or an ammunition storage area. The charge to war was predicated, it would seem, on false evidence. So the second reason I keep a painting of the Maine around is to remind me not to jump to conclusions in the heat of the moment. Stop, consider, and above all, question the fact pattern being presented to you—a pretty good reminder.",

The war, essentially a proxy conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, saw North Vietnam supported by the Soviet Union and China, while the South struggled against both external pressure and internal insurgency from the Viet Minh and Viet Cong. This necessitated a gradual escalation of U.S. military presence, peaking at over half a million troops under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. The U.S. Navy played a pivotal role, conducting carrier strikes, coastal and riverine operations, logistical support, surveillance, SEAL insertions, and naval bombardments. The South China Sea effectively became an American lake, with hundreds of warships operating throughout.  The Tonkin Gulf incident in 1964, involving alleged attacks on U.S. ships by North Vietnamese torpedo boats, served as the catalyst for direct U.S. military intervention and a rapid troop surge.

    "section": "The South China Sea Dispute",
    "text": "One expert from the University of Miami, John McManus, called China’s building of man-made islands “the most rapid rate of permanent loss of coral reef area in human history.” Add to this the internal tension under which President Xi Jinping’s regime is operating: falling real estate prices, an aging population, an imbalance of men (too many) and women (too few), terrible ecological damage requiring significant mitigation, and above all, a sputtering economy that is stunting growth. When authoritarian regimes come under pressure, they tend to look outward to find ways to distract the population. Nationalism emerges. Such is the case in China today. Witness Xi’s September 2015 speech at the United Nations—full of barely concealed vitriol directed at the government of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. The tension between Japan and China has been waxing and waning over the past several years. Now it’s increasing again. What is the best approach for the United States? This tense situation is out in the open, and Xi’s late September 2015 visit to Washington did not fundamentally change anything. First, despite provocations, the United States must maintain open communications with China and seek ways to reduce the chances of an inadvertent collision either between the United States and China (unlikely) or between China and one of its immediate neighbors (far more likely). The U.S. relationship with China encompasses economic issues, geopolitical cooperation from Afghanistan to Iran, and global environmental issues—the South China Sea dispute is only one element. Dialogue is crucial. And the agreements on military- to-military contact and cybersecurity that the two presidents discussed during Xi’s visit are better than nothing. Second, the United States needs to strengthen its relationship with existing allies and partners in the region and encourage them to work together better. This applies especially to Japan and South Korea, which, for a host of historical reasons, have long had an uncomfortable relationship. The United States can help build better ties between the two neighbors by promoting military exchanges and exercises, enabling conversations at important events like the Shangri-La Dialogue (an annual gathering of strategic thinkers in Singapore), and encouraging so-called Track II engagement, which is exchanges and dialogue conducted not through government channels (Track I) but instead through academic and research institutions. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive multilateral trade agreement, is a big element: building a network of even stronger trading ties can ensure that America’s friends and allies cooperate with one another. And in particular, working more closely with Vietnam makes good sense—and this should include lifting bans on weapons sales. Third, the fundamental tenets of international law are against China’s approach in the South China Sea. The United States should sternly emphasize this in international forums like the United Nations, the G-7, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The intellectual underpinnings of international legal judgments on the South China Sea are very clear: nations cannot simply declare a “historical claim” and take over what other nations regard as international waters. The United States, as a global maritime power, should not miss any opportunity to object. The recent negative ruling against China further buttresses this strategic approach. And frankly, the United States should finally sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty that governs the world’s oceans, to maintain the high ground in these conversations. Fourth, and finally, the United States should exercise its traditional rights of transit under international legal norms: its Freedom of Navigation operations. That means overflying Chinese territorial claims and sailing U.S. ships through China’s claimed water space—the waters within twelve miles of these islands. The United States has a long tradition of countering unjustified historical claims by sailing and flying through international waters and airspace. Now is the time to exercise it in the South China Sea.",

    "text": "Echoes of this argument from five hundred years ago—of the sovereign states’ rights in the coastal zone versus the value of mare liberum or the freedom of the high seas—are very much with us today. When I first sailed in the South China Sea in the 1980s, we were only marginally concerned about China. Our ships went pretty much wherever we wanted. But of late, the Chinese— advocating ownership of more or less the entire South China Sea—are vastly more aggressive. Even more disturbing, they are building these artificial islands in a further attempt to solidify their claim to these seas. All of this dates back at least five hundred years, and in many ways a couple of millennia in terms of historical claim to the waters. From the perspective of the United States, acquiescing in these claims will lead to further closure of the high seas, and thus necessitate our Freedom of Navigation operations: short, sharp patrols intruding into claimed territorial seas that we contend are in fact high seas and open to all. To understand this controversy requires looking backward into the long history of the region.\n\nHAVING SPENT MUCH OF A long nautical career in the Pacific, I am hard-pressed to think of another time of greater military competition in the Asian region, at least since the end of the Second World War. In particular, arms expenditures are rising throughout Asia, especially in the bubbling cauldron of the South China Sea. Unfortunately, we are merely at the start of an entirely predictable and dangerous arms race as nations in the region increasingly respond both to the perception of a rising military power in China that seems more assertive in a strategic sense and to growing evidence of instability on the Korean Peninsula. All of this happens as the American “Pacific pivot” fails to gain traction in the face of crises in Syria, threats from the Islamic State, and ongoing tension with Russia over Ukraine. In terms of military spending, China (which has the second-largest national defense budget in the world after the United States) is on track to double its already significant defense spending by 2020, increasing about 7 percent each year. Meanwhile, the U.S. defense budget and those of European nations in particular have been declining. The Chinese are also buying and building large aircraft carriers, having just begun construction on the first one to be built in China. They are also rapidly improving their offensive cyber capability, which will be central to military operations in the future.",

Japan has not only increased its defense budget but also passed legislation (not without controversy and protests) that will allow for offensive Japanese military action in defense of allies under attack—clearly strengthening its military alignment with the United States. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and virtually every other nation in the region are likewise increasing their defense spending. On average, the East Asian nations are spending at least 5 percent a year more on defense than was the case several years ago. And we should remember that the United States and Russia, the first-and third-largest defense spenders in the world (and the two largest arms exporters), are also Pacific powers. At a recently completed World Economic Forum in Davos, we saw a bit less public strain between Asian leaders than in the past couple of years, which is good.

Since then, the two leaders—Prime Minister Abe and President Xi—have managed to appear together at several events and there seems to be less overt tension in the air. But in a variety of conversations I have had with senior military and political leaders over the past few months, it is clear that the subtext remains one of significant competition and indeed potential conflict. Several of the nations involved in territorial disputes with China are moving closer to the United States. These include Japan (already among the closest of allies of the United States in the East Asian region), Australia (basing U.S. Marines ashore on its northern coast), and Vietnam (which continues to operate closely with the United States in both military and commercial spheres). The Philippines presents a more complicated case. Until 2016 they were moving toward a much closer relationship with the United States. However, their newly elected and highly unpredictable populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, is now distancing himself from the United States, which has criticized him for violating human rights and encouraging the killing of drug offenders and criminals with impunity. In addition to swearing (frequently) at the United States and President Obama, Duterte has indicated a desire to reduce overall military cooperation with the United States and perhaps align himself with China (and possibly Russia). His mercurial nature makes it difficult to predict how this will turn out, but it certainly throws another layer of tension and unpredictability into the already turbulent South China Sea. The completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which does not include China) would further align the signatories with the United States, although its future is in doubt as President Trump opposed it. All of this activity is at least in part a response to a perception of increased military and political aggression on the part of China.",

With yet another nuclear detonation, Kim Jong-un has definitively claimed the dubious honor of leading the most dangerous nation in the world. The North Koreans are armed with a small arsenal of nuclear weapons; led by an inexperienced, unstable, emotional, and medically challenged dictator (with a truly bad haircut); possessed of technologically advanced ballistic missiles; and in a virtual state of war with their closest neighbor, South Korea. All of this has an additive effect on the already tense relationships in the region, especially for Japan and South Korea, which must factor into their defense spending the presence of North Korea. Another fascinating dynamic is the unfolding role of India as a global security actor, which will have knock-on effects in East Asia. India has historically stood a bit apart from East Asian politics, reasoning that it has enormous internal challenges and plenty to do in operating along the vast Indian Ocean littoral. But increasingly we are seeing India under dynamic prime minister Narendra Modi reaching out to engage with the United States and Japan in increased military and security cooperation. This began with counterpiracy operations off the Horn of Africa and now includes military exchanges and joint exercises.",

    "text": "The outlook remains very concerning, and it appears unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in tensions or in defense spending over the next decade and beyond. What should the international community and the nations in the region be doing to help create stability? First, at the tactical level, the nations in the region should at a minimum encourage military-to-military direct contact. This can lead to defined protocols to minimize the chances of accidental ship and aircraft collisions, misunderstandings that escalate into shooting incidents, and even structuring agreements that would prevent cyberattacks on military command and control systems, which are highly destabilizing and particularly dangerous. Such military-to-military contact can be done bilaterally between the military staffs or organized in parallel to regional conferences. Additionally, when such regional gatherings do occur—for example the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) annual convocation—having a portion of the event that includes high-level and candid political conversations about security is important and can create a higher level of confidence. Alongside such governmental conferences, private sector engagement (in maritime shipping, commercial air traffic control, cyber agreements, and environmental technologies for example) can be an excellent way for views to at least be exchanged in a neutral forum. Third, finding ways for the militaries in the region to collaborate operationally, especially at sea, is important. This can be in simple maritime exercises that focus on noncombat operations—such as medical diplomacy, disaster relief, and humanitarian operations. It can also include quasi-military training or operations together for events upon which the nations do agree— piracy, for example, or humanitarian evacuations from a disaster zone. Fourth, the use of international negotiating platforms to resolve territorial disputes could be key. Putting such disagreements before international bodies like the International Court of Justice in The Hague, another mutually agreed- upon United Nations body, a third-party government, or even an agreed-upon binding arbitrator should be considered. Unfortunately, such international legal activities are not binding, and it appears unlikely that China will accept such outside interference in its “backyard.”\n\nOVERALL, THE ARMS RACE in East Asia is simply a reflection of the geopolitical tensions that will remain high in the region for the foreseeable future. While there are ways to reduce such tensions, they are unlikely to diminish as the twenty-first century unfolds, so buckle up. After putting all of this together, what is the right U.S. strategy for the South China Sea? Can it be separated from our thinking about the broader Pacific and the world ocean? What would Mahan tell us about its importance and our approach? While it is impossible to pull out a single sea from the whole of the oceans and develop a global strategy based upon it, the South China Sea is unique in its geopolitical significance. Here resources, great and powerful maritime states, and critical sea lanes of communication converge in the most populous region of the world. The United States must retain a presence here. There are several ways we can do this. We should maintain a network of bases and access agreements around the littoral of the South China Sea. The logical places to consider are in the west (hopefully the Philippines, perhaps even a return to Subic Bay), the east (in Vietnam, Cam Ranh Bay is a logical spot), and the south (Singapore, where we already have a robust presence, makes the most sense). In the north, we should continue to explore a strong refueling and resupply arrangement with Taiwan, even if this makes China upset (which it will). With a package of four bases, or at least four significant agreements for access and resupply, we could operate quite freely in the region. Additionally, we need to have a strong relationship with each of the nations around the littoral. We already have such relationships with Japan and South Korea, just outside the South China Sea; but we need to pursue exercises, military exchanges, and maritime engagement with",

    "text": "Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Continuing to pursue good maritime relations with Thailand, Indonesia, and even Cambodia would also be helpful. The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the resulting economic interconnections will be helpful strategically. The big question over time will be whether or not to encourage China to participate. It is too soon to tell, frankly, whether or not China’s intentions in this region will permit recognition of international norms, and maritime and littoral boundaries. If China truly intends to attempt to claim the South China Sea as its territorial waters, the prospects are slim for an accommodation. Having said all of that, it is crucial that we maintain an open and constructive relationship with China where we can. Despite our frustrations with their piracy of intellectual property, cyberattacks, unsupportable maritime claims, internal human rights violations, lack of democracy or liberty, and other points of disagreement, there are ways we can find some zones of cooperation. In the maritime sphere, for example, the possibility exists to work together on disaster relief, medical diplomacy, counternarcotics, counter–human smuggling, and environmental issues. The key is recognizing that there will be areas of significant disagreement, but that does not totally preclude working together on specific areas. And there will be flare-ups between the United States and China. Over the past decade, we have suffered several, including an aggressive Chinese confrontation in 2009 with a U.S. surveillance ship, USS Impeccable, operating completely legally in international waters (although within the exclusive economic zone of China); and a Chinese fighter jet collision with a Navy electronic P-3 Orion aircraft in 2001, forcing it to land on Chinese territory. Both of these incidents were eventually worked out diplomatically, but are indicative of the cut-and-thrust of both U.S. and Chinese maneuvering in the South China Sea. And in fairness, we should consider our own reactions if Chinese intelligence and surveillance vessels and aircraft were routinely operating in the Gulf of Mexico, close to U.S. installations and within our exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Those incidents bring up an interesting aspect of international law that pertains both in the South China Sea and elsewhere. The United States failed to sign the massive 1984 United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty (one of only thirty nations worldwide to refuse, sixteen of which are landlocked). In that treaty, the conditions under which nations can transit another nation’s exclusive economic zone (two hundred nautical miles) are somewhat ambiguous. The United States chooses to interpret it as permitting us to conduct national surveillance (a euphemism for spying); other nations (China, India, and others) vehemently dispute this. The text is unclear. This disconnect is what has led to incidents like this involving U.S. spy ships and aircraft operating inside the EEZ but outside the territorial sea (twelve nautical miles). More such incidents will follow, especially in the contentious waters of the South China Sea. Overall, the South China Sea will be a maritime hinge upon which huge geopolitical issues will ultimately swing. The United States must consider it a crucial zone of maritime activity in the twenty-first century. If we cede it to China—something China deeply desires and would consider inevitable—our global strategy will fail. While we should not push ourselves into a cold war with a rising China, we need to be mindful of our values and the importance of international law. As a young officer sailing these waters nearly four decades ago, I was deeply impressed with the history and civilization of China. We need to respect its culture and importance in this region and upon the dark blue waters of the South China Sea, but not surrender our own participation on international high seas and with close friends and allies. It will be a delicate balance to strike, but a crucial one. Much as with the Russian Federation, we should cooperate where we can, but confront where we must.",

    "section": "The Caribbean: Historical Context and Early Colonization",
    "text": "The Caribbean as it appeared to cartographers Pierre Lapie and Ambroise Tardieu in 1806. The Caribbean Sea remains the part of America’s backyard about which most citizens know very little. Any understanding of the modern Caribbean actually begins in Madrid, at the Spanish Naval Museum. I went there first in 2009, on my initial visit as the NATO commander. The chief of defense of Spain, an extremely elegant four- star air force general, put me in the capable hands of his chief of the navy for much of the day, and together we spent a couple of delightful hours wandering through the maritime history of Spain—a good deal of which focused on the Spanish conquest of the Americas, centered upon naval operations in the Caribbean. In the museum I saw the earliest map of any part of the Americas, the chart of Juan de la Cosa, which despite all of its understandable inaccuracies (it was drawn up in 1500 by an experienced sailor but not a formally trained mapmaker), is quite recognizable to modern eyes. Over the part of the map where Central America ought to be located is an image of St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers—probably an intended homage to Christopher Columbus. Columbus, as any pre–politically correct schoolchild of the 1970s will remember, was not Spanish, but Italian. He was born in Genoa in the middle of the fifteenth century, probably around 1450 or so. Known in Spanish as Cristóbal Colón, he has come to us in anglicized form as Christopher Columbus. He probably traveled extensively around the western Mediterranean and down the coast of Africa. This was a period in which the Portuguese were daily discovering new ways to harness current and wind to reliably explore beyond the edges of the known world. Some reports indicate that he traveled north as well, perhaps as far as Ireland. Genoa in the early years of Columbus was like the bar scene in Star Wars, with Marco Polo playing Han Solo. It was full of exaggerated tales of the Far East, the riches of trade, swaggering characters and sea captains, and plenty of shady opportunity. The son of a lower-middle-class weaver, Columbus would have grown up with a sense of horizons opening up, and a dream of making it to the richest lands of all—the China of Marco Polo’s tales. By the mid-1470s, he had moved to Portugal and set out to find a sponsor for a voyage to the west, eventually turning to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain (specifically Aragon and Castile, respectively) for sponsorship. The year 1492 was important in the consolidation of Spain and the removal of the final vestiges of the Muslim world from the Iberian Peninsula—on January 2, eight hundred years of Islamic rule over some portion of modern-day Spain came to a close through the so-called Reconquista. Given the optimism and enthusiasm over these august events, it was not hard to eventually persuade the royal couple (mainly Isabella, a sea captain’s daughter and granddaughter) to finance the expedition to the west, through what was called the Ocean Sea. Columbus demanded and received excellent terms: the title of admiral, significant control over the disposition of discovered lands, and a large share of the profits. The voyage to the Caribbean was soon financed and the expedition was divided among the three famous ships—the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria—in August 1492. By early October, the “Admiral of the Ocean Sea” is believed to have arrived in the Caribbean on a small Bahamian island today known as San Salvador, the name first given it by Columbus. Thus did Europeans come to the Americas, at least in the case of the Caribbean Sea. And what a disappointment for Columbus! Far from the glittering palaces and pleasure domes, the gold and silk, the spice and treasure of Asia, he found instead the traditional culture of the Amerindians, who went about mostly naked, built and produced little beyond bare subsistence, and had little idea about gold. Columbus explored and discovered Cuba and Hispaniola without finding anything of conventional value. He departed at the turn of the year in January 1493, bringing a few pieces of gold (he left nearly forty sailors behind to try to develop a gold mine on Hispaniola), some fruits and birds, and several terrified Indians to show at court. Despite utterly failing at what he actually set out to do—to find a western sea route to the Far East—Columbus put sufficient spin on the voyage’s narrative to intrigue many in Europe. Further voyages quickly followed, and investment flowed. On his next voyage in 1493, Admiral Columbus discovered other important islands—Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Antigua. Small bases and commercial entities were established, and more kept coming. There was a haphazard quality to it all, understandable given the depth of geographic misunderstanding that had led to the discoveries.",

    "section": "The Caribbean: Geography and Reflections on Early Voyages",
    "text": "When I was first a sea captain myself, in late 1993, my destroyer, the Barry, was ordered to the Caribbean to conduct humanitarian work and enforce an arms embargo against Haiti. It was a strange first voyage, as this was just after the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Frankly, I would rather have sailed my brand-new AEGIS combatant up into the Baltic Sea to chase Soviet submarines, but that ship had sailed, so to speak. So off to apply soft power in the Caribbean I went, with an inexperienced crew and all of us trying to find our sea legs on this, the first significant voyage of the newly commissioned warship. We sailed right by the island of San Salvador at the entrance to the Caribbean, and I called the crew up on deck and gave a very short description of Columbus’s first voyage, calling on my excellent fifth-grade history teacher’s pedagogy, concluding with the dramatic words, “Just think, here we are just over five hundred years later—half a millennium—sailing in the same waters as Christopher Columbus, the great explorer, headed to help create security in this part of the world. Columbus’s legacy continues.” I felt pretty good about my impromptu history lesson. But when I went down to the wardroom for dinner, a couple of my junior officers (who were nearly two decades younger than me and one of whom was African American) pointed out that Columbus’s voyages had led mostly to enslavement and death for the locals. Good point, I thought. We should remember that History, with a capital H, is always a throw of the cosmic dice. It seems to provide both the good and the bad in endless measure, and only God can sort it out in the end, I suppose. One man’s vaunted explorer is another man’s genocidal conquistador, and how those cosmic dice land on the table is so often a random walk. Indeed, the “Accidental Sea” could just as easily be the name of the Caribbean Sea given the nature of its discovery; but as my younger and wiser junior officers correctly pointed out, before very long, the deliberate and dark scourge of slavery to fuel the production of sugar and other crops would begin to take root throughout these beautiful and pristine islands. Colonization of the Caribbean was also fueled by the desire to proselytize and convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. The Age of Exploration, setting out on the vast oceans of the world, washed ashore on the quiet Caribbean—with explosive effect felt down to the present day. And on reflection it is hard to deny that the ultimate outcome, sadly, was not so much the product of an accident after all, but of a series of acts of avarice and greed that shape the sensibilities of the islands today. • • • THE CARIBBEAN IS A BIG SEA—if you include the Gulf of Mexico, which we will do for our purposes, it surpasses the Mediterranean as the world’s largest body of water that is not categorized as an ocean (after the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans in that order). It is roughly 1.6 million square miles, about half the size of the continental United States. It is a sort of massive pot-shaped body of water, and it is easy to picture the Caribbean as the rim of a huge volcano. One side is shaped by the long finger of Florida pointing downward on the western side, dropping like the boot of Italy toward the island of Cuba. Americans don’t always appreciate the size of Cuba, by the way—if it were laid out on a map of the United States it would stretch from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. Indeed, when President Kennedy was being briefed on the Bay of Pigs operation in the White House in the early 1960s, the commandant of the Marine Corps, a World War II veteran, overlaid the map of Cuba on one of the United States in that fashion to make the point. He then overlaid on the map of Cuba another map with a single dot at its center—it was tiny Tarawa, where in the Pacific War thousands of Marines had been killed to take that small island. Cuba is a big place. Cuba runs more or less northwest to southeast, and below it is the large island of Hispaniola, shared by the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and the Creole-and French-speaking Haiti, probably the unluckiest and certainly the poorest country in the Caribbean. Below them are the long string of islands forming the western border of the Caribbean, which are a mix of nationalities indeed, representing the constant resetting of imperial European ambitions in the Caribbean: British, French, Dutch, Danish, and Spanish are all represented across the centuries, and the present-day culture of each island is a kind of Euro- mélange. At the foot of the island chain and just north of South America are the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Richer than most of the rest, and representing a curious blend of English and Spanish culture, T & T in many ways has the best of both worlds: a British language and legal backbone overlaid on the warm Caribbean and Spanish island cultures. Because they are blessed with oil reserves (which has been a mixed blessing at times, in truth), they can afford to provide a higher level of resources for social and structural programs than many of their counterparts nearby. My principal memory of my visits there while I was a combatant commander was the exuberance of the motorcycle escorts that accompanied my convoys from the airport to the capital and the government houses. The tall, elegant police motorcyclists would literally stand on their motorcycles and direct traffic without touching the handlebars, moving at very high speed. I have been in motorcades in more than a hundred countries; this was the most dangerous.",

Across the north coast of South America, the Caribbean Sea laps against the three Guyanas: French Guiana, Suriname (the former Dutch Guiana), and Guyana (formerly British Guiana). They are sort of three tin soldiers guarding the southern mouth of the Caribbean, representing the three principal colonizing powers that arrived after Spain. Each has its own character, culture, language, and political situation, but the one that sticks in my mind is Guyana, the former British colony that sits farthest to the west. Known principally to Americans as the site of a bloody cult murder-suicide in 1978 known as the Jonestown Massacre after its megalomaniacal perpetrator, Jim Jones, it gave American English the phrase “to drink the Kool-Aid,” as in to believe in the cause despite all evidence to the contrary. It is a physically beautiful and relatively resource- rich nation with a quietly defeated air and a political system straight out of the Borgias. I went there first in the mid-2000s as the commander of U.S. Southern Command, determined to visit all of the thirty-plus nations of the region in the first couple of months on the job. My staff told me not to bother with the three Guyanas because “nothing ever happens there.” But I liked the idea of at least setting foot on each of the countries of the region, and after a brief back-and- forth with my doubting chief of staff, we set up a trip after, of course, visiting the bigger, more important countries: Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia. I arrived and was duly shuttled to see the president (or was it the prime minister?), and in his dusty office with the blinds drawn against the tropical sun, I asked him what the greatest challenge he faced was. Poverty? Drugs? Crime? (All of these were pretty obvious problems.) He shook his head and sighed, admitting that each of those was indeed a challenge; but he said the biggest problem was emigration. “Everyone who can attain a high school degree leaves as soon as they can. Mostly they want to go north to your country, but they will go anywhere to get out of Guyana.” It was a sad comment from a sad man, and made me think how lucky we are in the United States—for all our problems and mistakes and challenges, wherever I go people still want to come to, not leave, our country. We talked a bit more, I promised to be helpful in training and equipping his small and relatively docile military, and on I went. In all of the places I visited on the Caribbean Sea, in many ways Guyana was the saddest.",

    "text": "COLOMBIA IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL and troubled country in the Caribbean. It ought to work well given the lush beauty, incredible natural resources (gold, oil, rich farmland, gorgeous harbors), and geopolitical position, both commanding the southwestern Caribbean and possessing a long Pacific coast. It sits at the crossroads of North and South America as well as the Caribbean and Pacific, and would also possess the Panama Canal (and Panama) if the United States had not essentially created an independent Panama in 1905 by financing and guaranteeing a revolution and breakaway there in order to build the Panama Canal (“We stole it fair and square”). I spent a fair amount of time afloat in the Caribbean off the coast of Colombia over the years, especially in the first decade of the twenty-first century while charged with the so-called War on Drugs mission as the U.S. commander based in Miami. I had sailed through the waters earlier in my career, mostly en route to or from the Panama Canal, but as a four-star admiral I was responsible for helping our Colombian friends stop the flow of drugs that departed the Colombian ridge—much of it over water routes through the western Caribbean. The volumes of cocaine are staggering, certainly in the hundreds of tons. At one point early in my tenure, we captured a fully formed submarine built in the jungle of Colombia and launched into the Caribbean Sea with a crew of three, diesel propulsion, an excellent communication suite, and—wait for it—ten tons of cocaine in the hold. Street value north of $150 million: an example of powerful innovation and determination. These were the new pirates of the Caribbean, and their remit was law across much of the western Caribbean. Just north of Colombia is the beating heart of the American economy (American in the broad sense, encompassing all of the Americas, North, Central, and South): the Panama Canal. Built on what was once Colombian soil after a U.S.-engineered coup and subsequent “independence,” it opened in 1914 after much death and suffering among the workers, most of whom came from all around the Caribbean littoral and were directed by American engineers (after a previously failed attempt in the late 1880s led by Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps). This is a story of maritime engineering well told by historian David McCullough in his brilliant book The Path Between the Seas.",

    "text": "FOR A MARINER, there is no experience quite like transiting the Panama Canal. It is such a specialized nautical operation that even the United States Navy, which famously believes in full accountability for its commanding officers, relieves a CO of his or her command accountability while in the canal. I went through it first in the mid-1980s as the operations officer on a brand-new Ticonderoga- class cruiser, the fourth of the class, USS Valley Forge. I loved that ship, which I had helped build at a shipyard in Mississippi. When we sailed away, it very much had a “new car smell,” and the paint was pristine on its gray hull. As the operations officer, I had charge of the physical care of the exterior of the 567- foot ship, and my boatswain mates took enormous pride in the sides. When we approached the narrow sliver of the canal, I thought my crusty boatswain mate Chief Petty Officer Gene Jones would have a heart attack worrying about scraping our sides on the tight openings, where ships are literally pulled through the locks by mini-trains on both sides. The Panamanians were experts, and the transit went smoothly with hardly a scrape. But that feeling of coming from the open water of the Caribbean Sea into the tiny, vulnerable locks—of giving over responsibility for navigating your ship to the canal workers and the pilot—was an uncomfortable one. I was happy to break free on the southern side and kick up the speed to a full 30 knots, blasting swiftly into the endless Pacific and leaving the canal behind.",

Tragically, much of the violence is essentially an export of the United States, driven by the vast demand signal of our market for narcotics, armed by automatic weapons and handguns manufactured in our factories, and led by the gang culture created in southern California and sent south with deportees three decades ago. The Caribbean coast of Central America is a kind of Wild West that in places has changed little from the days of the pirates.

    "section": "Early Caribbean Experiences and Guantanamo",
    "text": "I FIRST SAILED to the Caribbean in 1975, while I was in my fourth year, a senior —properly referred to as midshipman first class—at the U.S. Naval Academy. Every summer the entire Brigade of Midshipmen, some four thousand strong, dispersed all around the world on their summer cruises. These were not experiences like going on a Carnival cruise line and enjoying piña coladas in the sunshine while shopping in the ship’s arcade. Summer cruises for midshipmen at Annapolis consisted of flying to some port of embarkation, slinging a huge sea bag over your shoulder, and trudging up a steel gangplank. The idea was to learn something about “the fleet,” which at that point in my seagoing career was merely a distant theory. In the humid summer of 1975, I was bused down to Norfolk, Virginia, where a dozen classmates and I embarked in the brand-new aircraft carrier Nimitz. She was a floating city; more than 100,000 gross tons, the length of three football fields, and from keel to the top of her mast about the height of the Empire State Building. After a quick indoctrination we were under way and headed down the East Coast of the United States into the Caribbean Sea. After a couple of days, we entered the Caribbean through the Windward Passage, the strait that lies between the islands of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and Cuba. The captain came on the ship’s announcing system, the 1MC, and said we were passing through the same water as Christopher Columbus centuries earlier, a speech I was to duplicate nearly two decades later as a destroyer captain. As a midshipman on Nimitz, however, I was having a cheeseburger in the wardroom and decided to forgo the soft ice cream sundae bar in tribute to the no doubt far more rigorous experiences Columbus and his sailors faced. Our first port of call was not exactly a tourist destination: Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. In those days, of course, it was not internationally infamous as a prison for terrorists but rather as a backwater training facility for ships getting ready to deploy. The main purpose of Guantánamo Naval Station for most of its history was logistic support—a Mahanian coaling station. Over time, because it was out of the main Atlantic shipping lanes and had a ready logistic base, it became the center of training on the Atlantic coast. In practice this meant that warships would show up for three weeks of brutal training to prepare for combat. Everything a ship could do was exercised, from gunfire to damage control (fighting shipboard fires and flooding after taking incoming fire) to aviation operations and under-way replenishment. It was a tight, twenty-hour-per-day syllabus, designed to put the ship’s crew under the maximum amount of stress. The beauty of doing this off Guantánamo Bay was that it provided an opportunity to get the full attention of the crew—who were a long way away from their families and friends. The bars and tattoo parlors of Norfolk seemed a distant memory to the sailors. But realizing that you cannot get the maximum effect by strictly training the crew at sea, the Navy in its wisdom let the sailors come ashore for a couple of days each week to blow off some steam. So my first chance to set foot ashore in the Caribbean was as a twenty-year- old midshipman on the athletic fields and tennis courts of the naval station under a full-on summer sun. Along with four thousand of my new best friends, I worked out and drank beer for 35 cents a glass with occasional shots of the high- end 50-cent rum to wash it down. Predictably, by the end of the day, the world was spinning a bit, and I went down to the pristine beach with a couple of my Annapolis classmates to sober up and contemplate the world from the vantage point of the sea. The Caribbean is a gorgeous body of water at night, and that evening the moon hung full and low over the gently rolling waves. As is the case in most of the Caribbean, the landscape of Cuba is dry and rocky once you get away from the beaches; but the beauty of the trade winds and the luminous turquoise water more than made up for it. As I leaned back and watched the moon rise, I thought of all the ships sailing and steaming by that southern point of the long island of Cuba, centuries of history, much of it bloody, passing by me. The next day we were back aboard the huge steel decks of the carrier and listening to the endless gong of the general quarters alarm.",

    "text": "IF YOU LOOK BACK at the colonial history of the Caribbean, it is easy to be reminded of Winston Churchill’s famous description of the traditions of the Royal Navy: “Rum, buggery, and the lash.” Indeed, the sea is named for one of the earlier Amerindian tribes, the Caribs, who were effectively wiped out by the intrusion of guns, germs, and steel, as author Jared Diamond titled his magnificent book on why Europe colonized so much of the world and not vice versa. Pre-European times in the Caribbean are not well understood or documented. The Europeans gave a variety of names to the indigenous tribes they discovered, all of whom they simply saw as candidates for conversion to Christianity and slavery. Some of the terms from those early days of collision include “Taino” or “Tanyo,” meaning a native who was relatively cooperative; or “Carib,” meaning a warrior and generally a cannibal; or Arawak, who was somewhere in the middle. Cultural anthropology was not a strong suit of the Spanish conquistadores, and the opportunity to preserve the language, history, and culture of the locals was largely squandered. What is notable is the lack of seamanship or open sea voyaging on the part of the early inhabitants of the Caribbean. Other than some offshore fishing, there is little evidence or record of serious voyages, the use of sails of any kind, or the construction of vessels capable of containing more than a handful of sailors. Thus the monstrous vessels of the arriving Spaniards, although quite tiny by today’s standards, were overwhelmingly impressive to the native populations. These were not entirely unsophisticated societies. The Caribbean natives had probably come into the broad basin of the Caribbean Sea thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The best guess would be that they were searching, not for gold and silk like the Europeans, but for land, freedom from oppressors to the south on the South American continent, food, and fish. At the time of the European arrival, they lived in villages and settlements, some of which were as large as\n",

The indigenous population suffered immensely, depicted powerfully in Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. The drama intensified with the Protestant Reformation, ignited by Martin Luther in 1517. King Henry VIII's marital disputes fueled the schism, leading to prolonged religious wars between Protestants and Catholics. This European conflict spilled over into the Caribbean, where Spanish Catholics sought to consolidate their empire, exploit resources, and monopolize trade. Protestant English and Dutch, along with French and Portuguese, challenged Spanish dominance. The Caribbean became a battleground, particularly for attacks on Spanish treasure galleons. Sir Francis Drake, a renowned privateer, epitomized this era of piracy. Buccaneers, known for their brutal practices, roamed the Caribbean, preying on trading vessels. This maritime Wild West is romanticized in Pirates of the Caribbean, loosely based on Sir Henry Morgan, who later became governor of Jamaica, further fueling tensions with Spain. My personal experience in Jamaica during the late 1970s highlighted the island's turbulent transition to independence and its complex social and political landscape.",

The triangular trade—Europe to Africa to the Americas and back—fueled this brutal system. Sugar, despite having origins elsewhere, became the dominant crop. The labor-intensive process involved not only Africans but also Indians and indentured whites. The human cost was immense, with millions transported across the Middle Passage and countless deaths. Disease, including yellow fever, further complicated the situation, disproportionately affecting Europeans and increasing the demand for African slaves. This system persisted until the 19th century, when nations began abolishing slavery, starting with Great Britain in 1807, followed by the United States and finally Brazil.

After the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro came and visited the United States, and it looked as though there might be an amicable relationship. But Castro quickly became associated with the Soviet Union, and in the dynamics of the cold war it was “you are either with us or against us” on both sides. The United States did all that it could to undermine the Cuban regime, most notably with the failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. This CIA-supported mission ended up with a thousand Cubans dead, a couple of thousand more jailed by Castro, and bitter enmity that endured for decades. The height of danger, and the moment at which the Caribbean became the epicenter of the world, was over a ten-day period in October 1962 in the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is a story best told by Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow in their masterful book Essence of Decision, about the Kennedy administration’s successful effort to avoid a nuclear war. The Navy conducted a significant blockade of the island to prevent more Soviet missiles from sailing to Cuba. Eventually the crisis was defused after some clever diplomatic maneuvering, but it is extraordinary to think how close the world came to a nuclear exchange and a completely changed and diminished world order in those days. The cold war hovered over the Caribbean throughout the second half of the twentieth century as a sort of ongoing symphony playing in the background, but the real theme was independence. Most of the islands and other small countries finally broke free from their European overseers, virtually all peacefully: Guyana and Barbados (1966), the Bahamas (1973), Grenada (1974), Dominica (1978), St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (1979), Belize (1981), and St. Kitts and Nevis (1983).

Despite its rapid opening, the Arctic remains the world’s least-understood ocean.\n\nAlmost every one of the world’s oceans has been the site of epic battles—some more than others—and there is no well-traveled global body of water that has escaped significant bloodshed.  But there is an exception: the Arctic Ocean.  The last ocean never to have seen any significant level of active combat is the Arctic, existing as it does at the top of the world, far from the reach of mankind. Today it offers the tantalizing chance of becoming a zone of cooperation and peace. But the enormity of its resources represents a prize that will draw increasing attention from many quarters, creating tension and danger.\n\nToday the Arctic world is in a delicate state of tension: between environmentalists and developers; between Russia and NATO; and between scientists and tour operators. The Arctic Ocean is a place of both promise and peril, as well as mystery.  We should consider the place it holds in the collective imagination of the world. Early maps often showed an area with arable land and a moderate climate at the top of the world, and this misconception persisted for centuries.  Virtually every civilization has a myth or two attached to the Arctic.\n\nThe smallest of the world’s great oceans, the Arctic Ocean has always been a zone of mystery. Early maps depicted it as a huge world of water, with vast hidden temperate land areas in the center of the massive ice fields.  Even today, we know more about the moon or Mars than we have the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. Remarkably, defining the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean remains somewhat difficult. It is scientifically accepted to be the portion of the globe north of which there is continuous daylight during the summer solstice. Some alternative definitions have to do with temperatures.  Politically, some try to define it as the ocean bordering those countries with Arctic indigenous populations. It is worth noting how fundamental the Arctic is to Russia. Fully 20 percent of Russia’s population lives within the Arctic Circle. The Russians fully self-identify as an Arctic nation.  They have just launched the largest and most powerful nuclear icebreaker in the world, the Arktika.\n\nStrangely, for a region that is essentially devoid of human settlement, the Arctic is today the fastest-growing region in the world.  In terms of the Arctic Ocean, it is essentially a bounded sea with two major openings, tightly confined at the Pacific end and relatively broadly accessible on the Atlantic side. With the warming polar climate, the permanent ice cover is eroding year on year.  By 2040 there will be an open passage for essentially twelve months of the year, and another decade later there will no longer be ice over the North Pole.  In terms of size, the Arctic is about 5.4 million square miles, covering an area roughly akin to the size of the continent of Antarctica. This is the promise of the Arctic Ocean: it covers an estimated nearly 15 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of the similarly estimated gas, and possibly a trillion dollars or more of minerals.  It is also a huge incubator for human life–sustaining protein in the form of fish.  In terms of geopolitical ownership, with the full Russian continental shelf claims, nearly 80 percent of the proven reserves of the Arctic will be in Russian hands. The fabled Northwest Passage is opening fairly rapidly. Several years ago, over a million tons of cargo transited the Arctic routes. This cargo falls broadly into three baskets: adventure tourism, transarctic shipping, and global shipping.  There are two key routes that connect Asia and Europe—the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route. Both routes are at present unpredictable and risky, but their use is growing.  All of this shipping must move over an area of open sea that is nearly undeveloped in terms of conventional ports and supporting maritime systems.  All of this represents an exciting opportunity for mankind. The promise of the Arctic Ocean is undeniable, but it sits in the center of a region that presents great peril as well.",

    "text": "The first time I sailed north into the waters of the Arctic Circle, I was in a Navy destroyer in the late 1970s. We were detached from routine patrol around Japan and ordered to the west coast of Alaska.  The highlight was learning that we would indeed dip our bow inside the Arctic Circle. In geopolitical terms, this was the height of the cold war, and our mission was to test antisubmarine warfare gear. Over the next two decades, there were plenty of interactions between U.S. and Soviet warships in the Arctic.  Like those games of cat and mouse, much of what happens in the Arctic stays in the Arctic. We dodged a bullet in the cold war—but looking ahead to the unfolding potential for confrontation around the Arctic Ocean, I often think back on that first voyage and hope that we can again avoid actual sea battles.\n\nWhy do I worry? A variety of perilous conditions will influence the speed with which mankind will be able to exploit fully all of the promise of the Arctic Ocean. The first and most evident form of peril remains simply the brutal character of the climate.  What makes the harsh conditions even more dangerous is the lack of facilities for rescue or monitoring. Taking the U.S. Coast Guard as an example, the closest Coast Guard air station to Barrow is located in Kodiak, about a thousand miles to the south. The Arctic is also famously difficult for the basic transmission of command and control signals. Cellular coverage is limited.",

Internationally, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) forms the backbone of ocean governance. The US hasn't signed but relies on customary international law. The 2008 Ilulissat Declaration supports UNCLOS's Arctic applicability. The Arctic Council, a forum for Arctic nations and indigenous groups, also plays a role. The International Maritime Organization is developing a Polar Code for Arctic shipping. Nationally, each stakeholder governs its nationals and Arctic areas, affecting transit. Geopolitical competition, particularly between NATO and Russia, adds another layer of complexity. The warming Arctic ice increases interaction between military forces. The 2012 ice cover was significantly below the 1980-2000 average, with younger ice indicating warming and breakup.  Melting permafrost could release massive methane, exacerbating global warming. A two-degree Arctic temperature rise could release 1,700-1,800 gigatons of carbon-equivalent methane, exceeding the Paris Climate Summit's carbon budget. Cooperation is crucial given these challenges.",

The reality is that Russia has the most at stake of any nation in the Arctic, and by working with the Russians we can ensure that the region becomes a zone of cooperation—not of competition or, even worse, actual conflict. Despite our disagreements in other areas, we need to maintain the conversation with Russia about the direction of the High North. Russia is building an operations center focused on the Arctic. We should explore how we could be part of that in some cooperative way, sharing our engagement with our Canadian friends and allies, as well as other NATO allies. In the dialogue with Russia, much of the conversation will focus on commercial and navigational issues. Of note, some scientists are predicting a truly “blue north”—one that has water, not ice, during much of the year—by 2030. Shipping, oil and gas, tourism, science, and many other commercial interests will dominate the agenda over time. Our Arctic czar should spend time with the private sector to fully understand the issues and find linkages with public sector efforts, which can then be translated into a dialogue with the Russians. Take an interagency approach. U.S. interests in the High North will cut across cabinet departments—Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, Coast Guard, Department of the Interior—as well as agencies such as EPA, NOAA, and so on. Working hard to make sure that the entire U.S. government is represented will be important. This concept is of course central to the DNA of a Coast Guard officer, making the choice of a retired four-star admiral and Coast Guard commandant sensible—the “Coasties” work with many other organizations and entities within the big tent of the Department of Homeland Security, such as the DEA, Customs, Fisheries, and so forth, and thus are very comfortable in an interagency environment.",

    "text": "so when we boarded their small vessels we would find “innocent fishermen” and have little evidence of their wrongdoing in many cases (unless we had caught them in the act and filmed them on video camera, of course). Eventually several of the local governments proved willing to take them on for trial and conviction, notably Kenya. The pirates were lucky that we couldn’t fall back on the centuries-old punishment for such crimes and string them up from a yardarm. While several of the nations in the coalition might have been actually willing to do so, we followed normal mores of Western judicial process throughout the time I was engaged in the exercise. In addition to the military instruments, both surface and airborne, the shipping industry itself took on the challenge of dealing with the pirates. Initially, this effort focused on routing and convoying, essentially charging captains to work closely with one another at sea and participate in our convoying mechanisms. They also became much better over time checking into the operational centers we established (in the Arabian Gulf and other littoral areas) over radio when they entered and exited the area. The ships gradually worked harder at sharing observations of pirate activity, and also exchanged ideas for warding them off. This included using the speed and size of the commercial ships; putting up various reasonable effective barriers on the sides of the ships, including barbed wire; tactics to counter a boarding operation, including use of fire hoses at full blast; nonlethal devices such as sonic blast and shock mechanisms; and simply manning the deck and throwing the ladders back into the sea when the pirates attempted to grapple on. The problem with all of those measures is that they required the merchant crews to do something for which they were neither trained nor particularly well oriented. Mariners today are used to very small crews, good meals, and creature comforts; the idea of fighting pirates does not come easily. Instead, many of the shipping owners developed plans for the mariners to retreat to a citadel inside the ship and radio from there for help. The film Captain Phillips about the taking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates and the subsequent rescue of the hostage captain provides a vivid and accurate portrayal of a ship takedown and one way the scenario could play out. What ultimately changed the dynamic altogether and has largely resulted in the dramatic reduction of piracy on the east coast of Africa was the decision by the shipping companies to put security teams on board. This was a new wrinkle in the millennia-old fight against pirates. Initially, the shipping companies wanted no part of this approach due to liability concerns. They were justifiably concerned that any mercenary team they hired might kill an innocent fisherman or other mariner at sea. This actually happened, by the way, and it was not even mercenaries who made the crucial mistake—a well-meaning Italian marine security team on an Italian-flagged vessel managed to shoot and kill two Indian fishermen in 2012. The case occurred twenty miles off the coast of Kerala, India —on the high seas but well within India’s exclusive economic zone (two hundred nautical miles) and is still in litigation, with potentially a significant prison sentence awaiting the adjudication in an Indian court. Despite legitimate concerns over the potential for incidents like this, shipping companies have finally turned to mercenary firms for protection.",

    "text": "Every four fish (i.e., 25 percent of the world catch) is categorized as “bycatch.” This is “accidentally” bringing aboard fish and other seagoing species that are not part of the target catch. When vessels use huge, industrial-level trawls—especially when dragged along the seabed—the collateral damage is extreme. The international community has been ineffective in managing this. Tied to this is a growing trend in using destructive fishing techniques such as explosives and cyanide, which threaten the orderly management of fishing and delicate coral reefs. Think of the oceans as a war zone, with daily atrocities, horrifying collateral damage, and no rule of law. There is an international political component: flags of convenience. This is the practice whereby commercial operators register their ships in a country with flexible enforcement.  This avoids accountability in the fishing world (and all commercial shipping). Shippers also seek the lowest-priced option. Today, between one thousand and two thousand fishing ships fly a flag of convenience. Many are from small Caribbean nations, including Belize, Honduras, and Panama. These nations profit from registration fees, making life hard for mariners and enforcement personnel because it is difficult to place effective sanctions on violators—the flag of convenience nation has no incentive to punish offenders and often has less sophisticated court systems. About 55 percent of all ships (fishing, tankers, cargo, passenger, etc.) fly a flag of convenience, and 40 percent are under three nations: Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. This represents a steady decline in the productivity of the oceans, and the long-range implications for the world’s fishing industry are concerning. Unless there is more regulation and scientific engagement, we should fear for the integrity and level of protein we can expect to draw from the sea.  More than a billion people rely on fish for protein, and roughly the same number work on or in the oceans—this despite concerns that fish stocks may have declined as much as 50 percent since the 1970s. Finally, we should recognize the potential geopolitical tension over fishing. Elements of the massive Chinese fishing fleet have been repeatedly apprehended conducting illegal fishing operations. Indonesia, Australia, and South Korea have a long record of such apprehensions. All of this exacerbates tensions in East Asia and the western Pacific.",

    "text": "Piracy and fishing are significant sources of illegal activity at sea. But the biggest criminal behavior is the willful and preventable damage to the environment. Through the destruction of the maritime world, we are robbing future generations of their birthright. This is stealing from us all, unless we work together to preserve the riches of the sea. This was a guiding premise in the negotiation of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the treaty has not had a sufficient effect.  From my time at sea on a destroyer and an aircraft carrier, I blithely watched our engineers pump dirty bilgewater and uninspected garbage into the oceans. We filled the oceans with plastic, toxins, medical waste, slightly radioactive materials, and unsafe products. This was “normal underway operations.” I thought the oceans could regenerate themselves, and nothing we were doing was anything other than “the way we always did it.” Later, I began to learn about the science, policy, and physical reality of the oceans. Sometimes you have to step back from something you love to understand it and judge where it is inflicting harm. Climate change is having increasingly evident effects on the oceans, beginning with sea temperature. As nearly all (more than 90 percent) of the extra heat generated by mankind eventually ends up affecting the oceans, temperatures are rising both at the surface and at great depth. While this does not sound significant, it has a gradual but inexorable effect on life in the sea, and migratory patterns of many species are under pressure. Rising temperatures also affect ocean currents. There is a complex interplay between salinity, wind, currents, and the resultant upwelling of nutrients from the deep ocean that sustain many traditional fishing grounds. If there is a greater differential between surface and deeper water temperatures, these upwelling currents are diminished, negatively affecting ocean life. Additionally, as salinity decreases near melting ice zones, there will be rising levels of acidification and ozone depletion—further exacerbating environmental damage. While rising temperatures are of concern, sea level rise has potentially the greatest effect on human life over time. The rise is related to the melting of polar ice caps and the increase of water volume. The rate of rise is accelerating. This is principally occurring because global warming is causing a melting effect of glaciers and ice at the poles. The potential effects are clear: coastal ecosystems will be disrupted, and there would be massive disruption in near-coastal fishing zones. Rising sea levels would also claim currently arable and habitable land—meaning coastal living areas would be lost, some small islands submerged, and current ports lost. With nearly three billion people living on coastlines, all of this will make for difficult adjustments globally.",

    "section": "Oil Pollution and Resource Exploitation",
    "text": "Two crucial problems affecting the oceans are oil pollution and resource exploitation. Both are intertwined, especially regarding liquid hydrocarbons, and both are having deleterious effects on the oceans. Oil spills can come from offshore rigs, onshore piping systems, or oil tankers. Removing resources from the seabed is complex and difficult. Throughout my career, I was saddened by the proliferation of offshore oil rigs. I have passed through oil spills, and the devastation—seabirds coated in oil, dead fish, a sheen to the waters—is sadly well known. I did so in early 1991 during the first Gulf War when Saddam Hussein’s troops deliberately pumped more than 400 million gallons of oil into the northern Arabian Gulf. The resulting damage still plagues parts of the Gulf. The most iconic example of broad area damage from offshore drilling remains the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 from the Deepwater Horizon rig.  The short-term effects are well known, starting with the eleven oil-rig workers who died and the more than 200 million gallons of oil that flowed into the Gulf.  Nearly six hundred miles of pristine coastland was oiled, and the livelihood of millions of residents interrupted or lost.  The long-term cost is still difficult to assess, as the damage to fish and birds may have generational effects. Most of the top-ranked oil spills have been from tankers. These enormous tankers are operated with a tiny crew. But when something goes wrong, it goes wrong with a vengeance, and nothing is worse than one of these behemoths discharging oil into the sea.  Americans remember the Exxon Valdez spill into Prince William Sound in Alaska. This spill covered 1,400 miles of coast and killed millions of living organisms. Yet this spill is not even in the top thirty in history and put “only” 11 million gallons into the water as compared with more than 200 million from the BP disaster. These big incidents shock the conscience, but they are dwarfed by the steady amount of oil that enters the world’s waters yearly through routine pollution. This comes from illegal dumping, accidental inclusion of oil in garbage, and the flow of oil from freshwater sources, largely rivers. Some experts believe more than 500 million gallons a year of such steady oil pollution take place. While big incidents like the Deepwater Horizon/BP or Exxon Valdez disaster can be overwhelming in a given spot, it is likely that the long-term, underreported but steady oil pollution is the bigger threat. This quiet but massive input of oil deserves greater study.",

This is most typically from broad industrial activities, which end up producing dangerous chemical substances that then find their way into the oceans. An example would be the flow of contaminated silt, which rolls into the sea. The silt is carried along by deep river currents and over time can include significant levels of pollutants from industrial and residential activity along the riverbanks. Man’s agricultural activities also contribute greatly to this form of pollution, largely from the use of nonorganic fertilizers. Auto activity, in terms of both exhaust and liquid effluents, also ends up frequently in the oceans. Toxic chemicals such as mercury also find their way into the seas, accumulating in the tissues of big fish species such as swordfish and tuna. And of course there is simple, obvious pollution in many low-regulation nations, where factories pump industrial waste, human excrement and urine, and other dangerous effluents directly into the water.",

    "text": "Another concern that I often witnessed over the years was the dumping of plastics and garbage directly into the sea. Certainly the U.S. Navy’s hands are not clean in this regard; I vividly remember all manner of plastic-laced garbage being thrown overboard. I would stand on the fantail of my destroyer in the 1970s and watch hundreds of seagulls come and look over the garbage we tossed carelessly over the side. We have come to understand the damage caused by plastics, and the world’s navies and responsible merchant fleets, at least, have modified their behavior accordingly. With apologies to Ian Fleming and his immortal novel Diamonds Are Forever, as far as the oceans are concerned it is plastics that are forever. Even as they degrade into smaller shapes and sizes, they still retain their fundamental composition. As a result, when marine animals—especially birds and turtles—ingest the garbage, they consume plastics, which are increasingly found not just in the seas but in the digestive systems of large segments of marine life.\n\nAs for other refuse, much of it is biodegradable or can be manufactured so that it will disintegrate without harm to the sea, but some vessels and garbage disposal operations continue to discharge highly toxic materials including contaminated medical waste (needles, tubes, stents, etc.), sewage (close to shore), chemicals, drugs, and other nonbiodegradable items. Looking to the future, there is both good and bad news. The bad news is that the vast array of activities that damage the oceans will only increase—there will be a higher demand for fish-based protein, and for hydrocarbons, and the increasing world population (probably headed to at least 10 billion by the turn of the next century from the current level of about 7 billion) will cause more pollution, including dumping of garbage, plastics, medical waste, and sewage. All of this will damage the oceans, with particular impact close to shorelines, especially on delicate and important coral reefs. And there will be new activities in the oceans, including a likely increase in the recovery of minerals, probably from the deep seabed where plentiful nodules of copper, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and rare earth minerals lie like so many potatoes waiting to be gathered and hauled to the surface. The good news is that we still have time to react and take measures to protect the oceans, beginning with stronger enforcement of the existing accords, negotiation of new international regimes, and a focus on using the oceans in responsible ways in all of our strategic communications globally. We will never fully tame the vast reaches of the outlaw sea, but we can take proactive steps to reduce risk.",

    "text": "At the heart of any approach to the challenges of the outlaw sea is the creation of an enhanced level of international cooperation. Only through a high level of integration among international, interagency, and private entities can there be any hope of addressing the challenges inherent in the vast world of the sea. Unfortunately, to date the results of such efforts have been mixed at best. Certainly the development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—an international negotiation concluded in the 1980s—has been largely successful. In the early 1980s, there was enormous enthusiasm for the treaty, a massive negotiating project that created the first truly global regime for ocean management. While it has obviously not solved all the problems of ocean governance, it is hard to imagine the level of chaos on the seas without it—even given that the United States, a huge maritime power, has refused to sign it (in a disagreement over deep seabed mining provisions, a foolish position pushed by U.S. neoconservatives). I remain hopeful that using the Law of the Sea treaty as a base, we will be able to negotiate other international instruments and—even more important—enforce them through a combination of sanctions, judgments in national and international courts, and shaming nations that do not follow the rules. So overall, I am cautiously optimistic about international maritime cooperation.\n\nOn the other hand, efforts such as the pledge in 2010 by the world’s nations to protect at least 10 percent of the world’s oceans as protected reserves by 2020 have foundered—to date only 2 percent of the oceans have been so designated. While there have been some successes (the United Kingdom, for example, has created a reserve area in the South Pacific near Pitcairn Island that is three times the size of Great Britain itself), international efforts are lagging overall. Likewise, the jury is still out on a plethora of well-meaning efforts to address fishing, pollution, and the global environment. In terms of interagency cooperation, again we see a mixed picture. While the Obama administration moved on creating a U.S. government plan against illegal fishing, there has been a lack of sufficient resources placed against the goals. Neither the Coast Guard nor the U.S. Navy has spare capacity to undertake the kind of sweeping tasks outlined in the plan. The good news is that the interagency spirit is willing, but the flesh, so to speak, is weak. This is typical of how interagency projects fail, both in the United States and in other countries. Unfortunately, there is no consistent voice for the oceans in the vast majority of governments.",

    "text": "Another immensely important zone of cooperation will be the intersection of efforts by the public and private sectors. International shipping companies, for example, are increasingly working together with international organizations (such as the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations) to create norms of behavior on the oceans. These run the gamut from agreements on “pumping and dumping”—discharge of anything from a ship—to levels of qualification of crew members, engineers, deck watch standers, mates, and captains. Many fishing companies are likewise working more closely with governmental and international organizations to bring order out of the largely chaotic world of fisheries. The oil and gas companies are cooperating at a higher level with such authorities as well. Getting past a sense of adversarial politics in all of these ocean areas will be crucial.\n\nIn Bill Moomaw’s superb report on the oceans, he and his coauthor identify seventy-six “treaties, agreements, protocols, and frameworks that address the management of one or more species, fishing practice, or marine resource at global or regional levels” (Moomaw and Blankenship, 39). This sort of international cooperation demonstrates both the hope and the challenge of such an approach: many were lacking a formal secretariat, scientific body, and enforcement mechanisms. Of the seventy-six, only six had all three. This is the case in other areas of maritime management as well. Clearly, much more work will need to be done in the international space to build not only agreements but the right kind of management and enforcement as well. The best way to do this will be under the overarching umbrella of United Nations organizations (especially the International Maritime Organization) and using the principles that guided nearly two hundred nations through the arduous decade-long negotiation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must be more innovative and experiment at sea with new ideas of governance and bring more actors into ocean policy. Creating more protected marine areas will be helpful, as will the idea of establishing sanctuaries at sea for fish, birds, and mammals, much as is done on land. Certification programs that clearly indicate to the public which companies are doing business in ecologically thoughtful ways will matter, and encouraging corporate social responsibility at sea will be crucial. Linkages with aquariums, zoos, environmental advocacy organizations, and think tanks all have applicability as well. The course we must chart for the oceans involves work between and within governments, and above all within the private sector. But underlying all of that effort must be a coherent campaign of strategic communications. Unless we can convince the public of all our nations that the oceans are not a vast, invulnerable dumping ground and an endless source of protein, we will not succeed globally in altering the course we are on. We have a long way to sail before we can feel confident that the outlaw sea has been tamed.",

    "text": "Ifirst heard of Alfred Thayer Mahan when I was seventeen years old and a freshman (a “plebe,” as we were not-so-affectionately termed) at the U.S. Naval Academy. Part of the first-year curriculum for the entire thousand-man (and it was all men in those prehistoric days) class was a course titled simply “Sea Power.” Some of my wittier classmates dubbed it “Z-Power” to imply that it was boring, but for me it was anything but a sleeper. The modern version of the course had been created by a venerable historian, E. B. “Ned” Potter, who had also written a classic blue-covered textbook of the same name. Luckily for him, every year he sold a thousand copies of this hardcover text, which no doubt kept him well supplied with the small-batch bourbon of which I am told he was quite fond. I still have my plebe-year copy of the book, a little battered but still very much a text I open from time to time, and of course the title of this work is taken in homage to Potter’s course, although the context and approach are entirely different. The structure of the course was built simply upon the chronological history of man’s military journey on the oceans. It began in prehistoric times, moved quite briskly through the age of galleys sailed by the Greeks and Romans, segued into the classic battles like Lepanto in the Mediterranean between the Ottomans and the Hapsburgs, included plenty of material on the American Revolution at sea, followed by a quick nod to the Barbary pirates and the heroics of Stephen Decatur. Then it slowed and began the long sail through nineteenth-century American sea power, with an emphasis on the Civil War, before launching into the real set pieces of World War I and World War II at sea. It was (and remains) unashamedly Western oriented (completing the course, you would have thought that the Chinese didn’t build boats). It was unapologetically told from a very American point of view, and was extremely traditional in its outlook. And the high priest of it all was Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan.\n\nOne former secretary of war, Henry Stimson, opined that Mahan manifested “the peculiar psychology of the Navy Department, which frequently seemed to retire from the realm of logic into a dim religious world in which Neptune was God, Mahan his prophet, and the United States Navy the only true church.” Mahan was born in 1840 in, of all places, West Point—home of the U.S. Military Academy, where his father was a professor. Mahan’s middle name was an homage to the so-called Father of West Point, Sylvanus Thayer. Everything about his early life would have predicted he would become an Army officer, but he set his course early for the Naval Academy and graduated second in his class of 1859. He was part of the Civil War Union Navy, and over the course of his career spent the requisite time at sea, working his way up to the rank of captain and holding command of a number of ships. Yet he was, by all accounts, an indifferent seaman whose propensity to bump into other ships and navigational buoys was noted by his superiors. But he began writing books early and often, expounding a theory of sea power that would make him perhaps the most influential naval officer of his generation.",

    "text": "Mahan’s desire to read, think, write, and publish occasionally landed him in hot water with his superiors, including one famously damning fitness report that said succinctly, “It is not the business of naval officers to write books.” (Here I must note that the book you are reading is the seventh I have either written or edited, none at the level of Mahan’s classics; but I too found my naval career a bit bumpy at times due to that desire to write. The Navy sometimes retains a level of skepticism toward those who would proffer their views in print, but fortunately I think overall there is a respect for intellectual effort as well as good seamanship in the course of an officer’s career.) Late in his career, Mahan was tapped by Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce, the intellectual force in the Navy’s move from sail to steam in the late nineteenth century, to come to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, first as a lecturer and later for two terms as the second president of the college, following Admiral Luce. Mahan’s lectures, which were deeply admired and absorbed by Theodore Roosevelt among many others, were eventually translated into a series of classic books on sea power and history that are still studied closely today and form the basis for American sea power on into the twenty-first century. He died at the age of seventy-four of congestive heart failure, having finally been advanced to rear admiral (on the retired list) very late in his life and career.\n\nThe basic theory of Mahan’s body of work is that national power derives from engagement via the world’s oceans along three key vectors: production (which leads to the need for international trade and commerce), shipping (both merchant and naval), and colonies and alliances (spread across the globe, forming a network of bases from which to project sea power). All three of these basic concepts still pertain today, although they need a bit of updating as we will discuss in more depth below. In addition to these three key vectors, Mahan also returns again and again to a handful of principal conditions that affect a nation’s ability to develop and wield sea power effectively. The first is the most straightforward and immutable: geography.",

    "text": "Alfred Thayer Mahan’s timeless work, *The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783*, remains a cornerstone of maritime strategic thinking. Mahan argues that national greatness is inextricably linked to sea power, encompassing not just a strong navy but also a thriving merchant marine, robust shipbuilding industry, and a national character oriented towards maritime commerce. He highlights key geographical factors contributing to sea power: extensive coastlines, productive harbors, and a favorable climate. The United States, with its vast coastlines and abundant resources, is ideally positioned for maritime dominance. Mahan emphasizes the importance of demographics – a population “following the sea” – and a government that understands and supports sea power. He advocates for an aggressive commercial approach to the seas, reflecting a capitalist and imperialist perspective. Mahan’s central argument is the need for a powerful fleet capable of concentrating force and achieving decisive victories at sea, ultimately containing land-based powers. Historical examples, such as Athens’ naval power against Sparta and the British Empire’s global dominance, illustrate this principle.",

He would likely advise the US president to prioritize a strong merchant marine, navy, shipbuilding industry, and Arctic capabilities, emphasizing the importance of an open global commons and freedom of navigation. He would advocate for challenging attempts to restrict maritime access, such as China’s actions in the South China Sea.  A robust system of alliances and partnerships, like NATO and other cooperative relationships, would be crucial for maintaining global maritime access and support.  Public-private cooperation in intelligence sharing, cybersecurity, and operational protocols would also be essential. Mahan would likely express concern about the rising naval powers of Russia and China, particularly their focus on submarine warfare and technological advancements. He would advocate for maintaining the US Navy's ability to counter these potential adversaries.",

    "section": "Shock and Awe to Cyber Warfare",
    "text": "To create shock and awe—missile strikes, aircraft attacks, naval gunfire, Marines landing and flying to an objective, heavy Army units right behind, all of it collectively creating a sense on the part of the enemy that defeat is inevitable. For Mahan, naval forces would have generally operated within their watery domain, fought a great battle with an enemy fleet, and been tasked with sea control, logistic resupply for forces ashore, and occasional power projection from cannons and Marines over a beachhead. But the essence of the fleet was to find and destroy the enemy fleet, thus ensuring control of the vital sea lanes of communication. He also, naturally enough, would have had no conception of the importance of cyber. The world of information, command, communications, and cyberwarfare simply had no existence in the period of time in which he was writing. It is hard enough for us to keep up with the latest changes in information warfare, let alone expect Mahan to imagine them. Perhaps the biggest technological change on ships would have been the use of computational power to direct weapons, giving them a distance, accuracy, and lethality he could not have imagined. The major cultural change, of course, would have been the advent of instantaneous communications, meaning that a captain’s decisions in battle are far more subject to “helpful advice” from a fully informed chain of command. I suspect the latter would not have been good news, as Mahan was someone who prized the initiative, verve, and confidence of the American naval commander at sea. But all good things must end, and in today’s world a captain still maintains a certain amount of tactical control over operations, even if he (or she!) is receiving a great deal of broad operational and strategic guidance. Additionally, it is hard to imagine that Mahan could have predicted the integration of space and unmanned systems into the nautical battle world. The vast expanses of the ocean always provided a sort of natural hiding place for ships, and the challenges of navigating across the trackless oceans challenged even the best of navigators. Electronic aids to navigation emerged in the middle of the twentieth century (radio beacons, for example), and radar deployed from aircraft began to shrink the unknown spaces of the sea. Once satellites were launched, and the Global Positioning System put in place, the world of the oceans was finally effectively mapped and tracked from on high. This has changed the character both of navigation itself and of how combat is conducted—virtually all naval weapons today depend on guidance obtained at least in part from GPS systems.",

    "section": "Undersea Cables: Peril and Promise",
    "text": "One final surprise for Rear Admiral Mahan would have been the emerging importance of undersea cables in linking the world together and creating a sort of undersea sea lane of communications (quite literally) upon which we all depend. One other important aspect of thinking through a maritime strategy for the twenty-first century is what lies at the bottom of the ocean. In addition to a formidable geography—just like the surface of the earth, with high mountain ranges, valleys, plateaus, plains, and on and on—there are critical cables, man-made of course, that carry much of the world’s knowledge and commerce. At the bottom of the world’s oceans, like so many snakes surrounding the globe, are the standard commercial fiber optic cables that carry 99 percent of the world’s international telecommunications daily. They move information at a brisk clip: two terabits of data every second, including nearly $5 trillion every twenty-four hours in financial transactions. About two hundred of them carry the vast majority of all that vital information. As one observer recently commented, “Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and a million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth’s Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.” As we consider the role they play today and what the potential might be for further enhancements, there is both promise and peril to consider. First, the peril—as strategists are increasingly aware, these cables are vulnerable. While their extreme depth protects them up to a point, advanced industrial nations—including the United States, the Russian Federation, and China—all reportedly have significant ability to monitor, exploit, damage, and destroy the cables. During the cold war, both the USA and the USSR were believed to have attacked antisubmarine systems and arrays at similar depths. As Steve Weintz wrote recently in the National Observer, “If you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of-service cyber weapon.” There have certainly been plenty of incidents of accidental cable cuttings and losses of data resulting from such activities. In 2006 and 2008, accidental destruction of cables effectively shut down Internet services to several large countries or parts thereof, including, among others, Egypt, India, China, and Pakistan. Fortunately, the cables are fairly substantial: typically, a couple of inches thick and well insulated with galvanic padding. But they are quite vulnerable, especially at cable heads when they emerge from the water. In Egypt just a couple of years ago, swimmers were caught while trying to cut through a major 12,500-mile cable. Internet speeds throughout Egypt plummeted by more than 60 percent. Overall, the cable system is fairly robust in facing routine challenges—accidents, anchors dragged over them, corrosion, low-level attacks. The challenge will come as nations and transnational groups (criminal cartels, terrorists) find ways to disrupt them on a massive scale. Even with the 285 cables on the bottom of the world today and the 22 “redundant” or “dark” cables in reserve, the vulnerabilities are clear. Both individual nations and international organizations should collectively be thinking through disaster scenarios and considering how best to use collective defense of these cables going forward. So much for the peril; but what about the promise of this system? Are there new technologies coming that can leverage and improve this capability? The good news is a resounding yes. First, the information technology itself is improving—and it has to. Just a couple of years ago, the Internet moved about five gigabytes per capita. It will hit fourteen gigabytes per capita in 2018. And with billions more devices connecting to the Internet in the next decade, the problem is obvious. Fortunately, we are able to use new phase modulation and also improve what is called submarine line terminal equipment (SLTE). This will boost capability by more than fifty times. Additionally, the prosaic ability to lay, adjust, repair, and maintain the cables is improving through the use of unmanned systems, big data analysis, and better materials. Additionally, there are increasingly creative ideas about how to leverage the cable system to improve access to high-speed Internet around the world. Satellites—at least for now—are just not the answer. Their signals capacity is severely limited by latency and bit loss, whereas underwater fiber optic cables deliver signals at nearly the speed of light (they are optic, after all). So what can we do to amp up their contribution? One idea is to create mobile networking hubs, both airborne and on the surface of the sea. The airborne vehicles could operate at forty to fifty thousand feet in altitude, which would enable broadcast to 250 nautical miles in all direction while receiving data from as far as 500 nautical miles. The surface hubs would be a system of “risers” above the cables to move the data to the surface and make it accessible to the mobile airborne hub. Such a system could have serious commercial viability, of course. It could also be very advantageous to military planners seeking another means of moving data. The key is the relatively low cost of moving data compared with satellites—this system, even considering the added cost of the mobile airborne hubs and the risers, would be orders of magnitude less expensive than satellite systems, and vastly faster. From a military perspective, this would be a redundant system to the backbone satellite systems in use today. This is also an idea rife with potential for public-private partnerships, as the risers could be connected via the systems that oil and gas industry platforms are using today. As with any system for communications, there is both risk and reward possible. In the case of submarine cables, we should increase our ability to protect this vital portion of the global communications grid and seek innovative ways to leverage its capability.",

    "section": "21st Century Seapower and Maritime Strategy",
    "text": "So if all of that reflects Mahanian thinking, where are we today? Are these classic ideas and principles important today, as well as the new technologies that are all part of our idea of twenty-first-century sea power? The short answer is yes—up to a point. In March 2015, the chiefs of the nation’s sea services—Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard—unveiled “A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” charting a forward, engaged, ready course to meet the nation’s global maritime strategic responsibilities. Then–chief of naval operations Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, then–Marine commandant General Joseph F. Dunford Jr. (he has since been promoted to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and Coast Guard commandant Admiral Paul F. Zukunft underscored the growing importance of increasing cooperation among the services to achieve the maximum forward presence and war-fighting capabilities required for national defense and homeland security. I enjoyed leading a conversation among the three of them at the official rollout of the document in Washington in 2015. This is not about diminishing the criticality of our nation’s air and ground forces: far from it. The document is about how the maritime world fits into the broader geopolitical context out of efforts to create twenty-first-century security. A bird’s-eye view of the shipyards, port facilities, Navy ships, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Special Forces bases and stations in and around the nation certainly reminds us that the United States is a global maritime power. This is as true today as it has been since the beginning of the Republic. What is often forgotten is the critical importance of a maritime strategy to go with all that capability. The sea services have developed such strategies for three decades, and they have been largely successful in driving the size, deployment patterns, and impact of our maritime forces. In 1986, with the fast-growing Soviet navy as the potential adversary, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps published “The Maritime Strategy,” aimed at using maritime power, in combination with the efforts of our sister services and forces of our allies, to bring about war termination on favorable terms. This flowed from presidential guidance. As then–secretary of the Navy John Lehman once reminded, President Ronald Reagan, when asked to summarize what his policy toward the cold war would be, replied: “We win and they lose.” Pretty simple. As a newly selected lieutenant commander (still a very junior officer), I was in the Pentagon as a special assistant to the chief of naval operations and had a chance to play a small role in the formation of “The Maritime Strategy.” Because I had a brand-new PhD, it was assumed that I was at least marginally capable of thinking and writing. This translated mostly to getting coffee for the actual authors, senior captains not only with comparable degrees but in possession of actual experience as strategic planners. But in hanging around the process, I learned a great deal about how these strategies are put together that I was able to use when I was more senior. In a nutshell, it begins with a political idea that “now is a good time” to put out a fresh strategy. This normally comes either when a high official (a secretary of defense or the Navy, or a chief of naval operations or Marine Corps commandant) comes into office. Or occasionally when a distraction is needed from the negative flow of events. A small team of bright officers is selected, several of whom will have had experience doing such work in the past. They will be given office space, a small support staff (such as Lieutenant Commander Stavridis), and will put together a draft concept. This will then be vetted through the enormous staff groups in the Pentagon, a process that can take months. Various offices will attempt to drive their particular areas of emphasis to the top of the priority queue, for example subsurface warfare, the threat of cyber affecting seagoing operations, tactical strike operations with aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and so forth. Lots of horse trading goes back and forth at increasingly higher levels in the food chain, until the leader of the drafting group—having done his or her best to synthesize all the “helpful input”—will take the melded draft concept to the decision maker, say the chief of naval operations. This august leader will provide a blessing, and now the true hard work begins—writing the actual words that will be part of the strategy. No one should ever underestimate the passion that goes into the heart and mind of a human being offered the chance to edit another’s prose. Once the drafting team produces an actual draft—sentences, paragraphs, a title, and so on—it must be sent around not only to the Pentagon staff, but to the various fleet elements as well. Lots of “helpful input” comes back, and is again considered (and mostly rejected) at this point. Finally, a smooth draft is completed that can go “outside the life lines of the Navy (or Marines)” and be presented to the Department of Defense (the boss) and informally to think tanks, influential thinkers and writers, retired august figures, and the like. All of this will typically have taken about nine to twelve months, but incredibly the product is usually pretty balanced and often contains some basic, useful guidance. “The Maritime Strategy” of 1986 was big and bold and really captured the imagination of the Naval Service. Subsequent strategic road maps would be published in 1992, 1994, and 2007. The massive blue-water threat of the USSR faded and the sea services became more skilled at littoral warfare as guided by the strategy titled “. . . From the Sea” in 1992. (Note: the three dots in front of the words “From the Sea” were intentional, meant to imply the flexibility of the Navy.) The world economy—largely dependent on sea transport of commerce—was becoming more interconnected. The challenges to national security were evolving to include wars between major powers, regional conflicts, international terrorism, piracy, and response to natural disasters. There was",

World changes since 2007 are examined: “Today’s global security environment is characterized by the rising importance of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the development of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities, threats from terrorist and criminal networks, maritime territorial disputes, and threats to maritime commerce.” Chinese naval capabilities, expansion into the Indian and Pacific oceans, and territorial claims are highlighted, as is China’s participation in international exercises and disaster response.  While the Indo-Pacific is crucial, Europe remains important. More U.S. forces will operate in the Indo-Asia-Pacific, but global forward presence requires expanded planning and operations with allies worldwide. Such partnerships increase stability and combined-force capability. The Coast Guard is also expanding combined operations, enhancing maritime stability. Sea power requires carrier strike groups, amphibious task forces, surface warships and submarines, and Coast Guard cutters.  Success demands all-domain access—protection of U.S. forces and effective mission completion in contested areas.  Budget constraints necessitate flexible, agile, ready forces and highly trained personnel. A balanced force of submarines, carriers, amphibious ships, and surface combatants is needed for deterrence, sea control, power projection, and maritime security.

    "text": "Throughout my naval career, I worked on many strategic plans, some visionary, others incremental. As we navigate the turbulent 21st century, it's time for “blue water” thinking. The oceans are more than a highway for goods. U.S. prosperity and leadership require a coherent national strategy incorporating Mahan’s principles—geography, national character, and the potential of the oceans. We must consider each ocean strategically. The North Atlantic and Pacific flank the United States, providing distance and insulation. Our strategy has been to ensure benign neighbors north and south, achieving excellent relationships with Canada and Mexico. This translates into three strategic elements: cordial relationships in the Americas, sufficient sea power for sea control in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and control of the Panama Canal. This requires approximately 350 battle force ships and at least twelve carrier battle groups.  President Obama mocked Romney's suggestion of a minimum number of ships in 2012, but Romney was right—quantity matters.  Events since 2012—China's naval rise, a more assertive Russia, and distributed threats—reinforce this argument. U.S. maritime strategy must ensure control of ocean approaches. Neglecting fleet size and military spending will jeopardize sea lanes of communication.  Two powerful fleets, each commanded by a four-star admiral, control the Atlantic and Pacific. The Third Fleet (Pacific coast) reports to the Pacific fleet commander.  The old Second Fleet (East Coast) was decommissioned and absorbed by the Atlantic fleet commander.  Both fleets protect U.S. coasts and territorial seas, conduct training, and prepare ships for deployment to the Sixth Fleet (Mediterranean), Fifth Fleet (Arabian/Persian Gulf), Seventh Fleet (western Pacific and Indian Ocean), and Fourth Fleet (Latin America and Caribbean).  An Eighth Fleet for the Indian Ocean and a Ninth Fleet for the Arctic should be considered.",

We need to invest broadly in the Caribbean and Latin America, the purview of the Fourth Fleet.  When I arrived at Southern Command in 2006, there was no designated fleet, requiring requisitioning forces from the Atlantic Fleet. We established the Fourth Fleet, though it faced regional controversy, perceived as a return to U.S. imperialism. I emphasized its focus on humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, medical diplomacy, training, canal protection, and counternarcotics.  These efforts have eased concerns. Guantanamo Bay is a crucial U.S. installation, a logistical, training, and naval hub for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. It supports humanitarian activities, medical diplomacy, and disaster relief. Guantanamo is leased from Cuba, though the Castro regime disputes this. Normalized relations with Cuba are positive, potentially promoting liberalization.  However, pressure to close the naval station will mount. One solution is to internationalize Guantanamo, using it for disaster relief, humanitarian work, hospital ship basing, training, relief supply storage, and counternarcotics efforts. This would require negotiation with Cuba, U.S. funding, partner cooperation (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico), and likely closing the detention facility. Internationalizing Guantanamo offers possibilities for U.S.-Cuban cooperation on regional issues.",

    "text": "The eastern Mediterranean, stretching from the Syrian seacoast to Libya, presents a volatile security landscape, further complicated by Russia's expanding influence from its Crimean bases.  Our NATO allies require our support and presence. The Sixth Fleet, based in Italy, patrols this region with a limited number of surface combatants and access to aircraft carriers and amphibious readiness groups from the Indian Ocean and Gulf when needed.  Given the escalating tensions, akin to the South China Sea, the Sixth Fleet should be augmented to a permanently deployed flotilla of at least ten ships, a significant increase from the current two or three.  In the South China Sea, collaboration with allies (Republic of Korea, Philippines, Japan) and friends (Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore) is crucial.  Maintaining the permanently stationed aircraft carrier strike group in Japan is essential, and the number of submarines in the region, based out of Guam or Japan, should be increased. This forward naval presence is key to maintaining regional balance.",

    "text": "North Korea, possessing nuclear weapons, developing ballistic missile capability, and a history of military provocation, represents a significant global threat.  Their domestic instability, including malnutrition, a large prison population, and a lack of democratic succession, further exacerbates the danger. Their threats towards the U.S., Japan, and other nations necessitate a comprehensive strategy. This strategy includes dramatically increased international sanctions, mirroring those imposed on Iran, targeting North Korea's international finances and penalizing businesses that interact with them. Deploying advanced missile defense systems like THAAD in South Korea and Japan is crucial to protect both U.S. personnel and host nations, despite potential Chinese objections. Modernizing existing Patriot and AEGIS systems and conducting joint exercises are also necessary. Aggressive cyber operations should target North Korean weapons programs, insert monitoring devices, and prepare for potential attacks on their electrical grid in response to North Korean aggression. Strengthening air and maritime cooperation between South Korea and Japan, along with large-scale annual joint exercises with a cyber component, will enhance deterrence.  Maintaining communication channels with North Korea is important, but it's crucial to avoid rewarding bad behavior with concessions.  China's economic leverage over North Korea is essential for successful negotiations.",

At the end of chapter 3 on the Indian Ocean is some material from a column in Foreign Policy written in 2014. The final paragraphs of chapter 4 on the Mediterranean are based on material published in Foreign Policy in 2015. Chapter 5 on the South China Sea has several paragraphs based on articles from Foreign Policy and Nikkei Asian Review from 2015. Chapter 6 contains some material from a column in Foreign Policy in 2015. Chapter 9 includes material on undersea cables and the new maritime strategy that appeared in Signal magazine. Captain Bill Harlow, a close friend and colleague of more than three decades, has been a superb supporter, adviser, and sharp-eyed editor of this manuscript. My friend and agent Andrew Wylie supported this idea and helped persuade Penguin Random House to take the plunge (pun intended) to publish such a watery book. Scott Moyers, a gifted agent and now an editor at Penguin Press, conceived the idea and persuaded me to take on the challenge of crafting this broad and deeply personal book. My wife, Laura, as always, has been a stalwart and patient source of love and support, even when our weekends were a bit curtailed as deadlines loomed. All errors of fact, content, or imagination are mine alone. I dedicate this book to all the sailors at sea: Godspeed and open water to them all, wherever the wind and waves have taken them.",

    "section": "Foreword",
    "text": "Referring to how “those far distant, storm-beaten ships, upon which the Grand Army never looked, stood between it and the dominion of the world,” Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan both described Britain’s successful blockade of Napoleonic France and sought thereby to persuade Americans that their own nation’s manifest destiny should not stop at the water’s edge. Mahan’s massively popular The Influence of Sea Power upon History was signally successful in so doing, becoming part of the intellectual backdrop to America’s acquisition of Caribbean and Far Eastern colonies and the construction of a world-class battle fleet. Unfortunately, Mahan’s thesis also impressed many influential Germans and Japanese. Their aspirations were dashed at Jutland and Midway. The last of these battles gave the United States unchallenged mastery of the world’s oceans, a position it continues to occupy 70 years later. Today, China is emerging as a potential competitor. In this volume, David Gompert asks what these earlier contests can tell us about that which is now on the horizon. History teaches many lessons. The difficulty is picking the right one. Well aware of this, David offers herein reflections on three encounters between rising and declining sea powers. Two of these ended in war, that between Germany and the United Kingdom in 1914 and between Japan and the United States in 1941. The third, that between the United Kingdom and the United States, led to a gradual and largely amicable transfer of first regional and then global predominance from one navy to the other. None of these outcomes is particularly appealing, as David Gompert’s analysis makes clear. Must America ultimately fight for or cede its naval primacy? If one projects recent Chinese and American economic growth rates several decades into the future, it becomes hard to envisage how one outcome or the other can be avoided. How long would an otherwise preeminent China be content to see a smaller, poorer, less powerful rival dominate the world’s sea-lanes? How long would an otherwise weaker America wish to guard global trade routes for China’s trade at America’s expense? These are the questions with which this important study grapples.",

    "section": "Preface",
    "text": "The idea for this book originated during research done by the author and Phil Saunders of the National Defense University on the mutual strategic vulnerabilities of China and the United States. That work, which culminated in The Paradox of Power: Sino-American Strategic Restraint in an Era of Vulnerability (National Defense University Press, 2012), proposed measures the two powers could take to reduce the dangers of conflict in the nuclear, anti-satellite, and cyber-war domains. But it left dangling one problem, arguably as important: the maritime domain—in particular, the looming competition and potential confrontation between Chinese and American sea power in the Western Pacific and adjacent seas. Just as that region has entered a period of change, owing to China’s expanding power, so is the nature of sea power changing. As a consequence, great uncertainty surrounds the question of who will control these vital waters—a question of importance for the United States, China, the rest of the region, and the world. With global economic integration, reliance on sea-borne trade and sea-based resources is growing. So is interest in cooperative maritime security, an idea advanced by the world’s leading naval power, the United States. At the same time, technology is increasing the vulnerability of naval vessels and shipping on the oceans’ surface. If the latter development means that the maritime domain may become less secure, the former development suggests an alternative to maritime competition and confrontation. Indeed, the rush of technology could push rivals at sea to become partners at sea instead. With regard to both developments, the future relationship between American and Chinese sea power—in classical terms, the “established power” and the “rising power”—is central, especially in East Asian waters. This study explores that relationship along several dimensions: theoretical, historical, economic, geo-political, and technological. It does so from the standpoint of U.S. interests, though with an eye on Chinese and other foreign interests. The imperative of maritime security and the challenge of vulnerability are not unique to the United States or to the Western Pacific. However, it is on U.S. interests in the Western Pacific that changes in sea power may have their first big effects. This study comes at a time of heightened recognition of the importance of this region to the world and to the United States. Its findings should be of interest to policymakers, opinion makers, practitioners, and scholars involved in any aspect of Sino-American relations, Asian affairs, naval and maritime questions, or political-military issues in general. While the issues are complex, the author has tried to present them in an accessible way.",

    "text": "American power in the Western Pacific has been, is, and will remain largely defined by sea power. Yet China views nearby U.S. sea power as a menacing presence, a counterweight to its regional interests, and a potential barrier to its access to the world’s oceans, resources, and markets. It is therefore deploying anti-ship missiles, submarines, and other capabilities that threaten the U.S. surface fleet. China is also expanding its own naval forces in East Asian waters to back its territorial claims, secure its trade approaches, and extend its influence. Because this vital region could become unstable or fall under China’s sway if U.S. sea power recedes or is allowed to become vulnerable, the United States can be expected to react to this challenge. Thus, a classic case of an established sea power resisting a rising one is shaping up in the Western Pacific. Such rivalries have a way of ending up in confrontation and war. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914), widely recognized as the father of sea-power theory, held that a world power needs overseas access to raw materials and markets to expand its production beyond its consumption.",

    "text": "Mahan observed Great Britain’s Royal Navy's role in its success and concluded sea power is key to world power, requiring national consciousness and commitment. Sea powers inherently rival each other, needing to safeguard their access (sea control) and disrupt rivals' access (sea denial). Concentrated battle fleet offensive strength is core to sea power. Mahan’s ideas influenced sea-power rivalries; his book was studied by German and Japanese officers, and American imperialists used his theories. The US, after continental control and industrialization, turned to sea power for possessions and world power. Britain, the dominant sea power, didn't oppose the US due to other threats and domestic demands. Imperial Germany challenged British sea supremacy, seen as a threat to its access and world power ambitions. Britain saw this as a strategic threat, strengthening its navy and aligning with France.  Anglo-German animosity, fueled by the dreadnought race, contributed to World War I.  Japan's 1905 Tsushima Strait victory signaled its rise.  With Britain and America weakened/isolationist in the 1920s, Japan sought East Asian control. Japan expanded its navy and carrier force. The US responded in the 1930s, threatening Japan’s lifelines, leading to Pearl Harbor. America’s industrial might and carriers prevailed. The Anglo-American case resulted in coexistence and alliance, but the US won't defer to China as Britain did to America. The Japanese-American rivalry's violent end doesn't necessarily predict a similar Sino-American outcome. The Anglo-German case seems more analogous, raising the question of how they could have achieved peaceful resolution. British and German statesmen lacked the vision to build on common maritime security interests, and their strategic postures didn't allow compromise.",

US sea power is crucial for regional security and influence, setting conditions for rivalry similar to Anglo-German and US-Japanese cases. China’s South China Sea claims cause US allies to seek American support. Despite shared maritime security interests (95% of Chinese trade and 90% of US trade is seaborne), a clash is brewing. China is expanding its naval reach, moving from coastal defense to protecting trade routes and collaborating against piracy, but this doesn't imply acceptance of US naval forces near China. China is leveraging information technology to improve targeting of surface ships with missiles, submarines, and cyber weapons. Chinese aircraft carriers pose a lesser threat. China’s focus on anti-naval capabilities constitutes sea power. Defending against missiles and submarines is increasingly difficult and expensive. US carriers are targets of Chinese strategy. Mahan’s focus on concentrated naval force and the carrier's dominance are being challenged by 21st-century technology. Missiles and submarines endanger carrier primacy in the Western Pacific. The US Navy and Air Force are developing \"Air-Sea Battle\" to counter China, but this is escalatory, destabilizing, and vulnerable to cyberattacks.  A technological remedy lies in distributed, numerous, diverse, elusive, small, long-range naval strike forces, drones, and cyber-war. This survivable posture would be less escalatory, discourage preemptive attacks, and allow for crisis de-escalation.  Carriers remain important globally but are becoming a liability in the Western Pacific, potentially diminishing their political influence.",

    "text": "The US faces long lead times, fiscal constraints, and institutional inertia in shifting to a more survivable sea power posture.  Therefore, it should pursue a political alternative: engaging regional partners and China in collective maritime security.  With expanded seaborne commerce, this idea has gained momentum outside East Asia. If targeting and networking invalidate Mahan's concentrated naval power, US leadership in cooperative maritime security might invalidate his premise of adversarial sea power. The US can't provide sea control everywhere; it should mobilize others for cooperative maritime security in the Western Pacific. The US should propose an East Asian maritime partnership, inviting states sharing an interest in assured access and passage. This could be based on nonviolent dispute settlement and non-threatening of civilian shipping, supported by information sharing, consultations, joint exercises, and incident avoidance measures. Resolving maritime legal disputes shouldn't be a precondition, but a pledge to refrain from force should be. Neither the US nor China would be expected to reduce capabilities or relinquish war options.  This could reduce mistrust and mistakes that might trigger hostilities. The goal isn't to exclude China but to encourage its participation. Regional navies' participation would encourage China to join or oppose a formidable grouping. China’s neighbors shouldn't seek to align against it, but China shouldn’t give them cause to by rejecting cooperation. Chinese concerns about regional isolation could allow its political leaders to overrule military opposition. The US can thus open the door to maritime cooperation. Chinese nationalism, weak civilian control, and suspicion of US motives might hinder China's accession. US patience and persistence are needed. A cooperative approach may be a long shot, but the advantages are substantial, and the US wouldn't limit its capabilities or freedom of action in war.  In parallel, the US should transform its sea-power posture to one that's more survivable. The US should move beyond reliance on concentrated surface forces while pursuing a cooperative alternative. China and the US have strong reasons to avoid confrontation. Growing sea-denial capabilities might diminish sea control for both, leaving both less secure.  The US has technological and political options to add crisis stability, lessen rivalry, and reduce conflict danger, while enabling it to prevail if conflict occurs.",

    "text": "“Command of the sea is not ‘naval.’ It is one of national policy, national security, and national obligation.” —A. T. Mahan\n\nSea Power and the Western Pacific: Importance, Scope, and Definition\n\nSince Commodore Matthew Perry arrived, uninvited, with a squadron of U.S. warships in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay in 1854, American Pacific power has been defined by American sea power. It was sea power that enabled the United States to assert itself in these waters and lands around them in the late 1800s. During the 20th century, U.S. fleets patrolled and, when called upon, controlled the Western Pacific, confirming that the United States has a Pacific calling to go with its Atlantic heritage. Today, with its heavy reliance on East Asian products and markets, the economic interests of the United States in the region are greater than ever. The Asia-Pacific share of total U.S. trade has risen from 5 percent in 1900 to 15 percent in 1950 to 30 percent today, larger even than U.S. trade with the rest of North America. Meanwhile, China’s rise as a great power presents the United States with both the risk of regional strife and the chance for global cooperation. As the United States recovers from its decade-long preoccupation with extremist threats in the Middle East and South Asia and turns its attention to East Asia, it is again sea power, though in forms yet unsettled, that will lend strength to the United States’ diplomacy and its ability to wage war if need be. At this juncture, it is important to assess the implications of China’s growing power, depending on how it is used, for America’s renewed interests, depending on how they are defined. Although the sea is only one of the domains in which Chinese power affects U.S. interests, it is as crucial as any, and the subject of this book.\n\nAt times, including ours, the United States has sought and gained predominant sea power, hence sea control—defined by two prominent 20th-century proponents of sea power as “the ability to use the sea in defiance of rivals.” In a vast region of capable nation-states and economic vitality, where sea-borne trade is crucial, a policy of sea control can invite challenge: After all, one state’s sea control can be seen by others as a threat to their own access, i.e., sea denial. Because these time-weathered terms are still useful, if sometimes misunderstood, it is worth clarifying them up front. In essence, sea control is defensive, and sea denial is offensive. The former is the ability to assure continuous freedom to navigate in any and all important waters of choice. The latter is the ability or action at least temporarily to deny others access to waters considered important. Because the ultimate purpose of oceanic access is trade, sea control, strictly speaking, is meant to protect shipping, and sea denial is meant to menace it. For our purposes, control includes being able safely to operate one’s navy where one wishes, and denial includes being able to endanger and disrupt such naval operations. Sea control is not the mirror image of sea denial. It is theoretically possible, if practically unlikely, to have sea control without being able to exercise sea denial—to enjoy yet not be able to prevent access.",

    "text": "Conversely, sea denial does not require sea control, since even without assured access there are ways—land-based missiles, for instance—to disrupt an adversary’s access. In view of technological trends and Western Pacific geography, we will see that this distinction is of consequence, and that technology is affecting sea control and sea denial differently. At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between sea control and sea denial, in that the naval capabilities with which a power assures its own access can also be used to deny access to others. The submarine or aircraft carrier that secures a patch of ocean for one’s own use can also threaten its use by others. From the Chinese perspective, there is a strong relationship between U.S. sea control and U.S. sea denial in the Western Pacific today, as there was from the Japanese perspective prior to World War II. Imperial Japan viewed American sea power as such a threat to its access to vital raw materials that it felt compelled to go to war. Because the Japanese, correctly, interpreted U.S. strategy as aimed at sea control and sea denial, they attacked the main instrument of both at Pearl Harbor. In the war thus begun, superior American industrial might and naval prowess brought about the destruction of Japanese aircraft carriers in high-seas battles of unprecedented scale and fury. Ironically, the elimination of Japan’s sea power left it dependent on the very American sea power it tried and failed to eliminate. China, the United States, and the Dynamic of Sea Power\n\nHow China interprets and counters U.S. sea power and whether and how the United States can and should try to maintain both sea control and sea denial in the Western Pacific are questions this book will attempt to answer. At the same time, technological change is complicating these questions: In the late 19th century, the best weapon against the battleship was another battleship; in the middle of the 20th century, the surest way to sink an aircraft carrier was with planes from another aircraft carrier. As the result of major and continuing increases in the range and fidelity of sensors, communications, and weapons, these simple equations have fractured. The capabilities a sea power uses to assure its access are not necessarily the only or even best ones to deny another power’s access. It no longer takes a carrier to sink a carrier. The U.S. Navy is as indispensable as ever to the ability of the United States to conduct its business, secure its interests, fulfill its responsibilities, and maintain stability in this region (and other regions) of critical importance to the American and global economies. Although China and the United States are not inevitable enemies, especially as long as they are economic partners, the expansion of Chinese power is prompting many Asian nations to look to American resolve and muscle for reassurance. Questions have arisen about whether China will become both able and determined to challenge American sea power: able because of its stunning economic and technological development; determined because it sees the U.S. Navy as threatening to Chinese territory, regional interests, and global access. As we will see, Chinese writings on this matter do not provide clear evidence of intent to wrest control of the Western Pacific from the United States and its fleet. Defending mainland China and preventing U.S. intervention in the event of conflict over Taiwan have thus far been the most explicit purposes declared by the Chinese. Yet the requirements of even these limited objectives are causing the Chinese to extend the reach of their naval and anti-naval forces farther and farther into the Pacific, at least to the so-called First Island Chain. In addition, China has displayed a willingness to use naval force to back its claims in disputes over territorial demarcations and maritime rights.",

    "text": "The Soviet Union, despite massive investment, never seriously challenged American sea control in the Pacific or Atlantic, illustrating the difficulty a great land power faces in operating naval forces against more seasoned sea powers. China faces many hurdles—naval architecture, integrating new technology, underway-replenishment skills, basing options, and able sailors, from deckhands to admirals—that will take a generation or more to overcome, especially if it means to have a blue-water navy of its own. Yet, acquiring sea power, and being a sea power, does not necessarily mean having and using power upon the sea. Theory suggests that sea power is the ability to exert power over what occurs at sea—or power of the sea. When those theories were offered in the 19th century, extant technology and capabilities made power upon the sea—notably, grand battle fleets—necessary if not sufficient to have power of the sea. Nowadays, power from elsewhere—under the sea, over the sea, from land, from space, and through “cyber-space”—can be used to exert sea denial, if not to maintain sea control. Thus, even with no grand fleet, presently or eventually, China (and others) can have sea power. Indeed, it is China’s current commitment to anti-naval capabilities, sea-based and otherwise, that makes our topic more urgent than waiting to see whether China builds a blue-water navy. By proper definition, China is already creating sea power and challenging American sea power, whether or not it tries to replicate U.S. naval forces. Likewise, how the United States responds to this Chinese challenge may involve forms of sea power unlike the naval forces on which it has relied and relies today. While the forms of both Chinese and U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific may be untraditional, the purposes will essentially be those that have motivated sea powers traditionally: to assure or deny access for shipping and navies. As the Chinese consider how best to gain sea power, it is important that today’s naval force not be an anchor on American thinking. Even as China becomes a sea power, in familiar or new ways, history indicates that Sino-American naval rivalry and conflict are not inevitable. The cases of Great Britain and Germany before World War I and of the United States and Japan before World War II show that naval competition can end in hostilities. But the case of Great Britain and the United States in the late 1800s suggests that an established and a rising sea power may evolve into co-existence, cooperation, and even, when confronted by common enemies, alliance. If the past is a guide, it is a mix of entangled interests, relative naval strength, and competitive hubris that determines whether sea powers collide or collaborate.",

    "section": "Technological Change and its impact on Sea Power",
    "text": "Today’s U.S. Navy has powerful offensive naval capabilities. In contrast, given its current aims and limitations, China is concentrating on defensive, or anti-naval, capabilities. Technology is fundamentally altering the relationship between offense and defense, and thus between denial and control of the sea. In particular, improvements in targeting are posing increasingly severe threats to surface vessels within range of new sensors and weapons. Consequently, naval strength, which has historically been equated with surface warships, may be trumped by anti-surface capabilities, such as long-range missiles guided from space against targets tracked from space. In response, the key capabilities in sea power may soon shift from surface fleets to capabilities under and above the seas, as well as drones. Compounding these new developments is the prospect that sea power will be endangered or even redefined by cyber power, targeting computerized command and control systems. Already, concentrated battle-fleets are being replaced by distributed networks of ships and sensors, at once necessitated by the vulnerability and enabled by the networking that information technology provides. While the U.S. Navy is grappling with the effects of these technological changes, it could be an even bigger challenge for Chinese naval forces, given China’s inexperience and U.S. advantages in targeting. Even if China is determined and able to become a sea power, it may discover that traditional surface forces, acquired at great cost in money and time, are not survivable—and perhaps not necessary. From their writings and investments, we know the Chinese are aware of the implications of advances in targeting and networking: They are exploiting these very technologies to threaten the U.S. surface fleet in the Western Pacific. The impact of long-range precision-guided weapons is a consideration that will weigh both on the Chinese as they decide how to pursue sea power and on the Americans as they decide how to maintain sea power in the Western Pacific. The particular problem of sea denial in the Western Pacific is a subset of a larger challenge faced by the United States, given its general reliance on power projection to and throughout this distant region. The Chinese are employing a variety of technologies to achieve what in strategic jargon are called “anti-access” (A2) and “area-denial” (AD) capabilities with missiles, air, naval, anti-satellite, and cyber-war weapon systems. U.S. air bases, facilities, and land forces stationed in or dispatched to the region are also becoming more vulnerable. However, because U.S. sea power figures centrally in U.S. strategy, influence, and possible operations in the Western Pacific, it is with this particular vulnerability that this study deals. Thus, technology is changing and even revolutionizing how we conceive sea power, sea denial, and sea control. It is making important the distinction between power of the sea and power upon the sea. Presently, it is shifting the balance between defense and offense at sea in favor of the former, making control harder and denial easier. Technology also means that rival sea powers of the 21st century, unlike those of the 19th and 20th, need not and most likely will not try to mimic each other’s naval forces in kind or size.",

    "section": "The Oceanic Commons and Globalization's Impact",
    "text": "Just as technology is changing the nature of sea power, globalization is changing its assumptions. Relationships between states with powerful fleets, or between established and rising powers, have been largely competitive since the era of mercantilism and competing imperial ambitions—indeed, since ancient times. As we will argue, economic integration and dramatic growth in sea-borne trade have made the oceans a “commons” of an interdependent world. All who depend on these commons share an interest in uninterrupted and unthreatened flows of energy fuels, raw materials, parts, and goods. The growth of direct overseas investment, multinational production, interwoven supply chains, and declining self-sufficiency makes it counterproductive to interfere with the sea-borne trade of other nations, which historically has been a strong motivation for sea power. Whether common interests in maritime security will supersede competitive, distrustful impulses could be a pivotal issue in the relationship of U.S. and Chinese sea power. If any major country has benefited more from global economic integration than the United States, it is China. World trade has enabled China to expand production far beyond what domestic demand would justify, which has in turn created the industrial and technological capacities to allow China to be a major sea power, whatever form that may take. Yet, globalization has also given rise to non-state actors, such as pirates and terrorists, who might interrupt these flows or else traffic by sea in drugs, humans, fighters, weapons, and other illicit cargoes. Likewise, rogue states, with or without traditional navies, might use new technologies and daring tactics to disrupt or misuse the maritime commons. This has caused the United States, notwithstanding its naval superiority, increasingly to stress collective maritime security. China, too, has much to gain from such cooperation, even if it means collaborating with U.S. naval forces to protect maritime interests that it and the United States share. Thus, even as China and the United States may be drawn toward competitive sea power, they may also be drawn toward cooperative sea power. If it were not for great-power politics and mistrust, China might elect to rely on American sea power to patrol and keep open the sea-lanes on which it depends. Keep in mind that until the late 19th century, when American leaders determined that global ambition demanded sea power, the United States depended on the Royal Navy to maintain maritime security, even in the Western Hemisphere. Although there is no explicit indication that the Chinese prefer to “free ride” on U.S. worldwide naval dominance, they are in fact a beneficiary of the security that the U.S. Navy provides along oil-supply routes from the Persian Gulf to East Asia. Moreover, if China rejects maritime cooperation, perhaps out of distrust of the United States, it may encourage even closer cooperation between the United States and others, including two other naval powers, Japan and India. While the Chinese might believe that these others will side with the United States anyway, some in China are concerned about its isolation. If China were to cooperate with and, by implication, depend on American sea power, it would risk being disadvantaged if cooperation breaks down and the United States uses its sea power to contain and deny China access.",

    "text": "China is preoccupied with the United States, Sino-Indian tensions could flare again as a result of hegemonic competition or deadly incidents that fuel persistent animosities. Less likely but not excluded is the onset of Sino-Russian confrontation over resource-rich Asiatic Russia, where Chinese migration and investment are weakening Moscow’s grip. Yet, even the resumption of troubles with its land neighbors would not cause China to view U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific with equanimity, especially if the United States and India formed an encircling anti-Chinese alliance. Recall that Imperial Germany had its own land adversaries when it launched its effort to end Britain’s sea dominance. If there is a flaw in established sea-power theory, it is the failure to recognize that the quest of sea power by one state can stimulate a similar quest by another, and so on in a costly spiral of worsening maritime insecurity for both. Great Britain’s policy of maintaining naval strength equivalent to the sum of any other two powers’ naval strength did not dissuade Germany from mounting a major challenge: quite the opposite. Likewise, Imperial Japan’s effort to have sea power second to none in the Pacific led to a major expansion of the U.S. Navy in the late 1930s. In both cases, the urge for sea power caused competition, fanned antagonism, and helped bring on war. Is competition the dominant dynamic in the case of China and the United States? Or could it be attenuated and even replaced by an appreciation that maritime partnership in the region would leave both China and the United States more secure at lower risk, lower cost, and friendlier relations? After all, Chinese and American ships cooperate, if warily, to protect shipping from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In East Asia, however, the Chinese have been cool and coy to U.S. overtures in such a direction, though this may not be a reason for the United States to abandon the idea. In sum, changes wrought by global economic integration, technological change, China’s growing power, and shifting U.S. and Chinese geo-strategic orientations might or might not point toward the sort of collision between sea powers modern history has seen. It depends on choices made by U.S. and Chinese political leaders.",

    "text": "The future of sea power, like the history and study of sea power, is to a very large degree a function of geography. The importance of sea-based trade, the possibility of securing and disrupting this trade, the ability to extract sea-based resources, the concentration and movements of naval forces, and, of course, ease of oceanic access all depend on it. Relative sea power, and thus rivalry between established and rising sea powers, is both driven and constrained by geography. Japan enjoyed an advantage over Great Britain and the United States in seeking to control the Western Pacific, as did (and does) the United States over all others in the waters of the Western Hemisphere. As true world sea powers, both Britain and America overcame the problem of distance by building and operating multi-ocean navies. Geography also determines whether passage is easy and safe, or not. Germany required access to colonies, resources, and markets through the North Atlantic, which meant passage through the confines of the British-patrolled North Sea. Geography forced the Soviet navy to transit narrow waters largely controlled by the United States and its allies (Norway, Denmark, the UK, Turkey, and Japan) in order to reach open ocean. “Like Germany, the Soviet Union would find its fleets bottled up in a major conflict, while those already at sea would become hostages to fortune.” All else being equal, powers with several wide paths to multiple seas have an advantage—thus, island powers such as Great Britain and Japan, as well as a two-ocean power like the United States. Geography obviously affects American and Chinese sea power in the Western Pacific. At first glance, the United States appears to be disadvantaged by the distances its navy must travel to get to and operate in the Western Pacific. Thus, naval nuclear propulsion, at which the U.S. Navy excels, enables its carriers and submarines to reach and remain at sea virtually anywhere; but nuclear propulsion is also a constraint—an expensive one at that, given the cost of such engineering plants. However, America’s apparent geographical disadvantages have been attenuated by the presence of reliable regional allies with deep-water harbors, modern facilities, and good navies of their own. In the Western Pacific, Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, and other allies largely offset the problem of distance, and will thus remain critical to American sea power and interests in the region. In addition, of course, the homeland security afforded by the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has long been and will remain a major U.S. advantage, unless and until technology reduces the difficulty adversaries face in threatening American soil (as has already occurred with respect to strategic nuclear weapons and is occurring with respect to cyber-war).",

    "text": "Generally speaking, China has the opposite of U.S. advantages and disadvantages as far as the Western Pacific is concerned. Being on the Western Pacific, its naval forces as well as shipping in and out of China are close enough to receive at least some protection from the mainland. Insofar as its main maritime security interests are in the waters of the region, its need for a blue-water fleet, both expensive and vulnerable, is reduced. Moreover, it can use land-based sensors and weapons to track and, if need be, strike U.S. vessels in the Western Pacific, giving it sea-denial options that do not depend on traditional high-seas naval forces. But a look at the map reminds us—surely reminds the Chinese—that geography is not an unambiguous blessing for China (any more than the vastness of the Atlantic and Pacific are an unambiguous blessing for the United States). China has three geographic problems. First, its territory is exposed, by virtue of proximity, to threats from U.S. sea-based strike power in the Western Pacific. Unless and until China has the ability to maintain a comparable naval presence as close to the United States as U.S. naval presence is to China—or develops sensors and conventional weapons of transoceanic range, which are decades away at the soonest—it must live with this disparity. China’s second geographic problem is nearly as noticeable on the map. To reach the high seas that its fleets and shipping need to cross for access to world markets and resources—the Pacific and Indian Oceans—they must pass through relatively tight waters crowded with islands and countries that may not be sympathetic to China in crises or war. Chinese control of the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea is a daunting challenge, not to mention unacceptable to the United States and others. Beyond these waters, China’s access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans involves running a gauntlet of straits and other choke-points patrolled by U.S. forces. Small wonder that Chinese strategists tend to see access to the world and its oceans in much the same way late-19th-century Germans did: not as welcoming expanses but as harrowing narrows. The intricate geography of the Western Pacific is even more disadvantageous to China when taking into account that most of the other states of the region are allies of the United States or, if not allies, at least looking to the United States for security in the face of China’s growing strength. Maybe the United States will allow long-standing alliances to decay or fail to develop new security relationships; but it seems at present determined to avoid just that. Conversely, perhaps China will earn the deference of its neighbors from Northeast to Southeast Asia; but it seems at present more likely that its growing military and naval capabilities—its A2AD and coastal fleets—will have the opposite effect. The starting point, by virtue of the path history has taken, is that the United States has the advantage of strong allies and expanding relationships, which in turn mitigates its geographic liabilities and aggravates China’s. As long as the United States maintains its presence and influence, including its sea power, in the region, China may be inclined to remedy this strategic problem by tacking away from rivalry and toward cooperation at sea. In that case, U.S. interests in the Western Pacific could be protected without having to confront a challenge to U.S. sea power.",

    "text": "This introduction requires one further clarification: What is meant by “Western Pacific”? Narrowly defined, the Western Pacific is just that, and thus does not include the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, or other important bodies of water that wash against China and other countries in East Asia. China might be more relaxed about U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific if the U.S. Navy did not frequent the seas adjacent to China. But of course, the U.S. Navy does frequent those seas, which are more critical and more contested than the Pacific beyond them. While U.S. and Chinese sea power, including anti-naval power, might eventually vie for control of the entire Pacific, Indian, and other great oceans, the waters where maritime competition—or, perhaps, cooperation—will be most intense in the next decade or so are those near China. For our purposes, we will consider them to be parts, and perhaps the most important parts, of what is broadly called the Western Pacific.  Structure This book is about the strategic choices that American and Chinese decisionmakers face, shaped by geography, history, technology, economics, and politics. It is structured according to the factors likely to determine whether China will feel compelled to challenge U.S. sea power and interests in the Western Pacific and what the United States can and should do about it. Chapter Two reviews the theory and history of sea power, including lessons from notable past rivalries and how they ended. Its point of departure—port of embarkation, if you will—is the work of American naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914), whose reflections on sea power and history shaped naval strategy, capabilities, relations, and conflicts to come. Theory and history provide the scenery for how Americans and Chinese may act out such ideas as sea control, sea denial, global reach, concentrated naval power, safeguarding versus severing sea lines of communication, and offense versus defense. As ranges of accurate weapons have increased by orders of magnitude—from a few miles for gunnery to thousands of miles for missiles—the particulars of past naval rivalries and battles become less germane. Yet, the point is not that the modern history of sea power will furnish definitive answers to the case of China and the United States, but that it may provide clues about how one power’s leaders will view and react to the other. By the end of the book, we will see which lessons from the theory and experience of sea power apply to the Sino-U.S. case despite technological change.",

    "text": "Both East Asia and sea power are of great and growing importance to world progress and U.S. interests. Yet both are entering periods of uncertainty and discontinuity. For the United States, the status quo has been comfortable but is not sustainable: The United States cannot dictate the path and use of technology any more than it can contain the rise of China. “Steady-as-you-go”—the order that has served regional stability and U.S. interests since World War II—has run its course. The United States faces tough choices that require bold decisions.\n\nSea power is the product of economics, politics, technology, and geography: necessitated by economics, textured by politics, enabled by technology, and shaped by geography. From international economics comes the need to transit the oceans safely and predictably. From international politics come confrontations and hostilities that may prompt nations to interfere with other nations’ sea-borne trade, giving rise to the need for navies. Domestic politics allow naval officers, business interests, and politicians to advocate, machinate, and formulate the particulars of sea power. Technology, defined to include the skill and ingenuity of people, can determine the balance between offense and defense, as well as the capabilities that afford the greatest operational advantages. If technology is equally accessible, the amount of resources a nation commits to naval capabilities determines its sea power. Geography, while largely beyond the control of nations, can make them more or less vulnerable and more or less able to project sea power where needed.\n\nSea-power theory is about how these factors combine in competition and conflict. It was born of the great-power naval competitions of the 19th century and earlier, and in turn it influenced 20th-century war and peace.  The extent and effects of such change are the underlying analytic questions. Global economic integration has greatly expanded international trade and investment across regions, making sea transport more important. In addition to commerce, the seas have become more coveted and contested because of raw materials beneath them. Ravenous appetites for energy, minerals, and food among rapidly developing and developed countries alike have made ocean exploitation more economical—lucrative enough to risk conflict. In East Asian waters, estimated resource concentrations have huge economic implications for numerous countries with contradictory claims and have opened a new front for competition. At the same time, globalization may attenuate geo-political rivalry insofar as one nation’s success depends on that of others. Globalization can also reinforce shared interests in secure trade, making confrontation between sea powers less likely. Contradictions between globalization and great-power rivalry are evident in Sino-U.S. relations and the role that sea power plays in those relations.",

    "text": "The domestic politics of sea power seems to have changed very little since the 19th century: Special interests in navies are as active as ever. In Washington and Beijing today, admirals, industrialists, and politicians are not motivated to downplay the other power’s capabilities, though they lack the influence of naval advocates in London, Berlin, Tokyo, and Washington a hundred years ago. In contrast, technology has gone through several revolutions since then, most of which bear on sea power: aviation, missilery, nuclear power, digital networking, and high-resolution sensing. Thus, the concept of sea power was formed in a specific 19th-century context, important aspects of which no longer obtain. That context was one of rivalry—economic, imperial, and military—among nation-states. While weak states had ample reason to fear stronger ones, it was the possibility of conflict between great powers, thus their peacetime pecking order and behavior in crises, that ordered world affairs.\n\nFor all his ideas about how to wage war, Mahan himself expected, and hoped, that great-power warfare’s growing destructive potential would make it less likely or at least more restrained. He died in 1914 before World War I would demolish his hope. In fact, the sea power Mahan prescribed combined with the power-politics he assumed to produce the conflict he dreaded. With trade expanding, grand navies were putatively threatening. Implicit in Great Britain’s strategy of maintaining an outsized fleet was the intent to deny to other powers the maritime prerogatives the British were determined to maintain for themselves. Fleets were essentially dual-purpose: able both to protect and to sever economic lifelines. A strong navy was inherently strategic in that it implied a threat to strangle a rival. Thus, an established great power, e.g., Britain, required naval strength to maintain its strategic advantage, as rising powers, e.g., the United States and Germany, sought it to eliminate their strategic disadvantage. Vying for advantage occurred even as commerce was expanding. The premise of sea power was distrust between great powers, notwithstanding their trade. Industrialization added both to the economic criticality of maritime trade and to the naval capability to disrupt it. Today’s established great power and rising great power—the United States and China—seem to distrust each other enough not to let their economic lifelines, critical waters and, in China’s case, coasts go undefended, or to eschew naval rivalry in favor of naval collaboration.",

    "text": "Essentially, she ruled unchallenged. Former antagonists, the Spanish and the Dutch, had no navies to speak of; Russia and the United States were deeply engaged in consolidating control over their own landmasses; the German Empire did not exist. Although its old enemy, France, had the world’s second largest fleet, “Great Britain’s naval supremacy remained unshaken.” Mahan’s theory flowed from his observation that the 19th century’s greatest power was its greatest sea power. What Great Britain had practiced, Mahan articulated: Because sea power can deliver national economic success and strategic advantage, it warrants the national commitment that it requires. In the British case, growing commercial and financial strength “enabled the country to adequately fund outsized naval fleets, and those fleets protected the trade and achieved the victories that enabled the British economy to flourish.” Mahan noticed that Britain had peers (France, for instance) in all categories of power save one: sea power. It was their superiority at sea that enabled the British to excel in exploiting industrial technology, in expanding production (well beyond domestic demand), and in securing access to the world’s abundance of raw materials. This implied that sea power was the sine qua non for world power and strategic advantage. Indeed, Britain’s navy made it the superpower of the 19th century. Knowing this, British leaders built and followed a national strategy based on sea power, and they saw to it that the Royal Navy would get the resources it needed to remain supreme. To Mahan, the heart of sea power was the offensive potency of a concentrated fleet. This was consistent with his belief that the “first principle of warfare is concentration—drawing force together at the centers which for the moment are important.” But his concept was much larger than concentrated offensive naval power, encompassing geography, navigation, economics, demographics, culture, and politics. Mahan both traced and predicted how sea power influences “history,” by which he meant the rise and fall of powers, the gain and loss of possessions, the ability to rule in peace, and the means to prevail in war.",

    "section": "Mahan's Principles of Sea Power and Their Impact",
    "text": "His line of thinking went like this: • To succeed economically and grow strong strategically, a nation needs to industrialize and produce more than it consumes. • Production requires more raw materials than the nation has. • Trade—importing materials and exporting products—is therefore vital to national economic success. • The oceans are the great highways of that trade. • Use of the oceans is vital to any nation that relies on trade and aspires to succeed economically and strategically. • The ability of a state to protect this use and to deny its enemy of it can determine the outcome of wars, competition over power, and international standing. • While sea power is important for any state, it is crucial for those with the potential and goal to become world powers. • The most effective measure in war at sea is to sever the enemy’s sea lines of communication. • The ability to destroy the enemy’s fleet is crucial to assure this is achievable and should be the main goal of war. • Offense is dominant; given offensive dominance, defense is needed only to enable offense. • Speed is important, but not as important as concentrated force. • Distance is a problem unless mitigated by bases and allies. • Because battle fleets can only be defeated by battle fleets, the capabilities to control the seas are essentially the same as those to deny others such control. For Mahan, sea power was power upon the surface of the seas—naturally enough given the state of technology. Submarines were novelties; aviation was science fiction; space satellites had not been imagined. Because communications were line-of-sight and gunnery ranges were at most a few miles, concentrated force necessitated concentrated fleets. Fleets were tethered to bases, even more so when coal replaced sail. Placing one’s fleet between the enemy’s fleet and its homeland was the key to victory. Blockades, commerce raiding, and amphibious warfare were considered secondary to the “clash of battle fleets.” Although sea power took a specific form in his mind’s eye, Mahan’s concepts were deeper and transcendent. Again, power upon the sea was essential because it was the way to attain power over what transpires at sea. While he did not anticipate the importance of submarines or contemplate aircraft carriers, he would have had no difficulty regarding them as inputs to sea power or amending his insistence on concentrated battle fleets to accommodate them. Long-range land-based anti-ship missiles would have been a greater shock to Mahan’s thinking; but in the end, he would have admitted that they were part of the sea-power equation because they could visit offensive force upon navies and shipping. Even cyber-war can be fit into the purposes and essence of sea power as defined by Mahan. Looking back, the battleship formation expressed but did not define the concept of sea power. Looking ahead, naval forces will hardly be the only way to acquire and use sea power. Mahan’s work was both descriptive and prescriptive: He sought to persuade his own country’s powers-that-be to commit to become the sea power that its size, location, ambitions, and seafaring ways implied it could be. He did battle not only with American apathy toward sea power but also with the idea that the fleet’s purpose was to serve as the nation’s “first line of defense”—a defense-mindedness that insulted three of his core beliefs: that the United States should be a global power, that global powers need navies less to guard their coasts than to safeguard their trade and prosperity, and that offense—the ability to disrupt another power’s trade by first destroying its fleet—was the heart of sea power.",

    "section": "Mahan's Legacy and the Evolution of Sea Power Theory",
    "text": "Upon publishing The Influence of Sea Power upon History, Mahan became hugely successful intellectually and politically—a strategic celebrity. His ideas rode a wave of national enthusiasm for world possessions, respect, and influence—based on claims of political, cultural, and racial (Anglo-Saxon) superiority, stirred by Roosevelt’s “Americanism” and formulated in Lodge’s “Large Policy.” From this moment, the U.S. Navy became synonymous with U.S. greatness (just as the Royal Navy meant British greatness). From 1890 to 1900, the U.S. fleet grew from 42 ships, of which 8 were steel and none were battleships, to 140 ships, of which 100 were steel and 8 were battleships. In that decade, the Navy steamed past the U.S. Army in political influence and public esteem. Roosevelt, Lodge, and Hearst favored war, not only for conquest but also to reinvigorate national spirit. Mahan demurred, arguing that deterrence is preferred to war, though it requires even greater naval predominance: “Force is never more operative than when it is known to exist but is not brandished.” On the whole—again, observing the Royal Navy during the 19th century—the greater the sea power, the less likely it had to be used. Though Mahan supported the acquisition of colonies, his stress on offense was not meant to be a call to start wars, only to destroy enemy forces if war occurred. Mahan’s concept was hijacked by others with a jingoistic fervor he did not share. Though based on British experience and motivated by American ambition, Mahan’s ideas “caused a global sensation.” In 1884, Kaiser Wilhelm wrote, “I am just now . . . devouring [The Influence of Sea Power upon History] and am trying to learn it by heart.” He had it placed in the wardroom of every ship in the German fleet. The book was required reading in Japan’s naval academy. Lodge and Roosevelt regarded it as scripture: “Lodge would use Mahan as a preacher used the Bible.” Roosevelt, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, leant Mahan’s ideas political force, rhetorical thunder, and generous funding. The traction of Mahan’s theory of sea power was badly weakened by World War I, which was mainly decided by land warfare (even between sea powers). The culminating Anglo-German naval battle, Jutland, ended in a tactical draw but a strategic win for Britain, which retained its mastery of the seas and consequent ability to gradually strangle the German economy and starve its population. Britain’s blockade of Germany affected the war’s course and outcome; but it also spurred development of the submarine to elude surface combatants and sink shipping. In general, World War I left losers and victors alike (except Japan) tired, broke, disinterested in more overseas possessions, and inclined to reduce, not increase, their fleets. It was the railroad, another product of the industrial revolution, that was seen as enabling great land powers to consolidate control, compete, move troops, and determine the outcome of war, more so than control of the seas. It was then that English geographer Halford Mackinder offered a competing and, considering World War I, more popular theory that land power, facilitated by rail transport, was the key to great power. (Ironic that an Englishman fashioned the theory of land power while an American did so for sea power.) It took war in the Pacific between Japan and the United States two decades later to revive Mahan’s theory of the importance of navies in war, peace, and history. Half a century after Mahan, with the benefit of learning from the Japanese-American conflict, E. B. Potter and Admiral Chester Nimitz (retired commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in World War II) updated Mahan’s ideas. Based mainly on American naval success (something unknown to Mahan), they wrote: The capacity of a nation to use the sea is based upon the character and numbers of its population, the character of its government, the soundness of its economy, the quality and numbers of its harbors, the extent of its coastline . . . and the location of homeland, bases, and colonies with respect to sea traffic. . . . A warring nation that has achieved a predominant capacity to use the sea is said to have command or control of the sea [which] consists of (1) the ability to defend one’s own sea communications and (2) the ability to deny the enemy the sea communications he requires to carry on the war. . . . Bases are indispensable to naval operations for both logistic and strategic reasons . . . needed to replenish, repair and protect fleets and also to maintain them near important communications routes. They also incorporated naval aviation into sea power theory: aircraft carriers replacing battleships as the most important platforms; the need for fleet concentration reduced; the risk of fleet concentration increased; and “gunboat diplomacy” promoted to “carrier diplomacy” to influence friends, foes, and crises. Writing during the Cold War, Potter and Nimitz were also more mindful than Mahan of the value of allies in creating and using sea power, whether for basing or supplementing the U.S. Navy. NATO became the first peacetime broad-based naval (and military) alliance, and the United States both supported and relied on the naval capabilities of (once rivals) Britain and Germany, as well as others. Another historical adversary of the United States, Japan, also became an ally and naval partner, though of limited capabilities and reach. Maritime security became collaborative. To this end, U.S. leadership was as important as U.S. supremacy, though the latter obviously facilitated the former. Unlike Imperial",

    "text": "Germany and Imperial Japan, the United States “multilateralized” sea power. At the same time, American strategy then and now requires U.S. naval power—and U.S. military power in general—to be robust enough to assure national security regardless of the strength and reliability of allies. With the help of its allies, U.S. sea power went essentially unchallenged during the Cold War, giving the United States the ability to assure maritime security, reinforce NATO, strike the Soviet homeland, and take on a new submarine-based strategic nuclear mission. Although the Soviets invested heavily in naval and long-range, land-based anti-naval capabilities, they were never able to threaten U.S. sea control, much less rival it.\nWith East-West confrontation concentrated on the western and eastern edges of the Eurasian land mass, the Cold War could be described geo-politically as one between a great land power and a great sea power. If the Soviet Union ruled Mackinder’s “Heartland” and most of his “World Island,” American command of the seas, trade, economy, and defense of the sea-connected “Free World” validated Mahan’s thinking. Owing to its sea power, the geographic remoteness of the United States from key theaters of East-West confrontation proved to be more advantageous than disadvantageous. The Cold War also reinforced U.S. reliance on global force projection, much of it by sea and supported by the ability to strike from the sea.\nIn addition to its limited ice-free, risk-free access to open oceans noted earlier, the Soviet Union’s failure, despite considerable effort, to exercise serious sea power in the North Atlantic or Western Pacific suggests a deficit of understanding, commitment, and competence to do so. The Soviet Union had negligible sea-borne trade, being isolated from the Western economy and reliant mainly on commerce with its client states, which with the exception of Cuba were land neighbors. Its main reason to build a fleet was self-protection in the event of World War III, both by holding U.S. naval strike power at a safe distance and by impeding U.S. reinforcement of NATO.22 This narrow motivation proved inadequate to make the Soviet superpower a sea power as well. Being a non-trading land power with a military dominated by generals, the Soviet Union lacked the commitment that made Britain, Germany, the United States, and Japan sea powers. It proved the rule that national consciousness of the importance of the seas is needed to provide the resources, patience, and persistence for navies.23 The only parts of sea power the Soviet Union possessed—ships—are of limited value absent the whole package.",

    "text": "As important as ships are the skills needed to crew and command them. Referring to the officers of the Royal Navy during the 19th century, Robert Massie wrote, “Going from ship to ship as they progressed in age and rank, experienced the sea and learned to command. The ultimate lesson was constant: in the British Navy it was not the ships but the men who won.”24 The same can be said for German, American, and Japanese officers and sailors—and French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese ones before them. Superior British seamanship and confidence on the high seas, whether in the English Channel or off China, were products of generations of experience, which has no substitute. Operating globally is qualitatively more demanding than operating coastally or regionally. It is also more potent because it gives the global sea power options the regional sea power does not have, such as “swinging” fleets from region to region or surging them from home bases in response to need. Both the Germans and the Japanese erred in calculating that the worldwide span of British and U.S. sea power, respectively, would be a disadvantage against regional sea power; for both Great Britain and the United States were able to bring far forces to bear when required to do so.\nWhat can distinguish the best navies from all others is the regularity with which they steam at great distance, detached from their support. When coupled with two-ocean access, as the United States has, such ranges facilitate coverage of high seas, trade routes, and critical waters worldwide. A land power can be a sea power, as the American and German cases show. But the strategic culture of the land power may relegate its naval service to junior status and fail to attract and develop the personnel required for blue-water superiority. The Soviet Navy never matched its investment in ships with an investment in sailors. In current parlance, the Soviet Union concentrated on the “hardware” of sea power while neglecting the “software.” Whether China can master both sides of sea power is a key question to which we will return.\nThese intangible qualities and the experience it takes to hone them explain why it can take decades to achieve sea control, let alone dominance, even with the industrial capacity for large-scale naval construction. Japan made a national commitment to become a sea power 60 years before Pearl Harbor, and 25 years before crushing the Russian fleet in 1905. Even with extraordinary political and industrial drive, it took Germany 30 years to confront the Royal Navy (at Jutland), and then it fell short. As rising sea powers mount such massive efforts, established ones can invest and maneuver to meet the challenge, as Britain did toward Germany and as the United States did toward Japan and may now do toward China.",

    "text": "to the Royal Navy’s 50, against which American ports were defenseless. As it became apparent that the small and untested U.S. fleet would not last long against Britain’s naval preponderance—a discrepancy that would take decades to correct— American imperialists shifted their attention to a more inviting target: Spain, a fading power, clinging to its remaining significant possession in the American Hemisphere, Cuba. From this point on, the United States no longer treated Great Britain as a threat to its strategic interests or as a sea power to be challenged. Just as the United States chose not to take on the dominant sea power—Spain being a softer target by far—Britain chose not to treat the rise of U.S. sea power as a challenge. Turning its attention to more pressing threats, especially the gathering danger of hegemonic war in Europe, Britain stopped sneering at the Monroe Doctrine. Just as London was about to dispatch an armada to the Caribbean to settle the Venezuelan dispute on Britain’s terms, Germany threatened to go to war with Great Britain over South Africa. The British then exe- cuted a “pivot” of their own: “Within a week America was seen as a potential ally, a fellow English-speaking nation against German impe- rial ambitions.”\nAt the same moment it dawned on the Americans that they would need a massive investment in sea power to end British encroachment in the Western Hemisphere, Germany “frightened Eng- land into America’s arms,” according to Henry Adams. The British were also realistic enough to see that the United States had the wherewithal to create an unchallengeable sphere of influence in its hemisphere. Moreover, the United States and Great Britain were increasingly interdependent economically, though bilateral trade was more important to the United States than to Great Britain. In 1880, 42 percent of U.S. trade was with Great Britain. By 1895, despite rapid growth in total U.S. trade, its trade with Great Britain was still 38 per- cent. In the Anglo-American case—though not in others, as we will see—shared interest in maritime security sapped the argument for mar- itime rivalry. Having diverged for most of American history, U.S. and British strategic interests were increasingly convergent. From Ameri- ca’s point of view and Britain’s, Anglo-American sea-power rivalry was over before it really began. Confrontation was averted mutually: The United States knew it was not strong enough, yet, to challenge British sea power in the Americas; and Great Britain knew that it could not contain the rise of U.S. sea power without exposing itself to the graver risk of German sea power.",

    "text": "Meanwhile, Roosevelt sought war with Spain with his inimitable exuberance. Apart from the merits of liberating the Cuban people, he had two motivations (three, if one counts his burning desire to lead men into battle): a conviction that a foreign war was needed to unify and invigorate the American spirit, and a justification for the construc- tion of a world-class navy. Roosevelt got what he wanted: a lopsided war with Spain, several American overseas possessions, and a sus- tained increase in the size and capabilities of U.S. Navy. The event that christened the United States as a sea power and Pacific power was the destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila harbor by Admiral Dewey’s Asiatic Squadron on May 1, 1898. There was celebration not only in America but also in Great Britain, literally. Although naval expendi- tures climbed from 7 percent to 20 percent of the entire U.S. federal budget from 1890 to 1905, the British were not disturbed. After all, the United States was not challenging British sea power: Germany was. The “Great Rapprochement” (1895–1914) between the established and rising Anglo-Saxon powers resolved their naval rivalry, not because the United States was dissuaded from becoming a global sea power but because British and American interests were compatible and, with the rise of Germany, increasingly convergent. When the United States got bogged down in a nasty counterinsurgency campaign against a Filipino resistance movement following the Spanish-American War, its eagerness for empire and thus its need for naval strength receded. Still, by the time of the Great White Fleet’s global circumnavigation in 1907–1908, the U.S. Navy had 22 battleships, 25 cruisers, and a total of 180 warships. While the Royal Navy, twice that size, still had global superiority over the U.S. Navy, it chose not to compete in the West- ern Hemisphere, given other and more critical regions and challengers, e.g., Germany and potentially Japan.",

    "text": "Even as Great Britain turned its main attention to Germany, the United States treated the Royal Navy as at least the benchmark, and per- haps the potential rival, of U.S. sea power. In 1912, Woodrow Wilson’s Assistant Secretary of the Navy—Franklin D. Roosevelt, following in his cousin’s footsteps—exhorted Congress “to buy and build dread- noughts until our Navy is comparable to any other in the world”—by clear implication, Great Britain’s. He argued that the American sea control must “extend all over the Western Hemisphere . . . a thousand miles into the sea . . . and wherever our commerce may be.” By the outbreak of World War I, the United States had replaced Great Britain as the supreme sea power in the entire Western Hemisphere, and the British were not prepared to contest this. The American digging of the Panama Canal, following aborted European attempts to do so, was both inspired by and a factor in the pursuit of this supremacy. Two features of early American sea power bear noting in rela- tion to Mahanian thinking. First, U.S. motivations, thus capabilities and operations, passed through stages: territorial defense, i.e., prevent- ing British or Spanish bombardment (neither of which was much of actual threat); coastal patrol, i.e., securing littoral waters for approach- ing and departing shipping; economic security, i.e., preventing attack on merchant ships, convoys, commercial activities, and assets wher- ever required (e.g., in China); support for expeditionary operations (e.g., in Cuba and the Philippines); and global power-projection. For a prolonged period (roughly 1895–1930), the Americans looked to sea power to achieve regional control but not to challenge or deny rivals in other regions. Loosely speaking, Japan and Germany followed the same sequence (as China may be doing now). A second notable feature of early U.S. sea power is that its opera- tions, reflecting its staged development, were distinctly non-Mahanian. As late as the 1920s, U.S. naval forces were “divided into numerous separate ‘force packages’ . . . in order to more effectively carry out their principal missions: troop and cargo transport, convoy protection, anti- submarine and anti-surface-raider warfare, and blockade.” Not until war with Japan did the U.S. Navy conform to Mahan’s model of the functionally consolidated and physically concentrated battle fleet— and then, of course, centered on the aircraft carrier at least as much as the battleship.",

    "text": "By the end of the century of its supremacy, Great Britain could no longer meet the standard of dominating all of its potential sea- power rivals: rapidly industrializing and outward-looking Germany, the United States, and Japan. It was forced, in effect, to cede the West- ern Hemisphere to the United States and then to ally with the United States and Japan against Germany, its most immediate threat (and later with the United States against Japan). The United States took advan- tage of British worldwide commitments and demands to become the leading sea power in its region. (As we will see, this is a pattern Ger- many tried to exploit at the time and China might try to exploit, vis-à- vis the United States, today.) Beyond naval strength, it was clear by the end of the 19th century that the economic and industrial potential of the United States would soon surpass Britain’s. As the world’s strongest economy and first to industrialize, the British knew well that sheer industrial scale could decide sea power competition between two states both committed, all else being equal. Although lacking comparable naval experience, so strong was the United States becoming, and so concerned were the British with Germany’s rise, that the Crown launched a pro-American propaganda campaign at this time in hopes of winning an invaluable ally for the Great War to come. In essence, the established sea power did not challenge the rising one; and while the Americans considered the Royal Navy the standard against which to measure theirs, they had no compelling economic or security reason to contest it. Once Ameri- cans’ ingrained Anglophobia faded, both states recognized that their interests were increasingly aligned. It is impossible to say whether British and American naval accom- modation would have occurred but for London’s growing anxiety about Germany and its naval ambitions. There were other pressures and con- straints acting on His Majesty’s Government at that time, not least of which was economic belt-tightening that necessitated making stra- tegic compromises. In any case, the Anglo-American case suggests that two great sea powers—one established, one rising—operating in the same waters are not inevitably on a course to competition, much less confrontation. It must also be said, though, that while the Royal Navy continued to operate throughout the Western Hemisphere, it did not challenge U.S. sea control; indeed, it could not do so because of demands elsewhere. As the U.S. Navy grew, Anglo-American maritime rivalry was not merely defused but even transformed into a century of maritime alliance against common adversaries. While this is encouraging for the Sino-U.S. case, it is important to remember that the United States explicitly claimed and Great Britain reluctantly accepted an American hemisphere of influence. Britain rec- ognized that the United States would surpass it in the economic and industrial wherewithal to maintain world-class sea power—something the United States does not recognize in China today.",

It also sought to make up for its late start as a colonial power by obtaining overseas possessions both for their economic potential and for prestige. Yet Germany’s access to colonies, resources, and markets was at the pleasure of the Royal Navy, the supremacy of which Great Britain was determined to preserve. British strategy was therefore viewed in Berlin as threatening to Germany’s economic health, imperial control, and standing as a great power. So Germany embarked on a campaign not just to become a sea power but to break Britain’s sea supremacy, which the British would regard as a major threat to their interests and strategy. It took Germany about 25 years, starting around 1880, to become capable of testing British supremacy. During that time, Anglo-German relations soured and turned hostile. Although their naval competition did not cause World War I, it gave the British a reason to suspect Germany of hegemonic intentions and to fear German power. Consistent with British policy of aligning against whichever power threatened Europe’s balance, Britain moved toward alliance with its traditional enemy, France. In turn, this meant that Germany and Britain would be on opposing sides when war occurred.46 Germany’s commitment to sea power was the product of back-room lobbying by a navy that was dwarfed in political influence by a German—largely Prussian—army that had won successive wars and enabled Bismarck to create the country. Admiral Tirpitz and his colleagues managed to convince the instinctively Anglophile Kaiser that Great Britain was Germany’s enemy, determined to deny it access to the high seas and the essential resources and new colonies beyond them.47 The admirals, taking a page from Mahan, framed the problem not as naval special pleading but as a national imperative: Failure to back a sea-power strategy would have grave consequences for a nation that was becoming vitally dependent on sea-borne trade. The challenge was also expressed in terms of fairness and pride: What entitled Britain to deny Germany access to the seas and the possessions, resources, and markets beyond them that Britain itself enjoyed? As German wealth, power, and patriotism grew, so did German resentment of a British policy that meant to keep Germany not only down but under Britain’s control. This sentiment meant that German sea power would have political support and therefore generous resources—one of Mahan’s criteria for success.",

The admirals and their political allies were not subtle about their target or their objective. The Second Naval Law (1890), authorizing construction of a High Seas Fleet, began with the following: To protect Germany’s sea trade and colonies . . . there is only one means: Germany must have a battle fleet so strong that even for the adversary with the greatest sea power [Great Britain], a war against it would imperil [the British] position in the world. For this purpose, it is not absolutely necessary that the German battle fleet should be as strong as that of the greatest naval Power because a great naval Power will not, as a rule, be in a position to concentrate all its striking forces against us. But even if it should succeed in meeting us with considerable superiority . . . the defeat of a strong German fleet would so substantially weaken the enemy that its own position in the world would no longer be secured by an adequate fleet.48 This formulation was known as Tirpitz’s “Risk Theory.” German strategy anticipated that Britain would find it increasingly difficult to safeguard its global interests and meet challenges from multiple rising sea powers. Matching British sea power was not a necessity, since the British could not concentrate their forces on the High Seas Fleet the way the Germans could concentrate theirs on the Royal Navy. Indeed, once the Imperial High Seas Fleet was built, Britain would be hesitant to confront it and thereby endanger its “position in the world.” At that point, Germany would have the sea control it required. Late-19th-century Germany had the means as well as the will to become a great sea power. In addition to its rapidly growing economic capacity and industrial prowess, Germany would overtake Britain as world leader in science and technology. From 1871 to 1914, it had more Nobel Prizes in Science than Britain, France, Russia, and the United States combined.49 As it applied technology to naval capabilities, Germany’s ships were second to none in quality, speed, and weaponry. Exploiting the benefits of a late start, Germany was not encumbered with a large fleet of wood-hulled sailing combatants. In contrast, Great Britain was slow to shift to iron, steel, and steam. In addition, the German navy developed seamanship and leadership with uncommon speed. The 20 years it took Germany to become a sea power was quick by historical standards. Britain’s response to Germany’s expanding continental and sea power was to recommit to naval supremacy. Although Great Britain was slow to grasp the significance of Germany’s new-found sea power commitment (despite the Germans being so explicit about it), once it did it threw itself into construction of bigger, swifter, and better-armed capital ships, including Dreadnought-class battleships and fast, light “all-big-gun” cruisers. The British certainly understood that Germany would become a formidable sea-power rival once it put its mind and means to it. For the British, an all-out naval construction race would be a major challenge with a great cost and an uncertain outcome, especially with global requirements and other sea powers looming.",

    "text": "In fact, the Germans’ Risk Theory—that undermining British confidence in a crisis did not require that Germany match Britain’s navy—nearly worked. In the years leading up to World War I, Britain shifted to a “one-power standard,” articulated in 1912 by First Sea Lord Winston Churchill as 60 percent superiority over Germany. Thus, the German challenge forced the British to accept significant risk in other regions (e.g., the Pacific) in order to frustrate a rising sea power in the region of their greatest interest. But the Germans brought this British response on themselves by explicitly threatening Britain’s ability to deny them access to the high seas. This begs the question of why Great Britain insisted on having the ability to deny Germany the sea access it demanded and genuinely needed. Why did Britain not offer Germany essentially the same space it offered the United States to become a sea power? Anglo-German relations were friendlier prior to their naval rivalry than Anglo-American relations were for most of the 19th century. In fact, Great Britain and Germany had common, historical adversaries: France and Russia. Anglo-American kinship was no closer than that between the British and German crowns, related by blood. Against this backdrop, the British could have offered Germany some sort of joint maritime security. They did not. While British statesmen might have moved in this direction, British admirals surely would have opposed it.50 After all, a policy of retaining sea supremacy justified a major modernization of the large but aging Royal Navy. Both the British and German admiralties were politically assertive, and neither regarded competitive naval construction as entirely unwelcome. If anything might have pushed Great Britain to steer away from competition and confrontation with German sea power, it would have been economics, not statesmanship. Fearful of German capacity and determination, feeling the growing burden of the shipbuilding race, and hoping to shift resources to social programs, Britain’s Liberal government did propose a mutual slowdown in warship construction (1908–1909). But the Kaiser and his admirals would have no part of an arrangement that would have codified Britain’s numerical advantage. According to Albert Ballin, an influential German shipping magnate alarmed by the turn in Anglo-German relations, “Tirpitz . . . did not wish to negotiate. He wanted no settlement. He wanted only to build ships.” The British admiralty was only slightly less enthused about an Anglo-German deal to limit construction. The initiative was rejected by Berlin and dropped by London.51 In any case, limiting ship construction would have been, at best, a patch on the expanding gulf between British and German sea-power objectives. The story of the Anglo-German naval arms race prior to World War I—told by Robert Massie in his brilliant book Dreadnought—was like the Soviet-American nuclear arms race during the Cold War (except that the latter did not end in hot war). Strategists, military leaders, and politicians in both capitals seized upon intelligence and news of the latest ship designs and building plans of the other to expand and upgrade their own naval capabilities beyond any requirements except those of the competition’s internal logic. The established power was not entirely reactive to the moves of the rising one. The British were the first to lay the keels of new classes of more powerful ships, leap-frogging German designs and forcing Berlin to follow suit. If this dynamic was fed by suspicion, it created even more suspicion. While the Royal Navy remained larger and operationally superior right up to World War I, Germany was closing the gap. In 1898, when Germany’s effort went into high gear, the Royal Navy had 329 warships compared with 68 for Germany. Ten years later, Germany had added 162 warships, while Great Britain had added only 8. The British, as noted, were modernizing while the Germans had to expand and modernize. If the Germans forced a quantitative naval arms race, the British set the pace for a qualitative one. Naval technology was such that each rival was building a mirror image of the other, with a particular emphasis on the offensive power of the concentrated battle fleet (just as Mahan had prescribed). Broadly speaking, although the established sea power was the first to industrialize and the rising one had only just become a unified state, the two were roughly equivalent in capacity to support sea power. While Germany had greater economic and industrial potential, it also had major land interests that Great Britain did not. Being evenly matched, neither had cause to back off for lack of confidence in its ability to compete. The British had strong reasons not to abandon their strategy of maintaining sea control by maintaining supremacy. The Germans had equally strong reasons to pursue relentlessly their goal of breaking the ability of Great Britain to deny access—or, according to the Risk Theory, to make prohibitive the expected costs to the British of threatening Germany’s interests and navy.",

    "text": "It is important to reiterate that the Germans took direct aim at the Royal Navy, figuratively in building the High Seas Fleet and literally in their plans to break British sea denial. As we will see also in the Japanese-U.S. case (and might also witness in today’s Sino-U.S. case), there is no better way to justify and focus the pursuit of sea power than to place that of a rival and potential enemy squarely in the crosshairs. Yet, this approach can be counterproductive and even dangerous insofar as it provokes the targeted, established power to invest even more in its naval capabilities, to design them specifically to defeat the rising power, to view that power as an enemy, and to draw up war plans to defeat it. It is impossible to say how the events of 1914 would have unfolded had the collision between Britain’s sea-power standard and Germany’s sea-power ambition not occurred. Again, the war was precipitated by events and alignments separate from the naval arms race. Yet, the role of Anglo-German sea-power rivalry in the lead-up to war should not be underestimated. The German naval challenge precipitated not merely a British in-kind response but also a change in British foreign policy—the abandonment of “Splendid Isolation” from the Continent’s disputes and alignments in favor of weighing in the side of the powers opposing the increasingly powerful Germany. Even as German admirals depicted British sea power as evidence of hostile intentions toward Germany, British statesmen saw the growing German High Seas as a leading indicator of a strategic if not existential threat. “[A]s Britain began to fear the German Fleet, it feared also that the greatest military power in Europe would not aspire to become a great naval power unless it wanted to dominate the world. . . .”52 As a consequence, in Massie’s words, Britain became . . . a partner of its erstwhile enemies, France and Russia. The alienation of Britain from Germany and its growing partnership between Britain and France and Britain and Russia, were caused by fear of the German Fleet. “It closed the ranks of the Entente,” said Winston Churchill. “With every rivet that von Tirpitz drove into his ships of war, he united British opinion . . . the hammers that clanged at Kiel and Wilhemshaven were forging the coalition of nations by which Germany was to be resisted and finally overthrown.”53 The title of Mahan’s monumental work, The Influence",

    "text": "An epilogue to the story of Anglo-German naval rivalry and conflict is pertinent to our study. Having failed to neutralize Britain’s sea-power advantage, and having lost World War I, Germany of the Third Reich chose not to invest heavily in a surface fleet in the run-up to and during World War II.54 Instead, it concentrated on a strong submarine force to threaten British and American naval forces and to cripple the shipping that the allies relied on for reinforcement. The Germans considered anti-naval capabilities more promising, more cost-effective, and more essential than those of a powerful surface fleet. It is interesting to speculate whether a Nazi aircraft-carrier force on the American or Japanese scale would have affected the war in Europe and the Atlantic. Strategically, Hitler and his strategists were captivated not by the idea of becoming a sea power, perhaps in league with Japan, but rather by the need for “living space” to Germany’s East—in the “Heartland” that Mackinder argued was the key to command of the “World Island” and ultimately the World. While Nazi Germany appreciated the importance of the seas, especially to its enemies, it opted for sea-denial capabilities by exploiting submarine technology rather than imitating the Anglo-Saxon fleets (as Imperial Germany had done). With the advance of technology, sea power was no longer defined by battle fleets or confined to clashes of battle fleets. The Battle of the Atlantic—which Churchill called the “dominating factor of the war” on which “everything happening elsewhere depended”—pitted allied bombers against German U-boats that eluded surface escorts to attack convoys with war supplies.55 Sea power had evolved from power upon the sea to power of the sea. Although the technology of his day did not require Mahan to make the distinction, he would surely have been comfortable with it. Hitler and his lieutenants never read The Influence of Sea Power upon History, as far as we know. Had they, they would have found an alternative to the theory that controlling Eastern Europe was the key to controlling the world. They might also have understood why defeating two sea powers would be harder than conquering continental neighbors.",

    "text": "Germans may not have studied Mahan between the Wars, but we know that the Japanese did so all along. Although Mahan wrote the sea-power script for his own country, the Japanese followed it exactly. After emerging from self-isolation in the mid-19th century, Japan became a sea power and as a result a great power: a seafaring island; the first non-Western country to industrialize; determined to produce more than it consumed; increasingly dependent on foreign trade; growing stronger economically and technologically; capable of unified national purpose and commitment; relentless. The irony, of course, is that it was the United States that pierced Japanese insulation, resulting in a Japanese commitment to sea power that eventually was turned against the United States. Fifty years from the time Commodore Perry opened Japan, it had arrived as a world-class sea power by its spectacular and surprising destruction of the Tsar’s fleet at the Strait of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese war (1905), where both Japanese ships and Japanese seamanship excelled. Like the United States, Japan graduated its navy in phases from coastal defense to trade-route security to regional sea power. Japanese sea power continued to increase in size, quality, and experience until capable of forcibly challenging the United States for control of the Pacific in World War II. However, the United States—unlike Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere—was not about to acquiesce in foreign hegemony in the Western Pacific, euphemistically called the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere by the Japanese. This contradiction between Japanese and American sea-power purposes set the stage for the collision to come, prompting the obvious question about parallels with China and the United States today.",

    "text": "Although allies during World War I, the Japanese saw the United States and Great Britain as their rivals and prospective adversaries in the Pacific. Even in victory, Britain emerged exhausted from World War I. Although the British had built more ships than it lost during the war, political commitment and resources flagged after 1919, when British defense expenditures as a whole were “cut to the bone.”56 Though it had not suffered losses comparable to the European powers, the United States came through wary about global responsibilities and ambivalent about sea power. A post-war fleet-expansion plan died on the floor of Congress. The United States did, however, send much of its fleet through the Panama Canal to form the Pacific Fleet in 1920. While influential Americans continued to favor sea power in the aftermath of World War I—President Wilson, an internationalist, called the navy “our natural bulwarks”—this sentiment was swamped by isolationism. Ironically, it was one of the original advocates of American globalism and sea power, Lodge, who engineered the Senate’s refusal to ratify U.S. membership in the League of Nations. The economic argument for internationalism and naval strength was erased by Depression and protectionism. U.S. foreign trade peaked in 1920, was flat until 1929, and then plummeted. With Theodore Roosevelt gone and Mahan’s books gathering dust, the U.S. pursuit of sea power went into reverse. Apart from interest in the aircraft carrier, contraction of the U.S. Navy in size and strength continued in the 1920s and accelerated with the onset of the Depression. Both the need and ability to pay for a powerful navy declined: By 1933, U.S. foreign trade was one-third what it was four years earlier.57 Hoping to preserve their advantages and avert renewed naval competition, Great Britain and the United States organized an arms control conference that concluded in 1923 with an agreement to restrict naval capabilities, with those of the United States at the same level as Britain’s and those of Japan at 60 percent: the so-called 5:5:3 formula. Ambivalent toward sea power, the United States was comfortable with these limits—though, mindful of aviation’s promise, it negotiated an exemption to permit two new aircraft carriers to be built. While Japan’s government agreed, its admirals never accepted the limits because of their belief that Japan needed a navy no less than 70 percent of the total size of the U.S. Navy if it were to prevail in a war in the Pacific. Japan renounced its obligations under the treaty in 1934, at the nadir in American sea power.58 Unscathed by World War I, Japan was poised to exploit the reduction of British and American sea power in the Pacific, owing to fatigue and isolationism, respectively. From 31 warships in 1898, the Imperial Navy grew to 230 by 1908. By the time its aggression was in full swing in the 1930s, Japan had the strongest navy in the Pacific in numbers and quality. In 1940, its surface fleet had grown to 375, all in the Pacific. Like the Americans, the Japanese were committed to aircraft carriers, adding 18 from 1940 to 1944.59 For Japan, sea power permitted conquest, which in turn demanded more sea power, which in turn enabled an economic system that provided the resources for naval expansion. While imperial and militaristic urges were factors in Japan’s quest for both sea power and conquest, economics was the main driver—or, more precisely, the readiness to use force to make and protect economic gains. Japanese foreign trade grew rapidly from 1891 to 1914 (from $110 million to $600 million), then exponentially after World War I. From 1931 to 1937, despite the Depression, Japanese total trade tripled. Japan was clear of the Depression by 1933 and sustained an average annual growth of 5 percent during the 1930s. Economic growth was mainly in manufacturing, especially heavy manufacturing. Japan required more ore, more fuel, and more markets, all of them overseas.",

The discussion focuses on American and Chinese perspectives on maritime interests, including trade, the operational and political functions of navies, and the concepts of sea control and sea denial. It highlights the importance of each country's actions and anticipated actions in shaping the other's sea power approach.  The text distinguishes between power upon the sea (naval power) and power of the sea (broader maritime influence), emphasizing that sea power encompasses capabilities from various domains, including underwater, air, space, and cyberspace.  It also distinguishes between sea control (assuring access) and sea denial (disrupting access), noting the U.S. focus on sea control and China's focus on sea denial as an asymmetric strategy. While acknowledging diverse factors influencing sea power strategies, the chapter emphasizes the critical role of each nation's response to the other's actions. It notes China's pursuit of anti-naval capabilities and its potential to challenge U.S. access in the Western Pacific, creating a dynamic of coupled sea-power development. The chapter concludes by highlighting Mahan's theory of sea power and the influence of technology in shaping modern maritime strategies.",

    "text": "In developing new capabilities, the U.S. Navy now treats China as its main “planning case,” as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has treated the United States since at least the mid-1990s. While the two have not become locked in a spiraling naval arms race like the Anglo-German one, the logic of competition is evident: a move by one triggers a counter-move by the other. This coupling is especially strong concerning China’s belief that U.S. naval strike forces in the region threaten its security and interests. China’s response has been to prioritize improving anti-naval and other A2AD—distinctly anti-U.S.—capabilities.  The U.S. response to this will surely produce another Chinese response. The new U.S. “Air-Sea Battle” strategy targets Chinese A2AD capabilities, and China is already investing in anti-satellite (ASAT) and cyber-war capabilities to disable the C4ISR on which Air-Sea Battle depends. The United States could then counter this with its own ASAT and cyber-war capabilities, perhaps with the threat of escalation. Every move in this game becomes more strategic and menacing. Our 20-year analysis horizon is roughly the time it took Great Britain and the United States, Great Britain and Germany, and the United States and Japan to settle their naval rivalries—peacefully in one case, violently in the other two. So now is an important moment to consider the dynamics and implications of American and Chinese maritime strategies.  At sea, being on a collision course doesn't make a collision inevitable, but turning a large ship takes time, requiring early awareness of potential trouble.",

Mahan’s theory of sea power rested on economics: prosperous nations must produce more than they need, import materials, and export products, mainly by sea; thus, they need sea power to assure access, protect trade routes, and, if necessary, sever rivals' and enemies' access and trade. The United States and China, the world’s two largest and most productive economies, face political and demographic pressures for growth, are major trading partners, and depend vitally on sea-borne trade.  Both have benefited from globalization, especially through the expansion of their bilateral trade. This trade has dramatically expanded U.S. imports of Chinese products, often with know-how from U.S. firms and financed by Chinese credit to the United States.  China’s ability to sustain rapid economic growth with moderate inflation and America’s ability to achieve moderate growth with low inflation and low interest rates depend on this trading and financing relationship. China’s dependence on trade is clear, given the need for rapid economic growth to maintain political stability, regime authority, and national cohesion.",

Total U.S. trade is roughly $3.7 trillion (25% of GDP), also growing at about twice the rate of GDP growth (6% to 3% per annum). Both countries depend predominantly on sea-borne trade (95% for China, 85% for the U.S.). Sea-borne trade accounts for about 45% of Chinese GDP and 20% of U.S. GDP. China depends more on secure sea-borne trade, though the U.S. has far greater naval capability.  Sino-U.S. trade has more than tripled in the past decade, to $500 billion, as has the U.S. trade deficit with China, reaching $300 billion in 2011.  U.S. exports to China are consistently less than one-third of Chinese exports to the United States. This deficit is largely financed by Chinese credit: China holds $1.3 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities. Both depend equivalently (in proportion to GDP) on trade with each other, but China’s dependence on U.S. trade has declined relatively. Chinese exports to the U.S. have grown significantly, playing a crucial role in China's manufacturing development, the locomotive of its growth. U.S. imports from China are the most important U.S. interest in this trade: American consumers, producers, and service providers rely on competitively priced Chinese goods.  Disrupting this trade would harm both economies: China would face higher unemployment, and the U.S. would see higher prices and interest rates.",

Still, a collapse of their economic relationship would severely impact both economies and the global economy. This may be the best guarantee against conflict.

However, three Chinese concerns militate against this: the need to back maritime claims and protect its trade, the perception of U.S. sea power as a threat to its trade, and the perception of U.S. sea power as a threat to China itself.  Despite shared interest in maritime security, China’s dependence on sea-borne trade may argue for sea-power rivalry, not cooperation, with the U.S. in the Western Pacific. This impulse would cause China to try to end U.S. sea control while expanding its own. This logic of confrontational sea power fits with China’s interest in reducing U.S. ability to threaten it or frustrate its regional ambitions. The same logic explains why the U.S. will not cede control of East Asian seas to China.  Economics are as likely to excite as to temper sea-power rivalry. U.S. interests in East Asia reflect the region’s economic strength, resource demands, and the influence of its strong states on world politics. East Asia’s economy has become the engine of world growth. Its demand for resources and its impact on the environment have global consequences. Asian powers have worldwide interests and roles.

    "text": "especially if it involves these powers, could endanger global security and prosperity. In addition to risks of East Asian instability, the region’s importance demands that the United States prevent it from becoming a Chinese “sphere of influence.” Because this consideration figures heavily in U.S. strategy and U.S. sea power, the term bears further definition. Like it or not, as East Asia’s largest country by far, as a budding world power, and with an outward-oriented economy, China is bound to have a huge role in East Asia. Not only is the United States unable to prevent this, its own stake in China’s success argues against trying—thus repeated American assurances that it will not try to contain China. A peaceful, stable, prosperous region that is under Chinese influence but entirely accessible to the United States might not be injurious to U.S. interests. In that case, the United States could learn to live with China leading in East Asia in most dimensions of power: conventional military, economic, diplomatic, demographic, and culture. Such conditions need not exclude the United States, weaken its economy, threaten its security, or preclude Sino-U.S. cooperation.\nA much more objectionable version of a Chinese East Asian sphere of influence would be one in which China could claim and exercise the prerogatives of power: bullying its neighbors; “resolving” disputes on its terms unilaterally; dictating foreign policies of other states (e.g., in regard to Taiwan); weakening bonds between the United States and its regional friends; harassing U.S. military forces or restricting their freedom of action; and erecting regional economic arrangements disadvantageous to the United States, e.g., closed trade zones—in a word, hegemony. In classical balance-of-power and sea-power theory, this is the behavior implied by sphere of influence. After all, it was how great powers played their great, “zero-sum” games. From time to time, even the United States exhibited some such conduct in its hemisphere. Yet, with economic integration, sturdy institutions, agreed norms, and belief in “positive-sum” outcomes, perhaps spheres of influence need not exclude and damage powers outside the sphere. By this reasoning, the United States could be more sanguine than it is about China’s growing prominence in East Asia.\nHowever, the combination of the region’s importance, uncertainty about China’s behavior as its power grows, and the potential for instability argues against American complacency. Chinese dominance of East Asia could come at the expense of critical U.S. interests, if not immediately then in time. The use of force by China to seize disputed territory would have dire consequences for international order and rule of law. That other East Asian states have also brandished force to stake out their maritime counterclaims underlines the region’s potential for instability in the event of U.S. disengagement or exclusion. In any case, the United States cannot ignore that Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and other U.S. friends—important states in their own right—clearly see the waxing of Chinese power and waning of American power and influence as harmful. That the United States has formal defense alliances with several of these only bolsters the need for balancing Chinese power and, if need be, countering its use.",

    "text": "For all these reasons, the United States should and likely will oppose a Chinese sphere of influence in East Asia, at least until it becomes clear from China’s behavior that there is no need to worry. Put simply, the United States will need to treat East Asia as a great power would unless China does not. Refusal to allow another power to dominate this region, in this sense, has been a constant of America’s foreign policy since it became a great power, sea power, and Pacific power a century ago. From the 1930s on, U.S. strategy has been to block hegemonic control of East Asia, even at the cost of war. Conforming to classical balance-of-power theory, it has put its weight on the weaker side: China (versus Japan) during World War II; Japan (versus the Soviet Union) at the outset of the Cold War; China again (versus the Soviet Union) after 1972. U.S. security interests and responsibilities in the region did not decline with the end of the Cold War; if anything, they have increased because of the region’s growing importance.\nThe United States has persistent and potentially rising security concerns in Northeast Asia, where the defense of South Korea and Japan are binding obligations, where nuclear confrontation is possible, and where the fate of North Korea is unclear. Further south, the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan dispute is important to the United States because it is predisposed to intervene militarily if Taiwan is attacked and also because it would have grave strategic and political consequences if democratic Taiwan were to be swallowed by China. In Southeast Asia, U.S. interest declined after the Vietnam War but is on the rise now because of the growing importance of this area’s waters and states, most of which now seek U.S. security ties. Throughout the region, long-standing U.S. defense relationships are being re-invigorated and reshaped by regional concerns about the implications of unchecked Chinese power. The purposes of the U.S. alliance with Japan have gradually expanded beyond the protection of Japan to the protection of joint interests and peace in the region. There is talk of the U.S. Navy returning to Subic Bay, its former base in the Philippines (though not likely on its former scale). The United States also is developing defense cooperation with Vietnam and India, also motivated by mutual concern about the rise of China. While the United States disavows the intention to encircle or align East Asia against China, what the Chinese see is a region in which its allies are few—two, if one counts Burma—poor, isolated, and unreliable, whereas U.S. allies are prospering and growing in number.",

Yet, ignoring the risk of Chinese destabilization in East Asia, in hopes of facilitating cooperation, could invite further Chinese pressure. Managing the tension between countering and engaging China is the defining challenge.  The U.S. response to China’s growing power has been de facto military containment, despite declaratory policy stressing cooperation.  Countering China has become the principal rationale for the forward American military presence in the Western Pacific. However, the United States has no modern experience with a rising power quite like China. Unlike past rivals, China's economic integration makes it impossible to contain economically.  U.S. and Asian allies depend on Chinese trade, investment, and financing.  China’s lack of expansionist design makes political containment difficult, as most regional states prefer constructive relations.  East Asia lacks a multinational alliance like NATO to counter China, though China’s recent behavior has prompted some neighbors to appeal to the U.S. for security.  While the U.S. has capable military allies like Japan and South Korea, they have historically focused on self-defense, leaving the U.S. responsible for regional stability.  The U.S. is improving its defense posture: updating alliances, deepening cooperation with India and Vietnam, and concentrating forces on Guam.  The U.S. has declared a geo-strategic “pivot” from the Middle East to East Asia, which China interprets as directed against its interests. U.S. efforts to shore up allied confidence could both dissuade Chinese aggression and persuade China that the U.S. seeks to contain it.  China faces a similar dilemma: avoiding conflict with the U.S. while asserting its status. Upgrading U.S. force posture could restrain Chinese military power but also harden China’s resolve to improve its own military.  China prioritizes neutralizing U.S. power in the Western Pacific, and U.S. operational effectiveness could be reduced by Chinese A2AD capabilities.  The prospect of a land war with China also appears increasingly forbidding.  Consequently, forward defense in the Western Pacific may not be sustainable, forcing the U.S. to choose between reducing its presence or accepting greater risk.",

    "text": "Facing unfavorable military trends, the United States might rely on deterrence, but this is also risky. The credibility of escalation threats can be undermined if the adversary believes escalation would also impose unacceptable costs on the threatening side.  Escalation with China is increasingly risky due to its growing capabilities in cyber-war, ASAT war, economic war, and nuclear war. Horizontal escalation—expanding the geographic scope of a conflict—is another option, such as cutting off China’s oil supply. However, this could damage global economies and set bad precedents.  Horizontal escalation would only be considered in cases of significant Chinese aggression, which are remote contingencies.  The U.S. should be judicious in warning of horizontal escalation, as it could confirm Chinese suspicions about American sea power.  While not ruling out escalation options, the U.S. should not count on them.  Deterrence should disabuse China of the assumption that war with the U.S. would be easy, but escalation threats could fuel Chinese paranoia and further military buildup. U.S. strategy faces multiple quandaries: restraining Chinese military power without stimulating its growth; reassuring allies despite increasing risks; and strengthening deterrence without relying on undesirable escalation threats.  Another quandary is countering China regionally while seeking its partnership globally. China has interests in addressing global challenges like nuclear proliferation and climate change, but it has also shown a tendency toward “free-ridership.”  China’s cooperation in global security is crucial, given its influence and UN Security Council seat. U.S. strategy must provide for both regional security and global collaboration by combining deterrence and engagement. This is more complex than the anti-Soviet strategy, as the U.S. increasingly depends on the cooperation of a potential regional threat. The feasibility of this strategy remains unclear, as both governments may be driven toward a simpler adversarial or cooperative relationship. If the strategy works, the U.S. could shift toward cooperation. If not, it should shift toward deterrence.",

Improving local defense capabilities of allies is crucial, not encircling China, but bolstering regional defenses to deter Chinese aggression.  Maintaining technological superiority is vital, shifting to less detectable strike platforms. This posture enhances deterrence and crisis management by enabling easier deployment of U.S. forces.  Cooperation with China is essential despite potential for miscalculation. Open communication and military-to-military contact are vital, avoiding provocative actions while maintaining allied confidence and deterring China.  In East Asia, sea power is critical for economic access, stability, and influence. It ensures freedom of passage, prevents Chinese maritime control, supports regional allies, and enables strike and expeditionary operations. As forward bases become vulnerable, sea power's mobility is paramount. Its weakening would signal a Chinese sphere of influence. Currently, U.S. sea power's core missions are strike and political influence, primarily through aircraft carriers, which have become China's prime target. The U.S. must rethink its naval strategy, questioning the wisdom of concentrating offensive forces, especially as the current form of sea power may become obsolete within a decade. The U.S. Navy has shrunk due to rising costs and prioritization of ground forces. While the U.S. enjoys global naval supremacy, the vulnerability of concentrated sea power in the Western Pacific poses a significant problem.  However, history demonstrates that evolving sea power adapts through new technologies.  Rethinking the meaning of American sea power is necessary. Assured maritime freedom doesn't necessitate denying China access to vital sea lanes.  Such denial could provoke intense naval competition, escalating tensions and risks. Mahan's formula of concentrating offensive forces may not be applicable in the current context, potentially imposing prohibitive costs.",

China's rising middle class, content with the status quo, further supports this model.  China's development mirrors other East Asian states: leveraging low-cost labor, improving productivity, strategic exports, currency manipulation, accumulating foreign exchange, controlled foreign investment, and state involvement in key industries.  However, China's vast rural population has allowed unprecedented expansion of low-wage manufacturing, and unlike other East Asian states, economic development hasn't led to political reform.",

Maintaining a growth rate of 6-8% is considered crucial for domestic stability and meeting rising expectations. Consequently, securing seaborne trade routes is a significant political and economic interest for the regime and its increasingly powerful business community.  This economic imperative has driven a fundamental shift in China's foreign policy, prioritizing international trade and cooperation over revolutionary ideology.  China's growth depends on access to technology from the U.S., Japan, and the West. This interdependence, combined with American consumer demand for Chinese goods, has fostered mutually beneficial economic cooperation. Both countries benefit from global economic integration and depend on international stability, multilateral institutions, and established rules.  However, shared economic interests don't preclude rivalry, as historical examples demonstrate. As China's economic success allows it to pursue other national interests like defense, sovereignty, and influence, the potential for friction with its neighbors and the United States increases.",

    "text": "At the same time, like the United States’, China’s interest and involvement in global cooperation may curb its regional antagonism. Yet, as noted earlier, there is some possibility of Sino-American confrontation in all of East Asia’s potential trouble hot spots: Korea, Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and China’s land dispute with Vietnam. Arching over these particular dangers is China’s intent to reduce the U.S. threat to itself and to the pursuit of its regional interests. Moreover, whether or not it means to achieve some sort of regional hegemony, China’s interest in access to the world’s resources, its markets, and thus its oceans, place it at odds with the U.S. presence off its shores. Because the Chinese regard U.S. military and naval capabilities in the region as a potential danger to their interests, they feel the need to challenge the dominant sea power in the Western Pacific, and they are working energetically to meet that need with their anti-naval capabilities.\n\nChinese Strategy\nThe tensions that define U.S. strategy toward China likewise define Chinese strategy toward the United States in particular and the outside world in general:\n* To gain economic access and earn influence within the existing order and/or to use its mounting power unilaterally.\n* To keep the external environment calm or to press Chinese rights and claims.\n* To befriend neighbors or to encourage deference to Chinese might, at the risk of isolation.\n* To pursue good relations with the United States or to undermine U.S. power and influence where it could harm Chinese interests.\n* To avoid a costly arms race or to seek operational-military advantages to deter or defeat threats to China and its interests.\n* To rely on the United States and on cooperation with it to keep trade routes secure or to build and deploy capabilities to do so independently.\n\nLike the United States, the Chinese will try to have it both ways on these choices. As noted, the impulses, constraints, and choices of Chinese strategy will differ from East Asia to the world at large. Cooperation is more appealing globally; competition more compelling regionally. The farther from China, the less capability and latitude for risk-taking the Chinese have. When the security of China and its sovereign interests, e.g., reunification and territorial rights, is at stake, the Chinese are less willing to leave outcomes to others. When they are constrained to negotiate and seek agreed solutions bearing on those sovereign interests, the Chinese will exploit the shadow of their growing military power if not the threat of force. As Chinese interests and defensive concerns become less acute at greater distance—in the Middle East and Africa, for example—the shadow vanishes and cooperation is more likely. In the Western Indian Ocean, for example, the Chinese navy works with those of the Americans, Japanese, South Koreans, and others to protect international shipping from Somali pirates. Yet in the Western Pacific, Chinese ships harass some of those same navies.",

    "text": "Is the contrast between Chinese regional and global behavior the result of a contrast between its near and far military capabilities or instead a matter of strategy reflecting a difference in importance between its near and far interests? The answer is probably both: China is more advanced in developing and deploying regional military capabilities than global ones because the former are easier, cheaper, quicker, and in some ways a logical step toward the latter. But regional military capabilities are also a much higher priority, driven largely by considerations of the defense of China itself. Generally, as states extend their definitions of security from their territory to their interests abroad, their military capabilities are also extended, unless of course they lack the resources or are content to count on the strength, or good behavior, of others. Though amply resourced, it is not clear that the Chinese want to invest heavily in the ability to station or project forces around the world if they can count on others, mainly the United States, to look after Chinese interests. The role of military forces generally in China’s strategy bears examination. Having treated defense spending as a low priority when the country was struggling to escape mass poverty and build national infrastructure, the Chinese have in the past decade made military capabilities a high priority. Past growth in spending on defense has matched GDP growth at roughly 10 percent. But in the past few years, Chinese defense spending has grown faster than GDP—as high as 18 percent per annum. As a result, China now spends as much on defense as the rest of East Asia combined (excluding North Korea). China’s estimated 2011 defense spending was $130 billion; the next six totaled $128 billion. Assuming present growth rates and that Japan stays near its traditional 1 percent of GDP for defense, Chinese military spending will be twice that of the region in as little as five years. Chinese defense spending today is dwarfed by that of the United States. However, if current trends continue, this gap will shrink in both absolute and relative terms. Of significance is that the preponderance of Chinese military investments and activities will be concentrated in East Asia, whereas the United States must meet global demands. During the post-9/11 decade, at least 40 percent of U.S. defense spending could be attributed to meeting the needs of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), compared with roughly 20 percent for the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), the second-biggest claimant. Even if and as the United States shifts its defense priorities to East Asia, it is most unlikely that it will be able to match China’s future spending directed toward the region.",

    "text": "damage. This strategy explains the priority the PLA places on A2AD capabilities. In its sights are the most likely instruments of U.S. intervention: large aircraft carriers. To target the carriers, the Chinese are developing extended-range and space-based sensors, space-based guidance systems, anti-ship ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, attack submarines, and digital communications networks to tie everything together. Chinese doctrine calls for swift, intense, coordinated attacks to impede and degrade U.S. forces. While not seeking armed conflict with the United States, obviously, Chinese military strategy depends on attacking U.S. strike forces early, first, or even preemptively if conflict appears probable. Even with such capabilities and doctrine, the PLA cannot expect to prevent successful U.S. military intervention unless (a) U.S. political leaders decide that the costs and risks outweigh the value of intervention; (b) hostilities remain confined in scope and end before the United States can bring its global strike power to bear; or (c) the command, control, and communications systems on which U.S. forces vitally depend are crippled. Because the Chinese cannot be confident of the first or second factor, both being mainly under U.S. control, they have begun to concentrate on the third. The PLA’s interest in both cyber-warfare and anti-satellite warfare is driven by the belief that its best and perhaps only chance of prevailing against U.S. forces is to attack U.S. space-based and other command, control, and communications networks, which are relatively vulnerable. (We will return to military-technological competition and its effect on possible Sino-U.S. conflict in the next chapter.)\n\nJust as U.S. military strategy serves both operational and political needs, so does China’s. The more capable the PLA is of conducting successful operations against its regional and U.S. forces, the longer and darker will be the shadow cast on relationships and actions short of war by all actors in the region. At the same time, the Chinese may feel pressure to “pull their punches”—at least in the use of force even in the forces they deploy—for fear of adverse political reactions. Again, if recent years are a guide to the future, the expansion and use of Chinese military capabilities has been attended not by greater regional deference but by the opposite: greater interest by U.S. allies and potential partners in a strong U.S. posture. There are sure to be some influential Chinese concerned that unreserved support for the PLA to satisfy its operational requirements would hurt, not help, China’s political ambitions in the region.",

    "text": "Aside from its military aspects, Chinese strategy is more or less a mirror image of U.S. strategy: preparing for confrontation in East Asia in hopes of avoiding it, while cooperating where interests converge globally. Like the United States, China would suffer grievous economic damage in the event of regional conflict; and like the Americans, the Chinese no doubt think that this consideration will dictate caution on the part of its potential adversary. China’s integration into the world economy is thus crucial not only for development but also in giving the United States a strong disincentive to use force against China, especially if it has no vital interests involved. In addition, China will partner with the United States on global challenges—nuclear non-proliferation, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, energy security—when it serves Chinese security interests and as long as the costs are not too high. It will also seek a greater voice and accept more responsibility in international institutions. Given its regional interests, China will need to balance cooperative global policies with assertive regional ones, just like the United States will. Taking a belligerent posture in East Asia could ruin prospects for global cooperation; yet taking a humble posture in East Asia in order to expand global cooperation would leave the United States in a position to threaten, intervene, and align the region against China.\n\nWhile it would be a mistake to interpret Chinese strategy and predict Chinese behavior as a product of “hawks and doves” vying for or slicing up control, there is a pattern worth noting. Whereas the PLA is preoccupied with the security of China and preparations for conflict, the state’s civilian leaders and institutions (e.g., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) are also interested in improving China’s standing in the world and relations with countries that can help it achieve its goals. With respect to the United States, the PLA has responsibility to plan for military contingencies, which are all in China’s vicinity; the civilians are expected to maintain a stable international environment and to manage the complex mix of cooperative and competitive Sino-U.S. relations. On top of this, China’s new business elites have a strong interest and some influence in creating favorable conditions for Chinese trade, investment, and acquisition of technology, in which the United States figures significantly. Finally, China’s expanding numbers of informed citizens are showing increased pride, patriotism, and nationalism about China’s success, its role in the world, and its relations with the United States. Ironically, the middle-class Chinese who have so much to gain from economic cooperation favor a hard line when China is disrespected by the Americans (or Japanese). Reflecting the perspectives of its hawkish officers, cautious statesmen, internationalist businessmen, and nationalistic bourgeoisie, as well as tensions among its global and regional interests, China’s strategy contains a mix of moderation and belligerence, making it all the more perplexing for the United States, just as U.S. strategy is obviously perplexing for the Chinese (and many Americans). Notwithstanding one-party rule, finding a genuine and stable synthesis among these competing interests and perspectives will be as difficult for China as it is for the United States. In quoting Deng Xiaoping’s famous aphorism, high Chinese officials have modified the original: China should “uphold keeping a low profile and actively achieve something” (modifications in italics).31 This implies that China can be more assertive abroad, as its power now permits, and still preserve a tranquil environment, as its development still demands. Because of the internal tensions and lack of consensus in China’s strategy, its conduct will be largely in reaction to challenges and opportunities presented by the United States. Steady pursuit by the United States of Sino-U.S. global economic and security partnership could embolden those in China who favor a moderate and multilateral approach to the region. But by the same token, it would be a mistake for the United States to bank on Chinese politicians, much less generals and admirals, to embrace cooperation outside their region with a power seen as threatening to China and its interests in their region. Yet, for the United States to relinquish its role in East Asian security in the belief that Chinese strategy will become more cooperative might have the opposite effect. We will return to the question of the interaction of Chinese and U.S. strategy in the Western Pacific after analyzing what sea power means to the Chinese.",

    "text": "investment suggest that China intends not to leave the security of its trade routes, including oil tanker lanes, to others—namely, the U.S. Navy.39 While the Chinese have not committed to global sea power, their needs and aspirations extend to “far seas,” including the entire Pacific and the Indian Ocean.40 The debate in China about sea power reveals sophisticated under- standing of the issues and challenges involved and, on the whole, is more reassuring than alarming: The hegemonic pattern of 19th- and 20th-century sea powers, per Mahan, is not widely embraced; law- based freedom and rights are stressed; and peaceful use and exploita- tion of the seas is preferred. Moreover, the Chinese appear to be real- istic about both sea control and sea denial. While they seek secure access for trade and resource exploitation, they cannot ignore U.S. sea power, and thus they entertain rules, co-existence, and cooperation. Insofar as they mean to deny others such access, it is to defend China against attack from the sea and to extend security over waters they claim as Chinese. In effect, this outlook fits the regional-global pattern of Chinese interests and strategy identified above: reliance on national strength and, if need be, force, in waters adjacent to China, and will- ingness to cooperate with the established power beyond those waters. Even though the Chinese generally buy the economic reasoning that underpinned Mahan’s argument for sea power, Chinese thinking about sea power itself is not really Mahanian. He argued that becom- ing a global power required becoming a global sea power, that commit- ment to sea power must occupy the entire state and the consciousness of the nation, and that the core capability of a navy is offensive force. Mahan was also clear that a sea power must be able to deny other states, including competing sea powers, secure trade lanes and naval links. To him, sea power was not an extension of territorial defense, regional hegemony, or cooperation: rather, it was about rivalry and conflict on and for the world’s oceans.",

    "text": "Of course, the United States itself was far from a sea power when Mahan wrote The Influence of Sea Power upon History. Yet, within 20 years it was strong enough to destroy a Spanish fleet in Manila harbor, convince Great Britain to redirect its sea power elsewhere, and impress the world while circumnavigating it. Production-based economic growth, industrialization, and achievement of continental control enabled the United States to become a sea power; its grow- ing trade, commitment to hemispheric dominance, and determina- tion to be a global power impelled it to do so. China in the early 21st century is similar in some ways: rapidly growing and industrializing; consolidating continental control; heavily dependent on sea trade (much more dependent, in fact, than the United States was in 1890); opposed to foreign naval dominance in its region; and aspiring to be a global power. Yet, even if China evolves in concept and capabili- ties toward Mahanian sea power, it cannot expect to mount a chal- lenge to American superiority beyond the Western Pacific. The prob- lem for the United States is not Chinese global sea control, which is beyond China’s grasp, but instead Chinese regional sea denial, which is within its grasp. In the region, Chinese military and political leaders are discover- ing how useful naval forces are—more so than ground forces—both in protecting the country from the offshore U.S. threats and in press- ing Chinese claims in the South China and East China Seas. Includ- ing anti-naval capabilities, regional sea power is China’s top military priority. Challenging American sea power in the Western Pacific does not require China to develop a large blue-water fleet. As its anti-naval capabilities are increased and improved, making use of advanced infor- mation technologies, it is acquiring the means to neutralize U.S. strike power in the region. In time, it could even deny U.S. naval and trade access in a region of great importance to the American economy and, in effect, claim a sphere of influence, similar to what the United States did once it became a hemispheric sea power. Beyond regional waters, Chinese sea power is but a gleam in the eye: contributing modestly to protection of shipping against Somali pirates, incapable of challenging the United States on the high seas, and effectively relying on the United States to secure trade routes vital for energy supplies and access to world resources and markets. As already noted, the farther from China the Chinese must address security chal- lenges, the more inclined they are to do so cooperatively. As noted, one can see a pattern of Sino-American maritime collaboration in distant regions (e.g., Gulf of Aden) at the same time China threatens U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific.",

    "text": "Based on historical cases of rising powers—the United States, Germany, and Japan—it will be at least two decades before China can apply the skills, doctrine, technology, and logistics to become a global sea power, assuming it decides to do so. However, the crux of the problem for the United States is that China does not need global sea power—i.e., a high-seas fleet—to wield sea power in the Western Pacific with its anti-naval capabilities. China is practicing a form of sea power whereby control, or at least denial, of the seas does not neces- sitate power upon the seas. While Mahan did not imagine them, he would be the first to recognize Chinese anti-ship missiles as a feature of sea power no less than the battleships he knew. The challenge to Amer- ican sea power, and thus American interests, in the Western Pacific is not decades away but looming now. Indeed, China is growing its sea power at a faster pace than the United States is adapting its sea power. Conclusion: The Interaction of U.S. and Chinese Sea Power If China means to establish sea denial in East Asian waters, even while enjoying the benefits of U.S. sea power beyond the region, it will be opposed. The United States will not and cannot allow China to deny access to East Asian waters, nor accept a Chinese sphere of influence detrimental to U.S. interests that such sea denial would imply. Yet the Chinese will not—for in their way of thinking they cannot—allow the U.S. Navy to control the Western Pacific without risk or rival. Thus, the analog of Anglo-American accommodation described in the previous chapter breaks down, and that of Anglo-German confronta- tion seems more applicable. While the United States has not explicitly threatened to sever China’s vital trade routes, as it did Japan’s in the run-up to Pearl Harbor, opportunities exist for Sino-U.S. sea-power rivalry to become heated and even violent. The United States has the clear ability, possible motivation, and regional encouragement to foil Chinese attempts to use sea power against its neighbors in the South China and East China Seas. It could, if need be, again flaunt its strike power in the event of another Chinese attempt to intimidate Taiwan. Moreover, U.S. planners and pundits could contemplate a blockade of China, e.g., intercepting Chinese shipping in the Malaccan Strait, as a way of bolstering deterrence of Chinese aggression. For these reasons, it seems highly likely that the Chinese will attempt to neutralize, though not necessarily copy, U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. Elsewhere, the Chinese will be receptive to coop- erative maritime security—their way of reconciling the need for mari- time security with the infeasibility of meeting that need unilaterally. They may be satisfied, even pleased, that the United States will con- tinue to secure oil-transport and other shipping routes in the Middle East, across the Indian Ocean, and even through Southeast Asian nar- rows; for that relieves China of a burden and allows it to concentrate its resources and sea power on challenging its American benefactor-rival in the Western Pacific. What the United States can and should do, technologically and politically, about the strategic bind it is in is taken up in the next two chapters.",

    "text": "\"Communications dominate war . . . they are the most important single element in strategy, political or military.” —A. T. Mahan1 The Networking and Targeting Revolutions Mahan thought and wrote at a time when naval capabilities were lim- ited and operational concepts were defined by the distances of gunnery and visual communications. While he clearly understood the implica- tions of industrialization—from sail to steam and wood to steel—he can be pardoned for believing that the offensive power of the concen- trated battle fleet, with the line of dreadnoughts as its spine, was the key to naval victory and world sea power. He died (in December 1914) before the dreadnought proved to be something of a flop—hardly engaged by either side at Jutland (1916).2 Ironically, the great conflict that Mahan’s ideas are blamed for helping to cause began the obsoles- cence of the very capability that was at the core of those ideas. Whether the ideas themselves transcend technological changes that Mahan and his contemporaries did not contemplate is an important question bear- ing of the future of sea power and American interests in the Western Pacific. The technologies for air and undersea warfare that redefined sea power after World War I both were at first resisted by the U.S. Navy. The submarine was described by a young Chester Nimitz as a “Jules Verne fantasy” (though Nimitz deserves much of the credit for subse- quently developing submarine technology and forces).3 Although the French and Germans were early leaders in building and using subma- rines, the Americans—with the Japanese close behind—pioneered the aircraft carrier as the new core of the fleet. By the Battle of Midway, carrier superiority—still concentrated, but at tactical-aircraft range— prevailed, and since then the carrier has been the emblem of sea power. In parallel, electromagnetic-wave technology—radio and radar— extended the ranges of coordinated action and attack. Nuclear power has extended greatly the cruising endurance—not to mention the destructive power—of carriers and submarines. Just as 19th-century technologies produced and 20th-century technologies soon superseded the sea power observed by Mahan, the information technology is revolutionizing at least the content and per- haps also the concepts of sea power at the beginning of the 21st cen- tury. Although the U.S. Navy has pioneered and now stands supreme in exploiting this latest revolution in its capabilities and operating con- cepts, the effect of these technologies on sea power has only begun. Nowhere is change more evident than in the Western Pacific. And nowhere, because of the interests and capabilities of the established power and the rising power, will change be more consequential. The information revolution has taken two branches in military affairs in general and naval affairs in particular. Although related in their core technologies, their implications are different enough—in tension, even—that they can be, and here will be, thought of as dual revolutions. The duel of these dual revolutions will affect the course and consequences of sea-power competition for years and probably decades to come. Whether and how the United States will be able to maintain sea power in the Western Pacific despite China’s challenge to it depend largely on U.S. technological strategy. Thanks to digital communications and satellites, computer net- working permits forces to be integrated yet also distributed geographi- cally, making them both more effective and less vulnerable. Greater effectiveness comes because any node in the network—any unit, sensor, platform, weapon, or person—located virtually anywhere will be able to work in conjunction with any and every other node.4 Vulnerability is reduced as enemy forces face greater complexity and expanse in tar- geting distributed forces. The longer the communications and weapon ranges, the more distributed yet still integrated the whole force can be: Barriers to global communications are being demolished by the creation of information infrastructure, largely for commercial use, and information technology allows weapon ranges to be extended without sacrificing accuracy. In the naval domain, Mahan’s insistence on the need to concentrate the fleet to achieve concentrated offensive force has been overtaken by ranges that are theoretically global. Beyond the advantages of being able to connect forces over distance, network- ing allows those of all services and in all domains—naval, land, air, space, and cyber—to share data and operate jointly, multiplying their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the information revolution has led to improvements in finding and tracking targets (sensing, for short), in integrating data from diverse sensors (fusing), and in feeding the result to any weapon system (sensor-to-shooter). Also, by guiding weapons from “off-board” navigation systems (e.g., GPS), information technology has reduced the cost of accurate weapons; as a result, a strike force can better afford ample weapons to achieve its missions.5 When networked with advanced command and control systems, in which human deci- sionmaking is enhanced by data-crunching and imaging, the result is improved targeting. Technology is making the concentration of naval forces less important than ever even as it is making it more hazardous than ever.",

Advanced targeting aims to weaken or destroy opposing forces, competing with the networking of those forces, which enhances survivability. A force superior in both networking and targeting gains a decisive operational edge, assuming its computer networks are not disrupted by cyber-attacks. Currently, U.S. forces hold this dual advantage, particularly for high-intensity warfare anticipated with Chinese forces in the Western Pacific. Both U.S. and Chinese military strategies are focused on enhancing their forces' survivability and effectiveness through advanced networking while making opposing forces more vulnerable through advanced targeting.

Sensors provide high resolution, wide coverage, and immediacy. Networked sensor data is fused, analyzed, and shared for targeting, enabling unmatched speed, reach, and lethality for U.S. strike forces. This results in operational superiority across all service domains. However, effectively leveraging these capabilities in actual operations is challenging, requiring highly trained personnel, agile command and control, fluid tactics, and seamless inter-service coordination.  The U.S. Navy has been actively exploiting the dual revolutions. Navies have traditionally relied on networking for various functions like blockade, sea-lane protection, and modern warfare aspects like AAW, BMD, and ASW. Digital technology and satellites have exponentially increased naval communication range, volume, and speed, enabling a truly networked and effective force. Greater accuracy at lower cost enhances weapon payoff, multiplying the strike potential of platforms. The current U.S. Navy superiority stems from individual platform strike potential, weapon lethality, sensor power, and their integration, rather than just fleet size. The challenge in the Western Pacific is not China replicating the U.S. Navy but exploiting technologies to weaken U.S. sea control. Despite advantages, the U.S. Navy faces the dilemma of reinforcing existing fleet qualities versus developing a different one, often clinging to the familiar amidst change pressures.",

China's growing market share and competitiveness in high-tech industries support PLA advancement. The Chinese are progressing in various aspects of networking and targeting revolutions, including data processing, digital communications, sensors, sensor fusion, weapon advancements, space systems, jamming technologies, C4ISR networks, and cyber-warfare.

Initially, sensors had tactical range, communications relied on fiber-optic cables, and services operated separately.

    "text": "maneuvering warheads. While it remains to be seen how far into the Pacific the Chinese intend to extend this kill-chain, their immediate goal is to exceed the range of carrier-based strike aircraft, which would also bring forward U.S. air bases in the region into Chinese range. Already, Chinese medium-range ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles can reach aircraft carriers (and land bases) within 2,000 km of China. The addition of new long-range theater strike systems—a new 4,000 km–range conventional ballistic missile, improved medium-range bombers with long-range cruise missiles, and a growing fleet of quiet attack submarines—will significantly increase the PLA’s lethal radius.\n\nThe PLA’s concentration of information technology for anti-naval missions is being complemented by four other priorities: ballistic and cruise missile programs, a modern submarine fleet, cyber-war capabilities to degrade U.S. C4ISR networks, and ASAT to destroy satellites. Viewed together, the thrust of China’s military investment and war-fighting strategy is clearly to raise U.S. costs of intervening against China in the event that a regional dispute turns violent. While the original focus was on a Taiwan contingency, the Chinese have generalized their objective.\n\nIt is one thing for the PLA to erect a kill-chain and quite another to get it to work as intended. Technical and operating skills are essential ingredients, not easily or quickly acquired. PLA enthusiasm over cyber-war and ASAT can be explained in large part by the belief that degrading U.S. C4ISR could compensate for the uncertainties the Chinese face in targeting U.S. strike forces. Even then, the Chinese would have to be confident that two-way cyber and ASAT warfare would be more deleterious to U.S. operations than to their own, given that the United States presumably would respond in kind. In sum, the Chinese are riding the targeting revolution to disable U.S. strike platforms, U.S. C4ISR, and U.S. satellites. These three U.S. capabilities are at once crucial to U.S. operations and difficult to defend. As Chinese naval and other forces operate throughout the region, the need to distribute and integrate them through networking will also grow.\n\nA general pattern in the military-information revolution is that investment and reform tend to focus on strong operational demands. For the United States, at present, the priority is to make its forces less vulnerable. For China, it is to make U.S. forces more vulnerable. Whether in networking or targeting, the Chinese and Americans are both searching for the right approach to command and control: centralized or decentralized. Traditionally, the PLA has stressed centralized-vertical control even more than the U.S. military has. The instantaneous sharing of information can give commanders at the center a more complete view than they have ever had, but this can invite excessive meddling and contradict the potency of horizontal collaboration that networking offers. An alternative school argues that networking permits and targeting requires decentralized command and control. If the Chinese have not resolved this contest, they at least understand it. Junior officers tend to better appreciate the pitfalls of centralization than do seniors. So the Chinese are likely to gravitate toward decentralization, which will enable them to effectively use new technology to target U.S. forces.",

    "text": "While hard to network because of limits on communications, submarines can exploit China’s improvements in targeting U.S. surface-strike forces at increasing distances. The PLAN is replacing older submarines with a smaller, more survivable fleet capable of operating far from China. Although China will likely put more of its nuclear deterrent on submarines and improve anti-submarine capabilities, its main submarine mission is anti-carrier warfare.  These submarines will be equipped with anti-surface missiles, compounding the U.S. vulnerability challenge. This force complements China’s commitment to long-range surveillance, sensor fusing, improved tracking, precision navigation and guidance, and integrated C4ISR.\n\nChina is also building a modern surface fleet, but its role in the Western Pacific is less clear.  China cannot achieve true sea control in the region given U.S. strike capabilities, nor does it require such a fleet for sea denial, as submarines and land-based missiles are more effective and less vulnerable. It would take decades for the Chinese Navy to rival the U.S. Navy. The Chinese appear to have other purposes for their surface navy: complementing A2/AD capabilities, enforcing territorial claims in the South and East China Seas, providing security for its sea-lifelines, and showing the flag.\n\nChina’s aircraft carriers have received much attention. However, it would take decades to build a substantial carrier battle group force, and they are a poor option for attacking U.S. carriers.  The Chinese aim to have at most three carriers, likely for influencing maritime disputes, contributing to maritime security, and projecting power.  Overall, China has not shown the same commitment to aircraft carriers as it has to anti-access capabilities. While China has new anti-air and anti-surface ships, it has built only a few per class.  It will also have a large force of smaller, advanced fast-attack craft armed with missiles, potentially presenting a serious sea-denial threat.  Improving amphibious ships has also been a priority. It could take decades for China to build a navy resembling the U.S. Navy, but China’s ambivalence about a traditional high-seas fleet should not gratify the United States. What matters more is how well and how soon Chinese forces can carry out their assigned missions: anti-access, sea-denial, and bullying China’s maritime neighbors.  For these purposes, China is progressing rapidly, using targeting technology where the current U.S. lead will be hard to maintain.\n\nEven with new missiles, submarines, and surface vessels, it is China’s development of a robust C4ISR network that represents a serious challenge to American sea power. China is following the U.S. lead in using advanced C4ISR.  Its 2010 Defense White Paper highlights progress in building these systems, achieving a preliminary level of interoperability among command and control systems, combat forces, and support systems.  The United States should not assume insurmountable advantages in applying information technology. Technology gaps exist but are shrinking. Gaps in personnel quality exist, but the Chinese are prioritizing this. The U.S. military has a head start in joint C4ISR systems, but the Chinese know what needs to be done. While the U.S. began its military “transformation” earlier, its attention and resources were diverted to counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.  Meanwhile, China’s focus has remained on neutralizing U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific.  The United States is currently dependent on concentrated strike power in aircraft carriers, whereas China is stressing capabilities that exploit networking and targeting.",

With decreased likelihood of successful U.S. intervention, China's chances of prevailing in regional conflicts improve, strengthening its coercive power.  If the U.S. withdraws forces from the PLA's expanding range, those forces gain survivability but lose regional influence. Maintaining a forward presence in peacetime but retreating during heightened threats undermines U.S. leverage. Whether U.S. naval forces withdraw or remain vulnerable, China's neighbors, including U.S. allies, face increased exposure and pressure, potentially leading to Chinese sea denial and a hegemonic sphere of influence in the Western Pacific. This could disrupt regional order and peace, outcomes that U.S. sea power aims to prevent. Even without hegemonic ambitions, China's interests compel it to challenge U.S. carrier presence within strike range.  China's territorial defense necessitates pushing U.S. carriers beyond its reach, and it seeks dominance in regional disputes concerning Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Korea, aiming to displace the U.S. as the primary security provider. The U.S. faces a growing challenge to its sea power as China strengthens, with the inherent difficulty of maintaining distant access compounded by China's capabilities.

    "text": "American strategists should not rely on presumed technological superiority to prevail in the sea-power contest with China, given China's increasing competitiveness and the global spread of technologies. A new U.S. advantage must stem from superior application of information technology. Geographic and technological asymmetries favor China: the U.S. projects power over 10,000 miles, while China defends its own region. China’s targeting capabilities improve incrementally, whereas the U.S. requires a fundamental shift due to its platforms' vulnerability.  The U.S. Navy, in collaboration with the Air Force, developed the Air-Sea Battle strategy to counter the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) challenge posed primarily by China in the Western Pacific. This integrated approach, similar to the 1980s Air-Land Battle strategy against the Soviet threat, leverages network and targeting revolutions for deep attacks using both kinetic and cyber weapons.  Air-Sea Battle presents operational challenges for China, but its effectiveness in addressing U.S. sea power vulnerability remains uncertain.  Its reliance on vulnerable forward-deployed assets like carriers and regional bases offers only modest improvement. Air-Sea Battle’s dependence on preemption and escalation raises strategic concerns. The need to strike Chinese targets before they disable U.S. forces encourages early U.S. attacks, potentially destabilizing the situation. As many Chinese kill-chain elements are located within China, attacking them carries escalatory risks.  While such threats enhance deterrence, dependence on them or preemption for lack of alternatives is strategically and politically problematic.",

    "text": "Even with Navy-Air Force integration and options for early and deep strikes, the U.S. must increasingly rely on distant and less observable platforms as forward forces become more vulnerable. This shift's extent is crucial for the U.S. military, particularly the Navy.  Without solving the vulnerability issue, pressure mounts to emphasize deterrence through escalation in the U.S. military strategy toward China. However, relying on nuclear threats is undesirable when de-emphasizing nuclear weapons in warfare.  Furthermore, China's second-strike nuclear capability, able to withstand a U.S. first strike, renders U.S. escalation options less credible.  Escalating to strategic cyber-attacks or Anti-Satellite (ASAT) weapons becomes riskier as China develops similar capabilities. Maintaining some forward presence in the Western Pacific remains necessary to support allies, deter force, and enhance security guarantees.  Forward presence also reassures partners and influences peacetime developments. However, with increased risks to both forward defense and escalation, the U.S. requires more inventive use of technology.  Countering advanced targeting involves four approaches: defending the target, disabling enemy strike capabilities, hiding the target, and complicating the target. Defending the target, the traditional military reflex, is likely the least effective given foreseeable technology.  Both submarine and missile warfare are offense-dominant, where offensive investments yield greater returns than defensive ones. In both areas, defense is technologically challenging, operationally unreliable, and economically costly.",

    "text": "Despite significant investment, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) remains inadequate or prohibitively expensive against sophisticated attacks from major powers like China. While current BMD might be effective against Iran or North Korea, China can easily enhance its missile capabilities faster than the U.S. can improve its intercept capacity.  While directed-energy or other advanced technologies might offer future solutions, their effectiveness remains uncertain.  Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) also faces persistent challenges. Submarines, especially quiet ones, are difficult to detect in deep waters with varying thermal layers.  Non-acoustic technologies, developed during and after the Cold War to overcome submarine silencing techniques, have yielded disappointing results.  Neutralizing hard-to-locate submarines with conventional weapons is also problematic.  China's investment in a new submarine force reflects the enduring challenges of ASW, even against the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy and Strategic Command's continued reliance on submarine-based nuclear deterrence underscores the ongoing difficulty in detecting and neutralizing submarines.  Given the cost and difficulty of defending U.S. strike platforms, American strategists are exploring counter-targeting Chinese sensors, missile launchers, command centers, weapon stocks, air bases, and submarine bases.  The technological possibilities and strategic risks of Air-Sea Battle have been discussed.  The option of using cyber weapons against the Chinese kill-chain warrants further examination. While the U.S. lacks a defined cyber-war doctrine, it is incorporating cyber capabilities into war-fighting plans. China considers U.S. C4ISR networks (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) a key vulnerability and a legitimate target for cyber-attacks.",

Without extending this reach, China cedes the vast Pacific to U.S. strike forces. China must balance the risks of extended anti-naval capability against the risks of not extending it.

    "text": "Cyber-war is better thought of as a military information counter-revolution, targeting enemy targeting and networking.  A force dependent on advanced networking and targeting is vulnerable to cyber-war. Both the U.S. and Chinese militaries are increasingly dependent yet also possess advanced cyber-war capabilities.  Both have much to lose and gain, given the offense-dominant nature of cyber-war. The advantage lies with the side superior at cyber-warfare and resilient to its effects.  The U.S. might be superior at cyber-war but more vulnerable to degradation due to geographic distance and reliance on advanced C4ISR. Offensive cyber-war against China's anti-access capability could be a defensive measure for the U.S.  While firewalls and network security are essential, they're inadequate against sophisticated state-sponsored cyber-attacks. Dual-use IT infrastructure poses an escalation risk, as civil-military cyber-attacks could escalate to general cyber-war against critical infrastructure.  Both the U.S. and China will likely avoid such escalation. This creates a dilemma – the likelihood of C4ISR-targeted cyber-war in a Sino-U.S. conflict versus the severe consequences of general cyber-war. Resolution requires tight political control to prevent escalation. The U.S. is torn between using cyber-war to protect its forces and avoiding it due to its reliance on networking.  The possibility of escalation necessitates mutual restraint, but China might not reciprocate, demanding U.S. preparedness for cyber-war. U.S. military planners haven't fully defined cyber-war's role in major conflict, but they are developing capabilities to degrade Chinese forces. Cyber-war is increasingly integral to U.S. strategy. Similar dynamics exist regarding military use of space and ASAT.  U.S. and Chinese C4ISR rely heavily on satellites. Both likely possess ASAT capabilities, but mutual deterrence and restraint are possible, particularly in space. Currently, the U.S. recognizes it has more to lose than gain from ASAT warfare.",

    "text": "Hiding platforms beyond enemy sensor range is more feasible and affordable than defending them or relying on preemptive strikes. This requires weapons with extended reach, excluding large aircraft carriers within Chinese targeting distance. While long-range missiles have a role, China's growing space-based sensor capabilities pose a challenge.  China's increasing space power, with plans to launch numerous satellites annually, enhances its long-range targeting capabilities. Submarines offer survivability due to the limitations of Chinese ASW. The U.S. Navy is expanding the role of submarines for conventional strikes, but cost remains a factor. Cheaper non-nuclear submarines could be a viable option as China's anti-surface capabilities improve. Befuddling Chinese targeting systems through increased complexity is another approach. Numerous, diverse, small, fast, and stealthy platforms, including drones, pose a challenge to a system designed for targeting a few large, high-value targets. Drones are cost-effective and expendable, complicating targeting and air defense. Distributed forces increase the difficulty of surveillance and tracking. Aircraft carriers can still play a role, but smaller, cheaper drone carriers might be more effective. Numbers matter, especially against large missile forces. A distributed force of smaller platforms can have greater survivability than a concentrated force of larger platforms with equal strike power. A 2005 National Defense University study highlighted the effectiveness of alternative fleet architectures with larger numbers of smaller platforms, achieving 25-50% greater strike effectiveness.  These alternatives emphasized VSTOL aircraft, submarines, and unmanned platforms. The study recommended design principles of complexity, smaller ships, networking, and modularity. These alternatives could also address the Navy's limited ship numbers. The most feasible and affordable counter to China's targeting advances involves hiding, fractionating, diversifying, and complicating the U.S. strike platform target set. This presents a qualitatively different challenge than the concentrated offensive forces of Mahanian sea power. Exploiting networking technology allows distributed forces while retaining the ability to concentrate force, echoing Mahan's principles with modern technology.",

The practical elements of phantom sea power would include: • submarines • sea-based missiles of various ranges • drone vessels and aircraft, in large numbers • larger numbers of small vessels with drones and missiles • state-of-the-art and continuously improving C4ISR networks • cyber-war  • ASAT. This is not to say that legacy platforms, including large aircraft carriers, have no future in the Western Pacific. The traditional blue-water fleet will remain potent, relevant, and survivable in most regions, and thus will be available for East Asia. Carriers and other surface combatants may have important roles to play in conditions short of high-intensity Sino-U.S. warfare, which is among the least likely contingencies. Moreover, surface combatants will remain important in expressing U.S. commitment and advancing U.S. interests—roles for which more ethereal war-fighting capabilities, as prescribed here, are not suitable. At issue is the balance between concentrated, conspicuous sea power and spread-out, ghost-like sea power. The analysis here suggests that the balance should tilt increasingly and as soon as practical toward the latter.",

The Chinese have chosen to concentrate on denying U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific instead of achieving sea control for themselves. Will the Chinese approach succeed if the United States shifts toward phantom sea power? On the surface, it would be much harder for the Chinese to neutralize a force of U.S. submarines, drones, and numerous, distant, and diverse strike platforms because they will not be able to find and target enough of them. Eventually, breakthroughs in sensor technology may make any platform, anywhere, observable and vulnerable. Until then, the fragmentation, distribution, diversification, and hiding of strike forces will cause diminishing returns on investment in targeting. As great a risk to distributed U.S. sea power as Chinese targeting is Chinese cyber-warfare. In theory, cyber-warfare has the potential to disrupt all kinds of military operations that exploit information technology. How great the potential and what can be done about it over the long term is unclear. It may be that progress in defending computer networks from low-end threats (e.g., hackers) will extend to high-end ones (e.g., China). In the meantime, the United States will have to grapple with the dilemma of how dependent to become on networking—but so too will China.",

    "text": "The U.S. Navy is not poised to embark on a radical shift away from concentrated surface power. Large carriers have the backing of naval and joint commanders, diplomats, politicians, and ship-builders. Moreover, but for their vulnerability to Chinese targeting, they remain critical to U.S. global military and political power. If the number of U.S. carriers declines, it will be gradually, carefully, and by attrition through retirement from old age. Within the likely constraints of U.S. defense spending, the retention of aircraft carriers—at about $10 billion per vessel—will limit the building of distributed sea power to investments at the margin. Hence, it will take the United States decades to effect wholesale change in the character and composition of its fleet. In addition to huge industrial and structural impediments, navies—especially those of established sea powers—resist rapid change. For instance, the Royal Navy was very slow to change from sail to steam and wood to steel until compelled to do so by emergent German sea power. An even more arresting example is the case of the battleship following World War I. The advent of submarines and warplanes and the marginal role played by the dreadnought in the war, despite expectations that it would be critical, raised questions—outside the U.S. Navy’s mainstream—about both the survivability and importance of battleships. In 1920, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell of the Army Air Service challenged the Navy to see whether its battleships could withstand bombing. The Navy insisted on “the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out of action by aerial bombs.” It further asserted that “no development would justify any conclusion that battleships were practically rendered useless by aircraft.” Mitchell’s bombers proceeded to sink the Navy’s captured German battleship Ostfriesland with six bombs in 20 minutes. From then on, the vulnerability of the battleship was indisputable, its demise was inevitable, and the supremacy of the aircraft carrier was assured.",

    "text": "’s success was thought to come at the expense of the success of others. In such a climate, the only assurance of maritime security was independent national sea power (sea control), which could also be used to degrade the maritime security of others (sea denial). Because the fittest power, Britain, could dominate weaker ones—Holland, Spain, Russia, and France—superiority at sea meant dominance at sea. Therefore, emerging powers that depended on trade and aspired to be imperial powers—America, Germany, and Japan—had not only to become sea powers but also to challenge if not confront the established sea power.\n Mahan’s ideas were informed by what he observed of British sea power and, in turn, applied by Americans, Germans, and Japanese to motivate and guide dramatic naval expansion. A century-plus later, another American naval officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, while serving as Chief of Naval Operations, offered a fundamentally different idea in the fundamentally different world he observed. The integration of the world economy in the late 20th century caused another burst of international trade, 90 percent of which is by sea. As global markets and global industries formed, economic interdependence has deepened. In these conditions, the health of national economies depends more than ever on the health of the world economy in which they are a part. So the success of one power correlates with the success of other powers, not their failure. More and more nations are joining the mainstream of economic development, trade, and interdependence. There is a greater awareness of common interests in the efficient and safe trade of materials, food, fuels, and goods. While contemporary sea powers—the United States, above all—have the means to disrupt the trade of others, economic integration has made it self-defeating to do so. More plausible threats now come from those few states and many non-state actors who would threaten or abuse the expansion of trade: pirates, terrorists, and traffickers in drugs, weapons of mass destruction, and human beings. In addition, resources located in and under the oceans are in growing demand to maintain economic health in the advanced North and nourish rapid growth in the developing South. Finally, with coastal populations expanding rapidly and under growing danger of disasters and rising sea levels, natural maritime threats have grown along with human threats. For these reasons, there is growing support for the idea that the seas are “commons” in need of joint stewardship and security by the states and enterprises that use them for good purposes. The main steward of the commons, naturally, would be the United States, sole superpower and dominant sea power. But unlike Britain’s unilateral command of the seas in the 19th century, the United States will lead a multilateral approach. With the Cold War behind it, the United States has steadily reduced its fleet. As more of the world’s seas need more security, as a result of globalization and expanded trade",

    "text": "the United States cannot afford to perform in the 21st century the role Great Britain played in the 19th. Whereas sea power is an important aspect of American power now, it was the foundation of British power then. (Even at that, recall that, by the beginning of the 20th century, domestic economic demands were threatening the affordability of Britain continuing to “rule the waves.”) The number of ships in the U.S. Navy of 2000 was one-third that of the Royal Navy of 1900. With climbing capital costs and operating expenses (e.g., fuel), odds are against the U.S. Navy expanding. In these circumstances, Mullen’s idea was a simple one: All like-minded nations with a requirement for maritime security should become members of a global coalition. The United States should organize and lead a “Thousand-Ship Navy”—officially, the “Global Maritime Partnership Initiative”—consisting of warships, coast guards, tankers, freighters, and all other flagged vessels that could assist in monitoring and policing the world’s waters. Advanced information technology would network participating fleets and vessels in what some have referred to as a “global” or “post-modern” navy. In Mullen’s words: Imagine [a] fleet operating with the navies . . . of a host of other nations, fully netted and interoperable. They could be anywhere the national and international political leadership wanted them to be . . . ready to go at a moment’s notice. Not just a force to wage war, but a force to wage peace as well. While the rhetoric of the Thousand-Ship Navy has cooled off and the terminology has changed—new leaders like new slogans—the basic idea continues to affect not only the U.S. Navy but many others, including in the Western Pacific. Regional partnerships are forming in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, mostly at U.S. encouragement. Their purposes range from protection of littoral waters (off West Africa) to counter-drug patrolling (in the Caribbean) to WMD interdiction and choke-point security (the Strait of Malacca). Even as the U.S. Navy maintains its blue-water supremacy, despite declining fleet size, it is developing its green-water capabilities with the Littoral Combat Ship and new high-speed vessels to facilitate working with partners. Although the U.S. Global Maritime Partnership Initiative was motivated by the general problem of maritime security, the cause of cooperation got a big boost with the spread of terrorism, the rise of piracy, and several huge coastal natural disasters in the first decade of the 21st century. Even the recruiting slogan of today’s U.S. Navy—“A Global Force for Good”—implies a preference for engagement and cooperation over naval warfare (albeit with a reminder of U.S. power and reach). Cynics might say that the U.S. Navy fashioned the idea of American-led cooperative maritime security to justify maintaining and modernizing the fleet as it became clear that it has no serious opponent. But the underlying premise—too much ocean, too many choke-points, too many threats, too few navy ships—is incontestable when considering the vital importance of oceanic trade to the world and U.S. economies. Lately, the prospect of warfare from and on the sea has returned, especially in Middle East and East Asian waters of strategic importance. U.S. defense strategy concentrates increasingly on major military contingencies that could place heavy demands on naval forces for traditional missions: sea control, sea denial, and strike. In particular, the growing anti-naval and naval capabilities of China in the Western Pacific and Iran in the Persian Gulf command the top attention of the U.S. government, not just the Navy. Because the United States does not anticipate large-scale land-warfare with Iran, much less with China, maritime war-fighting capabilities, such as for sea-based strike, are considered key. Hence, Mullen’s maritime partnership now competes with Mahan-like (or Mahan-lite?) sea power as the basis for naval planning, fleet architecture, and politics. While the U.S. Navy is extraordinarily versatile and resourceful, there is no denying that the forces and competencies best suited for maritime cooperation (green-water engagement) are not the same as those most needed for maritime warfare against capable states (blue-water control, denial, and strike). U.S. sea power is thus being pulled in two directions: collaborative and competitive. This naval tug-of-war is putting operational strains on existing forces, intensifying competition over investment, and creating tension between openly sharing information with many partners and restricting information to only the closest allies. Aggravating the U.S. Navy’s resource dilemma is the fact that it, along with the U.S. Air Force, has been the post-9/11 “bill-payer” of U.S. requirements to expand and operate the Army and Marine Corps for occupation and counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. defense spending has grown enormously since 2001, but funding for naval modernization has been more or less flat. So the need to partner with other navies remains strong. While the Navy tries to reconcile the two, it is best to acknowledge that Mullen’s imperative of cooperation largely contradicts Mahan’s inevitability of competition—which helps explain why a fleet optimized for the latter is not optimal for the former. Therefore, the validity of the underlying theories needs to be examined. Has mutual responsibility for the commons replaced the drive for advantage? Is there more to the idea of partnership than a situational need to make up for the post–Cold War contraction of the U.S. Navy in the absence of a rival sea power? And, for this study, is there some way the United States and China can snatch the promise of maritime partnership from the jaws of sea-power confrontation?",

    "text": "If we are indeed in for a change in the basic premise of sea power, the main reason would be that globalization is making cooperative maritime security more attractive and even compelling. But why would globalization favor cooperation over confrontation at sea? This is a legitimate question: After all, economic interdependence did not prevent naval rivalry or, for that matter, world war a century ago. More to the point at hand, why would the common economic interests of China and the United States, including secure trade, foster maritime cooperation when such an approach was not pursued by Great Britain and Germany, also major trading partners when they became rival sea powers? The answer is complex but worth examining. First, it can be argued that although economic interdependence did not prevent the great-power politics and antagonism that led to World War I, it should have. World War I was a tragic triumph of jealousy, hubris, and maneuvering over the modernizing and presumed moderating effects of increasingly interconnected economies. Sovereigns made win-or-lose calculations that had lose-lose consequences for their societies. While some powers paid a higher price than others for World War I, losses suffered by “winners” were also staggering (enough to nurture British and French appeasement of Hitler). Moreover, the automaticity built into pre-war alliances and interlocking pledges of support in the event of war—later seen as regrettable—left decision-makers with little space or time to manage a cascade of crises that led to war despite their inhibitions. Had European statesmen understood how long and devastating the War would be, even for winners, they just might have exercised better control over their mechanistic alignments, military planning triggers, and optimistic generals. That German leaders, for example, did not foresee how war would turn beneficial economic cooperation into ruinous economic punishment is not a reason to expect leaders today to be as myopic. Likewise, that British leaders saw no alternative but to deny Germany’s maritime-security interests does not mean that no alternative to sea-power rivalry exists today—or, for that matter, existed then. In this regard, and second, it is evident that today’s Chinese and American leaders do appreciate that conflict could inflict great economic harm, all the more so because of Sino-U.S. interdependence. When crises have occurred (e.g., over Taiwan or U.S. surveillance patrols near China), one or both capitals have acted judiciously. Such care by each power toward the other, despite divergent interests in the region, is not only because of doubts about the course and outcome of military conflict but also because both economies could suffer tremendously regardless. Thus, the fact that the Chinese and American economies are coupled and largely share the same fate, in war as in peace, is a major inhibition on great-power behavior. Conversely, if Sino-U.S. war were to occur, it could be because of the same sort of miscalculation or conceit that befell European leaders a century ago. Third, the nature and workings of economic integration under conditions of Europe prior to World War I are different in kind than those of globalization. The former involved choices at the margin to acquire raw materials and goods from nations where a comparative advantage in producing them existed. Although there was significant international investment, trade was largely replaceable and reversible, albeit at considerable cost. Under today’s conditions of an integrated world economy, interdependence is becoming organic: Markets for goods, services, capital, finance, technology, management, distribution, production operations, infrastructure, and equity are increasingly global and unified. Movements through these markets are continuous, swift, and resistant to national control. Market-driven value chains—research, development, componentry, sub-systems, systems, services—do not respect sovereign jurisdictions or preferences. This is structurally different than interacting national economies. If the breakdown of international trade and investment due to war and protectionism harmed all national economies during World War I and the Depression, the damage from the collapse of today’s global economy would be incalculable.",

It intertwines economies, like those of the U.S. and China, diminishing individual state control while creating a shared interest in protecting their interconnected economic system.

It could also serve Chinese interests better than confrontation with the U.S., though China may not perceive it that way. The U.S. faces a strategic dilemma: it must prevent China from establishing a dominant sphere of influence in the region while recognizing the growing vulnerability of its sea power. Technological advancements make sea control harder and sea denial easier. The increasing vulnerability of surface vessels to attacks from missiles and submarines undermines maritime security for both the U.S. and China. This shared vulnerability could eventually outweigh competitive impulses, leading to a greater common interest in maritime security.",

China's growing anti-naval capabilities challenge U.S. sea power, yet non-state threats and other maritime challenges call for cooperation among regional stakeholders. Cooperative maritime security is gaining traction, particularly among Southeast Asian nations and the U.S. The key question is whether such cooperation will include or exclude China.  The U.S. should encourage Chinese participation but ultimately leave the decision to China. Regional dynamics heavily influence this possibility. As China expands its military, its neighbors are upgrading their own capabilities.  Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian nations are enhancing their naval forces, often in cooperation with the U.S.  These improved capabilities among U.S. partners can be a significant geostrategic asset against China, assuming the U.S. maintains their trust and skillfully manages these relationships to encourage Chinese moderation.",

Including China could reduce suspicion and enhance regional stability. China's integration into the regional economy necessitates its inclusion in efforts to secure maritime trade.

    "text": "would motivate the formation of the grouping. As already noted, the Mullen idea addressed both non-state threats to maritime security and dangerous or harmful sea trafficking by states and non-states. Apart from such external threats, an East Asian maritime partnership including China would constitute a sort of collective security arrangement—one with a circumscribed purpose and scope: to provide maritime security. Generally speaking, collective security is different in kind than a security alliance in that it includes all states in a given geographic domain, whether friendly or not. It is undergirded by an understanding that all participating states will refrain from force and other aggressive conduct. Further, it is disciplined by a corresponding understanding—at least an implication—that the participants will organize and may act against any state that violates the collective security, even if that state had acceded to the grouping. In effect, a collective security arrangement can be transformed into an alliance against any wayward participant.\nIn the case of East Asia, a comprehensive collective security arrangement would be practically impossible to form under current conditions. For one thing, China would oppose absolutely any implication that the Taiwan problem is a matter of international security and any attempt to limit its options, including the use of force. Yet this does not preclude an agreement focused on the avoidance of force in international waters and, importantly, in disputed waters. While states with claims would resist any arrangement that would weaken those claims, they would be expected to affirm the widely accepted norm that disputes should not be settled by force. Along this line, the United States could propose—others in the region would of course need to agree—that China be invited and urged to join a maritime security partnership provided certain criteria are met, not only by China but by all participants. The matter of criteria thus becomes dispositive. While the United States and its partners would want to facilitate China’s involvement, they would also want to ensure that the goals of regional maritime security are served. To this end, all states wishing to join an East Asian maritime partnership, including the two great powers, might be expected to agree\n• to settle maritime territorial and resource disputes peacefully, consensually, and through international legal norms and means\n• not to use force against commercial and other civilian shipping engaged in peacetime trade and other peaceful activities\n• that the United States and other countries not located in the region have as much right of access to East Asian waters as any country of the region\n• to institute information-sharing, crisis consultations, confidence-building measures, joint exercises, and joint operations\n• to take appropriate joint action against non-state actors or states that violate these norms.\nSuch undertakings are consistent with established international norms, including peaceful dispute settlement, protection from attack of non-combatants, and freedom of navigation in international waters. Nevertheless, there is benefit in reiterating them in this particular regional setting. Moreover, it could be beneficial to reinforce these norms with practical cooperative measures and with agreement to cooperate against those that flout them.",

    "text": "The Chinese would be especially wary of any provision prejudicial to their claims—indeed, their insistence—that certain islands (in some cases, little more than rocks) in the South China and East China Seas are theirs, based on historical possession. The positions of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia regarding the South China Sea are exceedingly complex and seemingly irreconcilable; and those of China, Taiwan, and Japan in the East China Sea are nearly so. Resolution of these disputes should not be a precondition of forming or joining an East Asian maritime partnership. Indeed, so complicated and unclear are the merits of the welter of claims, especially in the South China Sea, that making their resolution a precondition of regional maritime partnership would mount to deferring this idea indefinitely. If any state—whether a U.S. ally or China—sought American endorsement of its legal position in return for its support for an East Asian maritime partnership, the United States should decline (as it now declines to take sides). It would be essential to show China both that such a partnership will not be used against it and that it cannot be used by them against other claimants. Even such circumscribed purposes could be difficult to fulfill, because one party’s failure to contest another’s military or economic activities may be prejudicial to its legal case. Nonetheless, precisely because the scramble for islands, waters, and resources in East Asian waters is already harmful to both economic development and security, a general pledge to act peacefully and cooperatively ought to be a criterion of a regional collective maritime security regime.\nThe Chinese could be attracted to an assurance that participating states would not attack its commercial shipping, since this would give it some confidence that its access to the oceans of the region and the world would not be cut off, especially by the United States. Of course, they would be unlikely to rely absolutely on such an assurance and so would presumably continue to expand China’s naval power. For its part, the United States would have to consider whether a pledge not to attack commercial shipping would forfeit an important option. However, as the study of international law and the history of warfare show, what nations do when at war is constrained by a different set of norms than the standards they observe in peacetime. The United States does not currently claim the right to attack commercial shipping engaged in peacetime, peaceful activity. A sincere invitation to join on such terms would leave China with the choice of whether to enhance maritime security cooperatively or else risk the partnership becoming an anti-China naval alliance. There are at least three possible results: China could decline and reject the grouping as anti-Chinese; it could join but then fail to adhere to the criteria; or it could accept the criteria, join, and become a valued partner. The United States should aim for the third possibility.",

    "text": "a response to regional anxiety brought on by China itself, and thus embraced by virtually the entire region. For China to react with hostility to the pivot and toward the United States would validate and reinforce the regional concerns that led to the pivot in the first place. As one U.S. expert observes: “A number of Chinese analysts argue that China should bear some responsibility for the resurgence of U.S. influence and power around its periphery.”\nThis insight into the worries of the Chinese is confirmed by how emphatically they warn against U.S. attempts at dividing the region, which is Chinese code for isolating China. In fact, China’s own conduct has had more to do with its isolation than American conduct has, given the U.S. post-9/11 preoccupations in the Middle East and South Asia. It follows that China’s opposition to U.S. policies that respond to regional security concerns could increase, not reduce, its isolation.\nThis consideration is unlikely to weigh enough to offset Chinese hostility toward U.S. moves, especially military enhancements, potentially threatening to China. Seen in this light, if all important states in the region welcomed a U.S. multilateral maritime-security plan, if such an initiative was not militarily threatening, if the United States expressed a sincere and strong interest in China’s involvement, and if the Chinese knew they had no veto, then they might be hesitant to reject it lest doing so add to their isolation.\nAs David Shlapak of RAND has reminded the author, the Chinese already expect most important East Asian states to seek close ties with the United States, if they do not already have them. Regional concerns about China are an inevitable result of China’s growing power—a price that must be paid in order to protect and advance China’s legitimate interests now that China, at long last, has the means. By this reasoning, the Chinese already discount the possibility of further isolation, thus mooting the political disadvantage of refusing to participate in collective maritime security. Maybe so; however, there are hints that not all Chinese see it this way, as noted above. Moreover, why give the Americans and their allies another opportunity to align the region against China when an opportunity to reduce China’s isolation presents itself? Of course, this assumes that the Chinese see an invitation to participate as honest and non-prejudicial.\nEven if the Chinese see risks in refusing regional maritime security cooperation, they would suspect a Trojan Horse (or Sea Horse?) aimed at shoring up the political foundation for U.S. military presence and alliances surrounding China. While professing to want good relations with the United States and to accept the United States as a Pacific power, they feel threatened both by U.S. military capabilities and by U.S. alliances, old and new.",

    "text": "But as long as the U.S. initiative was cast as a way of involving China in regional security, not embarrassing China, those Chinese most concerned about isolation (e.g., diplomats) might prevail over those who reflexively oppose U.S. forces, relationships, and policies in the region (e.g., PLA brass). More likely, the Chinese would be divided over the propositions advanced here. In a classic damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don’t bind, they would not want to give legitimacy to U.S. leadership and sea power in East Asia, yet they would not want to give the Americans an opening to organize most of East Asia against them at sea. The Chinese might lobby their neighbors to rebuff the American plan; but in view of regional attitudes about Chinese maritime ambitions, they would not likely succeed. The approach would only work if U.S. civilian leaders appealed to their Chinese counterparts—both political and economic elites—in the interest of common maritime security. U.S. naval and other military leaders should of course present the idea in the most forthcoming way they can to their Chinese counterparts. But American diplomacy on this should avoid handing the PLA a veto (if it does not already have one on such a matter).\nBritish statesmen did not reach out wholeheartedly to their German counterparts to head off a naval rivalry, leaving it to intermediaries to test the waters, so to speak. In that case, not only did the British admiralty enjoy great political influence, but the commitment to sea-power dominance was engrained in national consciousness and policy. British politicians and industrialists saw the world and the need to block Germany more or less the same as the Royal Navy did. Their German counterparts, especially Kaiser Wilhelm, were no less deferential to their own admirals. Comparatively, U.S. political leaders are not beholden to “naval interests.” Moreover, U.S. naval leaders such as Mullen are on record favoring collective maritime security, including with China. Because regional maritime cooperation, with or without China, would not diminish or replace U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific but rather help to sustain it, the U.S. Navy should support this initiative.\nWhether China’s leaders are as taken with the logic of adversarial sea power as Imperial Germany’s were is less clear—but worth testing. The United States has recently raised its sights and sought to broaden the scope for Sino-American security dialogue to encompass increasingly difficult regional, nuclear, space, cyber, and maritime matters. In this context, the United States could introduce at the highest political levels the idea of Sino-American maritime partnership. This alone will not bring the Chinese along. What could do so is confronting Chinese leaders with the prospects of self-exclusion from regional partnership. Whether they could bring along the PLA and PLAN is unclear. In this regard, one possible straw in the wind is a reported recent agreement between PACOM and the PLAN to discuss logistics cooperation in cases of cooperative missions to combat piracy and provide humanitarian relief in the event of natural disasters. Obviously, the Chinese have more to gain than their American counterparts in practical terms. Moreover, this is a far cry from general agreement on cooperative maritime security. Still, it suggests that navy-to-navy collaboration is not taboo for the Chinese.\nIn no case can the United States mortgage its ability to defend its interests, its allies, its forces, freedom of the seas, and commercial shipping throughout the region. Cooperation with the region’s capable seafaring states would be advantageous for the United States in any case—whether one adheres to the view of Mahan, Mullen, or both. Indeed, East Asian maritime partnership would become the new framework in which U.S. sea power would remain in the region. Moreover, whether China participated or not, the United States should retain and modernize its naval capabilities for war-fighting, along the lines recommended in the preceding chapter.",

    "text": "NATIONAL DEFENSE RESEARCH INSTITUTE www.rand.org RR-151-OSD $23.95 China sees American sea power in East Asian waters as threatening to itself, its regional aspirations, and possibly its global access. So it is mounting a challenge with anti-ship missiles, submarines, and a growing ﬂeet of its own. However, the United States will not relinquish its sea power, which it sees as needed to maintain its inﬂuence and stability, despite China’s growing might, in this vital region. History shows that rivalries between established and rising sea powers tend to end badly, to wit: Britain versus Germany before World War I and the United States versus Japan before World War II. In this case, technology that enables the targeting of surface ships, especially aircraft carriers, favors the challenger, China. The United States can exploit technology more boldly than it has previously to make its sea power less vulnerable by relying more on submarines, drones, and smaller, elusive, widely distributed strike platforms. Yet, such a U.S. strategy could take decades and even then be vulnerable to Chinese cyber-war. Therefore, in parallel with making its sea power more survivable, the United States should propose an alternative to confrontation at sea: East Asian multilateral maritime-security cooperation, with China invited to join. While China might be wary that such a regional arrangement would be designed to contain and constrain it, the alternative of exclusion and isolation could induce China to join. David C. Gompert is a professor of national security studies at the U.S. Naval Academy and an adjunct fellow at the RAND Corporation. During 2009–2010, he was Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence. He has held a number of corporate executive and senior government positions, including Senior Advisor for National Security in Iraq, Deputy to",
