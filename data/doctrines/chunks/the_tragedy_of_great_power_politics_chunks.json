    "text": "The twentieth century was a period of great international violence. In World War I (1914-18), roughly nine million people died on European battlefields. About fifty million people were killed during World War II (1939-45), well over half of them civilians. Soon after the end of World War II, the Cold War engulfed the globe. During this confrontation, the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies never directly fought the United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, but many millions died in proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Angola, El Salvador, and elsewhere. Millions also died in the century's lesser, yet still fierce, wars, including the Russo-Japanese conflicts of 1904-5 and 1939, the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1920, the Russo-Polish War of 1920-21, the various Arab-Israeli wars, and the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-88.\nThis cycle of violence will continue far into the new millennium. Hopes for peace will probably not be realized, because the great powers that shape the international system fear each other and compete for power as a result. Indeed, their ultimate aim is to gain a position of dominant power over others, because having dominant power is the best means to ensure one's own survival. Strength ensures safety, and the greatest strength is the greatest insurance of safety. States facing this incentive are fated to clash as each competes for advantage over the others. This is a tragic situation, but there is no escaping it unless the states that make up the system agree to form a world government. Such a vast transformation is hardly a realistic prospect, however, so conflict and war are bound to continue as large and enduring features of world politics.\nOne could challenge this gloomy view by noting that the twentieth century ended peacefully—with the end of the Cold War—and that relations among the great powers are quite peaceful as we begin the twenty-first century. This is certainly true, but predicting the future by simply extrapolating forward from the present does not make for sound analysis. Consider what that approach would have told a European observer at the start of each of the previous two centuries. In 1800, Europe was in the midst of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, which lasted twenty-three years (1792-1815) and involved all of that era's great powers. Extrapolating forward from that bloody year, one would have expected the nineteenth century to be filled with great-power conflict. In fact, it is among the least conflictual periods in European history. In 1900, on the other hand, there was no warfare in Europe that involved a great power, and little evidence portended that one was in the offing. Extrapolating forward from that tranquil year, one would have expected little conflict in Europe during the twentieth century. As we know, the opposite was the case.\nGeneral theories of international politics offer useful tools for anticipating what lies ahead. The most useful theories of this sort would describe how great powers normally behave toward each other and would explain their conduct. Useful theories would also account in good part for how the great powers have behaved in the past, including explaining why some historical periods were more conflictual than others. A theory that satisfies these requirements and helps us look backward to understand the past should also help us look forward and anticipate the future. In this book I try to offer a theory with these attributes. My theory, which I label \"offensive realism,\" is essentially realist in nature; it falls thus in the tradition of realist thinkers such as E. H. Carr, Hans Morgenthau, and Kenneth Waltz. Its elements are few and can be distilled in a handful of simple propositions. For example, I emphasize that great powers seek to maximize their share of world power. I also argue that multipolar systems which contain an especially powerful state—in other words, a potential hegemon—are especially prone to war.",

    "text": "Many in the West seem to believe that \"perpetual peace\" among the great powers is finally at hand. The end of the Cold War, so the argument goes, marked a sea change in how great powers interact with one another. We have entered a world in which there is little chance that the major powers will engage each other in security competition, much less war, which has become an obsolescent enterprise. In the words of one famous author, the end of the Cold War has brought us to the \"the end of history.\" This perspective suggests that great powers no longer view each other as potential military rivals, but instead as members of a family of nations, members of what is sometimes called the \"international community.\" The prospects for cooperation are abundant in this promising new world, a world which is likely to bring increased prosperity and peace to all the great powers.\nEven a few adherents of realism, a school of thought that has historically held pessimistic views about the prospects for peace among the great powers, appear to have bought into the reigning optimism, as reflected in an article from the mid-1990s titled \"Realists as Optimists.\" Alas, the claim that security competition and war between the great powers have been purged from the international system is wrong. Indeed, there is much evidence that the promise of everlasting peace among the great powers was stillborn. Consider, for example, that even though the Soviet threat has disappeared, the United States still maintains about one hundred thousand troops in Europe and roughly the same number in Northeast Asia. It does so because it recognizes that dangerous rivalries would probably emerge among the major powers in these regions if U.S. troops were withdrawn. Moreover, almost every European state, including the United Kingdom and France, still harbors deep-seated, albeit muted, fears that a Germany unchecked by American power might behave aggressively; fear of Japan in Northeast Asia is probably even more profound, and it is certainly more frequently expressed. Finally, the possibility of a clash between China and the United States over Taiwan is hardly remote. This is not to say that such a war is likely, but the possibility reminds us that the threat of great-power war has not disappeared.\nThe sad fact is that international politics has always been a ruthless and dangerous business, and it is likely to remain that way. Although the intensity of their competition waxes and wanes, great powers fear each other and always compete with each other for power. The overriding goal of each state is to maximize its share of world power, which means gaining power at the expense of other states. But great powers do not merely strive to be the strongest of all the great powers, although that is a welcome outcome. Their ultimate aim is to be the hegemon—that is, the only great power in the system. There are no status quo powers in the international system, save for the occasional hegemon that wants to maintain its dominating position over potential rivals. Great powers are rarely content with the current distribution of power; on the contrary, they face a constant incentive to change it in their favor. They almost always have revisionist intentions, and they will use force to alter the balance of power if they think it can be done at a reasonable price. At times, the costs and risks of trying to shift the balance of power are too great, forcing great powers to wait for more favorable circumstances. But the desire for more power does not go away, unless a state achieves the ultimate goal of hegemony. Since no state is likely to achieve global hegemony, however, the world is condemned to perpetual great-power competition.",

In other words, why did it behave differently from Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union, all of which translated their economic might into military might and strove for European hegemony? 4) Why was Bismarckian Germany ( 1862- 90) especially aggressive between 1862 and 1870, fighting two wars with other great powers and one war with a minor power, but hardly aggressive at all from 1 8 7 1 until 1 890, when it fought no wars and generally sought to maintain the European status quo? 5) Why did the United Kingdom, France, and Russia form a balancing coalition against Wilhelmine Germany before World War I, but fail to organize an effective alliance to contain Nazi Germany? 6) Why did Japan and the states of Western Europe join forces with the United States against the Soviet Union in the early years of the Cold War, even though the United States emerged from World War II with the most powerful economy in the world and a nuclear monopoly? 7) What explains the commitment of American troops to Europe and Northeast Asia during the twentieth century? For example, why did the United States wait until April 1 9 1 7 to join World War I, rather than enter the war when it broke out in August 1 9 1 4? For that matter, why did the United States not send troops to Europe before 1 9 1 4 to prevent the outbreak of war? Similiarly, why did the United States not balance against Nazi Germany in the 1 9 30s or send troops to Europe before September 1 939 to prevent the outbreak of World War II? 8) Why did the United States and the Soviet Union continue building up their nuclear arsenals after each had acquired a secure second-strike capability against the other? A world in which both sides have an \"assured destruction\" capability is generally considered to be stable and its nuclear balance difficult to overturn, yet both superpowers spent billions of dollars and rubles trying to gain a first-strike advantage. Third, I use the theory to make predictions about great-power politics in the twenty-first century. This effort may strike some readers as foolhardy, because the study of international relations, like the other social sciences, rests on a shakier theoretical foundation than that of the natural sciences. Moreover, political phenomena are highly complex; hence, precise political predictions are impossible without theoretical tools that are superior to those we now possess. As a result, all political forecasting is bound to include some error.",

    "text": "Those who venture to predict, as I do here, should therefore proceed with humility, take care not to exhibit unwarranted confidence, and admit that hindsight is likely to reveal surprises and mistakes. Despite these hazards, social scientists should nevertheless use their theories to make predictions about the future. Making predictions helps inform policy discourse, because it helps make sense of events unfolding in the world around us. And by clarifying points of disagreement, making explicit forecasts helps those with contradictory views to frame their own ideas more clearly. Furthermore, trying to anticipate new events is a good way to test social science theories, because theorists do not have the benefit of hindsight and therefore cannot adjust their claims to fit the evidence (because it is not yet available). In short, the world can be used as a laboratory to decide which theories best explain international politics. In that spirit, I employ offensive realism to peer into the future, mindful of both the benefits and the hazards of trying to predict events. The Virtues and Limits of Theory\nIt should be apparent that this book is self-consciously theoretical. But outside the walls of academia, especially in the policy world, theory has a bad name. Social science theories are often portrayed as the idle speculations of head-in-the-clouds academics that have little relevance to what goes on in the \"real world.\" For example, Paul Nitze, a prominent American foreign policy maker during the Cold War, wrote, \"Most of what has been written and taught under the heading of 'political science' by Americans since World War II has been . . . of limited value, if not counterproductive, as a guide to the actual conduct of policy.\"' In this view, theory should fall almost exclusively within the purview of academics, whereas policymakers should rely on common sense, intuition, and practical experience to carry out their duties. This view is wrongheaded. In fact, none of us could understand the world we live in or make intelligent decisions without theories. Indeed, all students and practitioners of international politics rely on theories to comprehend their surroundings. Some are aware of it and some are not, some admit it and some do not; but there is no escaping the fact that we could not make sense of the complex world around us without simplifying theories. The Clinton administration's foreign policy rhetoric, for example, was heavily informed by the three main liberal theories of international relations: 1) the claim that prosperous and economically interdependent states are unlikely to fight each other, 2) the claim that democracies do not fight each other, and 3) the claim that international institutions enable states to avoid war and concentrate instead on building cooperative relationships.",

Introduction 13 In particular, does the system contain a potential hegemon-a great power that is considerably stronger than any of its rival great powers? Defining power dearly also gives us a window into understanding state behavior. I[ states compete for power, we learn more about the nature of that competition if we understand more fully what power is, and there­ fore what states are competing for. In short, knowing more about the true nature of power should help illuminate how great powers compete among themselves. Fourth, what strategies do states pursue to gain power, or to maintain it when another great power threatens to upset the balance of power? Blackmail and war are the main strategies that states employ to acquire power. and balancing and buck-passing are the principal strategies that great powers use to maintain the distribution of power when facing a dan­ gerous rival. With balancing, the threatened state accepts the burden of deterring its adversary and commits substantial resources to achieving that goal. With buck-passing. the endangered great power tries to get another state to shoulder the burden of deterring or defeating the threatening state. The final two questions locus on the key strategies that states employ to maximize their share of world power. The fifth is, what are the causes of war? Specifically, what power-related factors make it more or less likely that security competition will intensify and tum into open conflict? Sixth, when do threatened great powers balance against a dangerous adversary and when do they attempt to pass the buck to another threatened state? I will attempt to provide clear and convincing answers to these ques­ tions. It should be emphasized, however, that there is no consensus among realists on the answers to any of them. Realism is a rich tradition with a long history, and disputes over fundamental issues have long been commonplace among realists. In the pages that follow, I do not consider alternative realist theories in much detail. I will make clear how offensive realism differs from its main realist rivals. and I will challenge these alter­ native perspectives on panicular points. mainly to elucidate my own argu­ ments. But no attempt will be made to systematically examine any other realist theory. Instead, the locus will be on laying out my theory of offen­ sive realism and using it to explain the past and predict the future.",

Three different liberal theories were mentioned earlier; there are other nonrealist theories, such as social constructivism and bureaucratic poJitics, to name just two. I will briefly analyze some of these theories when I look at great-power politics after the Cold War (Chapter 1 0), mainly because they underpin many of the claims that international poli­ tics has undergone a fundamental change since 1 990. Because of space limitations, however. I make no attempt at a comprehensive assessment of these nonrealist theories. Again, the emphasis in this study will be on making the case for offensive realism. Nevenheless, it makes good sense at this point to describe the theories that dominate thinking about international relations in both the academic and policy worlds, and to show how offensive realism compares with its main realist and nonrealist competitors. L I B E RA L I S M V S . R E A L I S M L iberalism and realism are the two bodies o f theory which hold places of privilege on the theoretical menu of international relations. Most of the great intellectual battles among international relations scholars take place either across the divide between realism and liberalism, or within those paradigms.15 To illustrate this point, consider the three most influential realist works of the twentieth century: 1) E. H. Carr's The 1Wenty Years' Crisis. 1919-1939, which was pub­ lished in the United Kingdom shonly after World War II staned in Europe ( 1939) and is still widely read today. 2) Hans Morgenthau's Politics among Nations. which was first pub­ lished in the United States in the early days of the Cold War ( 19 48) and dominated the field of international relations for at least the next two decades. 3) Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Politics, which has dominat­ ed the field since it first appeared during the latter pan of the Cold War(l979).16 lntrocluction 15 All three of these realist giants critique some aspect of liberalism in their writings. For example, both Carr and Waltz take issue with the liberal claim that economic interdependence enhances the prospects for peace.17 More generally, Carr and Morgenthau frequently criticize liberals for holding utopian views of politics which, if followed, would lead states to disaster. At the same time, these realists also disagree about a number of imponant issues. Waltz. for example, challenges Morgenthau's claim that multipolar systems are more stable than bipolar systems.11 Furthermore. whereas Morgenthau argues that states strive to gain power because they have an innate desire for power, Waltz maintains that the structure of the international system forces states to pursue power to enhance their prospects for survival. These examples are just a small sam­ ple of the differences among realist thinkers.",

    "text": "Human nature realists recognize that international anarchy—the absence of a governing authority over the great powers—causes states to worry about the balance of power. But that structural constraint is treated as a second-order cause of state behavior. The principal driving force in international politics is the will to power inherent in every state in the system, and it pushes each of them to strive for supremacy. Defensive realism, which is frequently referred to as \"structural realism,\" came on the scene in the late 1970s with the appearance of Waltz's Theory of International Politics. Unlike Morgenthau, Waltz does not assume that great powers are inherently aggressive because they are infused with a will to power; instead he starts by assuming that states merely aim to survive. Above all else, they seek security. Nevertheless, he maintains that the structure of the international system forces great powers to pay careful attention to the balance of power. In particular, anarchy forces security-seeking states to compete with each other for power, because power is the best means to survival. Whereas human nature is the deep cause of security competition in Morgenthau's theory, anarchy plays that role in Waltz's theory.\nWaltz does not emphasize, however, that the international system provides great powers with good reasons to act offensively to gain power. Instead, he appears to make the opposite case: that anarchy encourages states to behave defensively and to maintain rather than upset the balance of power. \"The first concern of states,\" he writes, is \"to maintain their position in the system.\" There seems to be, as international relations theorist Randall Schweller notes, a \"status quo bias\" in Waltz's theory. Waltz recognizes that states have incentives to gain power at their rivals' expense and that it makes good strategic sense to act on that motive when the time is right. But he does not develop that line of argument in any detail. On the contrary, he emphasizes that when great powers behave aggressively, the potential victims usually balance against the aggressor and thwart its efforts to gain power. For Waltz, in short, balancing checkmates offense. Furthermore, he stresses that great powers must be careful not to acquire too much power, because \"excessive strength\" is likely to cause other states to join forces against them, thereby leaving them worse off than they would have been had they refrained from seeking additional increments of power. Waltz's views on the causes of war further reflect his theory's status quo bias. There are no profound or deep causes of war in his theory. In particular, he does not suggest that there might be important benefits to be gained from war. In fact, he says little about the causes of war, other than to argue that wars are largely the result of uncertainty and miscalculation. In other words, if states knew better, they would not start wars.\nRobert Jervis, Jack Snyder, and Stephen Van Evera buttress the defensive realists' case by focusing attention on a structural concept known as the offense-defense balance. They maintain that military power at any point in time can be categorized as favoring either offense or defense. If defense has a clear advantage over offense, and conquest is therefore difficult, great powers will have little incentive to use force to gain power and will concentrate instead on protecting what they have. When defense has the advantage, protecting what you have should be a relatively easy task. Alternatively, if offense is easier, states will be sorely tempted to try conquering each other, and there will be a lot of war in the system. Defensive realists argue, however, that the offense-defense balance is usually heavily tilted toward defense, thus making conquest extremely difficult. In sum, efficient balancing coupled with the natural advantages of defense over offense should discourage great powers from pursuing aggressive strategies and instead make them \"defensive positionalists.\"",

    "text": "My theory of offensive realism is also a structural theory of international politics. As with defensive realism, my theory sees great powers as concerned mainly with figuring out how to survive in a world where there is no agency to protect them from each other; they quickly realize that power is the key to their survival. Offensive realism parts company with defensive realism over the question of how much power states want. For defensive realists, the international structure provides states with little incentive to seek additional increments of power; instead it pushes them to maintain the existing balance of power. Preserving power, rather than increasing it, is the main goal of states. Offensive realists, on the other hand, believe that status quo powers are rarely found in world politics, because the international system creates powerful incentives for states to look for opportunities to gain power at the expense of rivals, and to take advantage of those situations when the benefits outweigh the costs. A state's ultimate goal is to be the hegemon in the system. It should be apparent that both offensive realism and human nature realism portray great powers as relentlessly seeking power. The key difference between the two perspectives is that offensive realists reject Morgenthau's claim that states are naturally endowed with Type A personalities. On the contrary, they believe that the international system forces great powers to maximize their relative power because that is the optimal way to maximize their security. In other words, survival mandates aggressive behavior. Great powers behave aggressively not because they want to or because they possess some inner drive to dominate, but because they have to seek more power if they want to maximize their odds of survival. (Table I. I summarizes how the main realist theories answer the foundational questions described above.)\nNo article or book makes the case for offensive realism in the sophisticated ways that Morgenthau does for human nature realism and Waltz and others do for defensive realism. For sure, some realists have argued that the system gives great powers good reasons to act aggressively. Probably the best brief for offensive realism is a short, obscure book written during World War I by G. Lowes Dickinson, a British academic who was an early advocate of the League of Nations. In The European Anarchy, he argues that the root cause of World War I “was not Germany nor any other power. The real culprit was the European anarchy,” which created powerful incentives for states “to acquire supremacy over the others for motives at once of security and domination.” Nevertheless, neither Dickinson nor anyone else makes a comprehensive case for offensive realism. My aim in writing this book is to fill that void.\nPower Politics in Liberal America\nWhatever merits realism may have as an explanation for real-world politics and as a guide for formulating foreign policy, it is not a popular school of thought in the West. Realism's central message—that it makes good sense for states to selfishly pursue power—does not have broad appeal. It is difficult to imagine a modern political leader openly asking the public to fight and die to improve the balance of power. No European or American leader did so during either world war or the Cold War. Most people prefer to think of fights between their own state and rival states as clashes between good and evil, where they are on the side of the angels and their opponents are aligned with the devil. Thus, leaders tend to portray war as a moral crusade or an ideological contest, rather than as a struggle for power. Realism is a hard sell. Americans appear to have an especially intense antipathy toward balance-of-power thinking. The rhetoric of twentieth-century presidents, for example, is filled with examples of realism bashing.",

    "text": "grounds that it is too idealistic and have complained that American leaders pay insufficient attention to the balance of power. For example, Kennan wrote in 1951, “I see the most serious fault of our past policy formulation to lie in something that I might call the legalistic-moralistic approach to international problems. This approach runs like a red skein through our foreign policy of the last fifty years.” According to this line of argument, there is no real gap between America's liberal rhetoric and its foreign policy behavior because the United States practices what it preaches. But this claim is wrong. American foreign policy has usually been guided by realist logic, although the public pronouncements of its leaders might lead one to think otherwise. It should be obvious to intelligent observers that the United States speaks one way and acts another. In fact, policymakers in other states have always remarked about this tendency in American foreign policy. As long ago as 1939, Carr pointed out that states on the European continent regard the English-speaking peoples as “masters in the art of concealing their selfish national interests in the guise of the general good,” adding that “this kind of hypocrisy is a special and characteristic peculiarity of the Anglo-Saxon mind.” Still, the gap between rhetoric and reality usually goes unnoticed in the United States itself. Two factors account for this phenomenon. First, realist policies sometimes coincide with the dictates of liberalism, in which case there is no conflict between the pursuit of power and the pursuit of principle. Under these circumstances, realist policies can be justified with liberal rhetoric without having to discuss the underlying power realities. This coincidence makes for an easy sell. For example, the United States fought against fascism in World War II and communism in the Cold War for largely realist reasons. But both of those fights were also consistent with liberal principles, and thus policymakers had little trouble selling them to the public as ideological conflicts. Second, when power considerations force the United States to act in ways that conflict with liberal principles, “spin doctors” appear and tell a story that accords with liberal ideals. For example, in the late nineteenth century, American elites generally considered Germany to be a progressive constitutional state worthy of emulation. But the American view of Germany changed in the decade before World War I, as relations between the two states deteriorated. By the time the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Americans had come to see Germany as more autocratic and militaristic than its European rivals. Similarly, during the late 1930s, many Americans saw the Soviet Union as an evil state, partly in response to Josef Stalin's murderous internal policies and his infamous alliance with Nazi Germany in August 1939. Nevertheless, when the United States joined forces with the Soviet Union in late 1941 to fight against the Third Reich, the U.S. government began a massive public relations campaign to clean up the image of America's new ally and make it compatible with liberal ideals. The Soviet Union was now portrayed as a proto-democracy, and Stalin became “Uncle Joe.” How is it possible to get away with this contradiction between rhetoric and policy? Most Americans readily accept these rationalizations because liberalism is so deeply rooted in their culture. As a result, they find it easy to believe that they are acting according to cherished principles, rather than cold and calculated power considerations.",

    "text": "The rest of the chapters in this book are concerned mainly with answering six big questions about power. Chapter 2 lays out my theory of why states compete for power and why they pursue hegemony. In Chapters 3 and 4, I define power and explain how to measure it. I do this in order to lay the groundwork for testing my theory. It is impossible to determine whether states have behaved according to the dictates of offensive realism without knowing what power is and what different strategies states employ to maximize their share of world power. My starting point is to distinguish between potential power and actual military power, and then to argue that states care deeply about both kinds of power. Chapter 3 focuses on potential power, which involves mainly the size of a state's population and its wealth. Chapter 4 deals with actual military power. It is an especially long chapter because I make arguments about “the primacy of land power” and “the stopping power of water” that are novel and likely to be controversial. In Chapter 5, I discuss the strategies that great powers employ to gain and maintain power. This chapter includes a substantial discussion of the utility of war for acquiring power. I also focus on balancing and buck-passing, which are the main strategies that states employ when faced with a rival that threatens to upset the balance of power. In Chapters 6 and 7, I examine the historical record to see whether there is evidence to support the theory. Specifically, I compare the conduct of the great powers from 1792 to 1990 to see whether their behavior fits the predictions of offensive realism. In Chapter 8, I lay out a simple theory that explains when great powers balance and when they choose to buck-pass, and then I examine that theory against the historical record. Chapter 9 focuses on the causes of war. Here, too, I lay out a simple theory and then test it against the empirical record. Chapter 10 challenges the oft-made claim that international politics has been fundamentally transformed with the end of the Cold War, and that great powers no longer compete with each other for power. I briefly assess the theories underpinning that optimistic perspective, and then I look at how the great powers have behaved in Europe and Northeast Asia between 1991 and 2000. Finally, I make predictions about the likelihood of great-power conflict in these two important regions in the early twenty-first century.",

    "text": "Great powers, I argue, are always searching for opportunities to gain power over their rivals, with hegemony as their final goal. This perspective does not allow for status quo powers, except for the unusual state that achieves preponderance. Instead, the system is populated with great powers that have revisionist intentions at their core. This chapter presents a theory that explains this competition for power. Specifically, I attempt to show that there is a compelling logic behind my claim that great powers seek to maximize their share of world power. I do not, however, test offensive realism against the historical record in this chapter. That important task is reserved for later chapters. My explanation for why great powers vie with each other for power and strive for hegemony is derived from five assumptions about the international system. None of these assumptions alone mandates that states behave competitively. Taken together, however, they depict a world in which states have considerable reason to think and sometimes behave aggressively. In particular, the system encourages states to look for opportunities to maximize their power vis-à-vis other states. How important is it that these assumptions be realistic? Some social scientists argue that the assumptions that underpin a theory need not conform to reality. Indeed, the economist Milton Friedman maintains that the best theories “will be found to have assumptions that are wildly inaccurate descriptive representations of reality, and, in general, the more significant the theory, the more unrealistic the assumptions.” According to this view, the explanatory power of a theory is all that matters. If unrealistic assumptions lead to a theory that tells us a lot about how the world works, it is of no importance whether the underlying assumptions are realistic or not. I reject this view. Although I agree that explanatory power is the ultimate criterion for assessing theories, I also believe that a theory based on unrealistic or false assumptions will not explain much about how the world works. Sound theories are based on sound assumptions. Accordingly, each of these five assumptions is a reasonably accurate representation of an important aspect of life in the international system.",

    "text": "States in the international system aim to guarantee their own survival. Because other states are potential threats, and because there is no higher authority, states cannot depend on others for their own security. Each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and alone, and therefore it aims to provide for its own survival. This emphasis on self-help does not preclude states from forming alliances, but alliances are only temporary marriages of convenience. States operating in a self-help world almost always act according to their own self-interest and do not subordinate their interests to the interests of other states, or to the interests of the so-called international community. The reason is simple: it pays to be selfish in a self-help world. This is true in the short term as well as in the long term, because if a state loses in the short run, it might not be around for the long haul. Apprehensive about the ultimate intentions of other states, and aware that they operate in a self-help system, states quickly understand that the best way to ensure their survival is to be the most powerful state in the system. The stronger a state is relative to its potential rivals, the less likely it is that any of those rivals will attack it and threaten its survival. Weaker states will be reluctant to pick fights with more powerful states because the weaker states are likely to suffer military defeat. The ideal situation is to be the hegemon in the system. Survival would then be almost guaranteed. Consequently, states pay close attention to how power is distributed among them, and they make a special effort to maximize their share of world power. Specifically, they look for opportunities to alter the balance of power by acquiring additional increments of power at the expense of potential rivals. States employ a variety of means—economic, diplomatic, and military—to shift the balance of power in their favor, even if doing so makes other states suspicious or even hostile. Because one state's gain in power is another state's loss, great powers tend to have a zero-sum mentality when dealing with each other.",

    "text": "The claim that states maximize relative power is tantamount to arguing that states are disposed to think offensively toward other states, even though their ultimate motive is simply to survive. Even when a great power achieves a distinct military advantage over its rivals, it continues looking for chances to gain more power. The pursuit of power stops only when hegemony is achieved. Given the difficulty of determining how much power is enough for today and tomorrow, great powers recognize that the best way to ensure their security is to achieve hegemony now, thus eliminating any possibility of a challenge by another great power. But even if a great power does not have the wherewithal to achieve hegemony, it will still act offensively to amass as much power as it can, because states are almost always better off with more rather than less power. States not only look for opportunities to take advantage of one another, they also work to ensure that other states do not take advantage of them. This inexorably leads to a world of constant security competition, where states are willing to lie, cheat, and use brute force if it helps them gain advantage over their rivals. The security dilemma reflects the basic logic of offensive realism. The essence of the dilemma is that the measures a state takes to increase its own security usually decrease the security of other states. Thus, it is difficult for a state to increase its own chances of survival without threatening the survival of other states. The implication is clear: the best way for a state to survive in anarchy is to take advantage of other states and gain power at their expense. The best defense is a good offense. Since this message is widely understood, ceaseless security competition ensues.",

A great power that has a marked power advantage over its rivals is likely to behave more aggressively, because it has the capability as well as the incentive to do so. By contrast, great powers facing powerful opponents will be less inclined to consider offensive action and more concerned with defending the existing balance of power from threats by their more powerful opponents. States might also have the capability to gain advantage over a rival power but nevertheless decide that the perceived costs of offense are too high. Great powers are not mindless aggressors; they think carefully about the balance of power and about how other states will react to their moves. They weigh the costs and risks of offense against the likely benefits.  Great powers miscalculate from time to time because they invariably make important decisions on the basis of imperfect information. Potential adversaries have incentives to misrepresent their own strength or weakness, and to conceal their true aims. Even if disinformation was not a problem, great powers are often unsure about how their own military forces, as well as the adversary's, will perform on the battlefield.

    "text": "Great powers, as I have emphasized, strive to gain power over their rivals and hopefully become hegemons. Once a state achieves that exalted position, it becomes a status quo power. More needs to be said, however, about the meaning of hegemony. A hegemon is a state that is so powerful that it dominates all the other states in the system.31 No other state has the military wherewithal to put up a serious fight against it. In essence, a hegemon is the only great power in the system. A state that is substantially more powerful than the other great powers in the system is not a hegemon, because it faces, by definition, other great powers. The United Kingdom in the mid-nineteenth century, for example, is sometimes called a hegemon. But it was not a hegemon, because there were four other great powers in Europe at the time—Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia—and the United Kingdom did not dominate them in any meaningful way. In fact, during that period, the United Kingdom considered France to be a serious threat to the balance of power. Europe in the nineteenth century was multipolar, not unipolar. \nHegemony means domination of the system, which is usually interpreted to mean the entire world. It is possible, however, to apply the concept of a system more narrowly and use it to describe particular regions, such as Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. Thus, one can distinguish between global hegemons, which dominate the world, and regional hegemons, which dominate distinct geographical areas. The United States has been a regional hegemon in the Western Hemisphere for at least the past one hundred years. No other state in the Americas has sufficient military might to challenge it, which is why the United States is widely recognized as the only great power in its region.",

    "text": "My argument, which I develop at length in subsequent chapters, is that except for the unlikely event wherein one state achieves clear-cut nuclear superiority, it is virtually impossible for any state to achieve global hegemony. The principal impediment to world domination is the difficulty of projecting power across the world’s oceans onto the territory of a rival great power. The United States, for example, is the most powerful state on the planet today. But it does not dominate Europe and Northeast Asia the way it does the Western Hemisphere, and it has no intention of trying to conquer and control those distant regions, mainly because of the stopping power of water. Indeed, there is reason to think that the American military commitment to Europe and Northeast Asia might wither away over the next decade. In short, there has never been a global hegemon, and there is not likely to be one anytime soon. The best outcome a great power can hope for is to be a regional hegemon and possibly control another region that is nearby and accessible over land.\n\nStates that achieve regional hegemony seek to prevent great powers in other regions from duplicating their feat. Regional hegemons, in other words, do not want peers. Thus the United States, for example, played a key role in preventing imperial Japan, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union from gaining regional supremacy. Regional hegemons attempt to check aspiring hegemons in other regions because they fear that a rival great power that dominates its own region will be an especially powerful foe that is essentially free to cause trouble in the fearful great power’s backyard. Regional hegemons prefer that there be at least two great powers located together in other regions, because their proximity will force them to concentrate their attention on each other rather than on the distant hegemon.",

    "text": "In sum, the ideal situation for any great power is to be the only regional hegemon in the world. That state would be a status quo power, and it would go to considerable lengths to preserve the existing distribution of power. The United States is in that enviable position today; it dominates the Western Hemisphere and there is no hegemon in any other area of the world. But if a regional hegemon is confronted with a peer competitor, it would no longer be a status quo power. Indeed, it would go to considerable lengths to weaken and maybe even destroy its distant rival. Of course, both regional hegemons would be motivated by that logic, which would make for a fierce security competition between them. That great powers fear each other is a central aspect of life in the international system. But as noted, the level of fear varies from case to case. For example, the Soviet Union worried much less about Germany in 1930 than it did in 1939. How much states fear each other matters greatly because the amount of fear between them largely determines the severity of their security competition, as well as the probability that they will fight a war. The more profound the fear is, the more intense is the security competition, and the more likely is war. The logic is straightforward: a scared state will look especially hard for ways to enhance its security, and it will be disposed to pursue risky policies to achieve that end. Therefore, it is important to understand what causes states to fear each other more or less intensely. Fear among great powers derives from the fact that they invariably have some offensive military capability that they can use against each other, and the fact that one can never be certain that other states do not intend to use that power against oneself. Moreover, because states operate in an anarchic system, there is no night watchman to whom they can turn for help if another great power attacks them. Although anarchy and uncertainty about other states’ intentions create an irreducible level of fear among states that leads to power-maximizing behavior, they cannot account for why sometimes that level of fear is greater than at other times. The reason is that anarchy and the difficulty of discerning state intentions are constant facts of life, and constants cannot explain variation.",

    "text": "The capability that states have to threaten each other, however, varies from case to case, and it is the key factor that drives fear levels up and down. Specifically, the more power a state possesses, the more fear it generates among its rivals. Germany, for example, was much more powerful at the end of the 1930s than it was at the decade’s beginning, which is why the Soviets became increasingly fearful of Germany over the course of that decade. This discussion of how power affects fear prompts the question, What is power? It is important to distinguish between potential and actual power. A state’s potential power is based on the size of its population and the level of its wealth. These two assets are the main building blocks of military power. Wealthy rivals with large populations can usually build formidable military forces. A state’s actual power is embedded mainly in its army and the air and naval forces that directly support it. Armies are the central ingredient of military power because they are the principal instrument for conquering and controlling territory—the paramount political objective in a world of territorial states. In short, the key component of military might, even in the nuclear age, is land power. Power considerations affect the intensity of fear among states in three main ways. First, rival states that possess nuclear forces that can survive a nuclear attack and retaliate against it are likely to fear each other less than if these same states had no nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, for example, the level of fear between the superpowers probably would have been substantially greater if nuclear weapons had not been invented. The logic here is simple: because nuclear weapons can inflict devastating destruction on a rival state in a short period, nuclear-armed rivals are going to be reluctant to fight with each other, which means that each side will have less reason to fear the other than would otherwise be the case. But as the Cold War demonstrates, this does not mean that war between nuclear powers is no longer thinkable; they still have reason to fear each other. Second, when great powers are separated by large bodies of water, they usually do not have much offensive capability against each other, regardless of the relative size of their armies. Large bodies of water are formidable obstacles that cause significant power-projection problems for attacking armies.",

The key relationship, however, is the power gap between the potential hegemon and the second most powerful state in the system: there must be a marked gap between them. To qualify as a potential hegemon, a state must have—by some reasonably large margin—the most formidable army as well as the most latent power among all the states located in its region. Bipolarity is the power configuration that produces the least amount of fear among the great powers, although not a negligible amount by any means. Fear tends to be less acute in bipolarity because there is usually a rough balance of power between the two major states in the system. Multipolar systems without a potential hegemon, what I call \"balanced multipolarity,\" are still likely to have power asymmetries among their members, although these asymmetries will not be as pronounced as the gaps created by the presence of an aspiring hegemon. Therefore, balanced multipolarity is likely to generate less fear than unbalanced multipolarity, but more fear than bipolarity.\n\nThis discussion of how the level of fear between great powers varies with changes in the distribution of power, not with assessments about each other's intentions, raises a related point. When a state surveys its environment to determine which states pose a threat to its survival, it focuses mainly on the offensive capabilities of potential rivals, not their intentions. As emphasized earlier, intentions are ultimately unknowable, so states worried about their survival must make worst-case assumptions about their rivals' intentions. Capabilities, however, not only can be measured but also determine whether or not a rival state is a serious threat. In short, great powers balance against capabilities, not intentions.\n\nGreat powers obviously balance against states with formidable military forces because that offensive military capability is the tangible threat to their survival. But great powers also pay careful attention to how much latent power rival states control because rich and populous states usually can and do build powerful armies. Thus, great powers tend to fear states with large populations and rapidly expanding economies, even if these states have not yet translated their wealth into military might.",

    "section": "The Hierarchy of State Goals",
    "text": "Survival is the number one goal of great powers, according to my theory. In practice, however, states pursue non-security goals as well. For example, great powers invariably seek greater economic prosperity to enhance the welfare of their citizenry. They sometimes seek to promote a particular ideology abroad, as happened during the Cold War when the United States tried to spread democracy around the world and the Soviet Union tried to sell communism. National unification is another goal that sometimes motivates states, as it did with Prussia and Italy in the nineteenth century and Germany after the Cold War. Great powers also occasionally try to foster human rights around the globe. States might pursue any of these, as well as several other non-security goals.\n\nOffensive realism certainly recognizes that great powers might pursue these non-security goals, but it has little to say about them, save for one important point: states can pursue them as long as the requisite behavior does not conflict with balance-of-power logic, which is often the case. Indeed, the pursuit of these non-security goals sometimes complements the hunt for relative power. For example, Nazi Germany expanded into eastern Europe for both ideological and realist reasons, and the superpowers competed with each other during the Cold War for similar reasons. Furthermore, greater economic prosperity invariably means greater wealth, which has significant implications for security because wealth is the foundation of military power. Wealthy states can afford powerful military forces, which enhance a state's prospects for survival. As the political economist Jacob Viner noted more than fifty years ago, \"there is a long-run harmony between wealth and power.\" National unification is another goal that usually complements the pursuit of power. For example, the unified German state that emerged in 1871 was more powerful than the Prussian state it replaced.",

    "text": "The claim is sometimes made that great powers can transcend realist logic by working together to build an international order that fosters peace and justice. World peace, it would appear, can only enhance a state's prosperity and security. America's political leaders paid considerable lip service to this line of argument over the course of the twentieth century. President Clinton, for example, told an audience at the United Nations in September 1993 that \"at the birth of this organization 48 years ago… a generation of gifted leaders from many nations stepped forward to organize the world's efforts on behalf of security and prosperity…. Now history has granted to us a moment of even greater opportunity…. Let us resolve that we will dream larger…. Let us ensure that the world we pass to our children is healthier, safer and more abundant than the one we inhabit today.\"\n\nThis rhetoric notwithstanding, great powers do not work together to promote world order for its own sake. Instead, each seeks to maximize its own share of world power, which is likely to clash with the goal of creating and sustaining stable international orders. This is not to say that great powers never aim to prevent wars and keep the peace. On the contrary, they work hard to deter wars in which they would be the likely victim. In such cases, however, state behavior is driven largely by narrow calculations about relative power, not by a commitment to build a world order independent of a state's own interests. The United States, for example, devoted enormous resources to deterring the Soviet Union from starting a war in Europe during the Cold War, not because of some deep-seated commitment to promoting peace around the world, but because American leaders feared that a Soviet victory would lead to a dangerous shift in the balance of power. The particular international order that obtains at any time is mainly a by-product of the self-interested behavior of the system's great powers. The configuration of the system, in other words, is the unintended consequence of great-power security competition, not the result of states acting together to organize peace.",

    "section": "Cooperation Among States",
    "text": "One might conclude from the preceding discussion that my theory does not allow for any cooperation among the great powers. But this conclusion would be wrong. States can cooperate, although cooperation is sometimes difficult to achieve and always difficult to sustain. Two factors inhibit cooperation: considerations about relative gains and concern about cheating. Ultimately, great powers live in a fundamentally competitive world where they view each other as real, or at least potential, enemies, and they therefore look to gain power at each other's expense.\n\nAny two states contemplating cooperation must consider how profits or gains will be distributed between them. They can think about the division in terms of either absolute or relative gains (recall the distinction made earlier between pursuing either absolute power or relative power; the concept here is the same). With absolute gains, each side is concerned with maximizing its own profits and cares little about how much the other side gains or loses in the deal. Each side cares about the other only to the extent that the other side's behavior affects its own prospects for achieving maximum profits. With relative gains, on the other hand, each side considers not only its own individual gain, but also how well it fares compared to the other side. Because great powers care deeply about the balance of power, their thinking focuses on relative gains when they consider cooperating with other states. For sure, each state tries to maximize its absolute gains; still, it is more important for a state to make sure that it does no worse, and perhaps better, than the other state in any agreement. Cooperation is more difficult to achieve, however, when states are attuned to relative gains rather than absolute gains. This is because states concerned about absolute gains have to make sure that if the pie is expanding, they are getting at least some portion of the increase, whereas states that worry about relative gains must pay careful attention to how the pie is divided, which complicates cooperative efforts.\n\nConcerns about cheating also hinder cooperation. Great powers are often reluctant to enter into cooperative agreements for fear that the other side will cheat on the agreement and gain a significant advantage. This concern is especially acute in the military realm, causing a “special peril of defection,” because the nature of military weaponry allows for rapid shifts in the balance of power. Such a development could create a window of opportunity for the state that cheats to inflict a decisive defeat on its victim. These barriers to cooperation notwithstanding, great powers do cooperate in a realist world. Balance-of-power logic often causes great powers to form alliances and cooperate against common enemies. The United Kingdom, France, and Russia, for example, were allies against Germany before and during World War I. States sometimes cooperate to gang up on a third state, as Germany and the Soviet Union did against Poland in 1939. More recently, Serbia and Croatia agreed to conquer and divide Bosnia between them, although the United States and its European allies prevented them from executing their agreement. Rivals as well as allies cooperate. After all, deals can be struck that roughly reflect the distribution of power and satisfy concerns about cheating. The various arms control agreements signed by the superpowers during the Cold War illustrate this point.",

    "text": "Power lies at the heart of international politics, yet there is considerable disagreement about what power is and how to measure it. In this chapter and the next, I define power and offer rough but reliable ways to measure it. Specifically, I argue that power is based on the particular material capabilities that a state possesses. The balance of power, therefore, is a function of tangible assets—such as armored divisions and nuclear weapons—that each great power controls. States have two kinds of power: latent power and military power. These two forms of power are closely related but not synonymous, because they are derived from different kinds of assets. Latent power refers to the socio-economic ingredients that go into building military power; it is largely based on a state’s wealth and the overall size of its population. Great powers need money, technology, and personnel to build military forces and to fight wars, and a state’s latent power refers to the raw potential it can draw on when competing with rival states. In international politics, however, a state’s effective power is ultimately a function of its military forces and how they compare with the military forces of rival states. The United States and the Soviet Union were the most powerful states in the world during the Cold War because their military establishments dwarfed those of other states. Japan is not a great power today, even though it has a large and wealthy economy, because it has a small and relatively weak military, and it is heavily dependent on the United States for its security. Therefore, the balance of power is largely synonymous with the balance of military power. I define power largely in military terms because offensive realism emphasizes that force is the ultima ratio of international politics. Military power is based largely on the size and strength of a state’s army and its supporting air and naval forces. Even in a nuclear world, armies are the core ingredient of military power. Independent naval forces and strategic air forces are not suited for conquering territory, nor are they much good by themselves at coercing other states into making territorial concessions. They certainly can contribute to a successful military campaign, but great-power wars are won mainly on the ground. The most powerful states, therefore, are those that possess the most formidable land forces. This privileging of military power notwithstanding, states care greatly about latent power, because abundant wealth and a large population are prerequisites for building formidable military forces. During the Cold War, for example, American leaders worried about Soviet economic growth and were especially alarmed by Soviet scientific achievements (such as the Sputnik satellite launched in 1957), which they saw as signs that the Soviet Union’s latent capabilities might one day exceed those of the United States. Today, the United States is increasingly worried about China, not because of its military, which is still relatively weak, but because China has more than 1.2 billion people and a rapidly modernizing economy. Should China become especially wealthy, it could readily become a military superpower and challenge the United States. These examples show that states pay careful attention to the balance of latent power as well as the balance of military power.",

A comparison of Table 3.1 with Table 3.2 indicates that the United Kingdom and Russia led the other European great powers in terms of GNP during most of the period. In fact, this conclusion is wrong. The United Kingdom certainly had more latent power than any other European state during the nineteenth century, especially in the middle decades of that century, which are often called the \"Pax Brittanica.\" But the Russian economy was in an anemic state from at least the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s. Russia had relatively little latent power during this period, which explains in good part why its military suffered crushing defeats in the Crimean War (1853-56), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), and World War I (1914-17). In short, GNP fails to capture the potentially sharp difference in latent power between industrialized and semi-industrialized states.\nThe same problem arises when GNP is used to compare the latent power of contemporary China with Japan and the United States. Despite its rapid economic development over the past two decades, China is still a semi-industrialized state. Roughly 18 percent of its wealth remains tied up in agriculture. Japan and the United States, on the other hand, are highly industrialized states; only 2 percent of their wealth is in agriculture. China, however, has almost five times as many people as the United States and about ten times as many people as Japan. Therefore, the balance of latent power among those three states will be biased in China's favor if GNP is the chosen measure. This problem is likely to go away with time, because China's agricultural base will continue to shrink (it accounted for 30 percent of wealth in 1980) as its economy modernizes. But for now, it must be factored into any analysis that uses GNP to measure China's latent power.\nThus, GNP is sometimes a sound measure of latent power, whereas at other times it is not. In those latter cases, one can either find an alternative indicator that does a better job of capturing latent power, or use GNP but add the appropriate qualifiers. In measuring the balance of latent power for the long historical period from 1792 to 2000, it is impossible to find one simple but reliable indicator of wealth. For one thing, there is little economic data available for the years between 1792 and 1815. The main place this causes problems is in Chapter 8, when the question arises of whether Napoleonic France had more latent power than its great-power rivals, especially the United Kingdom. I attempt to deal with the problem by describing what historians say about the relative wealth of the United Kingdom and France, and also by looking at population size, the other building block of military power. This information provides a rough but probably accurate picture of the balance of latent power during the Napoleonic years.",

    "text": "I measure latent power between 1816 and 1960 with a straightforward composite indicator that accords equal weight to a state's iron and steel production and its energy consumption. That indicator, which effectively represents a state's industrial might, does a good job of capturing both mobilizable wealth and level of technological development for that lengthy period. From 1960 to the present, GNP is used to measure wealth. I switched indicators in 1960 for two reasons. First, my composite indicator is not useful after 1970, because the role of steel in the major industrial economies began to decline sharply around that time. Thus, a different measure of potential power is needed for the years after 1970; GNP was the obvious alternative. Second, the best available GNP figures for the Soviet Union and the United States, the two great powers in the system at the time, start in 1960 and run through the end of the Cold War. So I employ GNP for the last thirty years of the Cold War (1960-90) and the first decade of the post-Cold War era (1991-2000), taking due note of the limits of GNP as an indicator of China's latent power today.\nA brief look at the rise and decline of three European great powers during the last two centuries buttresses my claim that wealth underpins military power and that wealth by itself is a good indicator of latent power. The profound change that took place in the balance of power between France and Germany (Prussia before 1870) during the nineteenth century, as well as Russia's changing position in the balance of power between 1800 and 2000, shows the crucial role of wealth in determining power. Napoleonic France was the most powerful state in Europe between 1793 and 1815; in fact, it came close to conquering the entire continent. Prussia was probably the weakest of the great powers at that time. It was decisively defeated by Napoleon's armies in 1806 and was effectively knocked out of the European balance of power until 1813, when it took advantage of France's devastating defeat in Russia to join the balancing coalition that finally finished off Napoleon at Waterloo in June of 1815. By 1900, however, the tables had turned almost completely, and Wilhelmine Germany was emerging as Europe's next potential hegemon, while France needed alliance partners to help check its German neighbor. France and its allies subsequently went to war in 1914 and 1939 to prevent Germany from dominating Europe.",

    "text": "Changes in the relative wealth of France and Germany during the hundred years after Waterloo largely account for the shift in military power between them. As is clear from Table 3.2, France was considerably wealthier than Prussia from 1816 until the late 1860s, when Otto von Bismarck transformed Prussia into Germany. In fact, Germany first gained an edge over France in steel production in 1870, the year that the Franco-Prussian War broke out. From that point until the start of World War I, the wealth gap between France and Germany steadily widened in the latter's favor. By 1913, Germany was roughly three times as wealthy as France. This marked change in the relative wealth of France and Germany was due in part to the fact that Germany industrialized more rapidly than France in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The main cause, however, was a significant shift in the size of their respective populations, which illustrates how changes in wealth also capture changes in population. The data in Table 3.2 show that France had about a 2.5:1 advantage in population over Prussia in 1830, but that by 1913 Germany had gained roughly a 1.7:1 population advantage over France. This demographic flip-flop was the result of two factors. The French birthrate in the nineteenth century was especially low, while the German birthrate was among the highest in Europe. Furthermore, the unified German state that Bismarck built around Prussia had a substantially larger population than Prussia itself. For example, Prussia had 19.3 million people in 1865, whereas Germany had 34.6 million people in 1870.",

Russia was probably Napoleonic France's most formidable military rival. Indeed, the Russian army played the key role in driving Napoleon from power between 1812 and 1815. There was even fear in the wake of France's collapse that Russia might try to dominate Europe. But Russia did not make a run at hegemony after 1815. Instead, its position in the European balance of power declined over the next hundred years. As noted, Russia fought three wars against other great powers during that period and suffered humiliating defeats in each: the Crimean War, the Russo-Japanese War, and World War I. A comparison of Russia's performance in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II shows how weak Russia had become by 1914. Each conflict was dominated by a potential hegemon that invaded Russia. Napoleonic France and Nazi Germany were able to concentrate the bulk of their armies against Russia, although each had to maintain some forces in other theaters as well. Nevertheless, Russia decisively defeated both of those aggressors. During World War I, however, Germany deployed approximately two-thirds of its fighting forces on the western front against the French and British armies, while the remaining one-third fought against the Russian army on the eastern front. Although the German army was fighting the Russian army with its best hand tied behind its back, it still managed to defeat Russia and knock it out of the war, a feat that neither Napoleon nor Hitler could accomplish with both hands free. Russia's decline reached its nadir in the years immediately after World War I, when Poland invaded the newly created Soviet Union.",

Starting in the early 1930s, however, the Soviets began to build a formidable military machine, which beat the Japanese army in a brief war in 1939, and then defeated the vaunted German Wehrmacht in World War II. The Soviet Union was so powerful after 1945 that only the United States could prevent it from dominating all of Europe. The Soviet Union remained a formidable military power for more than forty years after Hitler's defeat, until it broke apart into fifteen separate states in 1991. The ups and downs in Russian military power over the past two centuries can be explained in good part by changes in Russia's position in the hierarchy of wealth. Although we do not have much data on the wealth of the great powers between 1800 and 1815, it seems clear that the United Kingdom and France had the most powerful economies in Europe. Nevertheless, it does not appear that Russia was decidedly less wealthy than either the United Kingdom or France in those years. But even if that were the case, the Russian economy was still able to support the Russian military in its fight against Napoleon, although Russia received subsidies from the United Kingdom at various points in the conflict. In short, there is no evidence that the French army had an important advantage over the Russian army because France was wealthier than Russia. Russia's position in the balance of wealth declined sharply over the seventy-five years following Napoleon's defeat (see Table 3.3), mainly because Russia industrialized much more slowly than did the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Russia's lack of industrial might had important military consequences.",

To rectify that asymmetry, France, which was allied with Russia against Germany, subsidized the building of Russian railroads. In essence, by the eve of World War I, Russia was a semi-industrialized state about to go to war against a highly industrialized Germany. Not surprisingly, Russia's war economy could not support its army's needs. Rifle production was so woeful that in 1915, \"only part of the army was armed, with others waiting for casualties to get arms.\" Artillery was so lacking by as late as 1917 that Germany had 6,819 heavy pieces, while Russia had only 1,430. Jonathan Adelman estimates that at best only 30 percent of the Russian army's equipment needs were met during the war. Another way to look at Russia's problem is to consider the following comparisons for the period from 1914 through 1917: 1) Germany produced 47,300 airplanes; Russia produced 3,500. 2) Germany produced 280,000 machine guns; Russia produced 28,000. 3) Germany produced 64,000 artillery pieces; Russia produced 11,700. 4) Germany produced 8,547,000 rifles; Russia produced 3,300,000. Thus, it is hardly surprising that less than half the German army was able to defeat the entire Russian army in World War I.",

Thus, the Soviet war economy was able to compete effectively with the German war economy in World War II. Indeed, the Soviets outproduced the Germans in virtually every category of military weaponry for the years from 1941 through 1945: 1) The Soviet Union produced 102,600 airplanes; Germany produced 76,200. 2) The Soviet Union produced 1,437,900 machine guns; Germany produced 1,048,500. 3) The Soviet Union produced 11,820,500 rifles; Germany produced 7,845,700. 4) The Soviet Union produced 92,600 tanks; Germany produced 41,500. 5) The Soviet Union produced 350,300 mortars; Germany 68,900. No wonder the Red Army defeated the Wehrmacht on the eastern front. Although the Soviet economy suffered enormous damage in World War II (see Table 3.4), the Soviet Union emerged from that conflict with the most powerful economy in Europe. Not surprisingly, it had the military might in the late 1940s to dominate the region. But the United States, which was far wealthier than the Soviet Union (see Table 3.5), was determined to prevent the Soviets from becoming a European hegemon. In the first three decades after World War II, the Soviet economy grew rapidly as it recovered from that war, and the wealth gap with its bipolar rival narrowed considerably. It appeared that General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev's boast in 1956 that the Soviet Union would \"bury\" the United States might prove true.",

Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov was dismissed as the chief of the Soviet general staff in the summer of 1 984 for saying pub­ licly that Soviet industry was falling badly behind American industry, which meant that Soviet weaponry would soon be inferior to American weaponry.54 Soviet leaders recognized the gravity of the situation and tried to fix the problem. But their economic and political reforms went awry, touching off a crisis of nationalism, which not only allowed the United States to win the Cold War but shortly thereafter led to the disso­ lution of the Soviet Union. This discussion of the importance of wealth for building military power might suggest that the distribution of latent power among states should roughly reflect the distribution of military power, and therefore it should be feasible to equate the two kinds of power. My argument that great powers aim to maximize their share of world power might reinforce that notion, since it seems to imply that states will translate their wealth into military power at roughly the same rate. But that is not the case, and thus economic might is not always a sound indicator of military might.

The United States was much wealthier than the Soviet Union from the start to the finish of that conflict, but that was especially true between 1 945 and 1 955, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact were formed (see Table 3.5). Yet the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy in Europe, and Japan in Asia, opted to join an American-led coalition aimed at containing the Soviet Union. If wealth were an accurate measure of power. those less powerful states should have joined forces with the Soviet Union to check the United States, not the other way around.

And third, great powers buy different kinds of military forces, and those choices also have implications for the military balance.",

    "text": "Diminishing Returns Wealthy states sometimes do not build additional military forces-even though they could in principle afford them-because they recognize that doing so would not give them a strategic advantage over their rivals. Spending more makes little sense when a state's defense effon is subject to diminishing returns (that is, if its capabilities are already on the •flat of the curve\") or if opponents can easily match the effon and maintain the balance of power. If launching an arms race is unlikely to leave the initia­ tor in a better strategic position. in short, it will sit tight and wait for more favorable circumstances. The United Kingdom in the nineteenth century is an example of a state that hit the flat of the curve in terms of the military payoff from additional defense spending. Between 1 820 and 1 890. the United Kingdom was far and away the wealthiest state in Europe. It never controlled less than 45 percent of great-power wealth during those seven decades, and in the middle two decades of the century ( 1 840-60), it possessed close to 70 per­ cent (see Table 3.3). France, which was the United Kingdom's closest com­ petitor during those twenty years. never controlled more than 16 percent of European industrial might. No other European great power has ever enjoyed such an overwhelming economic advantage over its rivals. If wealth alone was a sound indicator of power, the United Kingdom would probably have been Europe's first hegemonic power, or at least a potential hegemon that the other great powers would have had to balance against. But it is apparent from the historical record that this was not the case.\" Despite its abundant wealth, the United Kingdom did not build a military force that posed a serious threat to France, Germany, or Russia. Indeed, Wealth and Power 77 the United Kingdom spent a much smaller percentage of its wealth on defense between 1 8 1 5 and 1 9 1 4 than any of its great-power rivals.57 The United Kingdom was just another state in the European balance of power. Consequently, the other great powers never formed a balancing coalition to contain it, as happened with Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union.58 The United Kingdom did not raise a large army and attempt to conquer Europe because it would have faced huge problems trying to project power across the English Channel and onto the European continent. Large bodies of water, as discussed in the next chapter, tend to rob armies of offensive capability. At the same time, the stopping power of water made it especially difficult for any continental power to cross the channel and invade the United Kingdom. Thus, the United Kingdom wisely con­ cluded that it made no strategic sense to build a large army that was of lit­ tle utility for offense and unnecessary for defending the homeland.",

    "text": "The Allies' strategic bombing campaign might well have hurt German war production in the last months of the war, but the Soviet Union was turning out greater numbers of weapons than Germany long before the bombing campaign began to have any significant effect on German output. The Soviet effort was also helped by the U.S. Lend-Lease program, although that aid accounts for only a small percentage of Soviet output. The main reason that the Soviet Union produced so many more weapons than Germany is that the Soviets did a much better job of rationalizing their economy to meet the demands of total war.  The Soviet (and American) economy was far better organized than the German economy for mass producing weaponry. The final reason why wealth is not a reliable indicator of military might is that states can buy different kinds of military power, and how they build their armed forces has consequences for the balance of power. The key issue is whether a state has a large army with significant power-projection capability. But not all states spend the same percentage of their defense dollars on their army, and not all armies have the same power-projection capabilities. During the period from 1870 to 1914, for example, when great powers spent their defense dollars on either their army or their navy, the United Kingdom earmarked a significantly larger share of its military budget to its navy than did either France or Germany. These different patterns of defense spending made good strategic sense, since the United Kingdom was an insular state that needed a large and powerful navy to protect its seaborne commerce and to transport its army across the large bodies of water that separated it from the European continent as well as the vast British empire. France and Germany, on the other hand, were continental powers with much smaller empires, so they were less dependent on their navies than was the United Kingdom. They were also more dependent on their armies than the United Kingdom, however, because they had to worry constantly about an invasion by a neighboring state. The United Kingdom was much less concerned about being attacked, because it was separated from the other European great powers by the English Channel, a formidable barrier to invasion. Consequently, the United Kingdom had a much smaller army than did either France or Germany. Furthermore, the small British army had little power-projection capability against the other European great powers, because the same geographical obstacle that made it difficult for rivals to invade the United Kingdom made it difficult for the United Kingdom to invade the continent.\nPower in international politics is largely a product of the military forces that a state possesses. Great powers, however, can acquire different kinds of fighting forces, and how much of each kind they buy has important implications for the balance of power. This chapter analyzes the four types of military power among which states choose—independent sea power, strategic airpower, land power, and nuclear weapons—to determine how to weigh them against each other and come up with a useful measure of power.  First, land power is the dominant form of military power in the modern world. A state's power is largely embedded in its army and the air and naval forces that support those ground forces. Simply put, the most powerful states possess the most formidable armies. Therefore, measuring the balance of land power by itself should provide a rough but sound indicator of the relative might of rival great powers. Second, large bodies of water profoundly limit the power-projection capabilities of land forces. When opposing armies must cross a large expanse of water such as the Atlantic Ocean or the English Channel to attack each other, neither army is likely to have much offensive capability against its rival, regardless of the size and quality of the opposing armies. The stopping power of water is of great significance not just because it is a central aspect of land power, but also because it has important consequences for the concept of hegemony. Specifically, the presence of oceans on much of the earth's surface makes it impossible for any state to achieve global hegemony. Not even the world's most powerful state can conquer distant regions that can be reached only by ship. Thus, great powers can aspire to dominate only the region in which they are located, and possibly an adjacent region that can be reached over land.",

    "section": "The Primacy of Land Power/Conquest vs. Coercion",
    "text": "For more than a century strategists have debated which form of military power dominates the outcome of war. I argue that land power is the decisive military instrument. Wars are won by big battalions, not by armadas in the air or on the sea. The strongest power is the state with the strongest army. One might argue that nuclear weapons greatly diminish the importance of land power, either by rendering great-power war obsolete or by making the nuclear balance the essential component of military power in a competitive world.  Great-power war is less likely in a nuclear world, but great powers still compete for security even under the nuclear shadow, sometimes intensely, and war between them remains a real possibility. The United States and the Soviet Union, for example, waged an unremitting security competition for forty-five years, despite the presence of nuclear weapons on both sides. Moreover, save for the unlikely scenario in which one great power achieves nuclear superiority, the nuclear balance matters little for determining relative power. Even in a nuclear world, armies and the air and naval forces that support them are the core ingredient of military power. The alliance patterns that formed during the Cold War are evidence that land power is the principal component of military might. In a world dominated by two great powers, we would expect other key states to join forces with the weaker great power to contain the stronger one. Throughout the Cold War, not only was the United States much wealthier than the Soviet Union, but it also enjoyed a significant advantage in naval forces, strategic bombers, and nuclear warheads. Nevertheless, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and eventually China considered the Soviet Union, not the United States, to be the most powerful state in the system. Indeed, those states allied with the United States against the Soviet Union because they feared the Soviet army, not the American army. Moreover, there is little concern about a Russian threat today—even though Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons—because the Russian army is weak and in no position to launch a major ground offensive. Should it recover and become a formidable fighting force again, the United States and its European allies would start worrying about a new Russian threat. This chapter comprises eight sections. I compare the different kinds of conventional military power in the first four sections, aiming to show that land power dominates independent sea power and strategic airpower. In the first section, I describe these different kinds of military power more fully and explain why land power is the main instrument for winning wars. In the next two sections, I discuss the various missions that navies and air forces perform and then consider the evidence on how independent naval and air forces have affected the outcomes of great-power wars. The role of land power in modern military history is examined in the fourth section. The fifth section analyzes how large bodies of water sharply curtail the power-projection capabilities of armies and thus shift the balance of land power in important ways. The impact of nuclear weapons on military power is discussed in the sixth section. I then describe how to measure land power in the seventh section, which is followed by a short conclusion that describes some implications for international stability that follow from my analysis of power. Land power is centered around armies, but it also includes the air and naval forces that support them. For example, navies transport armies across large bodies of water, and sometimes they attempt to project ground forces onto hostile beaches. Air forces also transport armies, but more important, they aid armies by delivering firepower from the skies. These air and naval missions, however, are directly assisting the army, not acting independently of it. Thus, these missions fit under the rubric of land power. Armies are of paramount importance in warfare because they are the main military instrument for conquering and controlling land, which is the supreme political objective in a world of territorial states. Naval and air forces are simply not suited for conquering territory.",

    "text": "Navies can perform three power-projection missions where they are directly supporting the army, not acting independently. Amphibious assault takes place when a navy moves an army across a large body of water and lands it on territory controlled by a rival great power. The attacking forces meet armed resistance either when they arrive at their landing zones or shortly thereafter. Their aim is to engage and defeat the defender's main armies, and to conquer some portion, if not all, of its territory. The Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, is an example of an amphibious assault. Amphibious landings, in contrast, occur when the seaborne forces meet hardly any resistance when they land in enemy territory and are able to establish a beachhead and move well inland before engaging enemy forces. The insertion of British troops into French-controlled Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars, discussed below, is an example of an amphibious landing; the landing of German army units in Norway in the spring of 1940 is another. Troop transport by a navy involves moving ground forces across an ocean and landing them on territory controlled by friendly forces, from where they go into combat against the enemy army. The navy effectively serves as a ferry service. The American navy performed this mission in World War I, when it moved troops from the United States to France, and again in World War II, when it moved troops from the United States to the United Kingdom. These different kinds of amphibious operations are considered below, when I discuss how water limits the striking power of armies. Suffice it to say here that invasion from the sea against territory defended by a rival great power is usually a daunting task. Troop transport is a much easier mission.\nThere are also two ways that navies can be used independently to project power against another state. In naval bombardment, enemy cities or selected military targets, usually along a rival's coast, are hit with sustained firepower from guns or missiles on ships and submarines, or by aircraft flying from carriers. The aim is to coerce the adversary either by punishing its cities or by shifting the military balance against it. This is not a serious strategy; naval bombardment is pinprick warfare, and it has little effect on the target state. Although navies often bombarded enemy ports in the age of sail (1500-1850), they could not deliver enough firepower to those targets to be more than a nuisance. Moreover, naval gunfire did not have the range to hit targets located off the coast. Horatio Nelson, the famous British admiral, summed up the futility of naval bombardment with sailing navies when he said, \"A ship's a fool to fight a fort.\" The industrialization of navies after 1850 significantly increased the amount of firepower navies could deliver, as well as their delivery range. But industrialization had an even more profound effect on the ability of land-based forces to find and sink navies, as discussed below. Thus, twentieth-century surface navies tended to stay far away from enemy coastlines in wartime. More important, however, if a great power were to try to coerce an adversary with a conventional bombing campaign, it would surely use its air force for that purpose, not its navy. The two great naval theorists of modern times, Corbett and Mahan, believed that a blockade is the navy's ace strategy for winning great-power wars. Blockade, which Mahan called \"the most striking and awful mark of sea power,\" works by strangling a rival state's economy. The aim is to cut off an opponent's overseas trade—to deny it imports that move across water and to prevent it from exporting its own goods and materials to the outside world.",

    "text": "Once seaborne trade is severed, there are two ways a blockade might coerce a rival great power into surrendering. First, it can inflict severe punishment on the enemy's civilian population, mainly by cutting off food imports and making life miserable, if not deadly, for the average citizen. If enough people are made to suffer and die, popular support for the war will evaporate, a result that will either cause the population to revolt or force the government to stop the war for fear of revolt. Second, a blockade can so weaken an enemy's economy that it can no longer continue the fight. Probably the best way to achieve this end is to cut off a critical import, such as oil. Blockading navies usually do not discriminate between these two approaches but instead try to cut off as much of an opponent's overseas trade as possible, hoping that one approach succeeds. Regardless, blockades do not produce quick and decisive victories, because it takes a long time for a navy to wreck an adversary's economy. States usually implement blockades with naval forces that prevent oceangoing commerce from reaching the target state. The United Kingdom, for example, has historically relied on its surface navy to blockade rivals such as Napoleonic France and Wilhelmine Germany. Submarines can also be used to cut an enemy state's overseas trade, as Germany attempted to do against the United Kingdom in both world wars, and the United States did against Japan in World War II. The Americans also used surface ships, land-based aircraft, and mines to blockade Japan. But navies are not always necessary to carry out a blockade. A state that dominates a continent and controls its major ports can stop trade between the states located on that continent and states located elsewhere, thus blockading the outside states. Napoleon's Continental System (1806-13), which was aimed at the United Kingdom, fits this model.",

Germany, for example, went to war with the United Kingdom in September 1939 and with the United States in December 1941. Germany surrendered in May 1945, although it was clear by the end of 1942, if not sooner, that Germany was going to lose the war. The Wehrmacht's last major offensive against the Red Army was at Kursk in the summer of 1943, and it failed badly. After much debate, the Allies finally decided at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 to launch a serious strategic bombing campaign against Germany. But the air offensive was slow getting started, and the bombers did not begin pounding the Third Reich until the spring of 1944, when the Allies finally gained air superiority over Germany. Even historian Richard Overy, who believes that airpower played a central role in winning the war against Germany, acknowledges that it was only \"during the last year of the war [that] the bombing campaign came of age.\" Italy went to war with the United Kingdom in June 1940 and the United States in December 1941. But unlike Germany, Italy quit the war in September 1943, before it had been conquered. The Allied bombing campaign against Italy began in earnest in July 1943, roughly two months before Italy surrendered. By that point, however, Italy was on the brink of catastrophic defeat. Its army was decimated and it no longer was capable of defending the Italian homeland from invasion. In fact, the Wehrmacht was providing most of Italy's defense when the Allies invaded Sicily from the sea in July 1943. Japan's war with the United States started in December 1941 and ended in August 1945. The serious pounding of Japan from the air began in March 1945, about five months before Japan surrendered. At that point, however, Japan had clearly lost the war and was facing the prospect of surrendering unconditionally. The United States had destroyed Japan's empire in the Pacific and effectively eliminated what remained of the Japanese navy at the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. Moreover, the American naval blockade had wrecked the Japanese economy by March 1945, an act that had profoundly negative consequences for Japan's army, a large portion of which was bogged down in an unwinnable war with China. The fact is that these strategic bombing campaigns were feasible only late in the war when the Axis powers were badly battered and headed for defeat. Otherwise, the target states would not have been vulnerable to a sustained aerial assault. The United States, for example, was unable to conduct a major bombing campaign against Japan until it had destroyed most of Japan's navy and air force and had fought its way close to the home islands. Only then were American bombers near enough to make unhindered attacks on Japan. Nor could the United States effectively employ its strategic bombers against Germany until it had gained air superiority over the Third Reich. That difficult task took time and was feasible only because Germany was diverting huge resources to fight the Red Army. The best case that can be made for the three Allied strategic bombing campaigns is that they helped finish off opponents who were already well on their way to defeat—which hardly supports the claim that independent airpower was a decisive weapon in World War II.",

    "text": "In particular, one might argue that those strategic air campaigns helped end the war sooner rather than later, and that they also helped the Allies secure better terms than otherwise would have been possible. Except for the Italian case, however, the evidence seems to show that strategic bombing had little effect on how these conflicts ended. Let us consider these cases in more detail. The Allies attempted to coerce Germany into surrendering by inflicting pain on its civilian population and by destroying its economy. The Allied punishment campaign against German cities, which included the infamous \"firebombings\" of Hamburg and Dresden, destroyed more than 40 percent of the urban area in Germany's seventy largest cities and killed roughly 305,000 civilians. The German people, however, fatalistically absorbed the punishment, and Hitler felt no compunction to surrender. There is no doubt that Allied air strikes, along with the advancing ground forces, wrecked Germany's industrial base by early 1945. But the war was almost over at that point, and more important, the destruction of German industry was still not enough to coerce Hitler into stopping the war. In the end, the American, British, and Soviet armies had to conquer Germany. The strategic bombing campaign against Italy was modest in the extreme compared to the pummeling that was inflicted on Germany and Japan. Some economic targets were struck, but no attempt was made to demolish Italy's industrial base. The Allies also sought to inflict pain on Italy's population, but in the period from October 1942 until August 1943 they killed about 3,700 Italians, a tiny number compared to the 305,000 Germans (between March 1942 and April 1945) and 900,000 Japanese (between March and August 1945) killed from the air. Despite its limited lethality, the bombing campaign began to rattle Italy's ruling elites in the summer of 1943 (when it was intensified) and increased the pressure on them to surrender as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the main reason that Italy was desperate to quit the war at that point—and eventually did so on September 8, 1943—was that the Italian army was in tatters and it stood hardly any chance of stopping an Allied invasion. Italy was doomed to defeat well before the bombing campaign began to have an effect. Thus, the best that can be said for the Allied air offensive against Italy is that it probably forced Italy out of the war a month or two earlier than otherwise would have been the case. When the American bombing campaign against Japan began in late 1944, the initial goal was to use high-explosive bombs to help destroy Japan's economy, which was being wrecked by the U.S. navy's blockade. It quickly became apparent, however, that this airpower strategy would not seriously damage Japan's industrial base. Therefore, in March 1945, the United States decided to try instead to punish Japan's civilian population by firebombing its cities. This deadly aerial campaign, which lasted until the war ended five months later, destroyed more than 40 percent of Japan's 64 largest cities, killed approximately 785,000 civilians, and forced about 8.5 million people to evacuate their homes. Although Japan surrendered in August 1945 before the United States invaded and conquered the Japanese homeland—making this a case of successful coercion—the firebombing campaign played only a minor role in convincing Japan to quit the war. As discussed earlier, blockade and land power were mainly responsible for the outcome, although the atomic bombings and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan (both in early August) helped push Japan over the edge.",

    "text": "Thus coercion failed in three of the five cases in which a great power was the target state: Germany's air offensives against the United Kingdom in World Wars I and II, and the Allied bombing campaign against Nazi Germany. Moreover, strategic bombing did not play a key role in the Allies' victory over the Wehrmacht. Although Italy and Japan were coerced into surrendering in World War II, both successes were largely due to factors other than independent airpower. Let us now consider what happened in the past when the great powers unleashed their bombers against minor powers. Despite the significant power asymmetry in the nine instances in which a great power's strategic bombers struck at a minor power, coercion did not happen in five of the cases. Italy bombed Ethiopian towns and villages in 1936, sometimes using poison gas. Nevertheless, Ethiopia refused to surrender, forcing the Italian army to conquer the entire country. Japan bombed Chinese cities between 1937 and 1945, killing large numbers of Chinese civilians. But China did not surrender and ultimately the United States decisively defeated Japan. The United States conducted the famous \"Rolling Thunder\" bombing campaign against North Vietnam from 1965 to 1968. Its aim was to force the North Vietnamese to stop fueling the war in South Vietnam and accept the existence of an independent South Vietnam. The effort failed and the war went on. The Soviet Union waged a bombing campaign against Afghanistan's population centers between 1979 and 1989 in order to coerce the Afghan rebels to stop their war against the Soviet-backed government in Kabul. The Soviets, not the rebels, eventually quit the war. Finally, in early 1991, the United States launched a strategic air offensive against Iraq to coerce Saddam Hussein into abandoning Kuwait, which his army had conquered in August 1990. The bombing campaign failed to coerce Saddam, however, and the United States and its allies eventually had to employ ground forces to accomplish their mission. This bombing campaign is noteworthy because the United States employed a decapitation strategy: it tried to kill Saddam from the air, and it also attempted to isolate him from his population and from his military forces in Kuwait. This strategy failed on all counts.",

    "section": "Bombing Small Powers: Cases of Coercion",
    "text": "Coercion did succeed in four of the cases involving small powers, but strategic bombing appears to have played a peripheral role in achieving that end in all but one of those cases. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland on November 30, 1939, Soviet leader Josef Stalin launched a modest bombing campaign against Finnish cities, killing roughly 650 civilians. By all accounts, the bombing campaign had little to do with Finland's decision to stop the war in March 1940 before it was defeated and conquered by the Red Army. Finland quit fighting because it recognized that its army was badly outnumbered and stood hardly any chance of winning the war. During the Korean War, the United States attempted to coerce North Korea into quitting the war by punishing it from the air. This effort actually involved three distinct campaigns. From late July 1950 until late October 1950, American bombers concentrated on bombing North Korea's five major industrial centers. Between May and September 1952, the main targets were a handful of hydroelectric plants in North Korea, as well as Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. American bombers struck North Korean dams between May and June 1953, aiming to destroy North Korea's rice crop and starve it into surrendering. Since the armistice terminating the war was not signed until July 27, 1953, the first two punishment campaigns clearly did not end the war. Indeed, it is apparent from the available evidence that neither of those campaigns affected North Korean behavior in any meaningful way. Although the campaign to destroy North Korea's rice crop immediately preceded the signing of the armistice, bombing the dams did not devastate North Korea's rice crop and cause mass starvation. North Korea was finally coerced into signing the armistice by President Dwight Eisenhower's nuclear threats, and by the realization that neither side had the necessary combination of capability and will to alter the stalemate on the ground. In short, conventional aerial punishment did not cause this successful coercion. In addition to the failed \"Rolling Thunder\" campaign against North Vietnam (1965-68), the United States launched the \"Linebacker\" bombing campaigns in 1972. North Vietnam eventually signed a cease-fire agreement in early 1973 that allowed the United States to withdraw from the war and delayed further North Vietnamese ground offensives against South Vietnam. Although technically this was a case of successful coercion, in fact, the agreement merely postponed North Vietnam's final victory over South Vietnam until 1975. Nevertheless, strategic bombing played a small role in causing North Vietnam to accept a cease-fire with the United States. Contrary to the popular perception at the time, American bombers inflicted relatively little punishment on North Vietnam's civilian population. About thirteen thousand North Vietnamese died from the 1972 air campaign, a level of suffering that was hardly likely to cause a determined foe like North Vietnam to cave in to American demands. The main reason North Vietnam agreed to a cease-fire in January 1973 was that the U.S. air force had thwarted a North Vietnamese ground offensive in the spring of 1972, thereby creating a powerful incentive for North Vietnam to facilitate a rapid withdrawal of all American forces from Vietnam before going on the offensive again. Signing the cease-fire did just that, and two years later North Vietnam won a complete military victory over South Vietnam, which fought its final battles without the help of American airpower. The recent war conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia appears at first glance to be the one case in which strategic airpower alone coerced an adversary into submission. The United States and its allies began bombing Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999. Their aim was to get Slobodan Milosevic, Yugoslavia's president, to stop repressing the Albanian population in the province of Kosovo and allow NATO troops into that province. The air campaign lasted seventy days. Milosevic caved in to NATO's demands on June 8, 1999. NATO did not launch a ground attack into Kosovo, although the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army skirmished with Yugoslav ground forces throughout the campaign. Not much evidence is available",

    "text": "about why Milosevic capitulated, but it seems clear that bombing did not come close to bringing Yugoslavia to its knees, and that bombing alone is not responsible for the outcome.64 The bombing campaign was initially a small-scale effort because NATO leaders believed that Milosevic would concede defeat after a few days of light punishment from the air. Although NATO intensified the air war when that approach failed, it did not have the political will to inflict significant pain on Yugoslavia. Consequently, NATO's bombers went to great lengths not to kill Yugoslav civilians while striking against a limited number of economic and political targets in Yugoslavia. The bombing campaign killed about five hundred civilians.\" Not surprisingly, there is hardly any evidence that Milosevic threw in the towel because of pressure from his people to end their suffering. It appears that a variety of factors account for Milosevic's decision to cave into NATO's demands. The threat of further punishment from the air was probably a key factor, but two other factors appear to have been at least as important. NATO was beginning preparations for a massive ground invasion of Yugoslavia, and in late May the U.S. administration of President Bill Clinton sent a clear message to Milosevic via the Russians that NATO would soon send ground troops into Kosovo if he did not surrender. Furthermore, Russia, which was Yugoslavia's key ally and was bitterly opposed to the war, essentially sided with NATO in early June and put significant pressure on Milosevic to end the conflict immediately. NATO also softened its demands a bit to make a settlement more attractive to the Yugoslav leader. In sum, the punishment campaign alone did not produce victory against Yugoslavia, although it seems to have been an important factor.\nThe evidence from these fourteen cases supports the following conclusions about the utility of strategic bombing. First, strategic bombing alone cannot coerce an enemy into surrendering. Save for the case of Yugoslavia, no great power (or alliance of great powers) has ever tried to win a war by relying solely on its air force, and even in that case NATO eventually threatened a ground invasion to coerce Milosevic. Strategic bombing was employed in tandem with land power from the start in the other thirteen cases. This record shows the futility of relying on strategic bombing alone. Furthermore, there is little evidence that past bombing campaigns so markedly affected the war's outcome as to indicate that strategic bombing by itself can compel the surrender of another great power. Even when strategic bombing is used along with land power, the record shows that strategic bombing plausibly played a major role in shaping the outcome only once. Strategic bombing is generally unable to coerce on its own.",

    "section": "Why Strategic Bombing Fails",
    "text": "Consider that in nine out of the fourteen cases, the great power employing strategic airpower won the war. In three of those nine cases, however, the victor did not coerce its adversary but had to defeat it on the ground: Italy against Ethiopia, the Allies against Nazi Germany, and the United States against Iraq. In the remaining six cases, the great power employing strategic airpower successfully coerced its adversary. Strategic bombing, however, played a subordinate role in determining the outcome of five of those six cases: the United States against Japan, the Soviet Union against Finland, the Allies against Italy, and the United States against Korea and Vietnam (1972). Land power was the key to victory in each case, although blockade was also an essential ingredient of success in the U.S.-Japan case. The war over Kosovo is the only instance in which strategic bombing appears to have played a key role in causing successful coercion. But that case is not cause for optimism about the utility of independent airpower. Not only was Yugoslavia an especially weak minor power fighting alone against the mighty United States and its European allies, but other factors besides the bombing campaign moved Milosevic to acquiesce to NATO's demands.\nThe second lesson to be drawn from the historical record is that strategic bombing rarely does much to weaken enemy armies, and hence it rarely contributes importantly to the success of a ground campaign. During World War II, independent airpower did sometimes help great powers win lengthy wars of attrition against rival great powers, but it played only an ancillary role in those victories. In the nuclear era, great powers have employed that coercive instrument only against minor powers, not against each other. But even against weaker states, strategic bombing has been about as effective as it was against other great powers. In short, it is hard to bomb an adversary into submission.\nWhy Strategic Bombing Campaigns Fail\nStrategic bombing is unlikely to work for the same reasons that blockades usually fail to coerce an opponent: civilian populations can absorb tremendous pain and deprivation without rising up against their government. Political scientist Robert Pape succinctly summarizes the historical evidence regarding aerial punishment and popular revolt: \"over more than seventy-five years, the record of air power is replete with efforts to alter the behavior of states by attacking or threatening to attack large numbers of civilians. The incontrovertible conclusion from these campaigns is that air attack does not cause citizens to turn against their government . . . . In fact, in the more than thirty major strategic air campaigns that have thus far been waged, air power has never driven the masses into the streets to demand anything.\" Furthermore, modern industrial economies are not fragile structures that can be easily destroyed, even by massive bombing attacks. To paraphrase Adam Smith, there is a lot of room for ruin in a great power's economy. This targeting strategy makes even less sense against minor powers because they invariably have small industrial bases.",

    "section": "Decapitation and Isolation Strategies",
    "text": "But what about decapitation? As noted, that strategy failed against Iraq in 1991. It was also tried on three other occasions, none of which are included in the previous discussion because they were such small-scale attacks. Nevertheless, the strategy failed all three times to produce the desired results. On April 14, 1986, the United States bombed the tent of Muammar Qaddafi. The Libyan leader's young daughter was killed, but he escaped harm. It is widely believed that the terrorist bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland two years later was retribution for that failed assassination attempt. On April 21, 1996, the Russians targeted and killed Dzhokhar Dudayev, the leader of rebel forces in the province of Chechnya. The aim was to coerce the Chechens into settling their secessionist war with Russia on terms that were favorable to the Kremlin. In fact, the rebels vowed to avenge Dudayev's death, and a few months later (August 1996) the Russian troops were forced out of Chechnya. Finally, the United States launched a brief four-day attack against Iraq in December 1998. \"Operation Desert Fox,\" as the effort was code-named, was another attempt to decapitate Saddam; it failed.67 Decapitation is a fanciful strategy.68 The case of Dudayev notwithstanding, it is especially difficult in wartime to locate and kill a rival political leader. But even if decapitation happens, it is unlikely that the successor's politics will be substantially different from those of the dead predecessor. This strategy is based on the deep-seated American belief that hostile states are essentially comprised of benign citizens controlled by evil leaders. Remove the evil leader, the thinking goes, and the forces of good will triumph and the war will quickly end. This is not a promising strategy. Killing a particular leader does not guarantee that one of his closest lieutenants will not replace him. For example, had the Allies managed to kill Adolf Hitler, they probably would have gotten Martin Bormann or Hermann Goering as his replacement, neither of whom would have been much, if any, improvement over Hitler. Furthermore, evil leaders like Hitler often enjoy widespread popular support: not only do they sometimes represent the views of their body politic, but nationalism tends to foster close ties between political leaders and their populations, especially in wartime, when all concerned face a powerful external threat.",

    "text": "The tide turned against the Third Reich in early 1942, and by May 1945, Hitler was dead and his successors had surrendered unconditionally. The Germans were beaten decisively on the battlefield, mainly on the eastern front by the Red Army, which lost a staggering eight million soldiers in the process but managed to cause at least three out of every four German wartime casualties. British and American armies also helped wear down the Wehrmacht, but they played a considerably smaller role than the Soviet army, mainly because they did not land on French soil until June 1944, less than a year before the war ended. The Allies' strategic bombing campaign failed to cripple the German economy until early 1945, when the war's outcome had already been settled on the ground. Nevertheless, airpower alone did not wreck Germany's industrial base; the Allied armies closing in on the Third Reich also played a major role in that effort. The British and American navies imposed a blockade on the Third Reich, but it, too, had a minor impact on the war's outcome. In short, the only way to defeat a formidable continental power like Nazi Germany is to smash its army in bloody land battles and conquer it. Blockades and strategic bombing might help the cause somewhat, but they are likely to matter primarily on the margins.\n\nAmericans tend to think that the Asian half of World War II began when Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7, 1941. But Japan had been on the warpath in Asia since 1931 and had conquered Manchuria, much of northern China, and parts of Indochina before the United States entered the war. Immediately after Pearl Harbor, the Japanese military conquered most of Southeast Asia, and virtually all of the islands in the western half of the Pacific Ocean. Japan's army was its principal instrument of conquest, although its navy often transported the army into combat. Japan conducted a strategic bombing campaign against China, but it was a clear-cut failure (as discussed earlier in this chapter). Also, starting in 1938, Japan tried to cut off China's access to the outside world with a blockade, which reduced the flow of arms and goods into China to a trickle by 1942. Nevertheless, China's armies continued to hold their own on the battlefield, refusing to surrender to their Japanese foes. In short, land power was the key to Japan's military successes in World War II. The tide turned against Japan in June 1942, when the American navy scored a stunning victory over the Japanese navy at the Battle of Midway. Over the next three years, Japan was worn down in a protracted two-front war, finally surrendering unconditionally in August 1945. As noted earlier, land power played a critical role in defeating Japan. The U.S. navy's blockade of the Japanese homeland, however, was also a deciding factor in that conflict. The firebombing of Japan, including Hiroshima and Nagasaki, certainly caused tremendous suffering in the targeted cities, but it played only a minor role in causing Japan's defeat. This is the only great-power war in modern history in which land power alone was not principally responsible for determining the outcome, and in which one of the coercive instruments—airpower or sea power—played more than an auxiliary role.",

    "text": "There is one especially important aspect of land power that merits further elaboration: how large bodies of water sharply limit an army's power-projection capability. Water is usually not a serious obstacle for a navy that is transporting ground forces across an ocean and landing them in a friendly state. But water is a forbidding barrier when a navy attempts to deliver an army onto territory controlled and well-defended by a rival great power. Navies are therefore at a significant disadvantage when attempting amphibious operations against powerful land-based forces, which are likely to throw the seaborne invaders back into the sea. Generally speaking, land assaults across a common border are a much easier undertaking. Armies that have to traverse a large body of water to attack a well-armed opponent invariably have little offensive capability.",

    "text": "The submarine threat to surface ships has important implications for navies bent on launching amphibious assaults against a rival's coast. In particular, an opponent with a formidable submarine force could sink the assaulting forces before they reached the beaches or sink much of the striking navy after the assaulting forces had landed, thereby stranding the seaborne troops on the beaches. Finally, naval mines, fixed explosives that sit under the water and explode when struck by passing ships, increase the difficulty of invading a territorial state from the sea.\n\nNavies used mines effectively for the first time in the American Civil War, but they were first employed on a massive scale during World War I. The combatants laid down roughly 240,000 mines between 1914 and 1918, and they shaped the course of the war in important ways. Surface ships simply cannot pass unharmed through heavily mined waters; the minefields must be cleared first, and this is a difficult, sometimes impossible, task in wartime. A territorial state can therefore use mines effectively to defend its coast against invasion. Iraq, for example, mined the waters off the Kuwaiti coast before the United States and its allies began to amass forces to invade in the Persian Gulf War. When the ground war started on February 24, 1991, the U.S. marines did not storm the Kuwaiti beaches but remained on their ships in the gulf.\n\nAlthough amphibious operations against a land mass controlled by a great power are especially difficult to pull off, they are feasible under special circumstances. In particular, they are likely to work against a great power that is on the verge of catastrophic defeat, mainly because the victim is not going to possess the wherewithal to defend itself. Furthermore, they are likely to succeed against great powers that are defending huge expanses of territory. In such cases, the defender's troops are likely to be widely dispersed, leaving their territory vulnerable to attack somewhere on the periphery. In fact, uncontested amphibious landings are possible if a defending great power's forces are stretched thinly enough. It is especially helpful if the defender is fighting a two-front war, because then some sizable portion of its force will be pinned down on a front far away from the seaborne assault. In all cases, the invading force should have clear-cut air superiority over the landing sites, so that its air force can provide close air support and prevent enemy reinforcements from reaching the beachheads. But if none of these circumstances applies and the defending great power can employ a substantial portion of its military might against the amphibious forces, the land-based forces are almost certain to inflict a devastating defeat on the seaborne invaders. Therefore, when surveying the historical record, we should expect to find cases of amphibious operations directed against a great power only when the special circumstances described above apply. Assaults from the sea against powerful land forces should be rare indeed.",

    "text": "A brief survey of the history of seaborne invasions provides ample evidence of the stopping power of water. There is no case in which a great power launched an amphibious assault against territory that was well-defended by another great power. Before World War I, some British naval planners argued for invading Germany from the sea at the outset of a general European war. That idea, however, was considered suicidal by military planners and civilian policymakers alike. Corbett surely reflected mainstream thinking on the matter when he wrote in 1911, \"Defeat the enemy's fleet as we may, he will be but little the worse. We shall have opened the way for invasion, but any of the great continental powers can laugh at our attempts to invade single-handed.\" German chancellor Otto von Bismarck apparently did just that when asked how he would respond if the British army landed on the German coastline. He reportedly replied that he would \"call out the local police and have it arrested!\" The United Kingdom did not seriously contemplate invading Germany either before or after World War I broke out but instead convoyed its army to France, where it took its place on the western front alongside the French army. The United Kingdom followed a similar strategy after Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. During the Cold War, the United States and its allies never seriously considered launching an amphibious attack against the Soviet Union. Moreover, American policymakers recognized during the Cold War that if the Soviet army had overrun Western Europe, it would have been almost impossible for the U.S. and British armies to launch a second Normandy invasion to get back on the European continent. In all likelihood, the Soviet Union would not have faced a two-front war, and thus it would have been able to concentrate almost all of its best divisions in France. Moreover, the Soviets would have had a formidable air force to use against the invading forces.",

    "text": "The successful landing at Anzio was due to decisive air superiority and limited German resistance. However, the Allies didn't exploit this advantage, failing to move inland quickly or prevent the Wehrmacht from containing the invasion.  In the Pacific, Japan’s early amphibious successes were due to air superiority and weak Allied defenses.  The U.S. conducted numerous successful amphibious invasions against Japan, facilitated by American air superiority, which isolated Japanese garrisons.  Japan's two-front war and the limited size of its forces on Pacific islands also contributed to American success.  By 1945, Japan was crippled, its economy and military devastated, making an American invasion feasible, though feared for potential casualties.\n\nThe historical record distinguishes between insular and continental states. Insular states, like the UK, Japan, and the US, are the sole great powers on large landmasses surrounded by water. Continental states, like France, Germany, and Russia, share large landmasses with other great powers. Insular powers are less vulnerable to invasion, as attacks must come over water. The UK and US have never been invaded as great powers. Continental powers, however, are more susceptible to land invasion. France has been invaded seven times since 1792, three times successfully, all by land. Russia has been invaded five times in the past two centuries, four times by land.  Large bodies of water significantly hinder invasions against well-defended great powers.",

    "text": "Nuclear weapons revolutionized warfare due to their destructive potential. However, their impact on great-power politics is debated. Some argue they eliminate security competition due to mutually assured destruction, rendering conventional military power irrelevant. Others contend that their catastrophic nature deters their use, leaving conventional power paramount.  This text argues that nuclear superiority creates a hegemon, minimizing the importance of conventional forces. However, with multiple nuclear powers possessing second-strike capability, security competition persists, and land power remains crucial, though nuclear weapons increase caution in military actions.\n\nNuclear superiority arises when a great power can destroy an adversary without significant retaliation, achieved through a nuclear monopoly or neutralizing rivals' arsenals via a first strike or robust defense.  A nuclear hegemon can credibly threaten rivals with destruction, achieving dominance.  Nuclear superiority doesn't necessarily stem from simply possessing more weapons, as long as the weaker power can inflict substantial damage in retaliation. ",

    "text": "Every great power would like to achieve nuclear superiority, but it is not likely to happen often, and when it does occur, it probably is not going to last for a long time. Non-nuclear rivals are sure to go to great lengths to acquire nuclear arsenals of their own, and once they do, it would be difficult, although not impossible, for a great power to reestablish superiority by insulating itself from nuclear attack. The United States, for example, had a monopoly on nuclear weapons from 1945 until 1949, but it did not have nuclear superiority in any meaningful sense during that brief period. Not only was America's nuclear arsenal small during those years, but the Pentagon had not yet developed effective means for delivering it to the appropriate targets in the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union exploded a nuclear device in 1949, the United States tried, but failed, to gain nuclear superiority over its rival. Nor were the Soviets able to gain a decisive nuclear advantage over the Americans at any time during the Cold War. Thus, each side was forced to live with the fact that no matter how it employed its own nuclear forces, the other side was still likely to have a survivable nuclear retaliatory force that could inflict unacceptable damage on an attacker. This \"Texas standoff\" came to be called 'mutual assured destruction' (MAD), because both sides probably would have been destroyed if either initiated a nuclear war. However desirable it might be for any state to transcend MAD and establish nuclear superiority, it is unlikely to happen in the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "A MAD world is highly stable at the nuclear level, because there is no incentive for any great power to start a nuclear war that it could not win; indeed, such a war would probably lead to its destruction as a functioning society. Still, the question remains: what effect does this balance of terror have on the prospects for a conventional war between nuclear-armed great powers? One school of thought maintains that it is so unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used in a MAD world that great powers are free to fight conventional wars almost as if nuclear weapons did not exist.  Nuclear weapons, according to this logic, have little effect on state behavior at the conventional level, and thus great powers are free to engage in security competition, much the way they did before nuclear weapons were invented. The problem with this perspective is that it is based on the assumption that great powers can be highly confident that a large-scale conventional war will not turn into a nuclear war. A second school of thought argues that great powers in a MAD world have little reason to worry about the conventional balance because nuclear-armed great powers are simply not going to attack each other with conventional forces because of fear of nuclear escalation. Great powers are remarkably secure in a MAD world, so the argument goes, and thus there is no good reason for them to compete for security. Nuclear weapons have made great-power war virtually unthinkable. The problem with this perspective is that it goes to the other extreme on the escalation issue. It is based on the assumption that it is likely, if not automatic, that a conventional war would escalate to the nuclear level. It is clear from the Cold War that great powers operating in a MAD world still engage in intense security competition, and that they care greatly about conventional forces, especially the balance of land power.",

    "section": "Measuring Military Power",
    "text": "Assessing the balance of land power involves a three-step process. First, the relative size and quality of the opposing armies must be estimated. It is important to consider the strength of those forces in peacetime as well as after mobilization, because states often maintain small standing armies that expand quickly in size when the ready reserves are called to active duty. There is no simple way to measure the power of rival armies, mainly because their strength depends on a variety of factors, all of which tend to vary across armies: 1) the number of soldiers, 2) the quality of the soldiers, 3) the number of weapons, 4) the quality of the weaponry, and 5) how those soldiers and weapons are organized for war. Any good indicator of land power should account for all these inputs. The second step in assessing the balance of land power is to factor any air forces that support armies into the analysis. We must assess the inventory of aircraft on each side, focusing on available numbers and quality. Pilot efficiency must also be taken into account as well as the strength of each side's 1) ground-based air defense systems, 2) reconnaissance capabilities, and 3) battle-management systems. Third, we must consider the power-projection capability inherent in armies, paying special attention to whether large bodies of water limit an army's offensive capability. If there is such a body of water, and if an ally lies across it, one must assess the ability of navies to protect the movement of troops and supplies to and from that ally.",

    "text": "It is time to consider how great powers go about maximizing their share of world power. The first task is to lay out the specific goals that states pursue in their competition for power. My analysis of state objectives builds on previous chapters' discussion of power. Specifically, I argue that great powers strive for hegemony in their region of the world. Because of the difficulty of projecting power over large bodies of water, no state is likely to dominate the entire globe. Great powers also aim to be wealthy—in fact, much wealthier than their rivals, because military power has an economic foundation. Furthermore, great powers aspire to have the mightiest land forces in their region of the world, because armies and their supporting air and naval forces are the core ingredient of military power. Finally, great powers seek nuclear superiority, although that is an especially difficult goal to achieve.\nThe second task is to analyze the various strategies that states use to shift the balance of power in their favor or to prevent other states from shifting it against them. War is the main strategy states employ to acquire relative power. Blackmail is a more attractive alternative because it relies on the threat of force, not the actual use of force, to produce results. Thus, it is relatively cost-free. Blackmail is usually difficult to achieve, however, because great powers are likely to fight before they submit to threats from other great powers. Another strategy for gaining power is bait and bleed, whereby a state tries to weaken its rivals by provoking a long and costly war between them. But this scheme is also difficult to make work. A more promising variant of the strategy is bloodletting, in which a state takes measures to ensure that any war in which an adversary is involved is protracted and deadly.\nBalancing and buck-passing are the principal strategies that great powers use to prevent aggressors from upsetting the balance of power. With balancing, threatened states seriously commit themselves to containing their dangerous opponent. In other words, they are willing to shoulder the burden of deterring, or fighting if need be, the aggressor. With buck-passing, they try to get another great power to check the aggressor while they remain on the sidelines. Threatened states usually prefer buck-passing to balancing, mainly because the buck-passer avoids the costs of fighting the aggressor in the event of war.\nThe strategies of appeasement and bandwagoning are not particularly useful for dealing with aggressors. Both call for conceding power to a rival state, which is a prescription for serious trouble in an anarchic system. With bandwagoning, the threatened state abandons hope of preventing the aggressor from gaining power at its expense and instead joins forces with its dangerous foe to get at least some small portion of the spoils of war. Appeasement is a more ambitious strategy. The appeaser aims to modify the behavior of the aggressor by conceding it power, in the hope that this gesture will make the aggressor feel more secure, thus dampening or eliminating its motive for aggression. Although appeasement and bandwagoning are ineffective and dangerous strategies, because they allow the balance of power to shift against the threatened state, I will discuss some special circumstances where it may make sense for a state to concede power to another state.",

    "text": "Although I have emphasized that great powers seek to maximize their share of world power, more needs to be said about what that behavior entails. This section will therefore examine the different goals that states pursue and the strategies they employ in their hunt for more relative power.\n\nRegional Hegemony\nGreat powers concentrate on achieving four basic objectives. First, they seek regional hegemony. Although a state would maximize its security if it dominated the entire world, global hegemony is not feasible, except in the unlikely event that a state achieves nuclear superiority over its rivals (see below). The key limiting factor, as discussed in the preceding chapter, is the difficulty of projecting power across large bodies of water, which makes it impossible for any great power to conquer and dominate regions separated from it by oceans. Regional hegemons certainly pack a powerful military punch, but launching amphibious assaults across oceans against territory controlled and defended by another great power would be a suicidal undertaking. Not surprisingly, the United States, which is the only regional hegemon in modern history, has never seriously considered conquering either Europe or Northeast Asia. A great power could still conquer a neighboring region that it could reach by land, but it would still fall far short of achieving global hegemony. Not only do great powers aim to dominate their own region, they also strive to prevent rivals in other areas from gaining hegemony. Regional hegemons fear that a peer competitor might jeopardize their hegemony by upsetting the balance of power in their backyard. Thus, regional hegemons prefer that there be two or more great powers in the other key regions of the world, because those neighbors are likely to spend most of their time competing with each other, leaving them few opportunities to threaten a distant hegemon.",

    "text": "It is also possible for conquerors to gain power by confiscating natural resources such as oil and foodstuffs. For example, any great power that conquers Saudi Arabia would surely reap significant economic benefits from controlling Saudi oil. This is why the United States created its Rapid Deployment Force in the late 1970s; it feared that the Soviet Union might invade Iran and capture the oil-rich area of Khuzestan, which would enhance Soviet power. Moreover, once in Iran, the Soviets would be well positioned to threaten Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich states. During both world wars, Germany was bent on gaining access to the grain and other foodstuffs produced in the Soviet Union so that it could feed its own people cheaply and easily. The Germans also coveted Soviet oil and other resources.\nBut even if one rejects the notion that conquest pays economic dividends, there are three other ways that a victorious aggressor can shift the balance of power in its favor. The conqueror might employ some portion of the vanquished state's population in its army or as forced labor in its homeland. Napoleon's military machine, for example, made use of manpower raised in defeated states. In fact, when France attacked Russia in the summer of 1812, roughly half of the main invasion force—which totalled 674,000 soldiers—was not French. Nazi Germany also employed soldiers from conquered states in its army. Furthermore, conquest sometimes pays because the victor gains strategically important territory. In particular, states can gain a buffer zone that helps protect them from attack by another state, or that can be used to launch an attack on a rival state. For example, France gave serious consideration to annexing the Rhineland before and after Germany was defeated in World War I. Israel's strategic position was certainly enhanced in June 1967 with the acquisition of the Sinai Peninsula, the Golan Heights, and the West Bank in the Six-Day War. The Soviet Union went to war against Finland in the winter of 1939–40 to gain territory that would help the Red Army thwart a Nazi invasion. The Wehrmacht, on the other hand, conquered part of Poland in September 1939 and used it as a launching pad for its June 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.\nFinally, war can shift the balance of power in the victor's favor by eliminating the vanquished state from the ranks of the great powers. Conquering states can achieve this goal in different ways. They might destroy a defeated rival by killing most of its people, thereby eliminating it altogether from the international system. States rarely pursue this drastic option, but evidence of this kind of behavior exists to make states think about it. The Romans, for example, annihilated Carthage, and there is reason to think that Hitler planned to eliminate Poland and the Soviet Union from the map of Europe. Spain destroyed both the Aztec and the Inca empires in Central and South America, and during the Cold War, both superpowers worried that the other would use its nuclear weapons to launch a “splendid first strike” that would obliterate them. Israelis often worry that if the Arab states ever inflicted a decisive defeat on Israel, they would impose a Carthaginian peace. Alternatively, conquering states might annex the defeated state. Austria, Prussia, and Russia, for example, partitioned Poland four times in the past three centuries. The victor might also consider disarming and neutralizing the beaten state. The Allies employed this strategy against Germany after World War I, and in the early years of the Cold War, Stalin flirted with the idea of creating a unified but militarily weak Germany. The famous “Morgenthau Plan” proposed that post-Hitler Germany be de-industrialized and turned into two largely agrarian states, so that it no longer could build powerful military forces. Finally, conquering states might divide a defeated great power into two or more smaller states, which is what Germany did to the Soviet Union in the spring of 1918 with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and is also what the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union effectively did to Germany after World War II.",

    "text": "A state can gain power at a rival's expense without going to war by threatening to use military force against its opponent. Coercive threats and intimidation, not the actual use of force, produce the desired outcome. If this blackmail works, it is clearly preferable to war, because blackmail achieves its goals without bloody costs. However, blackmail is unlikely to produce marked shifts in the balance of power, mainly because threats alone are usually not enough to compel a great power to make significant concessions to a rival great power. Great powers, by definition, have formidable military strength relative to each other, and therefore they are not likely to give in to threats without a fight. Blackmail is more likely to work against minor powers that have no great-power ally.\nNevertheless, there are cases of successful blackmail against great powers. For example, in the decade before World War I, Germany attempted to intimidate its European rivals on four occasions and succeeded once. Germany initiated diplomatic confrontations with France and the United Kingdom over Morocco in 1905 and again in 1911. Although Germany was clearly more powerful than either the United Kingdom or France, and probably more powerful than both of them combined, Germany suffered diplomatic defeats both times. In the other two cases, Germany tried to blackmail Russia into making concessions in the Balkans. In 1909, Austria annexed Bosnia without any prompting from Germany. When Russia protested, Germany used the threat of war to force Russia to accept Austria's action. Blackmail worked in this case, because the Russian army had not recovered from its shattering defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5) and thus was in no position to confront the mighty German army in a war. The Germans tried to intimidate the Russians again in the summer of 1914, but by then the Russian army had recovered from its defeat a decade earlier. The Russians stood their ground, and the result was World War I.\nAmong three other well-known cases of blackmail, only one had a significant effect on the balance of power. The first case was a dispute in 1898 between the United Kingdom and France over control of Fashoda, a strategically important fan at the headwaters of Africa's Nile River. The United Kingdom warned France not to attempt to conquer any part of the Nile because it would threaten British control of Egypt and the Suez Canal. When the United Kingdom learned that France had sent an expeditionary force to Fashoda, it told France to remove it or face war. France backed down, because it knew the United Kingdom would win the ensuing war, and because France did not want to pick a fight with the United Kingdom when it was more worried about the emerging German threat on its eastern border. The second case is the famous Munich crisis of 1938, when Hitler threatened war to compel the United Kingdom and France to allow Germany to swallow up the Sudetenland, which was at the time part of Czechoslovakia. The third case is when the United States forced the Soviet Union to remove its ballistic missiles from Cuba in the fall of 1962. Of these cases, only Munich had a telling effect on the balance of power.",

    "text": "Threatened states can take three measures to make balancing work. First, they can send clear signals to the aggressor through diplomatic channels (and through the actions described below) that they are firmly committed to maintaining the balance of power, even if it means going to war. The emphasis in the balancer's message is on confrontation, not conciliation. In effect, the balancer draws a line in the sand and warns the aggressor not to cross it. The United States pursued this type of policy with the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War; France and Russia did the same with Germany before World War I.\n\nSecond, threatened states can work to create a defensive alliance to help them contain their dangerous opponent. This diplomatic maneuver, which is often called \"external balancing,\" is limited in a bipolar world because there are no potential great-power alliance partners, although it is still possible to ally with minor powers. During the Cold War, for example, both the United States and the Soviet Union had no choice but to ally with minor powers because they were the only great powers in the system. Threatened states place a high premium on finding alliance partners, because the costs of checking an aggressor are shared in an alliance—an especially important consideration if war breaks out. Furthermore, recruiting allies increases the amount of firepower confronting the aggressor, which in turn increases the likelihood that deterrence will work. These benefits notwithstanding, external balancing has a downside: it is often slow and inefficient.\n\nThird, threatened states can balance against an aggressor by mobilizing additional resources of their own. For example, defense spending might be increased or conscription might be implemented. This action, which is commonly referred to as \"internal balancing,\" is self-help in the purest sense of the term. But there are usually significant limits on how many additional resources a threatened state can muster against an aggressor, because great powers normally already devote a large percentage of their resources to defense. Because they seek to maximize their share of world power, states are effectively engaged in internal balancing all the time. Nevertheless, when faced with a particularly aggressive adversary, great powers will eliminate any slack in the system and search for clever ways to boost defense spending.",

    "text": "Buck-passing is a threatened great power's main alternative to balancing. A buck-passer attempts to get another state to bear the burden of deterring or possibly fighting an aggressor, while it remains on the sidelines. The buck-passer fully recognizes the need to prevent the aggressor from increasing its share of world power but looks for some other state that is threatened by the aggressor to perform that onerous task. Threatened states can take four measures to facilitate buck-passing.\n\nFirst, they can seek good diplomatic relations with the aggressor, or at least not do anything to provoke it, in the hope that it will concentrate its attention on the intended \"buck-catcher.\" During the late 1930s, for example, both France and the Soviet Union tried to pass the buck to each other in the face of a deadly threat from Nazi Germany.\n\nSecond, buck-passers usually maintain cool relations with the intended buck-catcher, not just because this diplomatic distancing might help foster good relations with the aggressor, but also because the buck-passer does not want to get dragged into a war on the side of the buck-catcher. The aim of the buck-passer, after all, is to avoid having to fight the aggressor.\n\nThird, great powers can mobilize additional resources of their own to make buck-passing work. By building up its own defenses, a buck-passer makes itself an imposing target, thus giving the aggressor incentive to focus its attention on the intended buck-catcher. Buck-passers also build formidable military forces for prophylactic reasons. In a world where two or more states are attempting to buck-pass, no state can be certain that it will not catch the buck and have to stand alone against the aggressor.\n\nFourth, it sometimes makes sense for a buck-passer to allow or even facilitate the growth in power of the intended buck-catcher. That burden-bearer would then have a better chance of containing the aggressor state, which would increase the buck-passer's prospects of remaining on the sidelines. Between 1864 and 1870, for example, the United Kingdom and Russia stood by and allowed Otto von Bismarck's Prussia to conquer territory in the heart of Europe and create a unified German Reich.",

    "text": "Buck-passing and putting together a balancing coalition obviously represent contrasting ways of dealing with an aggressor. Nevertheless, there is a strong tendency to buck-pass or \"free-ride\" inside balancing coalitions, although the danger that buck-passing will wreck the alliance is a powerful countervailing force.  Britain's attempt to free-ride on its allies, along with the history described in Chapters 7 and 8, gives evidence of the powerful impulse to buck-pass among threatened states. Indeed, great powers seem clearly to prefer buck-passing to balancing.\n\nOne reason for this preference is that buck-passing usually provides defense \"on the cheap.\" Buck-passing can also have an offensive dimension to it, which can make it even more attractive. Specifically, if the aggressor and the buck-catcher become involved in a long and costly war, the balance of power is likely to shift in the buck-passer's favor; it would then be in a good position to dominate the postwar world. The United States, for example, entered World War II in December 1941 but did not land its army in France until June 1944, less than a year before the war ended.  Although the United States would have preferred to invade France before 1944 and was thus an inadvertent buck-passer, there is no question that the United States benefited greatly from delaying the Normandy invasion until late in the war, when both the German and the Soviet armies were battered and worn.\n\nPassing the buck is also an attractive option when a state faces more than one dangerous rival but does not have the military might to confront them all at once. Buck-passing might help reduce the number of threats. For example, the United Kingdom faced three menacing adversaries in the 1930s—Germany, Italy, and Japan—but it did not have the military power to check all three of them at once. The United Kingdom attempted to alleviate the problem by passing the burden of dealing with Germany to France, so it could concentrate instead on Italy and Japan.\n\nBuck-passing is not a foolproof strategy, however. Its chief drawback is that the buck-catcher might fail to check the aggressor, leaving the buck-passer in a precarious strategic position. For example, France could not handle Nazi Germany alone, and therefore the United Kingdom had to form a balancing coalition with France against Hitler in March 1939.  During that same period, the Soviet Union successfully passed the buck to France and the United Kingdom and then sat back expecting to watch Germany engage those two buck-catchers in a long, bloody war. But the Wehrmacht overran France in six weeks during the spring of 1940, leaving Hitler free to attack the Soviet Union without having to worry much about his western flank.",

    "text": ". But it is difficult to predict the future in international politics. Who would have guessed in 1870 that Germany would become the most powerful state in Europe by the early twentieth century and precipitate two world wars? Nor is balancing a foolproof alternative to buck-passing. Indeed, balancing is often inefficient, and states that balance together sometimes suffer catastrophic defeats, as happened to the United Kingdom and France in the spring of 1940. It should be apparent that buck-passing sometimes leads to the same outcome as a bait-and-bleed strategy. Specifically, when buck-passing leads to war, the buck-passer, like the baiter, improves its relative power position by remaining on the sidelines while its main rivals wear themselves down. Furthermore, both strategies can fail in the same way if one of the combatants wins a quick and decisive victory. Nevertheless, there is an important difference between the two strategies: buck-passing is principally a deterrence strategy, with war-fighting as the default option, whereas bait and bleed purposely aims to provoke a war.\n\nSome argue that balancing and buck-passing are not the only strategies that threatened states might employ against a dangerous opponent. Appeasement and bandwagoning, so the argument goes, are also viable alternatives. But that is wrong. Both of those strategies call for conceding power to an aggressor, which violates balance-of-power logic and increases the danger to the state that employs them. Great powers that care about their survival should neither appease nor bandwagon with their adversaries.\n\nBandwagoning happens when a state joins forces with a more powerful opponent, conceding that its formidable new partner will gain a disproportionate share of the spoils they conquer together. The distribution of power, in other words, will shift further against the bandwagoner and in the stronger state's favor. Bandwagoning is a strategy for the weak. Its underlying assumption is that if a state is badly outgunned by a rival, it makes no sense to resist its demands, because that adversary will take what it wants by force anyway and inflict considerable punishment in the process. The bandwagoner must just hope that the troublemaker is merciful. Thucydides' famous dictum that \"the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must\" captures the essence of bandwagoning. This strategy, which violates the basic canon of offensive realism—that states maximize relative power—is rarely employed by great powers, because they have, by definition, the wherewithal to put up a decent fight against other great powers, and because they certainly have the incentive to stand up and fight. Bandwagoning is employed mainly by minor powers that stand alone against hostile great powers. They have no choice but to give in to the enemy, because they are weak and isolated. Good examples of bandwagoning are the decisions by Bulgaria and Romania to ally with Nazi Germany in the early stages of World War II and then shift their allegiance to the Soviet Union near the end of the war.",

    "text": "With appeasement, a threatened state makes concessions to an aggressor that shift the balance of power in the recipient's favor. The appeaser usually agrees to surrender all or part of the territory of a third state to its powerful foe. The purpose of this allowance is behavior modification: to push the aggressor in a more pacific direction and possibly turn it into a status quo power. The strategy rests on the assumption that the adversary's aggressive behavior is largely the result of an acute sense of strategic vulnerability. Therefore, any steps taken to reduce that insecurity will dampen, and possibly eliminate, the underlying motive for war. Appeasement accomplishes this end, so the argument goes, by allowing the appeaser to demonstrate its good intentions and by shifting the military balance in the appeased state's favor, thus making it less vulnerable and more secure, and ultimately less aggressive.\n\nUnlike the bandwagoner, who makes no effort to contain the aggressor, the appeaser remains committed to checking the threat. But like bandwagoning, appeasement contradicts the dictates of offensive realism and therefore it is a fanciful and dangerous strategy. It is unlikely to transform a dangerous foe into a kinder, gentler opponent, much less a peace-loving state. Indeed, appeasement is likely to whet, not shrink, an aggressor state's appetite for conquest. There is little doubt that if a state concedes a substantial amount of power to an acutely insecure rival, that foe would presumably feel better about its prospects for survival. That reduced level of fear would, in turn, lessen that rival's incentive to shift the balance of power in its favor. But that good news is only part of the story. In fact, two other considerations trump that peace-promoting logic. International anarchy, as emphasized, causes states to look for opportunities to gain additional increments of power at each other's expense. Because great powers are programmed for offense, an appeased state is likely to interpret any power concession by another state as a sign of weakness—as evidence that the appeaser is unwilling to defend the balance of power. The appeased state is then likely to continue pushing for more concessions. It would be foolish for a state not to gain as much power as possible, because a state's prospects for survival increase as it accumulates additional increments of power. Furthermore, the appeased state's capability to gain even more power would be enhanced—probably substantially—by the additional power it was granted by the appeaser. In short, appeasement is likely to make a dangerous rival more, not less, dangerous.",

Japan's almost constant search for opportunities to expand through conquest is highlighted, aligning with the predictions of offensive realism.  Prior to 1853, Japan was largely isolated, with a feudal system and a less developed economy compared to Western powers. Forced into unequal treaties by Western powers, Japan responded by modernizing its political system and economy, as well as its military.  The Meiji Restoration of 1868 marked a key turning point. While initial focus was on domestic reforms, Japan quickly adopted a great power stance internationally. Korea became an early target, followed by broader ambitions for control over significant portions of the Asian continent. By the end of World War I, Japan aimed for hegemony in Asia. This offensive drive persisted until its defeat in 1945.  Over these decades, Japan consistently capitalized on shifts in the balance of power to expand its influence and territory.  Scholars generally agree on Japan's expansionist behavior and its security-driven motivations.  Japan primarily focused on Korea, Manchuria, and China. Korea, due to its proximity, was seen as a direct threat. Manchuria, also nearby, was another key target. While a more distant concern, China's potential to dominate Asia if modernized worried Japan, who aimed to keep it weak and divided. Other targets included Outer Mongolia, Russia, Southeast Asia, and various Pacific islands.  Neither China nor Korea could effectively counter Japan's ambitions.  Japan's modernization, unlike its neighbors, gave it a military edge, enabling it to annex Korea and conquer parts of China.",

Unlike Japan, which modernized after its initial contacts with the West, both China and Korea remained economically backward until well after 1945. Consequently, Japan gained a significant military advantage over China and Korea in the late nineteenth century and was eventually able to annex Korea and to conquer large portions of China. Japan might have dominated the Asian continent by the early twentieth\n\n1 Even E. H. Norman, an incisive critic of the authoritarian cast of the Meiji Restoration, concludes that all lessons of history \"warned the Meiji statesmen that there was to be no half-way house between the status of a subject nation and that of a growing, victorious empire.\"' 12 General Ishiwara Kanji forcefully made that same point at the Tokyo war-crimes trials in May 1946, when he challenged an American prosecutor with these words: Haven't you heard of Perry [Commodore Matthew Perry of the U.S. navy, who negotiated the first U.S.-Japan trade treaty]? Don't you know anything about your country's history? . . . Tokugawa Japan believed in isolation; it didn't want to have anything to do with other countries and had its doors locked tightly. Then along came Perry from 174 T H I T R A G I D Y OP G R I AT P O W E R P O L I T I C S your country in his black ships to open those doors; he aimed his big guns at Japan and warned, \"If you don't deal with us, look out for these: open your doors, and negotiate with other countries too.\" And then when Japan did open its doors and tried dealing with other countries, it learned that all those countries were a fearfully aggressive lot. And so for its own defense it took your country as its teacher and set about learning how to be aggressive. You might say we became your disciples. Why don't you subpoena Perry from the other world and try him as a war criminal?13 Targets and Rivals Japan was principally concerned with controlling three areas on the Asian mainland: Korea, Manchuria, and China. Korea was the primary target because it is located a short distance from Japan (see Map 6.1). Most Japanese policymakers surely agreed with the German officer who described Korea as \"a dagger thrust at the heart of Japan.\"14 Manchuria was number two on Japan's target list, because it, too, is located just across the Sea of Japan. China was a more distant threat than either Korea or Manchuria, but it was still an important concern because it had the potential to dominate all of Asia if it ever got its act together and modernized its economic and political systems. At the very least, Japan wanted to keep China weak and divided. Japan was also interested at different times in acquiring territory in Outer Mongolia and Russia. Moreover, Japan sought to conquer large portions of Southeast Asia and, indeed, accomplished that goal in the early years of World War II. Furthermore, Japan had its sights on several islands that lie off the Asian continent. They included Formosa (now Taiwan), the Pescadores, Hainan, and the Ryukyus.",

    "text": "In the first few decades after the Meiji Restoration, Japanese foreign policy focused on Korea, which remained isolated from the outside world, although it was still loosely viewed as a tributary state of China. Japan was determined to open up Korea diplomatically and economically, much the way the Western powers had opened up Japan at mid-century. But the Koreans resisted Japan's overtures, prompting a fierce debate in Japan between 1868 and 1873 over whether to use force to accomplish that end. The decision was ultimately made to forego war and concentrate instead on domestic reform. A Japanese surveying team, however, clashed with Korean coastal forces in 1875. War was narrowly averted when Korea accepted the Treaty of Kang-wah (February 1876), which opened three Korean ports to Japanese commerce and declared Korea an independent state. Nevertheless, China still considered Korea its vassal state, which inevitably led to an intense rivalry between China and Japan over Korea. Indeed, fighting broke out in late 1884 between Chinese and Japanese troops stationed in Seoul. But war was averted because both sides feared that the European great powers would take advantage of them if they fought with each other. Nevertheless, Sino-Japanese competition over Korea continued, and in the summer of 1894 another crisis broke out. This time, Japan decided to go to war against China and settle the issue on the battlefield. Japan quickly defeated China and imposed a harsh peace treaty on the losers. With the Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895, China ceded the Liaodong Peninsula, Formosa, and the Pescadores to Japan. The Liaodong Peninsula was part of Manchuria and included the important city of Port Arthur. Furthermore, China was forced to recognize Korea's independence, which effectively meant that Korea would become a ward of Japan, not China. Japan also received important commercial rights in China and exacted a large indemnity from China, leaving little doubt that Japan was bent on becoming a major player in Asian politics. The great powers, especially Russia, were alarmed by Japan's growing power and its sudden expansion on the Asian continent. Russia, France, and Germany decided to rectify the situation; a few days after the peace treaty was signed, they forced Japan to return the Liaodong Peninsula to China. The Russians were determined to prevent Japan from controlling any part of Manchuria because they intended to control it themselves. Russia also made it clear that it would contest Japan for control of Korea. Japan was allowed to keep Formosa and the Pescadores. With this \"Triple Intervention,\" Russia replaced China as Japan's rival for control of Korea and Manchuria.",

    "text": "By the early twentieth century, Russia was the dominant force in Manchuria, having moved large numbers of troops there during the Boxer Rebellion (1900). Neither Japan nor Russia was able to gain the upper hand in Korea, mainly because Korean policymakers skillfully played the two great powers off against each other so as to avoid being devoured by either side. Japan found this strategic landscape unacceptable and offered the Russians a simple deal: Russia could dominate Manchuria if Japan could control Korea. But Russia said no, and Japan moved to rectify the problem by going to war against Russia in early February 1904. Japan won a resounding victory at sea and on land, which was reflected in the peace treaty that was signed at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on September 5, 1905. Russia's influence in Korea was ended, ensuring that Japan would now dominate the Korean Peninsula. Moreover, Russia transferred the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, including control of the South Manchuria Railway. Russia also surrendered the southern half of Sakhalin Island to Japan; Russia had controlled it since 1875. Japan had reversed the outcome of the Triple Intervention and gained a large foothold on the Asian continent. Japan moved quickly to consolidate its gains, annexing Korea in August 1910. Japan had to proceed more cautiously in Manchuria, however, because Russia still maintained a large army in Northeast Asia and a serious interest in Manchuria. Moreover, the United States was alarmed by Japan's growing might and sought to contain it by keeping Russia strong and using it as a balancing force against Japan. Faced with this new strategic environment, Japan agreed with Russia in July 1907 to divide Manchuria into separate spheres of influence. Japan also recognized Russia's special interests in Outer Mongolia, while Russia recognized Japan's domination of Korea. Japan continued its offensive ways when World War I broke out on August 1, 1914. Japan entered the war on the Allies' side within the month and quickly conquered the Pacific islands controlled by Germany (the Marshalls, the Carolines, and the Marianas), as well as the German-controlled city of Tsingtao on China's Shandong Peninsula. China, which was then in the midst of major political turmoil and in a precarious strategic position, asked Japan to return control of those cities to China. Japan not only refused the request but, in January 1915, it presented China with the infamous \"Twenty-one Demands,\" which called for China to make major economic and political concessions to Japan that would have eventually turned China into a Japanese vassal state like Korea. The United States forced Japan to abandon its most radical demands, and China grudgingly agreed to Japan's more limited demands in May 1915. It was apparent from these events that Japan was bent on dominating China sooner rather than later.",

    "text": "Germany was powerful enough to set alarm bells ringing in the United Kingdom, France, and Russia when there was even a hint that it might go on the offensive, but it was not yet powerful enough to fight all three of its great-power rivals at once. So Germany was forced to accept the status quo from 1870 to 1900. By 1903, however, Germany was a potential hegemon. It controlled a larger percentage of European industrial might than did any other state, including the United Kingdom, and the German army was the most powerful in the world. It now had the capability to consider going on the offensive to gain more power. It is not surprising that at about this time Germany began to think seriously about altering the European balance of power and becoming a world power.\nGermany's first serious move to challenge the status quo was its decision at the turn of the century to build a formidable navy that would challenge the United Kingdom's command of the world's oceans and allow it to pursue Weltpolitik. The result was a naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany that lasted until World War I. Germany initiated a major crisis with France over Morocco in March 1905. Its aim was to isolate France from the United Kingdom and Russia and prevent them from forming a balancing coalition against Germany. In fact, the crisis backfired on Germany and those three states formed the Triple Entente. Although Germany's leaders did not start the so-called Bosnian crisis in October 1908, they intervened on Austria-Hungary's behalf and forced the crisis to the brink of war before Russia backed down and accepted a humiliating defeat in March 1909. Germany initiated a second crisis over Morocco in July 1911, and again the aim was to isolate and humiliate France. It too did not work: Germany was forced to back down and the Triple Entente tightened. Most important, Germany's leaders were principally responsible for starting World War I in the summer of 1914. Their aim was to defeat Germany's great-power rivals decisively and redraw the map of Europe to ensure German hegemony for the foreseeable future.",

The German army was so weak in the 1920s that German leaders seriously feared an invasion by the Polish army, which had attacked the Soviet Union in 1920 and defeated the Red Army. Although Germany was in no position to acquire territory by force, virtually all of its leaders during the Weimar period were committed to upsetting the status quo and at least gaining back the territory in Belgium and Poland that had been taken from Germany at the end of World War I. They were also intent on restoring German military might.

He signed both the Locarno Pact (December 1, 1925) and the Kellogg-Briand Pact (August 27, 1928), which were attempts to foster international cooperation and eliminate war as a tool of statecraft. He also brought Germany into the League of Nations (September 8, 1926) and rarely spoke about using force to upset the balance of power. Nevertheless, there is a broad consensus among scholars that Stresemann was no idealist but was instead \"a convinced adherent of the doctrine that Machtpolitik was the sole determining factor in international relations and that only a nation's power potential could determine its standing in the world.\" Moreover, he was deeply committed to expanding Germany's borders. He signed nonaggression treaties and used accommodating language with the United Kingdom and France because he thought that clever diplomacy was the only way that a militarily feeble Germany could get back some of its lost territory. If Germany had possessed a formidable army during his tenure at the foreign ministry, he almost certainly would have used it—or threatened to use it—to gain territory for Germany.",

Finally, during the Cold War, Soviet policymakers were determined to win allies and gain influence in virtually every area of the Third World, including Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and the South Asian subcontinent. Moscow was not bent on conquering and controlling territory in those less-developed regions, however. Instead, it sought client states that would be useful in its global competition with the United States.\n\nThe Soviet Union was engaged in a desperate fight for survival during the first three years of its existence (1917-20). Immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution, Lenin pulled the Soviet Union out of World War I, but in the process, he was forced to make huge territorial concessions to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 15, 1918). Shortly thereafter, the Western allies, who were still fighting against Germany on the western front, inserted ground forces into the Soviet Union. Their aim was to force the Soviet Union to rejoin the war against Germany. That did not happen, however, in large part because the German army was defeated on the battlefield in the late summer and early fall of 1918, and World War I ended on November 11, 1918. Germany's defeat was good news for the Soviet leaders because it spelled the death of the Brest-Litovsk treaty, which had robbed the Soviet Union of so much of its territory. Moscow's troubles were far from over, however. A bloody civil war between the Bolsheviks and various rival groups had broken out in the first months of 1918. To make matters worse, the Western allies supported the anti-Bolshevik forces, also known as the \"Whites,\" in their fight with the Bolshevik \"Reds\" and kept their intervention forces in the Soviet Union until the summer of 1920. Although the Bolsheviks sometimes appeared to be on the verge of losing the civil war, the balance of power shifted decisively against the Whites in early 1920, and it was then only a matter of time before they were defeated.",

For example, the Soviet Union controlled a mere 2 percent of European industrial might by 1920. But Moscow did pay some attention to foreign affairs. In particular, it maintained close relations with Germany from April 1922, when the Treaty of Rapallo was signed, until Hitler came to power in early 1933. Although both states were deeply interested in altering the territorial status quo, neither possessed a serious offensive military capability. Soviet leaders also made an effort in the 1920s to spread communism around the globe. But they were always careful not to provoke the other great powers into moving against the Soviet Union and threatening its survival. Virtually all of these efforts to foment revolution, whether in Asia or Europe, came up short. Probably the most important Soviet initiative of the 1920s was Stalin's decision to modernize the Soviet economy through forced industrialization and the ruthless collectivization of agriculture. He was motivated in large part by security concerns. In particular, he believed that if the Soviet economy continued to lag behind those of the world's other industrialized states, the Soviet Union would be destroyed in a future great-power war.",

He was a cautious expansionist during the early Cold War, targeting Iran, Turkey, Eastern Europe, and South Korea.  The Soviets occupied northern Iran during World War II, alongside British and American occupation of southern Iran. All three powers agreed to evacuate within six months of Japan's defeat. The US and UK withdrew on schedule, but Moscow supported separatist movements among Azeri and Kurdish populations and the Tudeh Party. Following pressure, Stalin withdrew in 1946. Stalin demanded the return of Ardahan and Kars from Turkey and military bases to control the Dardanelles. He massed troops on the Turkish border, but these demands were never met due to US resistance. Eastern Europe was the primary area of Soviet expansion due to Red Army conquests. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, eastern Poland, part of East Prussia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, Subcarpathian Ruthenia, and Finnish territory were incorporated into the Soviet Union. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Romania became satellite states, followed by Czechoslovakia and East Germany.  Finland and Yugoslavia escaped Soviet domination due to their demonstrated resistance during World War II and willingness to remain neutral.  The Soviet Union also expanded influence in Northeast Asia, aiding Chinese Communists and supporting North Korea's invasion of South Korea. By the early 1950s, US containment policy limited Soviet expansion in key areas.  Stalin's support for North Korea marked the last major Soviet-sponsored aggression in those regions. Subsequent expansion attempts were confined to the Third World, facing US resistance.",

Initial scholarship attributed this to a change in Soviet thinking, emphasizing cooperation over power maximization.  However, emerging evidence suggests the Soviet Union's collapse was largely due to its failing economy, unable to compete with major powers. Seeking Western technology, Soviet leaders reduced East-West competition, liberalized politically, and reduced Third World involvement.  This backfired as political liberalization fueled nationalism, leading to the Soviet Union's disintegration. Contrary to initial interpretations, Soviet leaders' actions aligned with the historical pattern of states maximizing power for security.",

Its aggressive intentions focused on North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia), the Horn of Africa (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somaliland), the southern Balkans (Albania, Corfu, the Dodecanese Islands, parts of southwestern Turkey), southern Austria-Hungary (Dalmatia, Istria, Trentino, Venetia), and southeastern France (Corsica, Nice, Savoy).  Italy's main rivals were Austria-Hungary (until 1918) and France. The decaying Ottoman Empire also factored into Italy's calculations.  Italy's military was weak, hindering direct confrontation with other great powers.  Italian leaders relied on diplomacy, forming alliances and playing powers against each other. They believed Italy's military could tip the balance of power, prompting concessions.  World War I exemplifies this strategy.  Italy remained neutral initially, negotiating with both sides before joining the Allies in 1915 for better territorial concessions.",

    "text": "Hitler all lost their bids to dominate Europe, each won major battlefield victories, conquered huge tracts of territory, and came close to achieving their goals. Only Japan stood little chance of winning hegemony on the battlefield. But as we shall see, Japanese policymakers knew that they would probably lose, and went to war only because the United States left them with no reasonable alternative. Critics of offensive policies claim that balancing coalitions form to defeat aspiring hegemons, but history shows that such coalitions are difficult to put together in a timely and efficient manner. Threatened states prefer to buck-pass to each other rather than form an alliance against their dangerous foe. For example, the balancing coalitions that finished off Napoleonic France and Nazi Germany came together only after these aggressors had conquered much of Europe. Moreover, in both cases, the defensive alliances did not form until after the drive for hegemony had been blunted by a significant military defeat in Russia, which effectively fought both Napoleon and Hitler without allies. The difficulty of constructing effective defensive alliances sometimes provides powerful states with opportunities for aggression.\nFinally, the claim that great powers should have learned from the historical record that attempts at regional hegemony are doomed is not persuasive. Not only does the American case contradict the basic point, but it is hard to apply the argument to the first states that made a run at regional hegemony. After all, they had few precedents, and the evidence from the earliest cases was mixed. Wilhelmine Germany, for example, could look at both Napoleonic France, which failed, and the United States, which succeeded. It is hard to argue that German policymakers should have read history to say that they were sure to lose if they attempted to conquer Europe. One might concede that point but argue that Hitler certainly should have known better, because he could see that Wilhelmine Germany as well as Napoleonic France had failed to conquer Europe. But, as discussed below, what Hitler learned from those cases was not that aggression did not pay, but rather that he should not repeat his predecessor's mistakes when the Third Reich made its run at hegemony. Learning, in other words, does not always lead to choosing a peaceful outcome.\nThus, the pursuit of regional hegemony is not a quixotic ambition, although there is no denying that it is difficult to achieve. Since the security benefits of hegemony are enormous, powerful states will invariably be tempted to emulate the United States and try to dominate their region of the world.",

    "text": "The indictment against the Kaiserreich for engaging in self-defeating behavior has two counts. First, its aggressive actions caused the United Kingdom, France, and Russia to form an alliance—the Triple Entente—against Germany. Thus, it is guilty of self-encirclement. Second, Germany then started a war with that balancing coalition in 1914 that it was almost sure to lose. Not only did Germany have to fight a two-front war as a result of its self-encirclement, but it had no good military strategy for quickly and decisively defeating its rivals.\nThese charges do not bear up under close inspection. There is no doubt that Germany made certain moves that helped cause the Triple Entente. Like all great powers, Germany had good strategic reasons for wanting to expand its borders, and it sometimes provoked its rivals, especially after 1900. Nevertheless, a close look at how the Entente was formed reveals that the main driving force behind its creation was Germany’s growing economic and military might, not its aggressive behavior. Consider what motivated France and Russia to come together between 1890 and 1894, and then what motivated the United Kingdom to join them between 1905 and 1907. As noted, both France and Russia worried about Germany’s growing power during the 1870s and 1880s. Bismarck himself feared that they might form an alliance against Germany. After Russia threatened to come to France’s aid during the “War in Sight Crisis” (1875), Bismarck built an alliance structure that was designed to isolate France from the other European great powers. Although he successfully kept France and Russia from allying against Germany during his tenure in office, Russia probably would not have stood by and watched Germany defeat France, as it had in 1870–71. Indeed, it was apparent by the late 1880s that France and Russia were likely to form an alliance against Germany in the near future, whether Bismarck remained in power or not. Soon after Bismarck left office in March 1890, France and Russia began negotiating an alliance, which was put in place four years later. But Germany did not behave offensively in the years before or immediately after Bismarck left office. His successors precipitated no significant crises between 1890 and 1900. So it is hard to argue in this instance that aggressive German behavior caused self-encirclement.",

    "text": "Germany fought two world wars in the first half of the twentieth century in an attempt to become a European hegemon. In each case, it came close to achieving its goal but ultimately failed. The most important reason for its failure in World War I was the entry of the United States into the war in April 1917. Although the United States did not make a large contribution to Allied military power until the spring of 1918, its entry into the war effectively meant that the Allies had access to almost unlimited manpower and material resources. The Germans understood that time was not on their side, which is why they launched a massive offensive in the spring of 1918 in an attempt to win the war before American power could be fully brought to bear against them.  That gamble ultimately failed.\n\nGermany's defeat in World War II resulted from a series of mistakes, the most important being the decision to invade the Soviet Union in June 1941.  Before then, Germany was on a roll.  Its army, the Wehrmacht, conquered France in just six weeks in May-June 1940, which ranks as one of the most stunning military victories of all time.  Hitler's Wehrmacht also won stunning victories against minor powers: Poland, Norway, Yugoslavia, and Greece. If Hitler had died in July 1940 after France capitulated, he probably would be considered \"one of the greatest of German statesmen.\" Fortunately, Hitler made a critical mistake that led to the destruction of the Third Reich: invading the Soviet Union. The German blitzkrieg failed to produce a quick and decisive victory, resulting in a savage war of attrition on the eastern front, which the Wehrmacht eventually lost to the Red Army.  The United States entered the war in December 1941 and, along with the United Kingdom, eventually opened up a second front in the west.",

The evidence, however, does not support this interpretation.  There was little resistance among the German elite to Hitler's decision; in fact, there was considerable enthusiasm.  Some German generals were dissatisfied with aspects of the final plan, and a few thought the Red Army might not succumb to the blitzkrieg.  Nevertheless, there was a powerful consensus within the German elite that the Wehrmacht would quickly rout the Soviets.  This belief was also widely held in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Indeed, there were seemingly good reasons to think that the Red Army would collapse: Stalin’s purges in the late 1930s had reduced its fighting power, and the Red Army performed badly in its war against Finland (1939-40).  The Wehrmacht, by contrast, was a finely tuned fighting force by June 1941. In the end, Hitler and his lieutenants simply miscalculated. They made a wrong decision, not an irrational one.",

Japan had picked fights with the Red Army in 1938 and 1939 and lost both times, after which it stopped provoking the Soviet Union.  Japan invaded China in 1937 and became involved in a lengthy war it was unable to win. However, Japan was reluctantly drawn into that conflict, and its leaders were confident that China would be easily defeated. Although they were wrong, Japan's failure to win a victory in China was hardly a catastrophic failure. Nor was the Sino-Japanese War the catalyst that put the the United States on a collision course with Japan. American policymakers were clearly unhappy about Japanese aggression in China, but the United States remained on the sidelines. Two stunning events in Europe—the fall of France in June 1940 and especially Nazi Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941—drove the United States to confront Japan, eventually leading to Pearl Harbor. The Wehrmacht’s victory in the west forced a weakened United Kingdom to concentrate on defending itself against Germany. Since European powers controlled most of Southeast Asia, that resource-rich region was now an open target for Japanese expansion. The United States was determined to prevent Japan from dominating Asia and thus in the summer of 1940 began working to deter further Japanese expansion.",

Most American policymakers believed that the Wehrmacht was likely to defeat the Red Army, making Germany the hegemon in Europe. A Nazi victory would also have left Japan as the hegemon in Asia. Thus, if the Soviets lost, the United States would have found itself confronting hostile hegemons in both Asia and Europe. The United States was determined to avoid that scenario, meaning the Soviet Union had to survive.  American policymakers worried that Japan would attack the Soviet Union from the east. To preclude that possibility, the United States put tremendous economic and diplomatic pressure on Japan in the latter half of 1941. The aim was not simply to deter Japan from striking the Soviet Union, but also to coerce Japan into abandoning China, Indochina, and possibly Manchuria, and any ambition to dominate Asia. The United States was well-positioned to coerce Japan, which was heavily dependent on American imports, including 80 percent of its fuel and over 90 percent of its gasoline. On July 26, 1941, the United States and its allies froze Japan’s assets, leading to a full-scale embargo.

After all, the United States had done little to stop Japanese expansion in the 1930s, and isolationism was still a powerful ideology in America. As late as August 1941, an extension of the one-year term of service for those who were drafted in 1940 passed the House of Representatives by only one vote.\nBut the Japanese were not fools. They knew that the United States was more likely than not to fight and likely to win the ensuing war. They were willing to take that incredibly risky gamble, however, because caving in to American demands seemed to be an even worse alternative.\nMy final test of offensive realism is to examine whether its prediction that great powers seek nuclear superiority is correct. The opposing position, which is closely identified with the defensive realists, is that once nuclear-armed rivals find themselves operating in a MAD world—that is, a world in which each side has the capability to destroy the other side after absorbing a first strike—they should willingly accept the status quo and not pursue nuclear advantage. States should therefore not build counterforce weapons or defensive systems that could neutralize the other side’s retaliatory capability and undermine MAD.\nAn examination of the superpowers’ nuclear policies during the Cold War thus provides an ideal case for assessing these competing realist perspectives. The historical record makes it clear that offensive realism better accounts for the nuclear policies of the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Neither superpower accepted the defensive realists’ advice about the virtues of MAD. Instead, both sides developed and deployed large, sophisticated counterforce arsenals, either to gain nuclear advantage or to prevent the other side from doing so. Moreover, both sides sought to develop defenses against the other side’s nuclear weapons, as well as elaborate clever strategies for fighting and winning a nuclear war.",

    "text": "U.S. Nuclear Policy\nThe nuclear arms race between the superpowers did not become serious until about 1950. The United States enjoyed a nuclear monopoly in the early years of the Cold War, and the Soviet Union did not explode its first nuclear device until August 1949. Thus, concepts such as counterforce were irrelevant in the late 1940s, because the Soviets had no nuclear weapons for the United States to target. The main concern of American strategists during this period was how to stop the Red Army from overrunning Western Europe. They believed that the best way to deal with that threat was to launch a nuclear bombing campaign against the Soviet industrial base.\nAfter the Soviets developed the atomic bomb, the United States sought to develop a splendid first-strike capability—that is, a strike that would preemptively destroy all of the Soviets’ nuclear capabilities in one fell swoop. American nuclear policy during the 1950s was called “massive retaliation,” although that label was probably a misnomer, since the word “retaliation” implies that the United States planned to wait to strike the Soviet Union until after absorbing a Soviet nuclear strike. In fact, there is considerable evidence that the United States intended to launch its nuclear weapons first in a crisis in order to eliminate the small Soviet nuclear force before it could get off the ground.\nIt would thus be more accurate to define U.S. nuclear policy in the 1950s as “massive preemption” rather than massive retaliation. Regardless, the key point is that during the 1950s, the United States was committed to gaining nuclear superiority over the Soviet Union.\nNevertheless, the United States did not achieve a first-strike capability against the Soviet nuclear arsenal during either the 1950s or the early 1960s. Granted, had the United States struck first in a nuclear exchange during that period, it would have inflicted much greater damage on the Soviet Union than vice versa. And American planners certainly did put forth plausible best-case scenarios in which a U.S. first strike eliminated almost all of the Soviet Union’s nuclear retaliatory force, thus raising doubts about whether Moscow truly had an assured-destruction capability. The United States, in other words, was close to having a first-strike capability. Still, most American policymakers at the time believed that the United States was likely to suffer unacceptable damage in a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, even if that damage fell short of total destruction of the United States.",

    "text": "By the early 1960s, however, it was readily apparent that the growing size and diversity of the Soviet nuclear arsenal meant that it would soon be impossible, given existing technology, for the United States seriously to contemplate disarming the Soviet Union with a nuclear first strike. Moscow was on the verge of developing an invulnerable and robust second-strike capability, which would put the superpowers squarely in a MAD world. How did American policymakers view this development, and how did they respond to it? They were not only deeply unhappy about it, but for the remainder of the Cold War, they devoted considerable resources to escaping MAD and gaining a nuclear advantage over the Soviet Union.\nConsider the sheer number of Soviet targets that the United States was planning to strike in a nuclear war, a number that went far beyond the requirements of MAD. It was generally agreed that to have an assured-destruction capability, the United States, after absorbing a Soviet first strike, had to be able to destroy about 30 percent of the Soviet Union’s population and about 70 percent of its industry. That level of destruction could have been achieved by destroying the 200 largest cities in the Soviet Union. This task required about 400 one-megaton weapons, or an equivalent mix of weapons and megatonnage (hereinafter referred to as 400 EMT). However, the actual number of Soviet targets that the United States planned to destroy far exceeded the 200 cities required for assured destruction. For example, SIOP-5, the actual military plan for employing nuclear weapons that took effect on January 1, 1976, listed 25,000 potential targets. SIOP-6, which the Reagan administration approved on October 1, 1983, contained a staggering 50,000 potential targets.",

    "text": "Although the United States never acquired the capability to hit all of those potential targets at once, it deployed a huge arsenal of nuclear weapons, which grew steadily in size from the early 1960s until the Cold War ended in 1990. Moreover, most of those weapons had significant counterforce capability because American strategic planners were not content merely to incinerate 200 Soviet cities but were determined to destroy a large portion of the Soviet Union’s retaliatory capability as well. For example, 3,127 nuclear bombs and warheads were in the U.S. inventory in December 1960, when SIOP-62 (the first SIOP) was approved. Twenty-three years later, when SIOP-6 was put into effect, the strategic nuclear arsenal had grown to include 10,802 weapons. Although the United States needed a reasonably large retaliatory force for assured-destruction purposes—because it had to assume that some of its nuclear weapons might be lost to a Soviet first strike—there is no question that the size of the American nuclear arsenal during the last twenty-five years of the Cold War went far beyond the 400 EMT required to destroy 200 Soviet cities.\nThe United States also pushed hard to develop technologies that would give it an advantage at the nuclear level. For example, it went to considerable lengths to improve the lethality of its counterforce weapons. The United States was especially concerned with improving missile accuracy, a concern that its weapons designers allayed with great success. America also pioneered the development of MIRVs (multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicles), which allowed it to increase significantly the number of strategic warheads in its inventory. By the end of the Cold War, the “hard-target kill capability” of U.S. ballistic missiles—that is, U.S. counterforce capability—had reached the point at which the survivability of the Soviets’ land-based missile silos was in question. Washington also invested heavily in protecting its command-and-control systems from attack, thus augmenting its capability to wage a controlled nuclear war. In addition, the United States pushed hard, if unsuccessfully, to develop effective ballistic missile defenses. American policymakers sometimes said that the ultimate purpose of missile defense was to move away from a nuclear world that prized offense to a safer, defense-dominant world, but the truth is that they wanted defenses to facilitate winning a nuclear war at a reasonable cost.",

    "text": "Finally, the United States came up with an alternative to the strategy of massive retaliation that, it hoped, would allow it to wage and win a nuclear war against the Soviet Union. This alternative strategy was first formulated by the Kennedy administration in 1961 and came to be known as “limited nuclear options.” The new policy assumed that neither superpower could eliminate the other side’s assured-destruction capability, but that they could still engage in limited nuclear exchanges with their counterforce weapons. The United States would aim to avoid striking Soviet cities so as to limit civilian deaths and would concentrate instead on achieving victory by dominating the Soviet Union in the limited counterforce exchanges that were at the heart of the strategy. It was hoped that the Soviets would fight according to the same rules. This new policy was codified in SIOP-63, which took effect on August 1, 1962. There were four important successor SIOPs over the remainder of the Cold War, and each new SIOP essentially provided smaller, more precise, and more select counterforce options than its predecessor, as well as command-and-control improvements that would facilitate fighting a limited nuclear war. The ultimate aim of these refinements, of course, was to ensure that the United States had an advantage over the Soviet Union in a nuclear war.\nIn sum, the evidence is overwhelming that the United States did not abandon its efforts to gain nuclear superiority during the last twenty-five years of the Cold War. Nevertheless, it did not gain a meaningful advantage over the Soviets. In fact, it did not come as close to achieving that goal as it had during the 1950s and early 1960s.",

    "text": "Soviet Nuclear Policy\nAlthough we know less about the Soviet side of the story than we do about the American side, it is not difficult to determine whether the Soviets sought nuclear advantage over the United States or were content to live in a MAD world. We not only have details on the size and composition of the Soviet nuclear arsenal during the course of the Cold War but also have access to a large body of Soviet literature that lays out Moscow’s thinking on nuclear strategy.\nThe Soviet Union, like the United States, built a massive nuclear arsenal with abundant counterforce capability. The Soviets, however, were late bloomers. They did not explode their first nuclear weapon until August 1949, and their arsenal grew slowly in the 1950s. During that decade, the Soviet Union lagged behind the United States in developing and deploying nuclear weapons, as well as the systems to deliver them. By 1960 the Soviet inventory contained only 354 strategic nuclear weapons, compared to 3,127 for the United States. But the Soviet force grew rapidly during the 1960s. By 1970 it numbered 2,216; ten years later it numbered 7,480. Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev’s “new thinking” notwithstanding, the Soviet Union added almost 4,000 bombs and warheads to its nuclear inventory during the 1980s, ending up with 11,320 strategic nuclear weapons in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall came down.\nFurthermore, most Soviet strategists apparently believed that their country had to be prepared to fight and win a nuclear war. This is not to say that Soviet leaders were eager to fight such a war or that they were confident that they could gain a meaningful victory. Soviet strategists understood that nuclear war would involve untold destruction.",

    "text": "I have reserved discussion of the American and British cases for a separate chapter because they might appear to provide the strongest evidence against my claim that great powers are dedicated to maximizing their share of world power. Many Americans certainly view their country as a truly exceptional great power that has been motivated largely by noble intentions, not balance-of-power logic. Even important realist thinkers such as Norman Graebner, George Kennan, and Walter Lippmann believe that the United States has frequently ignored the imperatives of power politics and instead acted in accordance with idealist values.\nThis same perspective is evident in the United Kingdom, which is why E. H. Carr wrote The Twenty Years' Crisis in the late 1930s. He was warning his fellow citizens about their excessive idealism in foreign policy matters and reminding them that competition for power among states is the essence of international politics.\nThere are three particular instances where it might seem that the United Kingdom and the United States passed up opportunities to gain power. First, it is usually said that the United States achieved great-power status in about 1898, when it won the Spanish-American War, which gave it control over the fate of Cuba, Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico, and also when it began building a sizable military machine. By 1850, however, the United States already stretched from the Atlantic to the Pacific and, as was shown in Table 6.2, clearly possessed the economic wherewithal to become a great power and compete around the globe with Europe's major powers. Yet it did not build powerful military forces between 1850 and 1898, and it made little effort to conquer territory in the Western Hemisphere, much less outside of it. Fareed Zakaria describes this period as a case of \"imperial understretch.\" The seeming failure of the United States to become a great power and pursue a policy of conquest in the second half of the nineteenth century might seem to contradict offensive realism.\nSecond, the United States was no ordinary great power by 1900. It had the most powerful economy in the world and it had clearly gained hegemony in the Western Hemisphere (see Table 6.2). Although neither of those conditions changed over the course of the twentieth century, the United States did not attempt to conquer territory in Europe or Northeast Asia or dominate those wealth-producing regions of the world. If anything, the United States has been anxious to avoid sending troops to Europe and Northeast Asia, and when it has been forced to do so, it has usually been anxious to bring them back home as soon as possible. This reluctance to expand into Europe and Asia might appear to contradict my claim that states try to maximize their relative power.\nThird, the United Kingdom had substantially more potential power than any other European state during most of the nineteenth century. In fact, between 1840 and 1860, Britain controlled nearly 70 percent of European industrial might, almost five times more than France, its closest competitor (see Table 3.3). Nevertheless, the United Kingdom did not translate its abundant wealth into actual military might and attempt to dominate Europe. In a world where great powers are supposed to have an insatiable appetite for power and ultimately aim for regional hegemony, one might expect the United Kingdom to have acted like Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union and pushed hard to become Europe's hegemon. But it did not.",

    "text": "The notion that the United Kingdom and the United States have not been power maximizers over much of the past two centuries is intuitively appealing at first glance. The fact is, however, both states have consistently acted as offensive realism would predict. American foreign policy throughout the nineteenth century had one overarching goal: achieving hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. That task, which was motivated in good part by realist logic, involved building a powerful United States that could dominate the other independent states of North and South America and also prevent the European great powers from projecting their military might across the Atlantic Ocean. The American drive for hegemony was successful. Indeed, as emphasized earlier, the United States is the only state in modern times to have gained regional hegemony. This impressive achievement, not some purported noble behavior toward the outside world, is the real basis of American exceptionalism in the foreign policy realm.\nThere was no good strategic reason for the United States to acquire more territory in the Western Hemisphere after 1850, as it had already acquired a huge land mass over which its rule needed to be consolidated. Once that happened, the United States would be overwhelmingly powerful in the Americas. The United States paid little attention to the balance of power in Europe and Northeast Asia during the second half of the nineteenth century, not only because it was focused on gaining regional hegemony, but also because there were no potential peer competitors to worry about in either region.\nFinally, the United States did not build large and formidable military forces between 1850 and 1898 because there was no significant opposition to the growth of American power in those years. The United Kingdom kept few troops in North America, and the Native Americans possessed little military might. In essence, the United States was able to gain regional hegemony on the cheap.\nThe United States did not attempt to conquer territory in either Europe or Northeast Asia during the twentieth century because of the difficulty of projecting military forces across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans against the great powers located in those regions. Every great power would like to dominate the world, but none has ever had or is likely to have the military capability to become a global hegemon. Thus, the ultimate goal of great powers is to achieve regional hegemony and block the rise of peer competitors in distant areas of the globe.",

    "text": "States achieving regional hegemony often act as offshore balancers in other regions. These distant hegemons typically prefer allowing local powers to contain aspiring hegemons, intervening only when necessary.  American military interventions in Europe and Northeast Asia during the 20th century exemplify this pattern. The US intervened to check potential peer competitors and maintain its unique status as the sole regional hegemon. Hegemons are inherently status quo powers, and the US consistently sought to preserve the existing order. American policymakers initially attempted to delegate balancing responsibilities to other great powers. However, when this buck-passing strategy failed, the US employed its military to eliminate the threat, restore a balance of power, and subsequently withdraw its forces.  The United Kingdom, despite possessing a vast empire outside Europe, never sought to dominate the continent. This restraint, even at the height of its power in the mid-19th century, can be attributed to the same geographical constraints faced by the United States: the stopping power of water. Both the US and the UK, as insular powers, found it impractical to conquer and control all of Europe. However, the UK consistently acted as an offshore balancer in Europe, intervening militarily when a rival threatened continental domination and buck-passing proved unfeasible. Otherwise, the British army largely remained off the continent during periods of relative stability. Thus, neither the UK nor the US attempted territorial conquest in Europe during modern times, and both functioned as balancers of last resort in the region.",

While avoiding European entanglements, the US prioritized security and foreign policy within the Americas, aggressively expanding its territory and influence. This expansionist drive aligns with the principles of offensive realism. In 1800, the US faced a precarious strategic situation. While it controlled territory east of the Mississippi River (excluding Spanish Florida), much of this land remained sparsely populated and contested by Native American tribes.  Great Britain and Spain held vast empires in North America, controlling most of the territory west of the Mississippi and surrounding the US to the north and south. By 1900, however, the US had achieved hemispheric hegemony, controlling a vast expanse from the Atlantic to the Pacific. European empires had receded, replaced by independent states like Argentina, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico, none of which possessed the capacity to challenge the burgeoning economic and military power of the United States.  The US attained regional hegemony through two interconnected policies: westward expansion across North America (Manifest Destiny) and minimizing European influence in the Americas (Monroe Doctrine).",

This expansion involved key acquisitions: the Louisiana Purchase from France in 1803, which doubled the nation's size; the annexation of Florida from Spain in 1819; the annexation of Texas in 1845; the acquisition of the Oregon Territory from the UK in 1846; and the conquest of California and the Southwest from Mexico in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848). These acquisitions dramatically increased US territory. Although continental expansion was largely complete by the late 1840s, the US later acquired a small portion of territory from Mexico (Gadsden Purchase) and purchased Alaska from Russia.

The United States had little need for more territory after 1848—at least for security reasons. So its leaders concentrated instead on forging a powerful state inside its existing borders. This consolidation process, which was sometimes brutal and bloody, involved four major steps: fighting the Civil War to eliminate slavery and the threat of dissolution of the union; displacing the Natives who controlled much of the land that the United States had recently acquired; bringing large numbers of immigrants to the United States to help populate its vast expanses of territory; and building the world's largest economy.\nDuring the first six decades of the nineteenth century, there was constant friction between North and South over the slavery issue, especially as it applied to the newly acquired territories west of the Mississippi. Indeed, the issue was so poisonous that it threatened to tear apart the United States, a result that would have had profound consequences for the balance of power in the Western Hemisphere. Matters finally came to a head in 1861, when the Civil War broke out. The North, which was fighting to hold the United States together, fared badly at first but eventually recovered and won a decisive victory. Slavery was quickly ended in all parts of the United States, and despite the ill will generated by the war, the country emerged a coherent whole that has since remained firmly intact. Had the Confederacy triumphed, the United States would not have become a regional hegemon, since there would have been at least two great powers in North America. This situation would have created opportunities for the European great powers to increase their political presence and influence in the Western Hemisphere.",

The Natives hardly stood a chance of stopping the United States from taking their land. The Natives had a number of disadvantages, but most important, they were greatly outnumbered by white Americans and their situation only grew worse with time. In 1800, for example, about 178,000 Natives lived within the borders of the United States, which then extended to the Mississippi River. At the same time, the population of the United States was roughly 5.3 million. Not surprisingly, the U.S army had little trouble crushing the Natives east of the Mississippi, taking their land, and pushing many of them west of the Mississippi in the first few decades of the nineteenth century. By 1850, when the present borders of the continental United States were largely in place, there were about 665,000 Native Americans living inside them, of whom roughly 486,000 lived west of the Mississippi. The population of the United States, however, had grown to nearly 23.2 million by 1850. Not surprisingly, then, small and somewhat inept U.S. army units were able to rout the Natives west of the Mississippi and take their land in the second half of the nineteenth century. Victory over the Natives was complete by 1900. They were living on a handful of reservations and their total population had shrunk to about 456,000, of whom 299,000 lived west of the Mississippi.

    "text": "The population of the United States more than tripled during the second half of the nineteenth century, in good part because massive numbers of European immigrants crossed the Atlantic. Indeed, between 1851 and 1900, approximately 16.7 million immigrants came to the United States. By 1900, 34.2 percent of all 76 million Americans were either born outside the United States or had at least one parent born in a foreign land. Many of those immigrants came looking for jobs, which they found in the expanding U.S. economy. At the same time, however, they contributed to the strength of that economy, which grew by leaps and bounds in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Consider, for example, that the United Kingdom was the world's wealthiest country in 1850, with roughly four times the industrial might of the United States. Only fifty years later, however, the United States was the wealthiest country on the globe and had more than 1.6 times the industrial might of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and the United States ended their long rivalry in North America during the early years of the twentieth century. In effect, the United Kingdom retreated across the Atlantic Ocean and left the United States to run the Western Hemisphere. A commonplace explanation for this rapprochement is that the United Kingdom had to consolidate its military forces in Europe to check a rising Germany, so it cut a deal with the United States, which was accommodating because it had a vested interest in getting the British out of North America, as well as having them maintain the balance of power in Europe. There is much truth in this line of argument, but there is an even more important reason why the British-American rivalry ended in 1900: the United Kingdom no longer had the power to challenge the United States in the Western Hemisphere. The two principal indicators of potential military might are population size and industrial might, and the United States was far ahead of the United Kingdom on both indicators by 1900. Furthermore, the United Kingdom had to project power across the Atlantic Ocean into the Western Hemisphere, whereas the United States was physically located there. The U.S.-U.K. security competition was over. Even if there had been no German threat in the early twentieth century, the United Kingdom would almost surely have abandoned the Western Hemisphere to its offspring, which had definitely come of age by then.",

    "text": "American policymakers in the nineteenth century were not just concerned with turning the United States into a powerful territorial state, they were also deeply committed to getting the European powers out of the Western Hemisphere and keeping them out. Only by doing that could the United States make itself the region's hegemon, highly secure from great-power threats. As the United States moved across North America, it gobbled up territory that previously had belonged to the United Kingdom, France, and Spain, thus weakening their influence in the Western Hemisphere. But it also used the Monroe Doctrine for that same purpose. The Monroe Doctrine was laid out for the first time in President James Monroe's annual message to Congress on December 2, 1823. He made three main points about American foreign policy. First, Monroe stipulated that the United States would not get involved in Europe's wars, in keeping with George Washington's advice in his famous \"farewell address\" (this policy certainly has not been followed in the twentieth century). Second, he put the European powers on notice that they could not acquire new territory in the Western Hemisphere to increase the size of their already considerable empires. \"The American Continents,\" the president said, \"are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European Power.\" But the policy did not call for dismembering the European empires already established in the Western Hemisphere. Third, the United States wanted to make sure that the European powers did not form alliances with the independent states of the Western Hemisphere or control them in any way. Thus, Monroe stated that \"with the Governments who have declared their independence and maintained it . . . we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition towards the United States.\"",

    "text": "It is understandable that the United States would worry in the early 1800s about further European colonization. The United Kingdom, for example, was a powerful country with a rich history of empire-building around the globe, and the United States was not powerful enough at the time to check the British everywhere in the Western Hemisphere. Indeed, the United States probably did not have sufficient military might to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the first decades after it was enunciated. Nevertheless, this problem proved illusory, as the European empires shriveled away over the course of the nineteenth century and no new ones rose in their place. The United States actually had little to do with the collapse of those empires, which were wrecked mainly from within by nationalism. Brazilians, Canadians, and Mexicans, like the American colonists in 1776, did not want Europeans controlling their politics, so they followed the U.S. example and became independent states. The real danger that the United States faced in the nineteenth century—and continued to face in the twentieth century—was the possibility of an anti-American pact between a European great power and a state in the Western Hemisphere. An alliance like that might ultimately be powerful enough to challenge U.S. hegemony in the Americas, which would adversely affect the country's security. Thus, when Secretary of State Olney sent his famous note to Lord Salisbury in the summer of 1895, he emphasized that \"'the safety and welfare of the United States are so concerned with the maintenance of the independence of every American state as against any European power as to justify and require the interposition of the United States whenever that independence is endangered.'\" The United States was able to deal with this threat when it arose during the nineteenth century. For example, France placed an emperor on the throne of Mexico during the American Civil War, but French and Mexican troops together were not a serious threat to the United States, even though it was fighting a bloody internal conflict. When that war ended, the nationalist forces of Benito Juarez and the United States army forced France to withdraw its troops from Mexico. The United States grew more powerful between 1865 and 1900, making it increasingly difficult for any European great power to forge an anti-American alliance with an independent state in the Western Hemisphere. Nevertheless, the problem has not gone away. In fact, the United States had to deal with it three times in the twentieth century: German involvement in Mexico during World War I, German designs on South America during World War II, and the Soviet Union's alliance with Cuba during the Cold War.",

    "text": "The stunning growth of the United States in the hundred years after 1800 was fueled in good part by realist logic. \"The people of the United States have learned,\" Olney wrote at the end of the nineteenth century, that \"the relations of states to each other depend not upon sentiment nor principle, but upon selfish interest.\" Moreover, American leaders understood that the more powerful their country was, the more secure it would be in the dangerous world of international politics. President Franklin Pierce made the point in his inaugural address on March 4, 1853: \"It is not to be disguised that our attitude as a nation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain possessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our protection.\" Of course, Americans had other motives for expanding across the continent. For example, some had a powerful sense of ideological mission. They believed that the United States had created a virtuous republic that was unprecedented in world history and that its citizens had a moral duty to spread its values and political system far and wide. Others were driven by the promise of economic gain, a powerful motor for expansion. These other motives, however, did not contradict the security imperative; in fact, they usually complemented it. This was especially true for the economic motive: because economic might is the foundation of military might, any actions that might increase the relative wealth of the United States would also enhance its prospects for survival. On idealism, there is no question that many Americans fervently believed that expansion was morally justified. But idealist rhetoric also provided a proper mask for the brutal policies that underpinned the tremendous growth",

    "text": "Balance-of-power politics had a rich history in the Western Hemisphere even before the United States declared its independence in 1776. In particular, the British and the French waged an intense security competition in North America during the middle of the eighteenth century, including the deadly Seven Years' War (1756–63). Moreover, the United States ultimately achieved its independence by going to war against Great Britain and making an alliance with France, Britain's arch-rival. James Hutson has it right when he says, \"The world the American Revolutionary leaders found themselves in was a brutal, amoral cockpit . . . . [It] was, above all, a world in which power was king.\" Thus, the elites who managed U.S. national security policy in the decades after the country's independence were steeped in realist thinking.\n\nThe politics of the Western Hemisphere in 1800 provided good reasons for those elites to continue thinking in terms of the balance of power. The United States was still operating in a dangerous neighborhood. The British and Spanish empires surrounded it on three sides, making fear of encirclement a common theme among American policymakers, who also worried that Napoleonic France, the most powerful state in Europe, would try to build a new empire in North America. Of course, the French empire never materialized, and indeed, France sold the huge Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803. Nevertheless, the Europeans, especially the British, were determined to do what they could to contain the United States and prevent it from further expanding its borders. The United Kingdom actually succeeded at stopping the United States from conquering Canada in the War of 1812. The United Kingdom had few good options for preventing the westward expansion of the United States, but it did form brief alliances with the Native Americans of the Great Lakes region between 1807 and 1815, and later with Texas when it was briefly an independent state. But these efforts never seriously threatened to stop the United States from reaching the Pacific Ocean. In fact, it appears that any move a European state made to contain the United States had the opposite effect: it strengthened the American imperative to expand. For example, Europeans began speaking openly in the early 1840s about the need to maintain a “balance of power” in North America, a euphemism for containing further American expansion while increasing the relative power of the European empires. The subject was broached before the United States expanded westward beyond the Louisiana Territory. Not surprisingly, it immediately became a major issue in U.S. politics, although there was not much disagreement among Americans on the issue. President James Polk surely spoke for most Americans when he said that the concept of a balance of power “cannot be permitted to have any application to the North American continent, and especially to the United States. We must ever maintain the principle that the people of this continent alone have the right to decide their own destiny.\" Shortly after Polk spoke on December 2, 1845, Texas was incorporated into the United States, soon to be followed by the Oregon Territories, California, and the other land taken from Mexico in 1848. The historian Frederick Merk succinctly summarizes American security policy in the nineteenth century when he writes, “The chief defense problem was the British, whose ambition seemed to be to hem the nation in. On the periphery of the United States, they were the dangerous potential aggressors. The best way to hold them off was to acquire the periphery. This was the meaning of the Monroe Doctrine in the age of Manifest Destiny.\"",

    "text": "Offensive realism predicts that the United States will send its army across the Atlantic when there is a potential hegemon in Europe that the local great powers cannot contain by themselves. Otherwise, the United States will shy away from accepting a continental commitment. The movement of American forces into and out of Europe between 1900 and 1990 fits this general pattern of offshore balancing.\nA good way to grasp the broad outlines of American military policy toward Europe is to describe it during the late nineteenth century and in five distinct periods of the twentieth century. The United States gave hardly any thought to sending an army to Europe between 1850 and 1900, in part because staying out of Europe’s wars was deeply ingrained in the American psyche by 1850. Presidents George Washington and James Monroe, among others, had made sure of that. Furthermore, the United States was concerned primarily with establishing hegemony in the Western Hemisphere during the second half of the nineteenth century. But most important, the United States did not contemplate sending troops across the Atlantic because there was no potential hegemon in Europe at that time. Instead, there was a rough balance of power on the continent. France, which made a run at hegemony between 1792 and 1815, was on the decline throughout the nineteenth century, while Germany, which would become a potential hegemon in the early twentieth century, was not powerful enough to overrun Europe before 1900. Even if there had been an aspiring European hegemon, however, the United States surely would have adopted a buck-passing strategy, hoping that the other great powers in Europe could contain the threat.\nThe first period in the twentieth century covers the time from 1900 to April 1917. It was apparent in the early years of the new century that Germany was not simply the most powerful state in Europe but was increasingly threatening to dominate the region. In fact, Germany precipitated a number of serious diplomatic crises during that period, culminating in the outbreak of World War I on August 1, 1914. Nevertheless, no American troops were sent to Europe to thwart German aggression. The United States pursued a buck-passing strategy instead, relying on the Triple Entente—the United Kingdom, France, and Russia—to contain Germany.",

The United States also deployed about seven thousand nuclear weapons on European soil during the 1950s and early 1960s. Although there was some variation over time in American troop levels in Europe, the number never dipped below 300,000. The United States reluctantly kept military forces in Europe after World War II because the Soviet Union controlled the eastern two-thirds of the continent and it had the military might to conquer the rest of Europe. There was no local great power that could contain the Soviet Union: Germany was in ruins and neither France nor the United Kingdom had the military wherewithal to stop the mighty Red Army, which had just crushed the same Wehrmacht that had easily defeated the British and French armies in 1940.

The first period covers the initial three decades of the twentieth century, during which there was no large-scale commitment of American forces to Northeast Asia. There were, however, small contingents of U.S. military forces in Asia during this period. The United States maintained a small contingent of forces in the Philippine Islands, and it also sent five thousand troops to China in 1900 to help put down the Boxer Rebellion and maintain the \"Open Door\" policy. A contingent of approximately one thousand U.S. soldiers was deployed to Tientsin, China, from January 1912 to March 1938. Finally, U.S. navy gunboats were on patrol in the region during this period. The United States did not send a large army to Northeast Asia because there was no potential hegemon in the area. China played an important role in the region’s politics, but it was not a great power and it hardly threatened to dominate Northeast Asia. The United Kingdom and France were important actors in Asia in the early twentieth century, but they were interlopers from a distant continent, with all the power-projection problems that role entails. Moreover, they were concerned with containing Germany during most of this period, so most of their attention was focused on Europe at the expense of Northeast Asia. Japan and Russia were candidates for potential hegemon in Northeast Asia, because each was a great power located in the region. But neither fit the bill.  Japan possessed the most formidable army in the region between 1900 and 1930. It soundly defeated the Russian army in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–5). Russia’s army went from bad to worse during World War I, finally disintegrating in 1917. The newly created Red Army was essentially a paper tiger throughout the 1920s. Meanwhile, the Japanese army remained an impressive fighting force. But Japan was not a potential hegemon because Russia was the wealthiest state in the region.",

That same British army helped deliver the final blow against Napoleon at Waterloo (1815). The second period runs from 1816 to 1904, when the United Kingdom adopted a policy commonly referred to as \"splendid isolation.\" It made no continental commitment during this period, despite the numerous great-power wars raging on the continent. Most important, the United Kingdom did not intervene in either the Austro-Prussian War (1866) or the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), which led to the creation of a unified Germany. The United Kingdom sent no troops to Europe during those nine decades because there was a rough balance of power on the continent. France, which was a potential hegemon from 1793 until 1815, lost relative power over the course of the nineteenth century, while Germany, which would become the next potential hegemon in the early twentieth century, was not yet powerful enough to dominate Europe. In the absence of a potential hegemon, the United Kingdom had no good strategic reason to move troops to the European mainland. The third period runs from 1905 to 1930 and was dominated by the United Kingdom's efforts to contain Wilhelmine Germany, which emerged as a potential hegemon in the early twentieth century. It was apparent by 1890 that Germany, with its formidable army, large population, and dynamic industrial base, was rapidly becoming Europe's most powerful state. Indeed, France and Russia formed an alliance in 1894 to contain the growing threat located between them. The United Kingdom would have preferred to let France and Russia deal with Germany. But it was clear by 1905 that they could not do the job alone and would need British help.",

    "text": "Not only were the power differentials between Germany and its continental rivals continuing to widen in Germany's favor, but Russia suffered a major military defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), which left its army in terrible shape and in no condition to engage the German army. Finally, Germany initiated a crisis with France over Morocco in March 1905, which was designed to isolate France from the United Kingdom and Russia, thus leaving Germany in a position to dominate Europe. In response to this deteriorating strategic environment, the United Kingdom allied with France and Russia between 1905 and 1907, forming the Triple Entente. In essence, Britain made a continental commitment to deal with the threat of a German hegemon. When World War I broke out on August 1, 1914, the United Kingdom immediately sent an expeditionary force to the continent to help the French army. As the war progressed, the size of the British expeditionary force grew, until it was the most formidable Allied army by the summer of 1917. It then played the main role in defeating the German army in 1918. Most of the British army exited the continent shortly after the war ended; a small occupation force remained in Germany until 1930. The fourth period runs from 1930 to the summer of 1939 and covers the years when the United Kingdom pursued a Europe policy commonly referred to as \"limited liability.\" It made no continental commitment in the early 1930s, because Europe was relatively peaceful and there was a rough balance of power in the region. After Hitler came to power in 1933 and began to rearm Germany, the United Kingdom made no move to commit ground forces to fight on the continent. Instead, after much debate, it decided in December 1937 to pass the buck to France to contain Germany. British policymakers eventually realized, however, that France alone did not have the military might to deter Hitler, and that in the event of a war, the United Kingdom would have to send troops to fight Nazi Germany, as it had done against Napoleonic France and Wilhelmine Germany.",

    "text": "The United Kingdom finally accepted a continental commitment on March 31, 1939, which marks the beginning of the fifth period. Specifically, it committed itself to fight with France against Germany if the Wehrmacht attacked Poland. A week later the United Kingdom gave the same guarantee to Greece and Romania. When World War II broke out five months later, British troops were promptly sent to France, as they had been in World War I. Although the British army was pushed off the continent at Dunkirk in June 1940, it returned in September 1943 when it landed with the American army in Italy. British forces also landed at Normandy in June 1944 and eventually fought their way into Germany. This period ended with the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. The final period runs from 1945 to 1990 and covers the Cold War. With the end of World War II, Britain had planned to move its military forces off the continent after a brief occupation of Germany. However, the emergence of the Soviet threat, the fourth potential hegemon to confront Europe in 150 years, forced the United Kingdom to accept a continental commitment in 1948. British troops, along with American troops, remained on the central front for the duration of the Cold War. In sum, both the United Kingdom and the United States have consistently acted as offshore balancers in Europe. Neither of these insular great powers has ever tried to dominate Europe. It is also clear that American actions in Northeast Asia fit the same pattern. All of this behavior, as well as the U.S. drive for hegemony in the Western Hemisphere during the nineteenth century, corresponds with the predictions of offensive realism. This chapter raises two issues that bear mentioning. First, insular Japan's conquest of large amounts of territory on the Asian mainland in the first half of the twentieth century might seem to contradict my claim that the stopping power of water made it almost impossible for the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century and the United States in the twentieth century to conquer territory on the European continent. After all, if Japan was able to project power across the seas separating it from the Asian continent, why is it that the United Kingdom and the United States could not do likewise in Europe? The answer is that the Asian and European mainlands were different kinds of targets during the periods under discussion.",

    "text": "In particular, the European continent has been populated by formidable great powers over the past two centuries, and those states have had both the incentive and the wherewithal to prevent the United Kingdom and the United States from dominating their region. The situation confronting Japan in Asia between 1900 and 1945 looked quite different: Russia was the only great power located on the Asian mainland, but it was usually more concerned with events in Europe than in Asia. Plus, it was a militarily weak great power for much of that period. Russia's immediate neighbors were feeble states like Korea and China, which were inviting targets for Japanese aggression. In short, the Asian continent was open for penetration from abroad, which of course is why the European great powers had empires there. The European continent, on the other hand, was effectively a giant fortress closed to conquest by distant great powers like the United Kingdom and the United States. Second, I argued earlier that great powers are not seriously committed to maintaining peace but instead aim to maximize their share of world power. On this point, it is worth noting that the United States was not willing at any point between 1900 and 1990 to take on a continental commitment for the purposes of keeping peace in Europe. No American troops were sent across the Atlantic to help prevent World War I or to stop the fighting after war broke out. Nor was the United States willing to accept a continental commitment to deter Nazi Germany or halt the fighting after Poland was attacked in September 1939. In both cases, the United States eventually joined the fight against Germany and helped win the war and create peace in Europe. But the United States did not fight to make peace in either world war. Instead, it fought to prevent a dangerous foe from achieving regional hegemony. Peace was a welcome byproduct of those endeavors. The same basic point holds for the Cold War: American military forces were in Europe to contain the Soviet Union, not to maintain peace. The long peace that ensued was the happy consequence of a successful deterrence policy. We find a similar story in Northeast Asia. The United States did not intervene with force to shut down the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5), nor did it send troops to Northeast Asia in the 1930s, when Japan took the offensive on the Asian mainland, conquering Manchuria and large portions of China in a series of brutal military campaigns. The United States began making serious moves to get militarily involved in Asia during the summer of 1941, not because American leaders were determined to bring peace to the region, but because they feared that Japan would join forces with Nazi Germany and decisively defeat the Red Army, making hegemons of Germany in Europe and Japan in Northeast Asia. The United States fought a war in the Far East between 1941 and 1945 to prevent that outcome. As in Europe, American troops were stationed in Northeast Asia during the Cold War to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the region, not to keep peace.",

    "text": "I have emphasized that when offshore balancers like the United Kingdom and the United States confront a potential hegemon in Europe or Northeast Asia they prefer to buck-pass to other great powers rather than directly confront the threat themselves. Of course, this preference for buck-passing over balancing is common to all great powers, not just offshore balancers. Chapter 8 will consider how states choose between these two strategies. I argued in Chapter 5 that balancing and buck-passing are the main strategies that states employ to defend the balance of power against aggressors, and that threatened states feel a strong impulse to buck-pass. Buck-passing is preferred over balancing because the successful buck-passer does not have to fight the aggressor if deterrence fails. In fact, the buck-passer might even gain power if the aggressor and the buck-catcher get bogged down in a long and costly war. This offensive feature of buck-passing notwithstanding, there is always the possibility that the aggressor might win a quick and decisive victory and shift the balance of power in its favor and against the buck-passer. This chapter has three aims. First, I explain when threatened states are likely to balance and when they are likely to buck-pass. That choice is mainly a function of the structure of the international system. A threatened great power operating in a bipolar system must balance against its rival because there is no other great power to catch the buck. It is in multipolar systems that threatened states can—and often do—buck-pass. The amount of buck-passing that takes place depends largely on the magnitude of the threat and on geography. Buck-passing tends to be widespread in multipolarity when there is no potential hegemon to contend with, and when the threatened states do not share a common border with the aggressor. But even when there is a dominating threat, endangered rivals will still look for opportunities to pass the buck. In general, the more relative power the potential hegemon controls, the more likely it is that all of the threatened states in the system will forgo buck-passing and form a balancing coalition. Second, I examine the five most intense cases of security competition in Europe over the past two centuries to test my claims about when threatened states are likely to buck-pass. Specifically, I consider how the great powers responded to the four potential hegemons in modern European history: Revolutionary and Napoleonic France (1789–1815), Wilhelmine Germany (1890–1914), Nazi Germany (1933–41), and the Soviet Union (1945–90). I also look at how the European great powers reacted to Otto von Bismarck’s effort to unify Germany with the sword between 1862 and 1870. Bismarckian Prussia, however, was not a potential hegemon.",

Buck-passing is least evident against Wilhelmine Germany, which had a rather impressive balancing coalition arrayed against it about seven years before the stan of World War I. There was considerable buck-passing against Revolutionary France and Nazi Germany in the years before they went to war in 1792 and 1939, respectively. and even after both were at war. The variation among these cases can be explained in good part by the relevant distribution of power and by geography, which facilitated buck-passing against Napoleon and Adolf Hitler, but not against Kaiser Wilhelm. Third, I hope to illustrate my claim that threatened states are inclined to buck-pass rather than balance in the face of aggressors. The discussion in Chapter 7 of how the United Kingdom and the United States have always looked to buck-pass when confronted with a potential hegemon in Europe (or Northeast Asia) provides substantial evidence of that tendency among states. However, I address the issue more directly in this chapter by focusing on five particularly aggressive European states and how their rivals reacted to them. My explanation for when states buck-pass is laid out in the next section. The five cases are then discussed in chronological order, starting with Revolutionary and Napoleonic France and ending with the Cold War. In the final section, the findings from the different cases are compared and contrasted.",

    "section": "When Do States Buck-Pass?",
    "text": "When an aggressor comes on the scene, at least one other state will eventually take direct responsibility for checking it. Balancing almost always happens, although it is not always successful. This point is consistent with the logic of buck-passing, which is essentially about who does the balancing, not whether it gets done. The buck-passer simply wants someone else to do the heavy lifting, but it certainly wants the threat contained. Buck-passing, on the other hand, does not always occur when an aggressor threatens to upset the balance of power. Passing the buck may be the strategy of choice for threatened great powers, but it is not always a viable option. The task here is to determine when buck-passing makes good strategic sense. The prospects for buck-passing are largely a function of the particular architecture of the system. What matters most is the distribution of power among the major states, and geography. Power is usually distributed among great powers in three ways. Bipolar systems are dominated by two great powers of roughly equal military might. Unbalanced multipolar systems contain three or more great powers, one of which is a potential hegemon. Balanced multipolar systems have no aspiring hegemon; instead, power is divided rather evenly among the great powers, or at least between the two most powerful states in the system. No buck-passing takes place among the great powers in bipolarity because there is no third party to catch the buck. A threatened great power has little choice but to balance against its rival great power. It is also not possible to form balancing coalitions with other great powers in a world with just two great powers. Instead, the threatened power has to rely mainly on its own resources, and maybe alliances with smaller states, to contain the aggressor. Because neither buck-passing nor great-power balancing coalitions are feasible in bipolarity, we should expect balancing in this kind of system to be prompt and efficient.",

    "text": "Buck-passing is always possible in multipolarity, because there is always at least one potential buck-catcher in the system. But buck-passing is likely to be rife in balanced multipolar systems, mainly because no aggressor is powerful enough—by definition—to defeat all of the other great powers and dominate the entire system. This means that not every great power is likely to be directly threatened by an aggressor in a counterpoised system, and those that are not in imminent danger of attack will almost certainly opt to pass the buck. States that are directly threatened by the aggressor are likely to try to get another threatened state to handle the problem, so that they can remain unscathed while the buck-catcher defends the balance of power. In short, balancing coalitions are unlikely to form against an aggressor when power is distributed rather evenly among the major states in a multipolar system. Buck-passing is less likely in an unbalanced multipolar system, because the threatened states have a strong incentive to work together to prevent the potential hegemon from dominating their region. After all, potential hegemons, which are great powers that clearly have more latent power and a more formidable army than any other great power in their region, have the wherewithal to fundamentally alter the balance of power in their favor. Consequently, they are a direct threat to almost every state in the system. Ludwig Dehio, the German historian, maintains that states “seem able to hold together only in one event: when a member of their own circle tries to achieve hegemony,” and Barry Posen notes that, “Those states most often identified as history’s would-be hegemons have elicited the most intense balancing behavior by their neighbors.” Nevertheless, buck-passing often occurs in unbalanced multipolar systems. Threatened states are reluctant to form balancing coalitions against potential hegemons because the costs of containment are likely to be great; if it is possible to get another state to bear those costs, a threatened state will make every effort to do so. The more powerful the dominant state is relative to its foes, however, the less likely it is that the potential victims will be able to pass the buck among themselves, and the more likely it is that they will be forced to form a balancing coalition against the aggressor. Indeed, at some point, the collective efforts of all the threatened great powers will be needed to contain an especially powerful state. Buck-passing makes little sense in such a circumstance because the buck-catchers are unlikely to be capable of checking the potential hegemon without help.",

    "text": "Whereas the distribution of power tells us how much buck-passing is likely among the great powers, geography helps identify the likely buck-passers and buck-catchers in multipolar systems. The crucial issue regarding geography is whether the threatened state shares a border with the aggressor, or whether a barrier—be it the territory of another state or a large body of water—separates those rivals. Common borders promote balancing; barriers encourage buck-passing. Common borders facilitate balancing in two ways. First, they provide threatened states with direct and relatively easy access to the territory of the aggressor, which means that the imperiled states are well-positioned to put military pressure on their dangerous opponent. If all the threatened great powers share a border with their common foe, they can readily raise the specter of a multi-front war, which is often the most effective way to deter a powerful aggressor. On the other hand, if a threatened state is separated from its adversary by water or a territorial buffer zone, it will be difficult for the endangered state to use its army to put pressure on the menacing state. A minor power caught in the middle, for example, is often unwilling to invite a threatened great power onto its territory, thus forcing the threatened state to invade the minor power to get at the aggressor. Projecting power across water is also a difficult task, as discussed in Chapter 4. Second, great powers that share a border with an aggressor are likely to feel particularly vulnerable to attack, and thus they are likely to take matters into their own hands and balance against their dangerous foe. They are not likely to be in a good position to buck-pass, although the temptation to try that strategy will always be present. On the other hand, threatened states separated from an aggressor by a barrier are likely to feel less vulnerable to invasion and therefore more inclined to pass the buck to an endangered state that has a common border with the menacing state. Thus, among threatened states, those that live next door to the aggressor usually get stuck with the buck, while those more distant from the threat usually get to pass the buck. There is some truth to the dictum that geography is destiny. In sum, buck-passing among the great powers is impossible in bipolarity, and not only possible but commonplace in multipolarity. Indeed, buck-passing is likely to be absent from a multipolar system only when there is an especially powerful potential hegemon and when there are no barriers between the aggressor and the threatened great powers. In the absence of a dominating threat and common borders, substantial buck-passing is likely in multipolarity. Let us now consider how well this theory explains the historical record, focusing first on how the European great powers reacted to the aggressive behavior of Revolutionary and Napoleonic France some two centuries ago.",

    "text": "with France. But that conflict was motivated mainly by balance-of-power considerations, although it was not a case of two threatened states balancing against a mighty France. On the contrary, Austria and Prussia were ganging up on a weak and vulnerable France to gain power at its expense. Britain was content to sit on the sidelines and watch this happen, while Russia encouraged Austria and Prussia to fight with France, so that it could make gains in Poland at their expense. France fared poorly in the opening months of the war, prompting a reorganization and enlargement of the French army in the summer of 1792. It then won a stunning victory against the invading Prussians at Valmy on September 20, 1792. Soon thereafter, France went on the offensive and it remained a relentless and formidable aggressor until Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo in June 1815. During the period from 1793 to 1804, France did not attempt to conquer all of Europe. Instead, it sought and achieved hegemony in western Europe. In particular, it gained direct control over Belgium, large parts of Italy, and a portion of the Third Germany. France also dominated the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. But Portugal, Spain, and most importantly, Britain, were not brought under French control. These gains in western Europe were not made quickly and easily. For example, France won control over Belgium by defeating the Austrians at the Battle of Jemappes on November 6, 1792. But the Austrians won it back at the Battle of Neerwinden on March 16, 1793. France took it back again, however, at the battle of Fleurus on June 26, 1794. We find a similar story in Italy. Between March 1796 and April 1797, Napoleon led French armies to victory over the Austrians in northern Italy. France subsequently gained territory and political influence in Italy with the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 18, 1797), which ended the fighting between Austria and France. But they were back at war again on March 13, 1799, and by the fall of that year virtually all French forces had been driven out of Italy. Napoleon returned to Italy in the spring of 1800 and defeated the Austrians in a series of battles, winning back control of much of Italy in the Treaty of Luneville (February 8, 1801), which ended that round of fighting. France not only had limited territorial ambitions between 1793 and 1804, but also did not make a serious attempt to conquer any of its great-power rivals. France certainly waged successful military campaigns against Austria, Britain, Prussia, and Russia, but it did not seriously threaten to knock any of them out of the balance of power. In effect, France's wars before 1805 were limited in scope, much like the canonical “limited wars” of the preceding century, which rarely produced decisive victories that led to the conquest of one great power by another.",

The first coalition was put in place on February 1, 1793, when Britain joined with Austria and Prussia to check French expansion in Belgium and Holland. But Russia did not join the fighting against France, preferring instead to pursue a bloodletting strategy, where Austria and Prussia would wear themselves down fighting against France. Prussia tired of the fighting and quit the coalition on April 5, 1795, which was tantamount to passing the buck to Austria and Britain. In fact, Austria wound up catching the buck, because Britain's small army could not seriously contest the French army on the continent, whereas the Austrian army stood a fighting chance against that powerful aggressor. Austria did not fare well in its subsequent battles with France, however, and it temporarily quit the war in the fall of 1797, leaving Britain to fight alone against France. A second balancing coalition was in place by December 29, 1798, and its members were Austria, Britain, and Russia, but not Prussia, which preferred to continue buck-passing. The coalition won some battles against France between March and August 1799, but France turned the tables and won impressive victories against the coalition in September and October 1799. Russia quit the coalition on October 22, 1799, leaving Austria and Britain to contain France. Again, the burden fell squarely on Austria, not Britain. After a handful of battlefield defeats by the French army, Austria signed a peace treaty with France on February 9, 1801. The United Kingdom finally quit fighting on March 25, 1802, when it signed the Treaty of Amiens. This was the first time since the spring of 1792 that Europe was free of great-power war. But the peace, which was really just an armed truce, lasted only fourteen months. Fighting broke out again on May 16, 1803, when the United Kingdom declared war against France.",

    "text": "Between 1805 and 1812, Napoleon shattered the limited-war mold that had shaped European conflict for the previous century. Specifically, he sought to conquer all of Europe and make France its hegemon. By the summer of 1809, France held firm control over all of central Europe and it was fighting to conquer Spain and dominate the Iberian Peninsula, the only area on the western part of the continent that France did not dominate. In June 1812, France invaded Russia in hopes of winning control of eastern Europe, too. In pursuit of European hegemony, Napoleon conquered other great powers and knocked them out of the balance of power, something that had not happened in the wars fought between 1792 and 1804. For example, France decisively defeated and conquered Austria in 1805. Prussia met the same fate a year later in 1806. Austria briefly came back from the dead in 1809, but Napoleon's armies decisively defeated it again. In essence, the United Kingdom and Russia were France's only two great-power opponents for much of the period between 1805 and 1812.",

    "text": "France itself. Napoleon's armies performed surprisingly well in some key battles in February 1814, but despite strains in the balancing coalition, it held together and routed the French army in March, causing Napoleon to abdicate on April 6, 1814. He was eventually exiled to Elba, from which he escaped back to France in early March 1815. The sixth coalition immediately reconstituted itself on March 25, 1815, and defeated Napoleon for the final time at Waterloo on June 18, 1815. France's run at hegemony was over.\n\nThe Calculus of Power\nIt is difficult to establish firmly that France had more latent power than any of its great-power rivals, mainly because there are not much reliable data on population and especially wealth for the period between 1792 and 1815. Still, when you consider what is known about those building blocks of military power, there is reason to think that France had more potential power than any other European state. Although hardly any comparative data on overall state wealth can be found for the Napoleonic period, scholars generally agree that Great Britain and France were the richest states in the international system. A good indicator of Britain's great wealth is the fact that Britain provided large subsidies to Austria, Prussia, and Russia so that they could build armies that could defeat France, which was certainly not being subsidized by the British or anyone else. The relative wealth of Britain and France is difficult to establish, but there are reasons to think that France was wealthier than Britain, although certainly not by much, for the period in question. For example, France had a much larger population than Britain did in 1800—28 versus 16 million (see Table 8.1)—and given two prosperous economies, the one with the larger population is more likely to possess greater overall wealth. Furthermore, like Nazi Germany, France garnered considerable wealth from its occupation and exploitation of much of Europe. One scholar estimates that \"Napoleon's conquests provided the French treasury with 10 to 15 per cent of its annual revenue from 1805 onwards.\" Turning to population size, France appears to have had an advantage over its rivals, too. The population figures for 1800 and 1816 in Table 8.1 show that the French outnumbered the British by about 1.5:1 and the Prussians by almost 3:1. But the French did not outnumber either the Austrians or the Russians. France's population was roughly the same size as Austria's, and it was much smaller than Russia's. Nevertheless, a critical factor at play effectively shifted the population balance in France's favor in both the Austrian and the Russian cases.",

    "text": "Population size, as emphasized in Chapter 3, is an important ingredient of military power because it affects the potential size of a state's army. Large populations allow for large armies. But rival states sometimes have markedly different policies regarding who serves in the military, and in those cases, simple comparisons of population size are not particularly useful. This point is relevant for France and its rivals between 1789 and 1815. Prior to the French Revolution, European armies were rather small in size and they were composed mainly of foreign mercenaries and the dregs of a state's society. In the wake of the revolution, nationalism became a mighty force in France, and it led to the introduction of the novel concept of the \"nation in arms.\" The idea that all persons fit to fight for France should serve the colors was adopted, and thereby the percentage of the population that French leaders could tap for military service increased dramatically. Neither Austria nor Russia, however, was willing to imitate France and adopt the nation-in-arms concept, which meant that compared to France, a significantly smaller percentage of their populations was available for military service. Thus, France was able to raise substantially larger armies than either Austria or Russia, as discussed below. Let us now consider actual military power. France did not have the most powerful army in Europe from 1789 to 1792, and thus it was not a potential hegemon. In terms of numbers alone, Austria, Prussia, and Russia all had larger armies than did France (see Table 8.2). Only Britain maintained a smaller army than France. Furthermore, the French army did not enjoy a qualitative edge over its rivals. In fact, it was in such disarray in the years right after the revolution that it was not clear that it could even protect France against invasion. This weakness explains why there was no balancing against France before 1793, and why Austria and Prussia ganged up to attack France in 1792. During the summer of 1792, when the war was going badly for France, it took steps to transform its army into the most powerful fighting force in Europe. By the early fall of 1793, that goal was achieved, and France clearly was a potential hegemon. The French army remained the preeminent army in Europe from 1793 to 1804. Nevertheless, when you consider both relative size and quality, it was not so powerful that all four of its rivals were compelled to ally against it. Instead, its limitations allowed for considerable buck-passing among France's opponents.",

    "text": "fight and die for France, but merit replaced binhright as the principal criterion for selecting and promoting officers. Furthermore, moving to an army of citizen-soldiers infused with patriotism permitted the introduction of novel tactics, which gave French forces an advantage over their rivals on the battlefield. It also allowed for an army that had greater strategic mobility than either its predecessor or the rival armies of the day. Although the French army enjoyed a marked qualitative advantage over its opponents (who all remained hostile to the nation-in-arms concept) and was the most powerful army in Europe between 1793 and 1804, it had some serious deficiencies. In particular, the army was neither well-trained nor well-disciplined, and it suffered from high desertion rates. \"Messy massive armies,\" as Geoffrey Best puts it, are what France fought with before 1805. During the period from 1805 to 1813, the power gap between the French army and its rivals widened significantly. Napoleon was largely responsible for this development. He sharply increased the size of the French army by refining its conscription system and by integrating large numbers of foreign troops into its ranks. Thus, the French army grew from 450,000 in 1805 to 700,000 in 1808, to 1 million in 1812, the year France invaded Russia. Even after that debacle, the French army still numbered 850,000 in 1813. As Table 8.2 makes clear, there was no comparable increase in the size of the other European armies between 1805 and 1813. Napoleon also substantially raised the quality of the French army. He did not make radical changes in the way the army did business, but instead corrected many of the \"imperfections\" in the existing system. He improved training and discipline, for example, and he also improved coordination among the infantry, artillery, and cavalry. In short, the French army after 1805 was more professional and more competent than its immediate predecessor had been. Napoleon was also a brilliant military commander, which gave France a further advantage over its foes. France's rivals made minor modifications in their armies in response to Napoleon, but only Prussia adopted the nation-in-arms concept and modernized its army in a fundamental way. Even so, the small Prussian army was no match for the much larger French army in a one-on-one engagement.",

    "text": "France's imposing power advantage over each of its rivals from 1805 until 1813 explains in large part why all four of them came together in 1813 and then remained together until France was defeated and conquered in 1815. One might ask, however, why did that imposing balancing coalition not come together earlier, say in 1806 or 1810? The main reason for the delay, as emphasized earlier in this chapter, was that Napoleon's stunning victories on the battlefield made it impossible for all four rivals to form an alliance. After Napoleon conquered Austria in late 1805, there was no time before 1813 when all four of France's great-power opponents were players in the balance of power. Indeed, for much of the period, both Austria and Prussia were great powers in name only. Finally, a word about the impact of geography on buck-passing. Austria was the only great power that controlled territory abutting France. Austria and France each shared a border with Italy and the Third Germany, which both of those great powers highly valued as targets. As a result, Austria was too threatened by France to opt out of the fighting by passing the buck. Indeed, it was well-placed to play the unenviable role of buck-catcher. And it did, as it was surely the most put-upon of France's rivals. David Chandler, for example, calculates that among France's rivals on the continent, Austria was at war with it for 13.5 of the relevant 23 years, whereas Prussia and Russia were each at war with France for only 5.5 years. Britain, which is separated from the continent by a large body of water, was the least vulnerable to invasion of France's foes. Yet Britain was at war with France almost continuously from 1793 onward. Chandler estimates that they were locked in conflict for 21.5 of the relevant 23 years. But Britain buck-passed to its continental allies in the sense that it never raised a powerful army to fight on the continent against France. It preferred instead to send small armies to fight in peripheral places like Spain, while subsidizing its allies to do the brunt of the fighting against the French army. In short, Britain's geographical location allowed it to act as an offshore balancer. Russia was located on the other end of the continent from France, with Austria and Prussia in between. So a favorable geographic position allowed Russia to buck-pass, too, especially between 1793 and 1804, when France was mainly concerned with winning hegemony in western Europe. In fact, Russia was at war with France for less than one year during that period. Prussia also did a considerable amount of buck-passing, but that behavior cannot be explained by geography, because Prussia was located in the heart of Europe, not far away from France. Prussia's success as a buck-passer was largely due to the fact that neighboring Austria was an ideal buck-catcher. In sum, the pattern of balancing and buck-passing displayed by France's rivals between 1789 and 1815 can be explained in good part by my theory, which emphasizes the distribution of power and the luck of geography. Europe was relatively peaceful for almost forty years after the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815. In fact, no war was fought between any of the great powers until the Crimean War started in 1853.",

    "text": "Unlike the United Kingdom and Russia, Austria and France feared a unified Germany on their doorstep due to the direct threat it posed to their survival.  However, instead of balancing together against Prussia, they engaged in buck-passing, allowing Bismarck to defeat them individually.  Evidence suggests France even welcomed conflict between Austria and Prussia in 1866, anticipating gains in relative power.  This buck-passing stemmed from the belief that the other could independently halt Prussia's ambitions.  Both Austria and France were perceived as possessing sufficient military strength to defeat Prussia. France, bolstered by Napoleon's legacy and recent victories in the Crimean War (1853-56) and the War of Italian Unification (1859), further fueled this perception.  Other factors contributed to the failure of a balancing coalition. Bismarck's skillful diplomacy isolated his targets, while residual animosity from the 1859 conflict hindered Austro-French relations. Austria also feared a Russian attack if it sided with France. Additionally, the Austrian army was still recovering from its defeat in 1866.  Despite these contributing factors, a shared belief in the need for mutual assistance would likely have led to a joint effort to contain Bismarck. \n\nThe prevalence of buck-passing in the 1860s can be largely explained by Prussia's position within the European balance of power. While its military grew stronger, Prussia was not a potential hegemon. The United Kingdom, not Prussia, controlled the largest share of potential power in mid-nineteenth-century Europe. The United Kingdom controlled about 68 percent of European wealth in 1860, compared to France's 14 percent and Prussia's 10 percent. By 1870, the United Kingdom still held approximately 64 percent of European industrial might, while Germany controlled 16 percent and France 13 percent.  Regarding military strength in the 1860s, France and Prussia possessed the most powerful armies. France held the top spot between 1860 and 1866, influencing Britain and Russia's approval of Bismarck's unification efforts. Prussia's initially weak army became the most powerful by 1867, retaining that position through 1870. Austria’s initially strong army weakened after 1866, while Russia maintained a large but inefficient army focused on defense.  The United Kingdom, despite its latent power, maintained a small and ineffective army. The key factor in checking Bismarck was the power distribution among Austria, France, and Prussia, not the relative military weaknesses of the United Kingdom and Russia. In 1866, the Austrian and Prussian armies were numerically comparable, with Austria having a slight advantage.  However, Prussia's army was qualitatively superior, using breech-loading rifles, a better staff system, while Austria's multi-ethnic composition was becoming a liability. Austria did have superior artillery and cavalry.  Overall, Prussia held a distinct but not overwhelming power advantage. This rough balance encouraged French buck-passing. France, still possessing Europe’s most powerful army in 1866, could have contained Bismarck through an alliance with Austria. Unlike Austria and Prussia, France relied heavily on its standing army, which outnumbered Prussia’s mobilized army.  However, the balance of power shifted between 1866 and 1870, a change not widely recognized at the time.",

    "text": "Following Prussia’s successful use of reserves in 1866, France reduced its standing army and began developing its own reserve system. By 1870, France had a formidable reserve structure on paper, but it was inefficient compared to the Prussian system, a crucial difference when war was declared on July 19, 1870. France’s standing army was still stronger, but Prussia could mobilize 1,183,000 soldiers compared to France's 530,870. France eventually mobilized all its reserves, exceeding Prussia's total mobilization by over half a million.  Prussia had a slight quality advantage due to a superior general staff and better-trained reserves, although French infantry had better weaponry, offset by Prussia's breech-loading artillery.  Prussia's significant advantage in short-term mobilization capacity proved decisive.  This imbalance should have prompted an Austro-French alliance against Prussia, but miscalculations of the balance of power prevented this. Both rivals mistakenly believed France could mobilize reserves as effectively as Prussia. French leaders even anticipated difficulties in Prussian mobilization. Conversely, Prussia correctly assessed France's mobilization weaknesses, giving them a battlefield advantage. Bismarck, recognizing this opportunity, readily went to war in the summer of 1870.  Finally, geography had minimal influence on buck-passing. The English Channel separating the United Kingdom and Prussia did little to affect British policy, primarily driven by fear of France.  Austria, France, and Russia all shared borders with Prussia, eliminating geography as an explanatory factor for their differing responses to German unification.  These rivals were geographically positioned to attack Prussia, had they deemed it necessary.",

    "text": "When Bismarck stepped down as chancellor in March 1890, Germany was not yet a potential hegemon, although it had a large and growing population, a dynamic economy, and a formidable army. These combined assets caused much anxiety among Europe's other great powers in the last decade of the nineteenth century. By the early twentieth century, however, Germany was a full-fledged potential hegemon that was gaining more relative power every year.  Fear of Germany pervaded European politics between 1900 and the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Besides Germany, there were five other great powers in Europe during this period: Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Russia. Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Germany were all members of the Triple Alliance. Austria-Hungary was a particularly weak great power with a dim future, ultimately disintegrating at the end of World War I. Nationalism, fueled by its multinational composition and the desire of ethnic groups for independence, was the principal source of its weakness. Austria-Hungary and Germany were closely allied before World War I; Austria-Hungary needed German protection against Russia due to territorial disputes in eastern Europe and the Balkans, while Germany had a vested interest in a unified Austria-Hungary to block Russian expansion. Italy was also a weak great power, not due to nationalism but due to its limited industrial might and a militarily prone to defeat. Italy was not strongly committed to the Triple Alliance by the early twentieth century, as its troubles with France had diminished and its relations with Austria-Hungary had deteriorated. Effectively neutral before World War I, Italy joined the Allies in May 1915 against its former allies. The United Kingdom, France, and Russia, all significantly more powerful than Austria-Hungary and Italy, were determined to prevent German hegemony in Europe. The key issue is how these three powers reacted to Germany's growing might between 1890 and 1914. There was little buck-passing among the Kaiserreich's rivals; instead, the United Kingdom, France, and Russia formed a balancing coalition—the Triple Entente—years before the start of World War I.",

    "text": "France and Russia, Germany's western and eastern neighbors, formed an alliance between 1890 and 1894 to contain Germany. However, neither anticipated an immediate German attack; their primary interest was preventing German disruption in Europe while pursuing their own goals elsewhere.  Relations between the United Kingdom and Germany cooled in the early 1890s, but the UK showed little interest in allying with France and Russia against Germany, even experiencing friction with them during the decade. Between 1894 and 1904, this dynamic remained largely unchanged. France and Russia maintained their alliance to contain Germany through the threat of a two-front war. Anglo-German relations remained strained due to Germany's naval buildup and imperial ambitions (Weltpolitik).  The UK, acting as an offshore balancer, buck-passed, relying on France and Russia to contain Germany on the continent, allowing it to focus on maintaining naval supremacy.  A dramatic shift occurred between 1905 and 1907. By 1905, Germany exhibited the characteristics of a potential hegemon, prompting the UK to reconsider its continental commitment. Japan's defeat of Russia in 1905 weakened the European balance of power and left France without its main ally.  Simultaneously, Germany initiated a diplomatic crisis with France over Morocco, aiming to isolate and humiliate the now vulnerable nation. Recognizing the inadequacy of buck-passing, the UK began moving towards a continental commitment, organizing an expeditionary force and initiating staff talks with France. Concurrently, the UK worked to improve relations with Russia, strained by their rivalry in Asia, culminating in the Anglo-Russian Convention on August 31, 1907. This agreement aimed to prevent disputes outside Europe, allowing them to cooperate against Germany. Despite forming the Triple Entente, the UK's inclination towards buck-passing persisted.  No explicit commitment to fight alongside its allies was made, and the Triple Entente lacked the formal structure of later alliances like NATO.  When Russia recovered from its defeat, the possibility of containing Germany without British assistance reemerged, leading to renewed Anglo-Russian tensions.  Even at the outbreak of war, the UK sought to minimize its involvement while France and Russia bore the brunt of fighting Germany.  Nevertheless, the UK ultimately joined the war alongside France and Russia in August 1914, committing a substantial army to the western front.",

    "text": "Between 1890 and 1905, Germany was not yet a potential hegemon, primarily because the United Kingdom possessed greater latent power until 1903.  The UK controlled 50% of European wealth in 1890 compared to Germany's 25%.  By 1900, this gap narrowed to 37% for the UK and 34% for Germany.  France's share declined to 11%, while Russia's rose to 10%.  Germany's industrial might was rapidly approaching the threshold of potential hegemony, reaching it in 1903 when its share of European wealth surpassed the UK's.  By the early twentieth century, Germany clearly possessed substantially more latent power than either France or Russia. In terms of military power, France and Germany boasted the two most powerful armies in Europe between 1890 and 1905. While their standing and fully mobilized armies were comparable in size, Germany's advantage lay in its reserve system. A larger portion of German reserves were trained and organized for combat, allowing for the rapid deployment of larger fighting forces. In a hypothetical 1905 war, Germany could have fielded 1.5 million soldiers compared to France's 840,000, a 1.8:1 advantage.  Furthermore, the German army enjoyed a qualitative edge due to its superior general staff and heavy artillery. Russia, while possessing the largest army in Europe, suffered from significant weaknesses, evident in its defeat by Japan in 1904-5. The British army, small and ill-prepared for continental warfare, was largely irrelevant to the European balance of power before 1905. By the decade preceding World War I, Germany was undeniably a potential hegemon.  Its control of 40% of European industrial might by 1913, compared to the UK's 28%, coupled with its more than 3:1 advantage in potential power over France and Russia (12% and 11% respectively), solidified its position.  The German army's dominance persisted, further enhanced by an expansion program initiated in 1912.  At the outbreak of war in 1914, Germany could deploy 1.71 million soldiers in front-line combat units, while France could only muster 1.07 million. Germany's greater potential power allowed it to mobilize far more men (13.25 million) than France (8.6 million) over the course of the war.",

However, it was still far inferior to the French TA.\n\nManpower in European Armies, 1900-1918 (World War I)\n[Table displaying manpower figures for Austria-Hungary, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and Italy from 1900 to 1914-18, including standing army and war potential.  Source information provided below the table.]\n\nA country's 'fighting army' represents the number of men in the army's fighting units concentrated in the theater of battle and thus immediately available for combat. The distribution of those fighting armies engaged on more than one front in August 1914, is as follows: Austria-Hungary, 1,000,000 in Galicia, 250,000 to invade Serbia; Germany, 1,485,000 to invade France and the Low Countries, 225,000 in East Prussia; Russia, 1,200,000 in Galicia, 600,000 to invade East Prussia.\n\n[Source information detailing specific sources for each data point within the table]\n\nThe post-1905 British army was small, but it was a high-quality fighting force, especially when compared to the Russian army. The British army was probably the third best in Europe during the decade before World War I, while Russia's was fourth best, a reverse of the situation before 1905. Given that Germany was the most powerful state on the continent from 1890 until 1905 but was not a potential hegemon until 1903, it makes sense that France and Russia balanced together against Germany, while the United Kingdom stayed offshore and pursued a buck-passing strategy. By 1905, however, the Kaiserreich was clearly a potential hegemon, and thus a much more serious threat to the balance of power, especially after the Russian defeat that year. Not surprisingly, the United Kingdom stopped passing the buck and balanced with France and Russia against Germany, a commitment it saw through until Germany was finally defeated in November 1918. Finally, geography was no hindrance to balancing against the Kaiserreich.\n\nFrance was the most powerful state in Europe between the end of World War I (1918) and when Hitler became German chancellor on January 30, 1933. It maintained a formidable army and paid serious attention to defending its eastern border against a German attack. Germany presented no threat to France during this period, however, because Weimar Germany was barely capable of defending itself, much less attacking into France. Germany certainly had the requisite population and wealth to build the mightiest army in Europe. but it was hamstrung by the Versailles Treaty (1919), which took the strategically important Rhineland away from Germany and placed it under international control and also prohibited Weimar from building a powerful military machine.\n\nManpower in European Armies, 1920-30\n[Table displaying manpower figures for United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Soviet Union from 1920 to 1930.  Source information provided below the table.]\n\nThe Soviet Union, too, was an especially weak great power in the fifteen years after World War I, which explains in good part why Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union cooperated extensively with each other before 1933. Soviet leaders faced many problems in the 1920s as they tried to rebuild after the destruction wrought by World War I, revolution, civil war, and a lost war against Poland. But the chief problem they faced was their backward economy, which could not support a first-class military establishment. Josef Stalin initiated a major modernization program in 1928 to rectify this problem. It eventually worked, but the fruits of his ruthless industrialization policy were realized only after the Nazis came to power. The United Kingdom maintained a small army in the 1920s that was probably more concerned with fighting in the British Empire than on the European continent. Italy, which had been under Benito Mussolini's rule since 1922, was the weakest great power in Europe.",

    "text": "Hitler was not in a good position to act aggressively on the foreign policy front during his early years in office. He first had to consolidate his political position at home and revitalize the German economy. Moreover, the German military he inherited was in no shape to fight a major war anytime soon. Consider that the mobilized German army that went to war in 1914 was composed of 2.15 million soldiers and 102 divisions. The 1933 version of that army had a little over 100,000 soldiers and 7 infantry divisions. Hitler and his generals, however, were determined to rectify that problem by overthrowing the Versailles Treaty and building a formidable military instrument. Still, it took about six years to achieve that goal.\n\nThree major building plans underpinned the growth of the German army. In December 1933, Hitler mandated that the peacetime strength of the army be increased threefold, to 300,000 soldiers and 21 infantry divisions. New reserve units were also to be created, so that the fully mobilized field army would have 63 divisions. In March 1935, a new law stipulated that the peacetime army would grow to 700,000 with 36 infantry divisions. Conscription was introduced at the same time, although it did not go into effect until October 1, 1935, the same month that Hitler decided to build 3 panzer divisions in addition to the 36 infantry divisions. The projected size of the field army, however, remained “practically unchanged at 63 to 73” divisions. Finally, the August 1936 Rearmament Program called for building a peacetime army of 830,000 with roughly 44 divisions by October 1940. The fully mobilized field army was to comprise 4.62 million soldiers and 102 divisions. When World War II started on September 1, 1939, the German army contained 3.74 million soldiers and 103 divisions.\n\nHitler also pushed to create a powerful navy and air force during the 1930s. The development of the German navy was rather haphazard and unimpressive, but the building of the Luftwaffe was a different story. Germany had no combat-ready air squadrons when Hitler took office in 1933, because the Versailles Treaty outlawed a German air force. By August 1939, however, the Luftwaffe could claim 302 combat-ready squadrons. As Wilhelm Deist notes, “The spectacular development of the Luftwaffe in the six years from 1933 until the outbreak of the war aroused the boundless admiration as well as dark forebodings of contemporaries.”\n\nUntil Germany had a powerful army, Hitler was not in a good position to redraw the map of Europe by the threat or use of force. Thus, Nazi foreign policy was relatively tame before 1938. Hitler pulled Germany out of the Geneva Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations in October 1933, but he also signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland in January 1934, and a naval treaty with the United Kingdom in June 1935. The Wehrmacht did occupy and remilitarize the Rhineland in March 1936, but that was widely recognized to be German territory, even though the Versailles Treaty mandated that it be permanently demilitarized. There was no overt German aggression in 1938, but Hitler twice used threats that year to acquire new territory. He compelled German-speaking Austria to join the Third Reich in March 1938 (the infamous Anschluss), and then at Munich in September 1938, he used threats and bluster to get the United Kingdom and France to detach the German-speaking Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and give it to Nazi Germany.",

    "text": "By 1939, Hitler finally possessed a potent military instrument, and he turned to overt aggression that same year. The United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union all feared Nazi Germany, and they each paid serious attention to devising a viable containment strategy. However, with the possible exception of the Soviet Union, there was little interest among them in putting together a balancing coalition like the Triple Entente that might deter Hitler by threatening Germany with a two-front war. Instead, each preferred buck-passing. Between 1933 and March 1939, there was no alliance between any of Hitler’s great-power rivals. The United Kingdom buck-passed to France, which tried to push Hitler eastward against the smaller states of eastern Europe and possibly the Soviet Union, which in turn tried to pass the buck to the United Kingdom and France. In March 1939, the United Kingdom finally joined forces with France against the Third Reich, but the Soviet Union did not join with its former allies. After Germany knocked France out of the war in June 1940, the United Kingdom tried to ally with the Soviet Union but failed because the Soviets preferred to continue buck-passing. Although Hitler’s rivals showed little interest in creating an anti-German balancing coalition, both France and the Soviet Union went to considerable lengths in the 1930s to maintain armies that could stand up to the Wehrmacht. They did so to increase the likelihood that buck-passing would work because the more powerful each was, the less likely that Hitler would attack it. Strong armies were also an insurance policy to protect them in the event that 1) they ended up catching the buck and facing the Nazi war machine alone, or 2) buck-passing worked, but the buck-catcher failed to contain the Wehrmacht.",

    "text": "Union against Hitler during the 1930s. The United Kingdom's buck-passing notwithstanding, French leaders worked hard throughout the 1930s to get the United Kingdom to commit itself to the defense of France. They prized an Anglo-French alliance because it would increase the likelihood that their buck-passing strategy would work. The combination of British and French military might make a German offensive in the west less likely, and thus increased the probability that the Wehrmacht would strike first in the east. Moreover, if buck-passing failed, fighting with the United Kingdom against the Wehrmacht was clearly preferable to fighting it alone. France also mobilized its own resources to facilitate buck-passing and to protect itself in the event of a buck-passing failure. Little was done to increase French defense spending during Hitler's first two years in office, probably because France had a relatively powerful military when Hitler came to power in 1933. But starting in 1935, the size of the annual defense budget grew constantly and sharply as different French governments sought to maintain a military that could stymie a Wehrmacht offensive. For example, France spent 7.5 billion francs on defense in 1935, 11.2 billion francs in 1937, and 44.1 billion francs in 1939.\n\nScholars disagree substantially about Soviet policy for dealing with Nazi Germany between 1934 and 1938. Stalin's strategy for the period from 1939 to 1941 is more straightforward and less controversial. There are three main schools of thought on Soviet policy in the mid-1930s. Some claim that Stalin, not Hitler, was driving events in Europe, and that the Soviet leader pursued a bait-and-bleed strategy. Specifically, it is argued, Stalin intervened in German politics to help Hitler become chancellor because he believed that the Nazis would start a war against the United Kingdom and France, which would work to the Soviets' advantage. Others contend that Stalin was determined to build a balancing coalition with the United Kingdom and France to confront Nazi Germany, but this effort at \"collective security\" failed because the Western powers refused to cooperate with him. Finally, some argue that Stalin was pursuing a buck-passing strategy, the aim of which was to foster cooperation with Hitler while working to undermine Germany's relations with the United Kingdom and France, so that Hitler would be inclined to attack them first. That approach would not only facilitate passing the buck to the Western great powers but would also create opportunities for Hitler and Stalin to gang up on small states in eastern Europe, such as Poland.",

    "text": "Although Stalin was certainly a clever strategist at times, there is insufficient evidence to support the bait-and-bleed thesis. There is, however, considerable evidence that he pushed both the collective security and buck-passing strategies between 1934 and 1938. This is not surprising, since the political landscape in Europe was undergoing rapid and fundamental change in the wake of Hitler's rise to power, and it was not clear where events were leading. Historian Adam Ulam puts the point well: \"'Confronted with a terrible danger, the Soviets felt a desperate need to keep all the options open, hoping that one of them would enable the [Soviet Union] to postpone or avoid an actual entanglement in war.'\" Nevertheless, on balance, the available evidence from the mid-1930s suggests that buck-passing was Stalin's preferred strategy for dealing with Nazi Germany. Buck-passing, of course, is an attractive strategy, which is why the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union were all pursuing it. If it works as designed, the buck-passer avoids the heavy costs of fighting the aggressor and might even gain relative power. Granted, Stalin's buck-passing strategy ultimately failed when France fell in June 1940. But Stalin had no way of knowing that would happen. Indeed, there was good reason at the time to think that the United Kingdom and France would hold their own against the Wehrmacht. Buck-passing in Europe was also attractive because the Soviets faced a serious threat from Japan in the Far East throughout the 1930s. Furthermore, Stalin surely recognized that there were a host of factors at play in the mid-1930s that made it unlikely that he could resurrect the Triple Entente. For example, the French army was not well-suited for offensive operations against Germany, especially after Hitler took back the Rhineland in March 1936. Therefore, Stalin could not depend on France to attack Germany if Hitler struck first against the Soviet Union. Stalin also had abundant evidence that both the United Kingdom and France were committed to buck-passing, which did not bode well for their reliability as allies. This problem was compounded by the deep-seated ideological hostility between Moscow and the Western powers. Finally, as noted, the geography of eastern Europe was a major impediment to the so-called collective security option.",

    "text": "While the Wehrmacht was experiencing growing pains between 1933 and 1939, France and the Soviet Union were expanding their militaries to counter the German buildup. Both the Red Army and the French army were more powerful than the German army through 1937, but their advantage eroded over the next two years, and Germany became the dominant military power in Europe by mid-1939. For this reason, many scholars now believe that Hitler's rivals should have fought the Wehrmacht in 1938 rather than 1939.\nThe French army, as Table 8.6 makes clear, was substantially larger than its German counterpart as late as 1937. It also enjoyed a qualitative edge, not because the French army was an efficient fighting force (it was not), but because the Wehrmacht's ongoing expansion severely limited its fighting capacity. By 1938, Germany finally had a peacetime army that was larger than France's, but as Table 8.7 makes clear, France could still mobilize a larger wartime army: 100 French versus 71 German divisions. By 1939, Germany had erased that French advantage; they now could mobilize about the same number of divisions for war. Moreover, the German army was qualitatively better than the French army, and it had a superior air force supporting it. Given that Germany possessed significantly more wealth and a much larger population than France, it is hardly surprising that the military power gap between them widened even further by 1940.\nThe Red Army was also qualitatively and quantitatively superior to the German army between 1933 and 1937. David Glantz is surely correct when he says, \"Had the Germans and Soviets fought in the mid-1930s, the Red Army would have had a considerable advantage over its opponent.\" That advantage slipped away in the late 1930s, however, not just because of the German army's growing strength, but also because of Stalin's purges (see Table 8.8). Given that Germany was no potential hegemon before 1939, and given that the French army and the Red Army could each have matched the German army through 1938, it makes sense that a balancing coalition like the Triple Entente did not form against Germany before 1939, and that Hitler's rivals instead passed the buck to each other. It also makes sense that the United Kingdom and France formed an alliance against Hitler in March 1939, because the day was fast approaching when the German army would be clearly superior to the French army, which would then need help fending off the Wehrmacht.",

    "text": "That the Western powers did not join forces with the Soviet Union to recreate the Triple Entente can be explained by the fact that the United Kingdom and France did not have to fear for the Soviet Union's survival in 1939 the way they had feared for Russia's survival before World War I. The Western powers had little choice but to ally with Russia before 1914, because it was barely capable of standing up to a German offensive. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, had much more industrial and military might than its Russian predecessor had, and thus the United Kingdom and France were not compelled to defend it. Stalin, for his part, recognized that the United Kingdom and France together were at least as powerful as Germany, and thus he could buck-pass to them.  Finally, the absence of a common border between Germany and the Soviet Union from 1933 until September 1939 greatly hindered efforts to create a united front against the Third Reich. Moreover, it made it likely that France (which bordered Nazi Germany), not the Soviet Union, would end up catching the buck. The British desire to form an alliance with the Soviet Union after June 1940 needs no explanation, as the United Kingdom was already at war with Nazi Germany and naturally wanted all the help it could get. The more interesting question is why the Soviet Union rejected the United Kingdom's overtures and continued buck-passing to it. After all, the German army was far superior to what was left of the British army after Dunkirk, which should have allowed Germany to easily defeat the United Kingdom and then turn its guns against the Soviet Union. The stopping power of water, however, saved the United Kingdom and made buck-passing look like a winning strategy for Stalin. The English Channel made it almost impossible for the Wehrmacht to invade and conquer the United Kingdom, which meant that the British were likely to fight a long war with the Germans in the air, on the seas, and in peripheral areas such as North Africa and the Balkans. Indeed, that is mainly what happened between 1940 and 1945. Allying with the United Kingdom was also unattractive for Stalin because not only would the Soviet Union get dragged into war with the Third Reich, but the Red Army would end up doing most of the fighting against the Wehrmacht, since the United Kingdom was in no position to send a large army to the continent.

    "section": "Concluding Remarks & THE COLD WAR",
    "text": "Let me conclude with a final word about the contrasting behavior of Germany's rivals in the years before the two world wars. Three key differences account for why the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union tended to buck-pass against the Third Reich but formed a balancing coalition against the Kaiserreich seven years before World War I. First, Nazi Germany was not a formidable military threat until 1939, whereas the kaiser's army was the most powerful fighting force in Europe from at least 1870 until the end of World War I. Indeed, Hitler's Germany was not a potential hegemon until 1939; Wilhelmine Germany achieved that status in 1903. Second, the Soviet Union controlled considerably more potential as well as actual military power during the 1930s than did pre-World War I Russia. Thus, the United Kingdom and France had less cause to worry about the survival of the Soviet Union than about tsarist Russia. Third, Germany and Russia shared a common border before 1914, but did not before 1939, and separation encouraged buck-passing.\n\nTHE COLD WAR (1945-90)\nBackground\nWhen the Third Reich finally collapsed in April 1945, the Soviet Union was left standing as the most powerful state in Europe. Imperial Japan collapsed four months later (August 1945), leaving the Soviet Union also as the most powerful state in Northeast Asia. No other great power existed in either Europe or Northeast Asia that could stop the mighty Red Army from overrunning those regions and establishing Soviet hegemony. The United States was the only state powerful enough to contain Soviet expansion. There were reasons, however, to think that the United States might not balance against the Soviet Union. The United States was neither a European nor an Asian power, and it had a long history of avoiding entangling alliances in those areas. In fact, Franklin Roosevelt had told Stalin at Yalta in February 1945 that he expected all American troops to be out of Europe within two years after World War II ended. Furthermore, given that the United States and the Soviet Union were allies in the fight against Nazi Germany from 1941 until 1945, it was difficult for American policymakers to do a sudden 180-degree turn and tell the public that the Soviet Union was now a deadly foe, not a friendly state. There was also a powerful imperative after the war for Stalin and Harry Truman to work together to deal with the defeated Axis powers, especially Germany.",

A communist insurgency in Greece (1944-1949) presented another opportunity, although Stalin's involvement remained indirect. Initially, the US relied on the UK to protect Greece and Turkey, but Britain's weakened economy prompted the US to intervene directly.  The Truman Doctrine (March 1947) signaled America's commitment to resisting communism globally, requesting $400 million in aid for Greece and Turkey.  This intervention proved successful, leading to the defeat of Greek communists and denying Soviet ambitions in Turkey.  Fears of Soviet influence in Western Europe, particularly through communist parties in France and Italy, led to the Marshall Plan in June 1947, aiming to bolster European economies against communist inroads.",

    "section": "Buck-Passing and Balancing Coalitions",
    "text": "Coalitions are feasible when there are only two great powers. The Cold War supports this, with the US containing the Soviet Union.  Earlier, facing potential European hegemons like Germany, the US initially passed the buck to other European powers. Buck-passing was impossible during the Cold War due to the lack of a power capable of containing the Soviet Union, prompting the US to balance against the Soviet threat. Regarding multipolarity, the theory predicts buck-passing is most likely without a potential hegemon, but still likely even with a powerful state.  Among multipolar cases, Bismarck's Prussia, the only aggressor not a potential hegemon, saw widespread buck-passing. No balancing coalition formed against Prussia during its three wars. The UK and Russia welcomed a unified Germany, hoping it would serve as a future buck-catcher. Austria and France, directly threatened by Prussia, buck-passed instead.  Balancing coalitions formed against potential hegemons like Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, and Nazi Germany, but buck-passing still occurred.  The theory suggests power balance and geography explain these differences. More power means less buck-passing; shared borders discourage it.  The least buck-passing occurred against Wilhelmine Germany. The Triple Entente (UK, France, Russia) formed by 1907 to contain Germany. France and Russia allied in the early 1890s due to Germany's imposing army. Germany wasn't yet a potential hegemon, and the combined Franco-Russian armies seemed capable of containment, allowing the UK to remain sidelined. This changed when Germany became a potential hegemon (1903) and Russia suffered defeat by Japan (1904-5), prompting the UK to join the Triple Entente. More buck-passing occurred against Nazi Germany.  The UK, France, and the Soviet Union never formed a coalition, all pursuing buck-passing strategies in the 1930s.  The UK and France opposed Hitler in 1939, but the Soviets continued buck-passing. After France's defeat, Stalin fostered a long UK-Germany war, joining the Anglo-Soviet coalition (later joined by the US) only after Operation Barbarossa in 1941. The 1930s buck-passing was partly because Germany's army wasn't formidable until 1939. When Germany became a potential hegemon, the UK and France allied, but not with the more powerful Soviet Union. Stalin's refusal to join stemmed from his belief in the stopping power of water, expecting a long war beneficial to the Soviets.",

Its rivals consistently buck-passed until 1804, as France wasn't powerful enough to require a united response. By 1805, Napoleon's army threatened French hegemony. Before a unified coalition formed, Napoleon defeated Austria and Prussia, forcing Russia to peace. Inefficient balancing, common in multipolarity, allowed Napoleon's victories (1805-1809). Napoleon's 1812 defeat in Russia allowed rivals to balance effectively, defeating France (1813-1815). Geography discouraged buck-passing against Wilhelmine Germany, but encouraged it against Nazi Germany and Napoleonic France. The UK fought all three, separated by the English Channel.  Wilhelmine Germany's shared borders with France and Russia facilitated their coalition and direct strikes. France bordered Nazi Germany, but the Soviet Union was separated by minor powers, encouraging buck-passing and hindering a Franco-Soviet coalition.  Napoleon's rivals often lacked common borders, facilitating buck-passing and complicating alliances.  Geography and power distribution determine whether threatened powers balance or buck-pass.  The next chapter analyzes aggressor behavior, focusing on war initiation. Power distribution is key to understanding great-power war.",

    "text": "Security competition is constant, but war isn't. This chapter offers a structural theory explaining this shift, focusing on the causes of great-power war (involving at least one great power). Anarchy, while a deep cause of war, doesn't explain why security competition sometimes leads to war. Anarchy is constant, but war isn't. To explain this variation, we consider power distribution: bipolarity, balanced multipolarity, and unbalanced multipolarity. Bipolar systems are most peaceful, unbalanced multipolar systems most prone to war, and balanced multipolar systems fall in between. Structural theories like offensive realism are crude predictors, unable to specify war frequency or timing.  Offensive realism suggests Germany's early 1900s emergence as a potential hegemon made great-power war likely, but not its exact timing (1914, not 1912 or 1916). Nonstructural factors influence war decisions. States don't fight solely for security. Bismarck's wars (1864-1870) were influenced by nationalism and domestic politics. Structural forces strongly influence state behavior, especially survival. Focusing on structure reveals much about great-power war origins. Numerous war theories exist, addressing human nature, leaders, domestic politics, ideology, capitalism, interdependence, and international structure. Some theories emphasize power distribution. Waltz favors bipolarity for peace; Deutsch and Singer argue the opposite. Others focus on preponderant power. Classical realists like Morgenthau prefer a balance of power; Gilpin and Organski see a preponderant power as stability-inducing.",

    "section": "Structure and War",
    "text": "The main causes of war are located in the architecture of the international system. What matters most is the number of great powers and how much power each controls. A system can be either bipolar or multipolar, and power can be distributed more or less evenly among the leading states. The power ratios among all the great powers affect the prospects for stability, but the key ratio is that between the two most formidable states in the system. If there is a lopsided power gap, the number one state is a potential hegemon. A system that contains an aspiring hegemon is said to be unbalanced; a system without such a dominant state is said to be balanced. Power need not be distributed equally among all the major states in a balanced system, although it can be. The basic requirement for balance is that there not be a marked difference in power between the two leading states. If there is, the system is unbalanced. Combining these two dimensions of power produces four possible kinds of systems: 1) unbalanced bipolarity, 2) balanced bipolarity, 3) unbalanced multipolarity, and 4) balanced multipolarity. Unbalanced bipolarity is not a useful category, because this kind of system is unlikely to be found in the real world. I know of none in modern times. It is certainly possible that some region might find itself with just two great powers, one of which is markedly more powerful than the other. But that system is likely to disappear quickly, because the stronger state is likely to conquer its weaker rival, who would have no other great power to turn to for help, since by definition there are no other great powers. In fact, the weaker power might even capitulate without a fight, making the more powerful state a regional hegemon. In short, unbalanced bipolar systems are so unstable that they cannot last for any appreciable period of time. Thus we are likely to find power apportioned among the leading states in three different patterns. Bipolar systems (this is shorthand for balanced bipolarity) are ruled by two great powers that have roughly equal strength—or at least neither state is decidedly more powerful than the other. Unbalanced multipolar systems are dominated by three or more great powers, one of which is a potential hegemon. Balanced multipolar systems are dominated by three or more great powers, none of which is an aspiring hegemon: there is no significant gap in military strength between the system's leading two states, although some power asymmetries are likely to exist among the great powers. How do these different distributions of power affect the prospects for war and peace? Bipolar systems are the most stable of the three systems. Great-power wars are infrequent, and when they occur, they are likely to involve one of the great powers fighting against a minor power, not the rival great power. Unbalanced multipolar systems feature the most dangerous distribution of power, mainly because potential hegemons are likely to get into wars with all of the other great powers in the system. These wars invariably turn out to be long and enormously costly. Balanced multipolar systems occupy a middle ground: great-power war is more likely than in bipolarity, but decidedly less likely than in unbalanced multipolarity. Moreover, the wars between the great powers are likely to be one-on-one or two-on-one engagements, not systemwide conflicts like those that occur when there is a potential hegemon.",

    "section": "Polarity vs. Multipolarity",
    "text": "War is more likely in multipolarity than bipolarity for three reasons. First, there are more opportunities for war because there are more potential conflict dyads in a multipolar system. Second, imbalances of power are more commonplace in a multipolar world, and thus great powers are more likely to have the capability to win a war, making deterrence more difficult and war more likely. Third, the potential for miscalculation is greater in multipolarity: states might think they have the capability to coerce or conquer another state when, in fact, they do not.\n\nOpportunities for War\nA multipolar system has more potential conflict situations than does a bipolar order. Consider great-great power dyads. Under bipolarity, there are only two great powers and therefore only one conflict dyad directly involving them. For example, the Soviet Union was the only great power that the United States could have fought during the Cold War. In contrast, a multipolar system with three great powers has three dyads across which war might break out between the great powers: A can fight B, A can fight C, and B can fight C. A system with five great powers has ten great-great power dyads. Conflict could also erupt across dyads involving major and minor powers. In setting up a hypothetical scenario, it seems reasonable to assume the same number of minor powers in both the bipolar and multipolar systems, since the number of major powers should have no meaningful effect on the number of minor powers. Therefore, because there are more great powers in multipolarity, there are more great-minor power dyads. Consider the following examples: in a bipolar world with 10 minor powers, there are 20 great-minor power dyads; in a multipolar system with 5 great powers and the same 10 minor powers, there are 50 such dyads. This disparity in the number of great-minor power dyads in the two systems probably should be tilted further in favor of bipolarity, because it is generally less flexible than multipolarity. Bipolar systems are likely to be rigid structures. Two great powers dominate, and the logic of security competition suggests that they will be unambiguous rivals. Most minor powers find it difficult to remain unattached to one of the major powers in bipolarity, because the major powers demand allegiance from the smaller states. This tightness is especially true in core geographical areas, less so in peripheral areas. The pulling of minor powers into the orbit of one or the other great power makes it difficult for either great power to pick a fight with minor powers closely allied with its adversary; as a result, the number of potential conflict situations is substantially less. During the Cold War, for example, the United States was not about to use military force against Hungary or Poland, which were allied with the Soviet Union. Thus, there should probably be substantially fewer than 20 great-minor power dyads in our hypothetical bipolar world. In contrast, multipolar systems are less firmly structured. The exact form multipolarity takes can vary widely, depending on the number of major and minor powers in the system and the geographical arrangement of those states. Nevertheless, both major and minor powers usually have considerable flexibility regarding alliance partners, and minor powers are less likely to be closely tied to a great power than in a bipolar system. This autonomy, however, leaves minor powers vulnerable to attack from the great powers. Thus, the 50 great-minor power dyads in our hypothetical multipolar system is probably a reasonable number. Wars between minor powers are largely ignored in this study because the aim is to develop a theory of great-power war. Yet minor-power wars sometimes widen and great powers get dragged into the fighting. Although the subject of escalation lies outside the scope of this study, a brief word is in order about how polarity affects the likelihood of great powers getting pulled into wars between minor powers. Basically, that possibility is greater in multipolarity than in bipolarity, because there are more opportunities for minor powers to fight each other in multipolarity, and thus more opportunities for great-power involvement. Consider that our hypothetical bipolar and multipolar worlds both contain 10 minor powers, which means that there are 45 potential minor-minor power dyads in each system. That number should be markedly reduced for bipolarity because the general tightness of bipolar systems makes it difficult for minor powers to go to war against each other. Specifically, both great powers would seek to prevent fighting between their own minor-power allies, as well as conflicts involving minor powers from the rival camps, for fear of escalation. Minor powers have much more room to maneuver in a multipolar system, and thus they have more freedom to fight each other. Greece and Turkey, for example, fought a war between 1921 and 1924 when Europe was multipolar. But they were in no position to fight with each other during the Cold War, when Europe was bipolar, because the United States would not have tolerated a war between any of its European allies for fear it would have weakened NATO vis-à-vis the Soviet Union.",

    "text": "Power asymmetries among the great powers are more commonplace in multipolarity than bipolarity, and the strong become hard to deter when power is unbalanced, because they have increased capability to win wars. But even if we assume that the military strength of the great powers is roughly equal, power imbalances that lead to conflict are still more likely in multipolarity than in bipolarity. Multipolar systems tend toward inequality, whereas bipolar systems tend toward equality, for one principal reason. The more great powers there are in a system, the more likely it is that wealth and population size, the building blocks of military power, will be distributed unevenly among them. To illustrate, let us assume that we live in a world where, regardless of how many great powers populate the system, there is a 50 percent chance that any two great powers will have roughly the same amount of latent power. If there are only two great powers in that world (bipolarity), obviously there is a 50 percent chance that each state will control the same quantity of latent power. But if there are three great powers in that world (multipolarity), there is only a 12.5 percent chance that all of them will have the same amount of latent power. With four great powers (multipolarity), there is less than a 2 percent chance that the ingredients of military might will be distributed evenly among all of them. One could use a different number for the likelihood that any two states will have equal amounts of latent power—say, 25 percent or 60 percent instead of 50 percent—but the basic story would remain the same. Asymmetries in latent power are more likely to be found among the great powers in multipolarity than in bipolarity, and the more great powers there are in multipolarity, the more remote the chances of symmetry. This is not to say that it is impossible to have a multipolar system in which the great powers possess equal proportions of latent power, but only that it is considerably less likely than in a bipolar system. Of course, the reason for this concern with latent power is that significant variations in wealth and population size among the leading states are likely to lead to disparities in actual military power, simply because some states will be better endowed to pursue an arms race than are others. But even if we assume that all the major states are equally powerful, imbalances in power still occur more often in multipolarity than in bipolarity. Two great powers in a multipolar system, for example, can join together to attack a third great power, as the United Kingdom and France did against Russia in the Crimean War (1853–56), and Italy and Prussia did against Austria in 1866. This kind of ganging up is impossible in bipolarity, since only two great powers compete. Two great powers can also join forces to conquer a minor power, as Austria and Prussia did against Denmark in 1864, and Germany and the Soviet Union did against Poland in 1939. Ganging up of this sort is logically possible in a bipolar world, but it is highly unlikely because the two great powers are almost certain to be archrivals disinclined to go to war as allies. Furthermore, a major power might use its superior strength to coerce or conquer a minor power. This kind of behavior is more likely in multipolarity than in bipolarity because there are more potential great-minor power dyads in a multipolar system. One might argue that balance-of-power dynamics can operate to counter any power imbalances that arise in multipolarity. No state can dominate another if the other states coalesce firmly against it.",

    "section": "The Causes of Great Power War",
    "text": "Indeed, this might be seen as an advantage that multipolarity has over bipolarity, since great-power balancing coalitions are not feasible in a world with only two great powers. But threatened states rarely form effective balancing coalitions in time to contain an aggressor. As Chapter 8 demonstrated, threatened states prefer buck-passing to balancing, but buck-passing directly undermines efforts to build powerful balancing coalitions. But even when threatened states do balance together in multipolarity, diplomacy is an uncertain process. It can take time to build a defensive coalition, especially if the number of states required to form a balancing alliance is large. An aggressor may conclude that it can gain its objectives before the opposing coalition is fully formed. Finally, geography sometimes prevents balancing states from putting meaningful pressure on aggressors. For example, a major power may not be able to put effective military pressure on a state threatening to cause trouble because they are separated from each other by a large body of water or another state.\n\nA final problem with multipolarity lies in its tendency to foster miscalculation. Multipolarity leads states to underestimate the resolve of rival states and the strength of opposing coalitions. States then mistakenly conclude that they have the military capability to coerce an opponent, or if that fails, to defeat it in battle. War is more likely when a state underestimates the willingness of an opposing state to stand firm on issues of difference. It then may push the other state too far, expecting the other to concede when in fact it will choose to fight. Such miscalculation is more likely under multipolarity because the shape of the international order tends to remain fluid, due to the tendency of coalitions to shift. As a result, the nature of the agreed international rules of the road—norms of state behavior, and agreed divisions of territorial rights and other privileges—tend to change constantly. No sooner may the rules of a given adversarial relationship be worked out than that relationship becomes a friendship, a new rivalry emerges with a previous friend or neutral, and new rules of the road must be established. Under these circumstances, one state may unwittingly push another too far, because ambiguities as to national rights and obligations leave a wider range of issues on which each state may misjudge the other's resolve. Norms of state behavior can come to be broadly understood and accepted by all states, even in multipolarity, just as basic norms of diplomatic conduct became generally accepted by the European powers during the eighteenth century. Nevertheless, a well-defined division of rights is generally more difficult when the number of states is large and relations among them are in flux, as is the case with multipolarity.\n\nWar is also more likely when states underestimate the relative power of an opposing coalition, either because they underestimate the number of states who will oppose them, or because they exaggerate the number of allies who will fight on their own side. Such errors are more likely in a system of many states, since states then must accurately predict the behavior of many other states in order to calculate the balance of power between coalitions. Even assuming that a state knows who is going to fight with and against it, measuring the military strength of multistate coalitions is considerably more difficult than assessing the power of a single rival. Miscalculation is less likely in a bipolar world. States are less likely to miscalculate others’ resolve, because the rules of the road with the main opponent become settled over time, leading both parties to recognize the limits beyond which they cannot push the other. States also cannot miscalculate the membership of the opposing coalition, since each side faces only one main enemy. Simplicity breeds certainty; certainty bolsters peace.",

    "section": "Balanced vs. Unbalanced Multipolarity",
    "text": "Unbalanced multipolar systems are especially war-prone for two reasons. The potential hegemons, which are the defining feature of this kind of system, have an appreciable power advantage over the other great powers, which means that they have good prospects of winning wars against their weaker rivals. One might think that a marked power asymmetry of this sort would decrease the prospects for war. After all, being so powerful should make the potential hegemon feel secure and thus should ameliorate the need to initiate a war to gain more power. Moreover, the lesser powers should recognize that the leading state is essentially a status quo power and relax. But even if they fail to recognize the dominant power’s benign intentions, the fact is that they do not have the military capability to challenge it. Therefore, according to this logic, the presence of a potential hegemon in a multipolar system should enhance the prospects for peace.\n\nThis is not what happens, however, when potential hegemons come on the scene. Their considerable military might notwithstanding, they are not likely to be satisfied with the balance of power. Instead they will aim to acquire more power and eventually gain regional hegemony, because hegemony is the ultimate form of security; there are no meaningful security threats to the dominant power in a unipolar system. Of course, not only do potential hegemons have a powerful incentive to rule their region, they also have the capability to push for supremacy, which means that they are a dangerous threat to peace.\n\nPotential hegemons also invite war by increasing the level of fear among the great powers. Fear is endemic to states in the international system, and it drives them to compete for power so that they can increase their prospects for survival in a dangerous world. The emergence of a potential hegemon, however, makes the other great powers especially fearful, and they will search hard for ways to correct the imbalance of power and will be inclined to pursue riskier policies toward that end. The reason is simple: when one state is threatening to dominate the rest, the long-term value of remaining at peace declines and threatened states will be more willing to take chances to improve their security. A potential hegemon does not have to do much to generate fear among the other states in the system. Its formidable capabilities alone are likely to scare neighboring great powers and push at least some of them to create a balancing coalition against their dangerous opponent. Because a state’s intentions are difficult to discern, and because they can change quickly, rival great powers will be inclined to assume the worst about the potential hegemon’s intentions, further reinforcing the threatened states’ incentive to contain it and maybe even weaken it if the opportunity presents itself. The target of this containment strategy, however, is sure to view any balancing coalition forming against it as encirclement by its rivals. The potential hegemon would be correct to think this way, even though the lesser great powers’ purpose is essentially defensive in nature. Nevertheless, the leading state is likely to feel threatened and scared and consequently is likely to take steps to enhance its security, thereby making the neighboring great powers more scared, and forcing them to take additional steps to enhance their security, which then scares the potential hegemon even more, and so on. In short, potential hegemons generate spirals of fear that are hard to control. This problem is compounded by the fact that they possess considerable power and thus are likely to think they can solve their security problems by going to war.",

    "text": "Thus, bipolarity is the most stable of the different architectures, for four reasons. First, there are relatively fewer opportunities for conflict in bipolarity, and only one possible conflict dyad involving the great powers. When great powers do fight in bipolarity, they are likely to engage minor powers, not the rival great power. Second, power is more likely to be equally distributed among the great powers in bipolarity, an important structural source of stability. Furthermore, there is limited opportunity for the great powers to gang up against other states or take advantage of minor powers. Third, bipolarity discourages miscalculation and thus reduces the likelihood that the great powers will stumble into war. Fourth, although fear is constantly at play in world politics, bipolarity does not magnify those anxieties that haunt states. Balanced multipolarity is more prone to war than is bipolarity, for three reasons. First, multipolarity presents considerably more opportunities for conflict, especially between the great powers themselves. Wars that simultaneously involve all the great powers, however, are unlikely. Second, power is likely to be distributed unevenly among the leading states, and those states with greater military capability will be prone to start wars, because they will think that they have the capability to win them. There will also be ample opportunity for great powers to gang up on third parties and to coerce or conquer minor powers. Third, miscalculation is likely to be a serious problem in balanced multipolarity, although high levels of fear among the great powers are unlikely, because there are no exceptional power gaps between the leading states in the system. Unbalanced multipolarity is the most perilous distribution of power. Not only does it have all the problems of balanced multipolarity, it also suffers from the worst kind of inequality: the presence of a potential hegemon. That state both has significant capability to cause trouble and spawns high levels of fear among the great powers. Both of those developments increase the likelihood of war, which is likely to involve all the great powers in the system and be especially costly.\n\nNow that the theory about the causes of war has been presented, let us switch gears and consider how well it explains events in Europe between 1792 and 1990. To test offensive realism’s claims about how different distributions of power affect the likelihood of great-power war, it is necessary to identify the periods between 1792 and 1990 when Europe was either bipolar or multipolar, and when there was a potential hegemon in those multipolar systems. It is then necessary to identify the great-power wars for each of those periods. System structure, we know, is a function of the number of great powers and how power is apportioned among them. The list of European great powers for the two centuries under discussion includes Austria, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Russia. Only Russia, which was known as the Soviet Union between 1917 and 1990, was a great power for the entire period. Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in 1867, was a great power from 1792 until its demise in 1918. Great Britain and Germany were great powers from 1792 until 1945, although Germany was actually Prussia before 1871. Italy is considered a great power from 1861 until its collapse in 1943.",

    "text": "What about Japan and the United States, which are not located in Europe, but were great powers for part of the relevant period? Japan, which was a great power from 1895 until 1945, is left out of the subsequent analysis because it was never a major player in European politics. Japan declared war against Germany at the start of World War I, but other than taking a few German possessions in Asia, it remained on the sidelines. Japan also sent troops into the Soviet Union during the last year of World War I, in conjunction with the United Kingdom, France, and the United States, who were trying to get the Soviet Union back into the war against Germany. Japan, however, was mainly concerned with acquiring territory in Russia’s Far East, not with events in Europe, about which it cared little. Regardless, the intervention was a failure.\n\nThe United States is a different matter. Although it is located in the Western Hemisphere, it committed military forces to fight in Europe during both world wars, and it has maintained a large military presence in the region since 1945. In those instances in which the United States accepted a continental commitment, it is considered a major actor in the European balance of power. But for reasons discussed in Chapter 7, America was never a potential hegemon in Europe; it acted instead as an offshore balancer. Much of the work on assessing the relative strength of the great powers during the years between 1792 and 1990, especially regarding the crucial question of whether there was a potential hegemon in Europe, was done in Chapter 8. The missing parts of the story are filled in below. Based on the relevant distribution of power among the major states, European history from the outbreak of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in 1792 until the end of the Cold War in 1990 can be roughly divided into seven periods: 1) Napoleonic era I, 1792–93 (1 year), balanced multipolarity; 2) Napoleonic era II, 1793–1815 (22 years), unbalanced multipolarity; 3) Nineteenth century, 1815–1902 (88 years), balanced multipolarity; 4) Kaiserreich era, 1903–18 (16 years), unbalanced multipolarity; 5) Interwar years, 1919–38 (20 years), balanced multipolarity; 6) Nazi era, 1939–45 (6 years), unbalanced multipolarity; and 7) Cold War, 1945–90 (46 years), bipolarity.",

    "text": "In 1918, American troops arrived in Europe in large numbers. Wilhelmine Germany was a potential hegemon, controlling the strongest army and greatest wealth, leading to unbalanced multipolarity in Europe from 1903 to 1918. This period was dominated by World War I (1914-18), a central war involving all great powers and many minor powers.  The Russian Civil War (1918-21) saw UK, France, Japan, and the US intervene, fighting the Bolsheviks. The Italo-Turkish War (1911-12) was a great power vs. minor power conflict where Italy conquered Ottoman provinces.  Between the world wars (1919-38), five great powers existed: UK, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. No potential hegemon existed, resulting in balanced multipolarity. France had the strongest army but lacked the wealth and population to be a potential hegemon. No great power vs. great power wars occurred, but the Russo-Polish War (1919-20) saw Poland invade a weakened Soviet Union. The Nazi era (1939-45) began with the same five powers. France and Italy were defeated, leaving UK, Germany, and the Soviet Union as great powers, with the US entering after 1941. Nazi Germany was a potential hegemon, leading to unbalanced multipolarity. World War II dominated this period, along with the Russo-Finnish War (1939-40). After World War II, only the Soviet Union remained a great power in Europe, but the US maintained a strong presence, resulting in bipolarity from 1945 to 1990. No great power war occurred, but the Russo-Hungarian War (1956) saw Soviet intervention. Analysis of this period reveals bipolarity as the most peaceful and least deadly system structure.  Unbalanced multipolarity is the most war-prone and deadly, while balanced multipolarity falls in between.",

    "text": "The findings support offensive realism, but the presence of nuclear weapons during the bipolar era complicates the analysis. Nuclear weapons are a strong force for peace, making it difficult to isolate the impact of bipolarity itself.  Lack of empirical studies on bipolarity and multipolarity without nuclear weapons further hinders analysis. Pre-1945 European history provides no bipolar comparisons, and while earlier examples exist (Athens/Sparta, Rome/Carthage), the historical record is incomplete. However, comparing types of multipolarity is possible, as nuclear weapons were absent. The presence of a potential hegemon significantly impacts peace prospects.  A multipolar system with a dominant power in terms of military and wealth (e.g., Napoleonic France, Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany) is more likely to experience major war. The final chapter will examine great power relations in the 1990s and the likelihood of conflict in the 21st century. Many in the West believe international politics fundamentally changed after the Cold War, with cooperation replacing security competition and conflict as the defining feature of great power relations.",

    "text": "Realist theories of international relations are outdated and irrelevant to the current political landscape. They may have been useful for understanding great power interactions before 1990, but they fail to explain the dynamics of the post-Cold War era.  President Clinton articulated this view in the 1990s, arguing that power politics was giving way to cooperation based on shared values and enlightened self-interest, particularly in the context of NATO expansion. However, this optimistic perspective is flawed.  Great powers still prioritize the balance of power and compete for it. Realism remains the most powerful framework for understanding international politics, even if non-realist theories dominate academic and policy discussions. The international system remains anarchic, states still fear each other, and they continue to seek power at the expense of others. The collapse of the Soviet Union shifted the global distribution of power but did not alter the anarchic structure of the system. Evidence from the 1990s demonstrates that power politics persists, particularly in Europe and Northeast Asia. Although competition has been low-key, the potential for intense security competition and major war remains, as evidenced by the continued presence of U.S. troops in these regions. The current peace is largely due to benign power distributions and factors like nuclear weapons, but these conditions are subject to change.  This chapter will analyze arguments against realism, demonstrating the persistence of anarchy and security competition among great powers. It will then examine the potential for future instability in Europe and Northeast Asia, concluding with a discussion of China as a potential threat to the United States.",

    "text": "The structure of the international system remains defined by five key assumptions: 1) states are the primary actors in an anarchic system, 2) great powers possess offensive military capability, 3) states cannot be certain of other states' intentions, 4) states prioritize survival, and 5) states are rational actors. These assumptions remain valid in the 21st century. International institutions lack the power to compel great powers to act against their interests. The United Nations, for example, has limited influence and is likely to weaken further with an expanding Security Council. While states benefit from operating through institutions, powerful states shape them to maintain or increase their power. Globalization and economic interdependence have not rendered states impotent. States have historically adapted to economic pressures and continue to do so.  While some argue for the decline of the state, there is no viable alternative political entity to replace it. Even if the state disappeared, anarchy and security competition would likely persist.  Nationalism reinforces the importance of the state, with numerous nations aspiring to statehood. The European Union's progress towards integration does not negate this, as nationalism and individual states within the EU remain strong. Even if a European superstate emerged, it would still operate within a system of states.",

    "text": "Nothing is forever, but there is no good reason to think that the sovereign state's time has passed. Some suggest that great powers no longer have a meaningful offensive military capability against each other because great-power war has become prohibitively costly.  John Mueller maintains that offense had become too costly even before nuclear weapons. World War I, he argues, proved that conventional war among great powers had become senseless slaughter. The flaw in this argument is that great-power conventional wars do not have to be protracted. Quick victories are possible, as Germany demonstrated against France in 1940. The more persuasive variant argues that nuclear weapons make it almost impossible for great powers to attack each other.  This argument also falls apart. Nuclear weapons reduce the likelihood of great-power war, but war between nuclear-armed states is still possible. During the Cold War, both the US and USSR worried about conventional attack despite their nuclear arsenals. Democratic peace theory posits that democracies, certain of each other's benign intentions, do not fight among themselves.  If all great powers were democracies, they would have no need to compete for power.  However, this theory has problems. Some scholars dispute that democracies never fight each other.  Christopher Layne's analysis of four near-wars between democracies shows that balance-of-power considerations, not democratic peace, prevented war.  Also, democracies can backslide into authoritarianism, requiring other democracies to maintain power for their own safety. Even if all current great powers became democratic, it is unlikely they would all remain so. A non-democratic China or Russia would be enough to keep power politics in play.",

    "text": "Social constructivists argue that state behavior is determined by how individuals think and talk about international politics, not by material structures.  They believe realism, the dominant discourse for centuries, promotes distrust and hostility. A new discourse emphasizing trust and cooperation is needed. However, realism's long dominance suggests the anarchic structure of the international system shapes state behavior. Even if one accepts the constructivist view, it's unclear what would cause a shift in discourse after so long.  The causal mechanism for such a change, and whether the new discourse would be benign, are not specified. Some constructivists claim the Cold War's end validates their perspective. They argue that Western intellectuals convinced Gorbachev to abandon realist thinking, leading to the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Eastern Europe and a change in great-power norms.  However, Gorbachev's actions can be explained by realism. The USSR was losing the Cold War and facing a domestic crisis. The costs of empire were too high, and cooperation with the West offered access to needed technology. The collapse of empires and states is not unprecedented, and the basic nature of international politics remained unchanged after the Soviet collapse. Gorbachev's \"new thinking\" holds little sway in Russia today, and contemporary Russian leaders, like their Western counterparts, still view the world through a realist lens.  NATO expansion eastward reflects continued fears of a resurgent Russia. The Soviet collapse does not signify a post-realist international system.",

    "text": "Globalization proponents argue that states prioritize prosperity over survival. In an interdependent world, war is counterproductive. If all great powers prosper, none has an incentive for war.  However, economic crises can undermine prosperity and increase the likelihood of conflict.  Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait stemmed partly from Kuwait's exceeding oil quotas, harming Iraq's economy. Furthermore, states typically target a single rival in war, minimizing damage to their own economy.  Conquest can even bring economic benefits. The high level of economic interdependence before World War I did not prevent its outbreak.  Great powers must prioritize survival. Another challenge to realism emphasizes non-traditional threats like AIDS, environmental degradation, and global warming, which require collective action to solve. While concerning, these threats currently do not endanger great power survival.  Even if they did, there's no guarantee of collective action. Environmental problems, for example, can also lead to inter-state war. Claims of a post-Cold War transformation in international relations are unconvincing. Anarchy persists, and great-power behavior should not have changed significantly. Optimists argue that great powers no longer engage in security competition or fight each other. Europe and Northeast Asia should therefore be zones of peace. However, this argument does not apply to regions without great powers, like South Asia or the Persian Gulf, or to great power interventions in those regions, like the US-led war against Iraq.",

    "text": "United States over issues such as NATO expansion and NATO policy in the Balkans. Nevertheless, Russia's actions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya make clear that it is willing to wage a brutal war if it thinks its vital interests are threatened. More evidence that great-power war remains a serious threat in Europe arises from the fact that the United States maintains one hundred thousand troops in the region, and its leaders often emphasize the importance of keeping NATO intact. If Europe is \"primed for peace,\" as many claim, NATO would surely be disbanded and American forces would be sent home. Instead, they are kept in place. In fact, NATO has moved eastward and incorporated the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland into its ranks. Why? Because there is potential for dangerous security competition in Europe, and the United States is determined to keep the forces of trouble at bay. Otherwise why would it be spending tens of billions of dollars annually to maintain a large military presence in Europe?\nThere is considerable evidence that the \"pacifier argument\" is widely accepted among policymakers and scholars on both sides of the Atlantic. For example, President Clinton told the West Point graduating class of 1997, \"Some say we no longer need NATO because there is no powerful threat to our security now. I say there is no powerful threat in part because NATO is there.\" That same year, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the U.S. Senate at her confirmation hearing, \"We have an interest in European security, because we wish to avoid the instability that drew five million Americans across the Atlantic to fight in two world wars.\" It appears that many Europeans also believe in the pacifier argument. Between 1990 and 1994, Robert Art conducted more than one hundred interviews with European political-military elites. He found that most believed that \"if the Americans removed their security blanket from Europe . . . the Western European states could well return to the destructive power politics that they had just spent the last forty-five years trying to banish from their part of the continent.\" Presumably that perspective is even more tightly held today, since the early 1990s was the heyday of optimism about the prospects for peace in Europe. Finally, it is worth noting that Art, Michael Mandelbaum, and Stephen Van Evera, all prominent scholars who believe that Europe is primed for peace, favor keeping American troops there and maintaining a formidable NATO. Might it be that they are ultimately guided by pacifier logic, not their stated belief that great-power war is no longer a danger in Europe?",

    "text": "There is no question that the presence of U.S. troops in Europe and Northeast Asia has played an important role in moderating security competition and promoting stability over the past decade. But periods of relative peace in those regions cannot be explained simply by the presence or absence of American forces. After all, there were no U.S. troops in Europe during the nineteenth century, yet there were long periods of relative peace. Moreover, even if the United States had committed military forces to Europe in the late 1930s, there still would have been intense security competition among the great powers, and Nazi Germany might have started a major war anyway.\nTo understand why the great powers were so tame in the 1990s, it is necessary to consider the overall distribution of power in each area, which means determining how much power is controlled by each major state in the region, as well as by the United States. In essence, we need to know whether the system is bipolar or multipolar, and if it is multipolar, whether it is unbalanced by the presence of a potential hegemon. Bipolar systems tend to be the most peaceful, whereas unbalanced multipolar systems are the most prone to conflict. Balanced multipolar systems fall somewhere in between.\nEurope remains bipolar in the wake of the Cold War, with Russia and the United States as the region's principal rivals. There are three particular aspects of Europe's bipolarity that make it especially stable. First, both Russia and the United States are armed with nuclear weapons, which are a force for peace. Second, the United States behaves as an offshore balancer in Europe, acting primarily as a check on any local great power that tries to dominate the region. It has no hegemonic aspirations beyond the Western Hemisphere, which significantly reduces the threat it presents to the states of Europe. Third, Russia, which is a local great power that might have territorial ambitions, is too weak militarily to cause serious trouble outside of its own borders.\nNortheast Asia, on the other hand, is now a balanced multipolar system; China, Russia, and the United States are the relevant great powers, and none has the markings of a potential hegemon. Balanced multipolarity tends to be less stable than bipolarity, but the same three factors that enhanced the prospects for peace in bipolar Europe do likewise in multipolar Northeast Asia. First, China, Russia, and the United States all have nuclear arsenals, which makes them less likely to initiate war with each other. Second, although the United States is clearly the most powerful actor in the region, it is an offshore balancer without territorial aspirations. Third, neither the Chinese nor the Russian military has much power-projection capability, making it difficult for them to behave aggressively toward other states in the area.",

One can assume either no fundamental change in the relative wealth and political fortunes of states, or significant changes, such as the collapse of Russia or China's rise as an economic superpower.  The future of the American military presence depends on the existence of a potential hegemon.  Two alternative futures are likely: U.S. withdrawal due to the absence of a potential hegemon, leading to increased instability, particularly in Europe; or continued U.S. engagement to contain a potential hegemon, resulting in intense security competition.  Either scenario suggests less peaceful relations between great powers than during the 1990s.  A common counterargument suggests that U.S. troops will remain regardless of a hegemon, to maintain peace, a vital U.S. interest. This claim requires examination.",

    "text": "American foreign policy aims for hegemony in the Western Hemisphere and no rival hegemon in Europe or Northeast Asia. The U.S. seeks to prevent the emergence of a global competitor.  Historically, the U.S. has acted as an offshore balancer, committing troops only when a potential hegemon requires containment.  If no such threat exists, the approximately 100,000 U.S. troops in each region are likely to withdraw. An alternative argument posits a U.S. interest in maintaining peace in Europe and Northeast Asia, justifying a continued military presence.  Peace is considered vital due to potential economic damage from a major war and the likelihood of U.S. involvement. This argument justifies an open-ended troop commitment.  While peace is desirable, the question is whether it justifies risking U.S. troops.  Peace in these regions is not a vital U.S. interest, and historical evidence does not support this alternative perspective.  The claim that a war would undermine American prosperity lacks analytical basis. Studies suggest that neutral countries often benefit economically from wars involving other powers.  Even if a war did negatively impact the U.S. economy, history suggests the U.S. is unlikely to engage in war solely for economic prosperity, as evidenced by the oil crisis of the 1970s and the Gulf War. The claim that the U.S. inevitably gets drawn into great power wars is also weak. Both the U.K. and U.S. have historically remained neutral in non-hegemonic wars.  U.S. involvement in World Wars I and II was driven by the threat of German domination of Europe.",

Strategically, it's better for the U.S. to avoid early involvement in wars, allowing it to intervene later at a lower cost and shape the postwar world.  The historical record shows little evidence of the U.S. committing troops to Europe or Northeast Asia solely for peacekeeping before 1990.  Deployments were aimed at preventing peer competitors, not maintaining peace.  The 1990s present a potential counterargument, with U.S. troops remaining despite no immediate hegemonic threat. However, insufficient time has passed since the Soviet collapse to assess long-term trends.  The suddenness of the collapse necessitates time for the U.S. to adjust its strategy. Inertia also plays a role, given the long-term U.S. military presence in both regions since World War II.  The existing alliance structures further contribute to the continued presence of troops.",

    "text": "There is considerable evidence that the United States and its Cold War allies are \"drifting apart.\" This trend is most apparent in Europe, where NATO's 1999 war against Serbia and its aftermath have damaged transatlantic relations and prompted the European Union to begin building its own military force independent of NATO and the United States. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy are realizing they want to provide for their own security and control their own destiny. Japan, too, is showing signs of independent behavior.  Moreover, the American commitment to defend Europe and Northeast Asia shows signs of weakening. Public opinion and congressional sentiment indicate the United States is at best a \"reluctant sheriff\" on the world stage, and its military role in those areas is likely to diminish. America's Cold War allies have started to act less like dependents and more like sovereign states because they fear the offshore balancer that has protected them might be unreliable in a future crisis. The reliability of the United States was not a serious problem during the Cold War because the Soviet threat provided a powerful incentive for the United States to protect its allies. Without that threat, however, America has begun to look like a less dependable ally to states like Germany and Japan, which are capable of protecting themselves from regional threats. One source of concern among America's allies is the widespread belief that the United States will inevitably draw down its forces, raising doubts about its commitment and ability to act in a crisis. The United States is also sure to pursue policies that raise doubts about whether it is a wise and reliable ally, simply because U.S. interests are not identical to those of its allies. Over time, these differences are likely to cause America's allies to provide for their own security. The international system is a self-help world.  The brief history of the 1990s is not a good indicator of future American military involvement in Europe and Northeast Asia. That issue will be resolved in the early twenty-first century, and the determining factor will be whether there is a potential hegemon in either region that the United States must help contain. Only the threat of a peer competitor is likely to provide sufficient incentive for the United States to risk involvement in a distant great-power war. The United States is an offshore balancer, not the world's sheriff.",

Germany has the earmarks of a potential hegemon: it is the wealthiest, has the largest population (excluding Russia), and the most powerful army in the region. However, Germany is not a great power today because it lacks nuclear weapons and is heavily dependent on the United States for security. If American troops were withdrawn from Europe, Germany would likely acquire nuclear weapons and increase its army size, becoming a potential hegemon.  Historically, despite Russia's population advantage, Germany has been a potential hegemon due to its superior wealth and industrial might. Today, Germany has a significant advantage in latent military power over Russia, similar to the early twentieth century. Germany's army is superior to Russia's in size, training, and leadership. Russia only dominates in nuclear weapons, an asymmetry Germany could rectify. Although Germany is likely to become a potential hegemon if it provides for its own security, the United States is still likely to withdraw its forces. Despite Germany's military potential, other European powers should be able to contain it without American help. Their combined population and wealth are significantly larger than Germany's, and the UK, France, and Russia possess nuclear deterrents. However, Europe may not remain peaceful without the American pacifier. Intense security competition among the great powers is likely, with the possibility of conflict, because Europe would shift from benign bipolarity to unbalanced multipolarity – the most dangerous power structure.  If the United States withdraws, European powers would have to build up their militaries and provide for their own security, effectively becoming great powers and making Europe multipolar. Germany would likely become a potential hegemon and the main source of trouble. German measures to enhance its security could lead to instability. Acquiring nuclear weapons might prompt neighbors to contemplate preventative force. Without American troops, Germany would likely increase its army size and try to dominate central Europe, fearing Russian control of that buffer zone. This would lead to security competition with Russia for control of central Europe. France would view German actions with alarm and might increase defense spending and strengthen relations with Russia. Germany would likely view these actions as hostile, escalating tensions.",

Two consequential scenarios involve Russia. First, Russia, not Germany, could become Europe's next potential hegemon. This requires Russia to become wealthier than Germany, which is unlikely in the next twenty years. However, if this happens, other European powers should be able to contain Russia without American help. A wealthy Russia would not be a paper tiger, but it would not be so formidable that American troops would be needed to contain it. In the second scenario, the Russian economy collapses, removing Russia from the ranks of great powers. This is also unlikely, but if it occurs, U.S. troops would likely remain in Europe to help contain Germany. Both scenarios involve a potential hegemon in a multipolar Europe, likely resulting in dangerous security competition.  Three Northeast Asian states have the potential to be great powers: China, Japan, and Russia. None are currently a potential hegemon. Japan is the wealthiest, with a GNP 3.5 times larger than China's and more than 12 times larger than Russia's. However, Japan cannot convert its wealth into a decisive military advantage. Despite its greater wealth, it has a smaller population and lacks nuclear weapons, hindering its ability to dominate the region.",

China's population is almost ten times larger, making it nearly impossible for Japan to build a more powerful army. While Japan could potentially develop a qualitatively superior military, it would be difficult to offset China's numerical advantage. Additionally, Japan's insular nature presents a power-projection problem. Conquering Northeast Asia would require invading from the sea, a daunting task against formidable adversaries like China and Korea.  Therefore, even if Japan becomes a great power, it is unlikely to resemble its expansionist past. Russia also faces similar challenges in becoming a regional hegemon. Its population is significantly smaller than China's, limiting its ability to field a comparable army. Moreover, Russia's security concerns in Europe and its southern borders further restrict the resources it can allocate to Northeast Asia.",

Scenarios comparing China's potential GNP based on different per capita GNP levels illustrate this potential.  If China reaches South Korea's current per capita GNP, its overall GNP would be substantially larger than Japan's.  If China's per capita GNP reaches half of Japan's, its GNP would be almost five times larger.  And if China matches Japan's per capita GNP, its GNP would be ten times greater.

Japan would likely become a great power with nuclear capabilities, resulting in a balanced multipolarity but increased instability due to Japan's nuclear proliferation and historical baggage. 2) If China becomes a potential hegemon, the US would likely remain to contain it, creating an unbalanced multipolarity and a more dangerous region.  This scenario poses the greatest danger to US national security, as a wealthy China would likely pursue regional hegemony and develop a Monroe Doctrine-like policy for Asia.  China's potential power could exceed previous potential hegemons faced by the US, making it a formidable competitor.  This analysis suggests that the US should aim to slow China's economic growth, contrary to the current engagement policy.  A wealthy China is unlikely to be a status quo power, and containing its rise is in America's interest.

For example, although the Soviet Union and the United States behaved similarly toward each other during the Cold War, there is no question that the leaders of each superpower treated their citizens in fundamentally different ways. Thus, one can rather easily distinguish between good and bad states when assessing internal conduct. Such distinctions, however, tell us relatively little about international politics.\nMorgenthau, like other realists, does not distinguish between good and bad states, and he clearly recognizes that external environment shapes state behavior. However, the desire for power, which he sees as the main driving force behind state behavior, is an internal characteristic of states.\nCarr does not explain why politics always involves power, an explanation vital to any attempt to channel the exercise of power along lines compatible with an ordered social existence. Is a lust for power basic to human nature—the view of Niebuhr and Morgenthau—or is it the result of a security dilemma?\nKennan nowhere offers a systematic explanation of his approach to international politics or of his political philosophy in general: he is a diplomat turned historian, not a theologian or a political theorist, and he is concerned neither to propound a doctrine of human nature nor to set forth the recurring truths of international politics in a quasi-doctrinal way.",

    "text": "Human nature realism lost much of its appeal in the early 1970s. The backlash against the Vietnam War contributed to its demise, since any theory that saw the pursuit of military power as inevitable was likely to be unpopular. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the oil shock of 1973, and the growing power of multinational corporations (MNCs) led many to think that economic issues had become more important than security issues, and that realism had little to say about international political economy. Some argued that MNCs and other transnational forces were threatening the integrity of the state itself.  Finally, human nature realism was out of sync with the behavioral revolution in the study of international politics.\nMorgenthau is the most famous human nature realist.  Despite his claim that the desire to attain a maximum of power is universal, he distinguishes between status quo and revisionist powers.  But if all states have a limitless aspiration for power, how can there be status quo powers? Although Morgenthau emphasizes that the drive for power is located in human nature, he also recognizes that the international system creates incentives for states to pursue offense. If all states have a vital interest in taking advantage of each other, how can there be status quo powers?  Morgenthau provides no explanation for this apparent contradiction.\nWaltz's *Theory of International Politics* qualifies as a work of modern social science. Structural theories emphasize that the configuration of the international system constrains the behavior of great powers and forces them to act in similar ways. Thus, we should expect common patterns of great-power behavior in anarchic systems. However, anarchic systems can be configured differently, depending on the number of great powers and how power is distributed among them. These structural differences sometimes cause variations in state behavior.",

See Fischer, \"'Feudal Europe, 800-1300: Communal Discourse and Conflictual Practices,\" International Organization 46, No. 2 (Spring 1992), pp. 427--66. The theory can also be used to explain the behavior of individuals. The most important work in this regard is Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, ed. C. B. Macpherson (Harmondsworth, UK: Penguin, 1986). Also see Elijah Anderson, \"'The Code of the Streets,\" Atlantic Monthly, May 1994, pp. 80-94; Barry R. Posen, \"'The Security Dilemma and Ethnic Conflict,\" Survival 35, No. 1 (Spring 1993), pp. 27-47; and Robert J. Spitzer, The Politics of Gun Control (Chatham, NJ: Chatham House, 1995), chap. 6.\n\nInis L. Claude, Jr., Swords into Plowshares: The Problems and Progress of International Organization, 4th ed. (New York: Random House, 1971), p. 14. The claim that states might have benign intentions is simply a starting assumption. I argue subsequently that when you combine the theory's five assumptions, states are put in a position in which they are strongly disposed to having hostile intentions toward each other.\n\nMy theory ultimately argues that great powers behave offensively toward each other because that is the best way for them to guarantee their security in an anarchic world. The assumption here, however, is that there are many reasons besides security for why a state might behave aggressively toward another state. In fact, it is uncertainty about whether those non-security causes of war are at play, or might come into play, that pushes great powers to worry about their survival and thus act offensively. Security concerns alone cannot cause great powers to act aggressively. The possibility that at least one state might be motivated by non-security calculations is a necessary condition for offensive realism, as well as for any other structural theory of international politics that predicts security competition. Schweller puts the point well: \"'If states are assumed to seek nothing more than their own survival, why would they feel threatened? Why would they engage in balancing behavior? In a hypothetical world that has never experienced crime, the concept of security is meaningless ...\" Schweller, \"'Neorealism's Status-Quo Bias,'\" p. 91. Herbert Butterfield makes essentially the same point when he writes, \"Wars would hardly be likely to occur if all men were Christian saints, competing with one another in nothing, perhaps, save self-renunciation ...\" C.

Although Snyder and Van Evera maintain that conquest rarely pays, both concede in subtle but important ways that aggression sometimes succeeds. Snyder, for example, distinguishes between expansion (successful offense) and overexpansion (unsuccessful offense), which is the behavior that he wants to explain. See, for example, his discussion of Japanese expansion between 1868 and 1945 in Myths of Empire, pp. 114-16. Van Evera allows for variation in the offense-defense balance, to include a few periods where conquest is feasible. See Causes of War, chap. 6.

Nikita Khrushchev makes a similar point about Stalin's policy toward Chinese nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek during World War II: \"'Despite his conflict with the Chinese Communist Party, Chiang Kai-shek was fighting against Japanese imperialism.

Japan was our number one enemy in the East, so it was in the interests of the Soviet Union to support Chiang.

Specifically, without the Navigation Act, both England and Holland probably would have made greater absolute gains, because their economies would have benefited from open trade. England, however, probably would not have gained much of a relative advantage over Holland. With the Navigation Act, England gained a significant relative advantage over Holland, but both sides suffered in terms of absolute gains.

Bradley Thayer examined whether the victorious powers were able to create and maintain stable security orders in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II, or whether they competed among themselves for power, as realism would predict.

Waltz maintains that structural theories can explain international outcomes—i.e., whether war is more likely in bipolar or multipolar systems—but that they cannot explain the foreign policy behavior of particular states. A separate theory of foreign policy, he argues, is needed for that task. See Theory of International Politics, pp. 71-72, 121-23. Colin Elman challenges Waltz on this point, arguing that there is no logical reason why systemic theories cannot be used as a theory of foreign policy. The key issue, as Elman notes, is whether the particular structural theory helps us understand the foreign policy decisions that states make. I will attempt to show that offensive realism can be used to explain both the foreign policy of individual states and international outcomes.

    "text": "CHAPTER THREE\nPower can be defined in different ways, raising the question of which definition is correct. A scholar's theory, in fact, determines the appropriate definition. Whether my definition makes good sense depends on how well offensive realism explains international politics. For elaboration of these two ways of thinking about power, see Bruce Russett and Harvey Starr, World Politics: The Menu for Choice (New York: Freeman, 1989), chap. 6; and William C. Wohlforth, The Elusive Balance: Power and Perceptions during the Cold War (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1993), pp. 3-5. Furthermore, some scholars (such as Wohlforth) maintain that there is a sharp distinction between how policymakers perceive the balance of power and the actual balance itself, and that what really matters for understanding international politics is the picture of the balance that policymakers have in their heads. I disagree with this line of argument. As will become clear in subsequent chapters, policymakers usually have a good sense of the actual balance of power, although they occasionally miscalculate the power of rival states. Therefore, one need not focus on perceptions of power to explain how states behave. Robert Dahl, \"The Concept of Power,\" Behavioral Science 2, No. 3 (July 1957), pp. 202-3. Also see David A.

America's GNP in 1940 was $101 billion. One might seek to remedy the problem of comparing state power by relying on per capita GNP, since it neutralizes the effect of differences in population size between states. But it is imperative to account for population size, because it is an important ingredient of latent power. For example, relying only on per capita GNP, one would conclude that Singapore has much more latent power than China does today, because Singapore has a much higher per capita GNP than China. This conclusion obviously makes little sense.",

Advanced industrial states usually can build the logistical capacity (roads, trucks, railroads, transport ships, cargo planes) to support large military forces. Industrially backward states invariably cannot create these ingredients of military success. Modern industrial states are also likely to have better-educated populations than do semi-industrialized states, and higher education levels tend to correlate with better military performance. Finally, modern militaries are large and complex organizations that need to be managed, which is why general staffs are indispensable. Highly industrialized states tend to have considerable expertise in managing large organizations because they are populated with large economic institutions. During World War I, for example, semi-industrialized Russia was plagued with significant logistical problems, poorly educated soldiers, and an inadequate staff system. Highly industrialized Germany, on the other hand, had excellent logistics, well-educated soldiers, and the best staff system among the warring powers.",

They also equate latent power with actual power, which are not always commensurate. Although the United Kingdom was an economic colossus during this period, it did not build formidable military forces. The numbers in this paragraph are from *World Bank Atlas, 2000* and *World Bank, Knowledge for Development: World Development Report 1998/1999*. The 1980 figure is for gross domestic product (GDP), which roughly approximates GNP in these cases. On the importance of energy for measuring wealth, see Oskar Morgenstern, Klaus Knorr, and Klaus P. Heiss, *Long Term Projections of Power*. Regarding steel, see Ray S. Cline, *World Power Assessment, 1977*. It might seem unusual to switch indicators of latent power, but as Moul notes, \"to test a theory in various historical and temporal contexts requires equivalent, not identical, measures.\"  When Cline updated *World Power Assessment, 1977* in the early 1990s, steel was no longer considered a key indicator of economic might.",

About 70 percent of Germany's divisions were on the eastern front in June 1941, including almost all of the Wehrmacht's best units. That ratio remained largely unchanged until late 1943, when Germany began building up its forces in France in anticipation of the Normandy invasion, which came on June 6, 1944. One might argue that this analysis does not account for the fact that the Austro-Hungarian army fought in the east with Germany in World War I but not in World War II. It is clear from what transpired on the battlefield during World War I, however, that the feeble Austro-Hungarian army was probably more of a liability than an asset for the Germans. Furthermore, a substantial number of Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian forces were fighting with Germany on the eastern front in World War II.",

It is commonplace in the post-Cold War world to emphasize the former Soviet Union's inefficiencies, and there were many for sure. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that the Soviet Union was good at employing draconian measures to harness underutilized resources, as Stalin showed in the 1 930s, and it was good at mobilizing resources under emergency conditions, as happened between 1 94 1 and 1 945.",

Smith, The Air Force Plans for Peace, 1943-1945 (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1 970), chaps. 1-3. 38. There are two main differences between blockade and strategic bombing. First, blockades are indiscriminate in the sense that they aim to cut off all of an enemy's imports and exports. Strategic bombers, as noted earlier, can be employed more selectively: they can strike directly at specific industries and ignore others. Second, if the aim is to punish an adversary's civilian population, blockades can do that only indirectly by wrecking the enemy's economy, which would eventually hurt the civilian population. Airpower, on the other hand, can perform that task directly by targeting civilians. 39. See, for example, John A. Warden III, \"Employing Air Power in the 1\\venty-first Century,\" in Richard H.

Overy emphasizes that the air war played a key role in defeating Nazi Germany by forcing Hitler to divert precious resources away from the ground war against the Allies and especially the Red Army. See Overy, Why the Allies Won. pp. 20, 1 27-3 3. The Allies. however, also had to divert enormous resources away from the ground war to the air war. See General Marshall's Report: The Winning of the War in Europe and the Padfic, Biennial Report of the Chief of Staff of the United States Army to the Secretary of War, July L 1 943, to June 30, 1 945 (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1 945), pp. 1 0 1-7. There is no evidence that the Allies diverted fewer resources to fighting the air war than did the Germans.

The strategic bombing campaign was directed at targets in Iraq such as the city of Baghdad and is distinct from the air attacks directed against Iraqi military targets in Kuwait. The latter campaign inflicted heavy losses on Iraq's army and helped the Allied ground forces win a quick and decisive victory in late February 1 99 1 . 58.

There i s also some evidence i n the public domain that a decapitation strat­ egy was employed against Yugoslavia in 1 999. Specifically, it appears from some of the targets that NATO struck (TV stations, Milosevic's house, important government buildings, party headquarters. high-level military headquarters, and the businesses of Milosevic's close friends) that it aimed either to kill him or to precipitate a coup. There is no evidence, however, that this strategy worked. 68. See Pape, Bombing to Win, pp. 79-86. 69.

It had brought to a triumphant conclusion one of the most masterly and complex sea campaigns in history, but insofar as it was an integral part of the combined campaign its results are scarcely to be discerned. It gave to England finally the dominion of the seas, but it left Napoleon dictator of the Continent. So incomprehensible was its apparent sterility that to fill the void a legend grew up that it saved England from invasion.\" Also see Edward Ingram, \"Illusions of Victory: The Nile, Copenhagen, and Trafalgar Revisited,\" Military Affairs 48, No. 3 (July 1984), pp. l4o-43.\nI estimate that approximately 24 million Soviets died in the fight against Nazi Germany. Of that total, 16 million were civilian and 8 million were military. Of the 8 million military deaths, 3.3 million were prisoners of war who died in captivity. The remaining 4.7 million died either in combat or from combat wounds. Among the best sources on Soviet casualties are Edwin Bacon, \"'Soviet Military Losses in World War II, \" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 6, No. 4 (December 1993), pp. 613-33; Michael Ellman and S.

    "text": "The Reagan administration's \"Maritime Strategy\" contained some schemes for using the U.S. navy to influence events on the central front, but those operations were concerned mainly with shifting the strategic nuclear balance against the Soviet Union. Of course the U.S. navy was also concerned with maintaining command of the sea in wartime, so that it could transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean. See John J. Mearsheimer, \"'A Strategic Misstep: The Maritime Strategy and Deterrence in Europe, \" International Security l L No. 2 (Fall 1986), pp. 3-57; and Barry R. Posen, Inadvertent Escalation: Conventional War and Nuclear Risks (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, l99l), chaps. 4-5.\nThis point is widely accepted by prominent naval strategists. For example, Adm. Herbert Richmond, one of Britain's leading naval thinkers in the first half of the twentieth century, wrote, \"'An invasion by sea of a great modern military state may be dismissed as impracticable, even if there were no opposition at sea. The number of men which can be transported would never be sufficient to conduct an invasion in the face of the opposition of the military forces of any great power.\" Herbert Richmond, Sea Power in the Modern World (London: G. Belt 1934), p. 173.\nThe problem of projecting power across a large body of water is not simply a problem of operating over a long distance. There is a fundamental difference between moving an army over water and moving it over land. A great power separated from an adversary by a large stretch of land can conquer and occupy that land and then move its army and air force right up to the border of its rival, where it can launch a massive ground invasion. (Consider how Napoleonic France conquered the various states that separated it from Russia in the early 1800s and then invaded Russia with a huge army in 1812.) Great powers, however, cannot conquer and occupy water. The sea, as Corbett notes, \"is not susceptible to ownership . . . . [Y]ou cannot subsist your armed forces upon it as you can upon enemy's territory.\" Corbett, Principles of Maritime Strategy, p. 93. (Napoleon could not capture the English Channel and station troops on it, which explains in part why he did not invade the United Kingdom). Therefore, navies have to move armies across the sea to strike an adversary. But navies usually cannot project large and powerful armies into enemy territory, and therefore the striking power of seaborne invasion forces is sharply limited.",

Raids, on the other hand, were commonplace in great-power wars during the age of sail. For example, Great Britain launched four raids against French port cities in 1778, during the Seven Years' War. See Potter and Nimitz, Sea Power. p. 53. Although Britain had a penchant for raids, they were often unsuccessful. Looking at Lisbon (1589), Cadiz (1595 and 1626), Brest (1696), Toulon (1707), Lorient (1746), Rochefort (1757), and Walcheren (1809), Michael Howard sees \"an almost unbroken record of expensive and humiliating failures.\" Howard.

In the final year of World War I, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and the United States inserted troops into the newly established Soviet Union at Archangel (August 2, 1918), Baku (August 4, 1918), Murmansk (March 6 and June 23, 1918), and Vladivostok (April 5 and August 3, 1918). Those troops eventually fought some battles against the Bolsheviks. This case is not relevant, however, because the Allies' entrance into the Soviet Union was not an invasion in any meaningful sense of that term. The Soviet Union had just been decisively defeated by Germany and was in the midst of a civil war. Consequently, the Bolshevik army did not oppose the coming of Allied forces. In fact, the Allies were welcomed into Baku and Archangel. See John Swettenham, Allied Intervention in Russia, 1918-1919 (Toronto: Ryerson, 1967); and Richard H.

    "text": "135. During the Cold War, some experts argued that it is possible to achieve nuclear superiority even in a MAD world. Specifically, they claimed that it was possible for the superpowers to fight a limited nuclear war with their counterforce weapons (nuclear weapons designed to destroy other nuclear weapons, rather than cities), while leaving each other's assured destruction capability intact. Each superpower would also try to minimize civilian deaths on the other side. The superpower that emerged from this limited nuclear exchange with an advantage in counterforce weapons would be the winner, having gained significant coercive leverage over the loser. See Colin S. Gray, \"'Nuclear Strategy: A Case for a Theory of Victory,'\" International Security 4, No. 1 (Summer 1979), pp. 54-87; and Paul Nitze, \"'Deterring Our Deterrent,'\" Foreign Policy, No. 25 (Winter 1976-77), pp. 195-210. The case for limited nuclear options, however, is flawed for two reasons. First, it is not likely that such a war would remain limited. The destruction to each side's society would be enormous, making it difficult to distinguish a limited counterforce strike from an all-out attack. Furthermore, we do not know much about escalation dynamics in a nuclear war, especially regarding how command-and-control systems would perform in a nuclear attack. Second, even if it were possible to fight a limited nuclear war and minimize casualties, the side with a counterforce advantage would not win a meaningful victory, as the following example illustrates. Assume that the Soviets won a counterforce exchange between the superpowers: they were left with 500 counterforce warheads, the United States had none. In the process, both sides suffered 500,000 casualties, and their assured destruction capabilities remained intact. The Soviets are purportedly the victors because they have a counterforce advantage of 500:0. In fact, that advantage is meaningless, because there are no targets left in the United States that the Soviets can use their 500 counterforce weapons against, unless they want to strike at America's cities or its assured destruction capability and get annihilated in the process. In short, the result of this limited nuclear war is that both sides suffer equal casualties, both sides have their assured destruction capabilities intact, and the Soviet Union has 500 counterforce weapons that it cannot use in any meaningful military way. That is a hollow victory. Among the best works criticizing limited nuclear options are Glaser, Analyzing Strategic Nuclear Policy, chap. 7; and Robert Jervis, \"Why Nuclear Superiority Doesn't Matter,\" Political Science Quarterly 94, No. 4 (Winter 1979-80), pp. 617-33.",

The best book on the general phenomenon of escalation is Richard Smoke, War: Controlling Escalation (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1977), although it says little about escalation from the conventional to the nuclear level, or about escalation in a nuclear war. 139. Robert Jervis is probably the most articulate proponent of this perspective. He writes, \"The implications of mutual second-strike capability are many and far-reaching. If nuclear weapons have had the influence that the nuclear-revolution theory indicates they should have, then there will be peace between the superpowers, crises will be rare, neither side will be eager to press bargaining advantages to the limit, the status quo will be relatively easy to maintain, and political outcomes will not be closely related to either the nuclear or the conventional balance. Although the evidence is ambiguous, it generally confirms these propositions ...\" Jervis, Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution, p. 45.

Also assume that Mexico becomes interested in conquering a large expanse of territory in the southwestern United States, but otherwise has no interest in conquering American territory. Mexican policymakers might conclude that they could achieve their limited aims without causing the United States to start a nuclear war. In the event, they probably would prove correct. American policymakers, however, would be much more likely to use nuclear weapons if Mexico tried to inflict a decisive defeat on the United States. Shai Feldman makes essentially the same point regarding the decision by Egypt and Syria to attack a nuclear-armed Israel in 1973. Arab policymakers, he argues, thought that Israel would not use its nuclear weapons because the Arab armies were not bent on conquering Israel but were merely aiming to recapture territory lost to Israel in the 1967 war.

The best way to avoid this predicament is to have powerful conventional forces that can deter the initial attack; this once again highlights the importance of the balance of land power.\nFor example, the United States spent roughly five times more money on conventional forces than on nuclear forces during the early 1980s, and about four times as much by the mid-1980s. See Harold Brown, Department of Defense Annual Report for Fiscal Year 1982 (Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Defense, January 19, 1981), pp. C-4, C-5; and William W. Kaufmann, A Reasonable Defense (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1986), pp. 21, 27. Over the course of the entire Cold War, roughly 25 percent of American defense spending went to the nuclear forces. See Steven M. Kosiak, The Lifecycle Costs of Nuclear Forces: A Preliminary Assessment (Washington, DC: Defense Budget Project, October 1994), p. ii. Another study estimates that about 29 percent of defense spending from 1940 to 1996 went toward nuclear weapons. See Stephen I. Schwartz, ed., Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons since 1940 (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1998), p. 3. For evidence of the relative importance of U.S. conventional forces in Europe, consider how the fiscal year 1986 U.S. defense budget, which totaled $313.7 billion, was apportioned: roughly $133 billion went to conventional defense of Europe, $54.7 billion went to nuclear forces, $34.6 billion went to conventional defense in the Pacific, $20.9 billion went to conventional defense of the Persian Gulf, and $16.2 billion went to conventional defense of Panama and the U.S. homeland. These figures are from Kaufmann, Reasonable Defense, p. 14. Also see the works cited in Chapter 6, note 177, of this book.",

Stephen G. Brooks, 'The Globalization of Production and the Changing Benefits of Conquest,' Journal of Conflict Resolution 43, No. 5 (October 1999), pp. 646-70. Brooks argues, however, that conquest is not likely to pay significant dividends because of 'changes in the globalization of production' (p. 653).

Eric Labs examined the war aims of Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War (1866), of Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), of the United Kingdom during World War I (1914-18), and of the United States in the Korean War (1950-53). He sought to determine whether security concerns drove those states to jump at wartime opportunities to gain relative power, as offensive realism would predict, or whether they were content to maintain the status quo. In other words, do war aims tend to remain fixed over the course of a conflict, or are they more likely to expand? He found that all four cases \"provide strong support\" for offensive realism. \"Statesmen expanded their war aims…[and] pushed the international system for all its worth,\" he argued, because they believed that maximizing their relative power was the best way \"to secure their interests…in a postwar world.\" Eric J.

Also, Japan was not a great power until 1895. However, I consider its behavior between the Meiji Restoration (in 1868) and 1895 because it has direct bearing on events after 1895. For reasons of space, I do not examine the actions of the complete universe of great powers between 1792 and 1990. Specifically, I omit Austria/Austria-Hungary (1792-1918), France (1792-1940), Prussia (1792-1862), and Russia (1792-1917). However, I am confident that a survey of the foreign policy behavior of these states would not contradict—indeed, would support—the main tenets of offensive realism.\n3.

Sensing an opportunity, Poland aimed to dismantle the Soviet Union and establish a powerful Polish-led federation encompassing Lithuania, Belorussia, and Ukraine. Poles envisioned restoring the vast, historical Kingdom of Poland.\n\nGermany and the Soviet Union signed the secret Rapallo Treaty on April 16, 1922, a cooperative arrangement enabling Germany to secretly rebuild its military, violating the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nNumerous sources detail Nazi aggression, German military growth in the 1930s, and the influence of Machtpolitik in Weimar Germany.\n\nHistorical analyses examine the formation of the Soviet Union, Russian foreign policy from 1600-1917, and the geopolitical dynamics of expansion and containment.\n\nScholarly debate surrounds Lenin's foreign policy, with some arguing he didn't desire a world revolution to avoid other communist parties potentially overshadowing the Bolsheviks. Stalin's approach is often viewed through a realist lens, particularly regarding his foreign policy advisors and the period of Nazi-Soviet cooperation (1939-1941).\n\nConflicting interpretations exist regarding the role of ideology in Soviet foreign policy, with some emphasizing realism while others highlight ideological factors. Studies explore Soviet foreign policy during and after the Bolshevik Revolution, including the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the Soviet-Polish War of 1920.\n\nFurther research investigates Soviet relations with Europe in the 1920s, the Russo-German military collaboration during the Weimar Republic, and the influence of realpolitik in shaping Soviet thinking after World War II.",

As discussed in Chapter 8, the balancing coalition that defeated Napoleon came together in 1813, after the French army that had invaded Russia in 1812 had been routed and destroyed. The balancing coalition that ultimately defeated Hitler came together in December 1941, at roughly the same time that the Red Army was stopping the German blitzkrieg outside of Moscow. At that point, a good number of Wehrmacht commanders thought that the war against the Soviet Union was already lost.\n114. J. A. Nichols, Germany after Bismarck: The Caprivi Era, 1890-1894 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1958); Sidney B. Fay, The Origins of the World War, 2d ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1943), pp. 122-24; Geiss, German Foreign Policy, chap. 7; and Rich, Holstein, vols. 1-2, chaps. 23-35.\n115. Charles Kupchan, who accuses Wilhelmine Germany of causing its own encirclement, allows that Germany did not start behaving aggressively until 1897. Kupchan, Vulnerability of Empire, p. 360. However, there is a problem with this argument: Germany was encircled by France and Russia well before 1897. Thus, according to Kupchan’s own timeline, the formation of the first and most important leg of the Triple Entente cannot be explained by aggressive German behavior. The same problem is found in Snyder, Myths of Empire, pp. 68, 72.\n116. Medlicott, Bismarck, p. 172. Also see ibid., pp. 164-66, 171-73; Fuller, Bismarck’s Diplomacy, passim; Geiss, German Foreign Policy, chaps. 6-7; Kennan, Decline, chaps. 18-22; and Taylor, Struggle, pp. 317-19.\n117. Geiss, German Foreign Policy, p. 52. Waller makes the same argument in Bismarck, p. 118.\n118. This point is the central theme in Paul M. Kennedy, The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860-1914 (London: Allen and Unwin, 1980), esp. chaps. 16, 20. Also see Calleo, German Problem Reconsidered; and Chapter 8 of this book.\n119. Hillgruber, Germany, p. 13, is excellent on this point. Even if there had been no Moroccan crisis, Russia’s defeat by itself would probably have caused the formation of the Triple Entente. However, that crisis alone would not have been enough to prompt the United Kingdom to join forces with France and Russia.\n120. Herrmann, Arming of Europe, chap. 2.\n121. Not only did the United Kingdom fail to give “a clear and timely commitment in support of her allies,” but there was also a marked improvement in Anglo-German relations between 1911 and 1914. See Levy, “Preferences,” p. 168; Sean M. Lynn-Jones, “Detente and Deterrence: Anglo-German Relations, 1911-1914,” International Security 11, No. 2 (Fall 1986), pp. 121-50; Scott D. Sagan, “1914 Revisited: Allies, Offense, and Instability,” International Security 11, No. 2 (Fall 1986), pp. 169-71; and the sources cited in Chapter 8, note 79, of this book. Furthermore, Anglo-Russian relations soured somewhat after 1911, raising doubts about the viability of the Triple Entente. See Keith Neilson, Britain and the Last Tsar: British Policy and Russia, 1894-1917 (Oxford: Clarendon, 1995), chaps. 10-11.\n122. For example, Cyril Falls writes, “The Germans had come within an inch of bringing off a set plan of great length and ending it with the annihilation of their foes.” Falls, The Great War (New York: Capricorn, 1959), p. 70. Also see Trevor N. Dupuy, A Genius for War: The German Army and General Staff, 1807-1945 (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1977), pp. 145-47; Herbert Rosinski, The German Army (New York: Praeger, 1966), pp. 134-37; and Sagan, “1914,” pp. 159-61.\n123.

Desch, When the Third World Matters: Latin America and United States Grand Strategy (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), pp. 39-40; and Taylor, Struggle, pp. xx, 566-67. Also see the discussion in Chapter 7, note 60, of this book.\n125. Taylor, Mastery, p. 427. Regarding the balance of power in 1905, see Herrmann, Arming of Europe, pp. 40-47.\n126. There was some sentiment among the German generals in 1905 for launching a preventive war, but apparently Field Marshal Alfred van Schlieffen (the chief of the General Staff) was not among the advocates. Regardless, the kaiser refused to consider the idea. See Geiss, “Origins of the First World War,” in Geiss, ed., July 1914, pp. 39-40; Martin Kitchen, A Military History of Germany: From the Eighteenth Century to the Present Day (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1975), pp. 174-75; and Gerhard Ritter, The Schlieffen Plan: Critique of a Myth, trans. Andrew and Eva Wilson (London: Oswald Wolff, 1958), pp. 103-28.\n127. Hitler emphasized in mid-February 1945, “I had always maintained that we ought at all costs to avoid waging war on two fronts.” Francois Genoud, ed., The Last Testament of Adolf Hitler: The Hitler-Bormann Documents, February-April 1945, trans. R. H. Stevens (London: Cassell, 1961), p. 63. His views on this subject were hardly unusual in post-World War I Germany. See Post, Civil-Military Fabric, p. 151.\n128. Hitler told his generals on March 30, 1941, “Now the possibility exists to strike Russia with our rear safe; that chance will not soon come again.” Quoted in Joachim C. Fest, Hitler, trans. Richard and Clara Winston (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1974), p. 646.\n129. Rich, Hitler’s War Aims, p. xii.

Nevertheless, there was good reason for Japan to think that the United States would demand that Manchuria also be abandoned.

Desmond Ball, a leading expert on the history of American nuclear plan­ ning, succinctly summarizes American nuclear policy between l 96 l and l 990: \"Since the early 1 960s, the overriding objective of U.S. strategic nuclear policy has been the development of a strategic posture designed to enable the United States to control any nuclear exchange in order to limit damage at the lowest possible levels while ensuring that the outcomes are favorable to the United States.\" Desmond Ball, \"Soviet Strategic Planning and the Control of Nuclear War,\" in Roman Kolkowicz and Ellen P. Mickiewicz, eds., The Soviet Calculus of Nuclear War (Lexington, MA: D. C. Heath, 1 986), p. 49.

Rowen, \"Formulating Strategic Doctrine,\" p. 233. Given that the Soviet Union rejected the notion of fight­ ing limited nuclear wars and instead favored massive nuclear strikes against the United States (see the next section of this chapter), this residual interest in massive retaliation is not surprising.",

During the late 1 960s and throughout much of the 1 970s, it was fash­ ionable on both the right and the left to argue that the United States had abandoned counterforce targeting and adopted a straightforward MAD strategy in its place. Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo. ) , for example, wrote in 1 979 that \"over the past fifteen years, at least four American Presidents, and their leading defense advisers, have built weapons and cast strategic plans well nigh exclusively for the purpose of inflicting damage upon the enemy's society ...

    "text": "The United States pursued a policy of expansionism driven by a belief in its own supremacy. This ambition, though not always explicitly articulated as \"Manifest Destiny\" before 1845, was ingrained in American and European thinking as early as the mid-18th century. This sense of destiny envisioned the American settlements encompassing a vast portion of the North American continent. This expansionist drive manifested in westward expansion, including the acquisition of territories like Texas, Oregon, and lands seized during the Mexican-American War. Racial factors played a significant role in this expansion, with notions of Anglo-Saxon racial superiority influencing attitudes towards Native Americans and other populations.  American policymakers aimed to secure the American Mediterranean, encompassing the Gulf and Caribbean regions, and even considered acquiring Mexico. The failure to conquer and annex Canada and Mexico entirely was not due to a lack of capability but stemmed from the practical difficulties and costs associated with subduing and assimilating their populations. Maintaining amicable relations with these neighbors proved a more sensible approach, particularly in preventing potential alliances with rival great powers.  The fear of disunion significantly shaped American policy until the Civil War, motivating expansion as a means to solidify national unity and prevent fragmentation into warring factions susceptible to manipulation by European powers. Westward expansion unfolded through territorial acquisitions and displacement of Native American populations. The U.S. army played a crucial role in this process, engaging in conflicts with Native American tribes to secure control over western lands.",

    "section": "The Monroe Doctrine and Hemispheric Influence",
    "text": "The growing power of the United States, coupled with declining British influence in the Western Hemisphere, led to a shift in the balance of power in North America. Great Britain recognized its diminished ability to challenge the United States on the continent, particularly after the American Civil War.  This shift paved the way for the assertion of American dominance in the hemisphere, notably through the Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine, articulated in 1823, declared the Americas closed to further European colonization and proclaimed non-intervention by European powers in the affairs of independent nations in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine, initially aimed at preventing the re-establishment of European colonial empires, evolved into a cornerstone of American foreign policy, serving as a justification for intervention and influence in Latin America.  The United States viewed the Monroe Doctrine as a means to protect its interests and maintain stability in the region, while simultaneously expanding its own influence.  This policy reflected a broader American ambition to shape the political and economic landscape of the Western Hemisphere, establishing a sphere of influence that limited European involvement and promoted American primacy.  The Louisiana Purchase, justified by Thomas Jefferson and others as a strategic move to secure American interests and expand westward, exemplified the underlying expansionist impulse driving American foreign policy.",

Had the United States not entered the war, Germany might have defeated the British and French armies in the spring of 1918. See the sources cited in Chapter 6, note 124, of this book. This is not to say that the United States played the key role in defeating Germany in 1918. In fact, the British army spearheaded the Allied victory in the final year of the war. See the sources cited in note 95 of this chapter. The arrival of the U.S. army on the western front, however, markedly shifted the balance of forces against the German army at a critical juncture in the war. It is also possible that the United Kingdom might have succumbed to the German submarine campaign if the United States had not entered the war on the Allies' side. Another dimension to the American decision to join the war against Germany also bears mentioning. As emphasized in Chapter 5, the principal reason that the United States sought to prevent a European hegemon is fear that such a power would be free to intervene in the Western Hemisphere. In early 1917, Germany proposed that Mexico (and possibly Japan) form an alliance against the United States. In a secret telegram that fell into American hands, the German foreign minister called for Germany and Mexico to make war together against the United States for the purpose of helping Mexico reconquer Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Germany's main aim, of course, was to get the United States bogged down in a war on its own territory, so that it could not fight against Germany in Europe. This episode played a key role in bringing the United States into the war against Germany. See Desch, Third World Matters, chap. 2; and Barbara W.

The Roosevelt administration was clearly trying to get the United States into a fight with Germany by the fall of 1941. Its main concern was finding a pretext to enter the war. Fortunately, Hitler provided a neat solution to that problem.",

There is a difference between British and American motives for maintaining a balance of power on the European continent. The United States, as emphasized, worries little about a direct military threat from a European hegemon, but instead is concerned about the possibility of a European (or Asian) great power forming an alliance with a state in the Western Hemisphere. The United Kingdom does not have to worry about that problem, because it is the only state on the island it occupies. Instead. it worries that a European hegemon would pose a direct military threat to its survival, either by sending an invasion force across the English Channel or by defeating the British navy and severing British trade with the outside world, thus wrecking its economy.",

The Soviet Union was a potential hegemon from 1 945 until 1 990, which is the entire time frame for that case. Also, I will sometimes refer to Revolutionary and Napoleonic France ( 1 789-1 8 1 5) as simply Napoleonic France, although Napoleon did not take control of France until November 1 0, 1 799.

The French military, however, concluded that Germany could mobilize a fighting force of only 1.33 million soldiers. Hermann, Arming of Europe, p. 45.

For examples, see Jonathan Haslam, \"Soviet-German Relations and the Origins of the Second World War: The Jury Is Still Out,\" Journal of Modern History 69, No. 4 (December 1997), pp. 785-97; Robens. The Soviet Union; and Uldricks. \"'Soviet Security Policy.\" 114. Ulam, Expansion and Coexistence. p. 238. 115. Most of the literature dealing with Stalin's German policy operates from the assumption that buck-passing is a misguided strategy. Hochman, for example, portrays Stalin as an immoral opportunist pursuing a strategy that was guaranteed to fail. See Hochman, Soviet Union and the Failure. Haslam, on the other hand, believes that Stalin sought the correct strategy (collective security), but was forced to accept a bankrupt alternative (buck-passing) because the Western allies themselves were foolishly passing the buck. See Haslam, Soviet Union and the Search. Note for Chapter Eight '11 116.

Carley, 1939: The Alliance That Never Was and the Coming of World War II (Chicago: Ivan R. Dee, 1999).

Not surprisingly, the Soviets fully grasped soon after World War II ended that the United States was determined to pursue an aggressive containment policy against them. See Vladislav Zubok and Constantine Pleshakov. Inside the Kremlin's Cold War: From Stalin to Khrushchev (Cambridge. MA: Harvard University Press, 1996). 132. The fact that the United States implemented a hard-nosed balancing policy against the Soviet Union so soon after World War II ended helps \"Cold War revisionists'\" make their case that the United States, not the Soviet Union, was responsible for starting the Cold War. For an excellent example of this phenomenon, see Carolyn W. Eisenberg, Drawing the Line: The American Decision to Divide Germany. 1944-1949 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). For an offensive realist, neither side can be blamed for starting the Cold War; it was the international system itself that caused the intense security competition between the superpowers. 133.

Trachtenberg argues convincingly in Constructed Peace that the main cause of friction between the superpowers from 514 THE TRAGEDY OF GREAT POWER POLITICS 1945 until 1963 was their conflict over Germany. The decisions to create and then arm West Germany, possibly with nuclear weapons, infuriated Soviet leaders and led them to precipitate crises over Berlin in the hope that they could reverse U.S. policy. There is much support for this line of argument in Zubok and Pleshakov, Inside the Kremlin's Cold War: 139. American policymakers considered",

Thus, the United States is guilty of inefficient balancing against the Soviet threat.

Rosecrance, \"Bipolarity, Multipolarity, and the Future,\" Journal of Conflict Resolution I 0, No. 3 (September 1 966), pp. 3 1 4-27. 8. Although a balance of power is more likely to produce deterrence than is an imbalance of power, balanced power does not guarantee that deterrence will work. As discussed in Chapter 3, states sometimes design innovative military strate­ gies that allow them to win wars, even though they have no advantage in the size and quality of their fighting forces. Furthermore, the broader political forces that move states toward war sometimes force leaders to pursue highly risky military strategies, impelling states to challenge opponents of equal or even superior strength. See John J. Mearsheimer, Conventional Deterrence (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1 983). esp. chap. 2. 9. A second argument is sometimes made to support the claim that power dis­ parities are more common in multipolarity than in bipolarity. States in multipolar­ ity facing a more powerful adversary are likely to pursue buck-passing, which usually means that they are content to live with an imbalance of power, because they believe that another state will deal with the threat. But even when states bal­ ance in multipolarity, they are often tempted to seek security through alliances rather than by building up their own strength. External balancing of this sort is attractive because it is cheaper than the alternative. Nevertheless. it leaves the orig­ inal power imbalance largely intact and hence leaves in place the dangers that such a power gap creates. The number two state in a bipolar system, on the other hand, can hope to balance against the leader only by mobilizing its own resources. since it has no great-power alliance partners or buck-catchers. Internal balancing of this son is likely to produce a rough balance of power between the opposing",

Mearsheimer, ·sack to the Future: Instability in Europe after the Cold War.\" International Security 15, No. 1 (Summer 1990), pp. 13-19. But there are two problems with this line of argument. As Dale Copeland notes, it contradicts my claim that states maximize their share of world power. If states are power maximizers, they are not going to tolerate imbalances of power that they have the capability to rectify. See Dale C. Copeland, \"The Myth of Bipolar Stability: Toward a New Dynamic Realist Theory of Major War,\" Security Studies 5, No. 3 (Spring 1996), pp. 38-47. Furthermore, while there is no question that buck-passing is a popular option among threatened states in multipolarity (see Chapter 8), buck-passing is most likely to succeed if the threatened state also builds formidable military forces and erases any power gap that might exist between it and the aggressor (see Chapter 5).\n10. There is one exception to this general point: if there were only three great powers in a multipolar system, two of them could gang up on the third, and there would be no allies available for the victim state.\n11. Balancing coalitions are most likely to form when there is a potential hegemon that can be contained only by the joint efforts of all the threatened great powers. But as discussed in the next section, war is highly likely when there is a potential hegemon in a multipolar system.\n12. This point is the central theme of Waltz, \"Stability of a Bipolar World.\" Also see Geoffrey Blainey, The Causes of War (New York: Free Press, 1973), chap. 3.\n13. The claim that multipolarity is more stable than bipolarity is often based on the belief that as the number of states in a system increases, the amount of attention that states can focus on each other diminishes, because other states demand attention as well. See, for example, Deutsch and Singer, \"Multipolar Power Systems,\" pp. 396-400. This claim, however, assumes rough equality in the size and strength of the relevant actors. But in multipolar systems with a potential hegemon, the other great powers are surely going to pay an inordinate amount of attention to that especially powerful state, largely vitiating the claim that multipolarity means \"limited attention capability.\"\n14. To review my criteria for selecting great powers, see Chapter 1, note 7.\n15. See Chapter 6.\n16. Jack S. Levy, War in the Modern Great Power System, 1495-1975 (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1983), chap. 3.\n17. The other great-power wars that are excluded because they involve a non-European state include the Anglo-Persian War (1856-57), the Franco-Mexican War (1862-67), the Sino-French War (1883-85), the Sino-Soviet War (1929), the Italo-Ethiopian War (1935-36), the Soviet-Japanese War (1939), and the Sinai War (1956).",

    "text": "61. On what defines a great power, see Chapter 1. 62. China and Russia have been on friendly terms in recent years, and both have made clear their displeasure with different aspects of American foreign policy. But they have not formed a serious balancing coalition against the United States, and few believe that they will do so in the future. See Jennifer Anderson, The Limits of Sino-Russian Strategic Partnership, Adelphi Paper No. 315 (London: International Institute for Strategic Studies, December 1997); Mark Burles, Chinese Policy toward Russia and the Central Asian Republics (Santa Monica, CA: RAND Corporation, 1999); and “Can a Bear Love a Dragon?” Economist, April 26, 1997, pp. 19–21. Also, there is a potential source of serious trouble between China and Russia: large-scale illegal immigration from China into Russia for the past decade, which could lead to ethnic conflict or territorial disputes. See David Hale, “Is Asia’s High Growth Era Over?” National Interest, No. 47 (Spring 1997), p. 56; and Simon Winchester, “On the Edge of Empires: Black Dragon River,” National Geographic, February 2000, pp. 7–33. 63. Many argue that it is difficult to imagine security competition, much less war, between France and Germany. The current happy situation, however, did not come about because those longtime rivals, who fought wars against each other in 1870–71, 1914–18, and 1940, suddenly learned to like and trust each other in 1945. The presence of a large American army in Western Europe since World War II has made it almost impossible for France and Germany to fight with each other and thus has eliminated the main cause of fear between them. In essence, hierarchy replaces anarchy in areas directly controlled by U.S. forces. Josef Joffe puts the point well: “Only the permanent intrusion of the United States into the affairs of the Continent changed the terms of state interaction to the point where West Europeans no longer had to conduct their business in the brooding shadow of violence. By promising to protect Western Europe against others and against itself, the United States swept aside the rules of the self-help game that had governed and regularly brought grief to Europe in centuries past.” Joffe, “Europe’s American Pacifier,” p. 72. 64. “Excerpts from Pentagon’s Plan: ‘Prevent the Re-Emergence of a New Rival,’” New York Times, March 8, 1992. Also see Patrick E. Tyler, “U.S. Strategy Plan Calls for Insuring No Rivals Develop,” New York Times, March 8, 1992. 65. See Eugene Gholz, Daryl G. Press, and Harvey M. Sapolsky, “Come Home, America: The Strategy of Restraint in the Face of Temptation,” International Security 21, No. 4 (Spring 1997), pp. 5–48; and Christopher Layne, “From Preponderance to Offshore Balancing: America’s Future Grand Strategy,” International Security 22, No. 1 (Summer 1997), pp. 86–124. 66. The Clinton administration certainly bought this view. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, for example, told the U.S. Senate that “European stability depends in large measure on continued American engagement and leadership. And as history attests, European stability is also vital to our national interests. As a result we will remain engaged.” Madeleine Albright, prepared statement before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, January 8, 1997. 67. Eugene Gholz and Daryl G. Press, “Economic Externalities of Foreign Wars,” manuscript accepted for publication in Security Studies. 68. David M. Kennedy, Over Here: The First World War and American Society (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), chap. 6. Japan’s economy also benefited significantly from sitting out the fighting in World War I. 69. Gholz and Press, “Economic Externalities…” This analysis assumes that a great-power war in Europe or Northeast Asia would be protracted and involve virtually all of the regional powers—i.e., a central war like World War I. However, a future great-power war, like many of those in the past, might be short or might involve only two major states. A more limited conflict of this sort would surely have less effect (positive or negative) on the U.S. economy than would a central war. 70.

The negative consequences for NATO of the Kosovo war are captured in the following comment from Der Spiegel: “After ten weeks of war in Yugoslavia, one thing has become clear across Europe: the hegemony of the U.S. and NATO is limited as a model for the future.” Quoted in Jeffrey Gedmin, “Continental Drift: A Europe United in Spirit against the United States,” New Republic, June 28, 1999, p. 23. 75. For example, Japan, which has the second largest defense budget in the world, is developing its own spy satellites, against American wishes. Moreover, each house of Japan’s Diet has established a commission to review its pacifist constitution, a move widely seen as a victory for Japan’s nationalists. An important defense official, Shingo Nishimura, was forced to resign in October 1999, because he suggested that Japan develop its own nuclear deterrent. See “Japan’s Naval Power: Responding to New Challenges,” International Institute for Strategic Studies’ Strategic Comments 6, No. 8 (October 2000); “Japan Reviews Pacifism,” London Times, January 21, 2000; Clay Chandler, “Japanese Official Forced to Quit after Endorsing Nuclear Arms,” Washington Post, October 21, 1999; Howard French, “Japan Signals Peaceful Intentions, but Reaffirms Armament Plans,” New York Times, April 28, 2001; and “Satellite Program Endorsed as a Response to N.

See Ted Galen Carpenter, “Roiling Asia: U.S. Coziness with China Upsets the Neighbors,” Foreign Affairs 77, No. 6 (November–December 1998), pp. 2–6. The United States raised suspicions about its reliability earlier in 1996 when it said that its security guarantee to Japan did not apply to any crisis arising over the Senkaku/Diaoyutai Islands, which both China and Japan claim. See Yoichi Funabashi, Alliance Adrift (New York: Council on Foreign Relations Press, 1999), pp. 401–15. 79. It is apparent from this discussion that even if I am wrong and the United States assumes the role of peacekeeper in Europe and Northeast Asia, there is still likely to be fundamental change in the power structures in those regions. In particular, America’s allies, especially Germany and Japan, are not likely to remain wards of the United States, but instead are likely to establish themselves as great powers. 80.

    "text": "International relations theory grapples with the enduring nature of great power competition.  Realist thought emphasizes the anarchic nature of the international system, where states, particularly great powers, constantly vie for power and security in the absence of a higher authority.  This competition is not merely a product of individual leaders or domestic factors, but a structural feature of the international system.  The distribution of power, the security dilemma, and the pursuit of national interests drive states to compete, even if they don't desire conflict.  The text highlights five key assumptions of realism:  (1) the international system is anarchic; (2) states are the key actors; (3) states are rational actors; (4) states' primary goal is survival; and (5) states possess offensive military capabilities.  These assumptions shape how realists view international politics and predict the behavior of great powers.",

    "text": "The text delves into the concept of power, distinguishing between latent power and military strength. Latent power refers to the underlying economic and demographic potential of a state, particularly its industrial capacity and population size. This potential can be translated into military strength, but it's not always a direct correlation.  Factors like efficient military application of industrial output, technological innovation, and the ability to mobilize resources play a crucial role.  The text emphasizes the historical significance of industrial development in shaping military power, citing examples such as railroads and information technology.  The discussion also touches upon the importance of wealth and resources, highlighting how conquest can be a source of both, while also emphasizing the limitations imposed by resource dependence.  The difference between wealth and latent power is also discussed, noting that large populations don't necessarily equate to great power status without the necessary industrial capacity.",

    "text": "The text analyzes land power, asserting its historical primacy in military affairs.  While acknowledging the importance of air and naval support for land operations, it underscores the limitations of projecting land power across water.  Geographical constraints, logistical challenges, and the inherent difficulty of amphibious assaults restrict the reach of land-based forces.  The discussion includes examples of how water barriers have shaped military history and influenced strategic choices.  The text also explores the role of conquered populations in bolstering land power, while also noting the challenges associated with controlling and integrating these populations.  The impact of nuclear weapons on the traditional dominance of land power is also considered, raising questions about the future of conventional military forces in a nuclear age.",

It examines the cases of Italy, Japan, and Germany, highlighting their respective ambitions for power and influence.  Italy's pursuit of expansion in Africa, Japan's expansionist goals in Asia, and Germany's ambitions for European dominance are analyzed in the context of the prevailing international system.  The text discusses the factors that contributed to their rise and fall, including their economic and military capabilities, their strategic choices, and the reactions of other great powers.  The examples demonstrate the recurring patterns of great power competition, the importance of balancing power, and the consequences of miscalculation.",
