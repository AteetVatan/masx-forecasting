    "text": "The Geographical Pivot of History\nBy H. J. Mackinder\nThe Geographical Journal, Vol. 23, No. 4 (Apr, 1904), 421-437.\n\nWhen historians in the remote future look back on the past few centuries, they may well describe the last 400 years as the Columbian epoch, ending soon after 1900.  Geographical exploration is nearly over, and geography must now turn to intensive survey and philosophical synthesis. In 400 years, the world map has been completed, and even the polar regions offer little scope for dramatic discoveries.  The 20th century marks the end of a great historical epoch not just because of this mapping achievement, but because the world has been almost completely politically appropriated.  Missionaries, conquerors, farmers, miners, and engineers have followed explorers so closely that few regions remain unclaimed.  The Columbian epoch contrasts with preceding ages in that European expansion met negligible resistance, whereas medieval Christendom was confined and threatened by external barbarism. From now on, in the post-Columbian age, we will deal with a closed global political system.  Social forces, instead of dissipating into unknown space and barbaric chaos, will reverberate globally, shattering weak political and economic elements.  This new reality is diverting statesmen's attention from territorial expansion to the struggle for relative efficiency.\n\nFor the first time, we can correlate larger geographical and historical generalizations, perceive the proportions of events on the world stage, and seek a formula to express geographical causation in universal history.  This formula should illuminate current international politics.  The phrase 'westward march of empire' is a rudimentary attempt.  I will describe the physical features I believe most coercive of human action, and present historical phases organically connected with them, even when unknown to geography.  My aim is not regional geography, but to exhibit human history as part of the world organism. I acknowledge this is only one aspect of the truth and avoid excessive materialism. Man initiates, but nature controls.  I focus on general physical control.  Professor Freeman argued that significant history is that of Mediterranean and European races. This is true regarding the origin of dominant ideas, but it limits thought.  National ideas arise under pressure of common tribulation and resistance to external force.  The idea of England was forged by Danish and Norman conquerors; the idea of France by Huns and the Hundred Years' War; the idea of Christendom by Roman persecutions and the Crusades; the idea of the United States by the War of Independence; the idea of the German Empire by the Franco-Prussian War.  Literary history, by focusing on ideas and civilization, overlooks the elemental pressures that excite the efforts in which ideas are nourished.  A repellent personality unites his enemies, and Europe achieved her civilization under pressure from external barbarism.  Consider Europe and its history as subordinate to Asia, for European civilization is the outcome of the secular struggle against Asiatic invasion.",

    "section": "The Contrast of Russia and Western Europe",
    "text": "The vast area of Russia contrasts sharply with the smaller territories of Western Europe.  Physically, Russia's unbroken eastern lowland contrasts with the complex mountains, islands, and peninsulas of the west.  This seems to correlate environment and political organization, especially given Russia's uniform climate of cold winters and hot summers.  However, historical maps reveal that the coincidence of European Russia with the Eastern Plain is recent.  Earlier, two groups of states usually divided Russia into northern and southern political systems.  The orographical map doesn't reflect the physical contrast that controlled human movement and settlement in Russia until recently.  Rain follows the winter snowmelt, peaking in May and June near the Black Sea, but in July and August near the Baltic and White Seas. The southern late summer is a period of drought.  Consequently, the north and northwest were forested and marshy, while the south and southeast were boundless grassy steppe with trees only along rivers.  The dividing line ran diagonally northeastward from the northern Carpathians to a point in the Urals nearer its southern end. Moscow lies just north of this line, on the forest side.  Outside Russia, the forest boundary ran westward through the center of the 800-mile-wide European isthmus between the Baltic and Black Seas.  In peninsular Europe, woods spread through northern Germany, while steppes extended through the Transylvanian basin of the Carpathians, up the Danube through modern Romania to the Iron Gates.  A detached steppe area, the Puszta, occupied the Hungarian plain, surrounded by forested Carpathian and Alpine mountains.  In western Russia, clearing forests, draining marshes, and tilling steppes have blurred this formerly significant distinction.",

    "section": "The Asiatic Invasions",
    "text": "Earlier Russia and Poland were established in forest glades.  From the 5th to 16th centuries, Turanian nomads—Huns, Avars, Bulgarians, Magyars, Khazars, Patzinaks, Cumans, Mongols, Kalmuks—entered the steppe through the gateway between the Urals and the Caspian Sea.  Attila's Huns settled in the Puszta, the Danubian steppe outlier, and attacked settled peoples north, west, and south.  Modern history can be viewed as a commentary on the changes resulting from these raids.  The Angles and Saxons may have been driven to Britain by them. Franks, Goths, and Romans were forced to unite at Chalons against the Asiatics.",

For a thousand years a geries of horce-riding peopleg emerged from Asia tbrough the broad interval between the Ural mountaing and the Caspian sea, rode through the open spaces of southern Russia, and struck home into Hungary in the very heart of the European peningula, shaping by the necessity of opposing them the history of each of the great peoples around_~the Rugsians, the Germang, the French, the Italians, and the Byzantine Greeks That stimu- lated healthy and powerful reaction, instead of orushing opposition under a widespread despotism, wa8 due to the fact that the mobility of their power wa8 Cunditioned by the steppes, and necessarily ceased in the gurrounding forests and mountains.

From its very nature neither pressure was over- whelming, and both therefore were stimulative. It is noteworthy that the formative influence of the Scandinavians was second only in nificance to that of the nomads, for under their attack both England and France made moves towards while the of Italy was broken by them. In earlier times, Rome had mobilized the power of her settled peoples by means of her roads, but the Roman roads had fallen into and were not replaced until the eighteenth century: It is likely that even the Hunnish invasion was by no means the first of the Asiatic series.",

The Celtic element in the river-names Don, Donetz, Dneiper , Dneister, and Danube may possibly betoken the passage of peoples of similar habits, though not of identical race, but it is not unlikely that the Celts came merely from the northern forests, like the Goths and Varangians of a later time.

It is obvious that, since tbe rainfall is derived from the sea, the heart of the greatest land-mass is likely to be relatively We are not, therefore, sur- prised to find that two-thirds of all the world' s population is concen- trated in relatively small areas along the marging of the great continent in Europe, beside the Atlantic ocean; in the Indies and China; beside the Indian and Pacific oceans.

It is mainly devoid of forest, is patched with desert, and is therefore suitable for the operations of the nomad. Dominantly, however, it is marginal, for sea-gulfs and oceanic rivers open it to sea-power, and permit of the exercise of such power from it. As a consequence, periodically throughout history, we have here had empires belonging essentially to the marginal series, based on the agricultural populations of the great 0a808 of Babylonia and Egypt, and in free water-communication with the civilized worlds of the Mediterranean and the Indies. But, as we should expect, these empires have been subject to an unparalleled series of revolutions, some due to Scythian, Turkish, and Mongol raids from Central Asia; others to the efforts of the Mediterranean peoples to conquer the overland ways from the western to the eastern Ocean. Here is the weakest spot in the girdle of early civilizations, for the isthmus of Suez divided sea-power into Eastern and Western; and the arid wastes of Persia advancing from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf gave constant opportunity for nomad-power to strike home to the ocean edge, dividing India and China, on the one hand, from the Mediterranean world on the other. Whenever the Babylonian, the Syrian, and the Egyptian oases were weakly held, the steppe-peoples could treat the open tablelands of Iran and Asia Minor as forward posts whence to strike through the Punjab into India, through Syria into Egypt, and over the broken bridge of the Bosporus and Dardanelles into Hungary. Vienna stood in the gateway of Inner Europe, withstanding the nomadic raids, both those which came by the direct road through the Russian steppe, and those which came by the way to south of the Black and Caspian seas. Here we have illustrated the essential difference between the Saracen and the Turkish controls of the Nearer East. The Saracens were a branch of the Semitic race, essentially peoples of the Euphrates and Nile and of the smaller oases of Lower Asia. They created a great empire by availing themselves of the two mobilities permitted by their land--that of the horse and camel on the one hand, that of the ship on the other. At different times their fleets controlled both the Mediterranean as far as Spain, and the Indian ocean to the Malay islands. From their strategically central position between the eastern and western oceans, they attempted the conquest of all the marginal lands of the Old World, imitating Alexander and anticipating Napoleon. They could even threaten the steppe land.",

    "text": "Wholly distinct from Arabia as from Europe, India, and China were the Turanian pagans from the closed heart of Asia, the Turks who destroyed the Saracen civilization. Mobility upon the ocean is the natural rival of horse and camel mobility in the heart of the continent. It was upon navigation of oceanic rivers that was based the Potamic stage of civilization, that of China on the Yangtse, that of India on the Ganges, that of Babylonia on the Euphrates, that of Egypt on the Nile. It was essentially upon the navigation of the Mediterranean that was based what has been described as the Thalassic stage of civilization, that of the Greeks and Romans. The Saracens and the Vikings held sway by navigation of the oceanic coasts. The all-important result of the discovery of the Cape road to the Indies was to connect the western and eastern coastal navigations of Euro-Asia, even though by a circuitous route, and thus in some measure to neutralize the strategic advantage of the central position of the steppe-nomads by pressing upon them in rear. The revolution commenced by the mariners of the Columbian generation endowed Christendom with the widest possible mobility of power, short of a winged mobility. The one and continuous ocean enveloping the divided and insular lands is, of course, the geographical condition of ultimate unity in the command of the sea, and of the whole theory of modern strategy and policy as expounded by such writers as Captain Mahan and Mr. Spencer Wilkinson. The broad political effect was to reverse the relations of Europe and Asia, for whereas in the Middle Ages Europe was between an impassable desert to south, an unknown ocean to west, and forested wastes to north and north-east, and in the east and south-east was constantly threatened by the superior mobility of the horsemen and camelmen, she now emerged upon the world, multiplying more than thirty-fold the sea surface and coastal lands to which she had access, and wrapping her influence round the Euro-Asiatic land-power which had hitherto threatened her very existence. New Europes were created in the vacant lands discovered in the midst of the waters, and what Britain and Scandinavia were to Europe in the earlier time, that have America and Australia, and in some measure even Trans-Saharan Africa, now become to Euro-Asia. Britain, Canada, the United States, South Africa, Australia, and Japan are now a ring of outer and insular bases for sea-power and commerce, inaccessible to the land-power of Euro-Asia.",
