The need for such a survey was pointed out by Sydney Owcn more than years ago. If the civilian student of military history suffers from some disadvantagc due to his lack of technical knowledge, he is further handicappcd when he selects the military history of the Marathas 2s the subject of his enquiry. In England a large number of useful works on the art and scicnce of war was written and published in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries but the Maratha comman- ders and strategists have left us nothing of that kind. Their nilitary theories must;therefore,remain a subject of conjecture: Luckily facts and figures, on which such conjectures can safely be based, are not wanting, though are still buriedin unpublished recordsscattered in different parts of India and Europe: All the information we need cannot be found in Marathi records, but these can be profitably supplemented by contemporary English , Portuguese, French and Dutch records; and for the last of the Meratha military orga- nisation we have the valuable accounts left by European military experts like Tone and Smith, who wrote from personal knowledge: On the naval history of the Marathas their own records do not study explore rapid collapse: Every myself = fifty they : phase PREFACB throw much light, and we have to Iely almost entirely on foreign sources It has been my endeavour to piecc together these widely scattered scraps of information in the following pages; with what success, it is for my readers to judge.

It is, therefore, possible thzt some papers bearing on the subject may hive escaped my scrutiny: The political history of the Marathas is now fairly well known, thinks to the monumental work of Grant Duff: It has been, there - fore, possible to avoid 2 detailed narrative of their campaigns, but, 2s the average reader is yet unfamiliar with their naval activities, Ihive deemed it nccessary to deal wi:h that subject in greater detail; though a fuller account of the cxploits of Kanhoji Angria and his sons hls to be postponed for & future occasion from consideration of space: It is necessary to add a few words hcre about my references to Factory Records and Bombay Public Consultations.

To avoid confusion, I have sometimes given the number of the particular part of the volume as well, but it shjuld be noted that in the original volumes the different parts hive not been separately numbered It is also necessary to out that in the following pages the word Maratha has not bcen (except when otherwise indicated) usedin the caste sense: thinks are due to Mr. Otwell, Superintendent of Records; India Ofice, for permitting me to read the Bombay Public Consultations of 1700 to I756.

In the second decade of1he next century thc Emperor of Delhi had to recognise their defacto suprcmacy in the Dcccan by granting them chauth and sardeshmukhi of six provinces of rhe South. But their activitics Were not confined to tle immcdiate neighbourhood of their homc Balaji Vishwanath entered Delhi in the train of Syed Husain Ali, his son appearcd in its environs at the head of his victorious army, his grardsons became arbitcrs of the fate of rhe Mughal empire and carried the Maratha banncrto thebanksoftheIndus, while iheir cavalryscoured the country from Lahore to Murshidabad, from Delhi to Seringa- patam. The expansion of thcir empire was once arrested by the defeat of Panipat, but the Mararhas quickly recovered from the shock; and Mahndaji Sindhia founded a ncw in Hindustan. In 1794 inflictcd a crushing defeat on the Nizam at Kharda and compelled him to cede hilf his territorics. Hardly eight years elapsed before the Peshwa became a fcudatory of the British Go- vernment in India, the armies of Daulat Rao Sindhia and Raghuji Bhonsla WCrc dcfeated and destroyed by Lake and Wellesley, and the Maratha empire collapsed like 4 house of cards If thcir rise was sudden and swift, thc fall of the Marathas was no less sudden and spectacular. The Empire was apparently at the zenith ofits power, it had reached its greatest extent,its man-power 'The later Sikh and Gurkha states never transcended the provincial limits of the Indus valley and the Himalayan respectively. They lorg rapid empire they grand region xiv INTRODUCTION was almost unlimited, yet it was destroyed by 3 foreign power with a small army after a brief campaign of fifteen weeks What led to this and complete collapse: The plea o accidents cannot be seriously considered. In History accident plays no prominent part, and seldom turns the tide of national fortuncs. It is true that Mahadaji Sindhia died whilc still in the of life, and about the samc date died 1 lesser person, Hari Pant Phadke: It is true that the early death of the first Madhav Rao, thc murder of Narayan Rao, the unfortunate suicide of the sccond Madhav Rao wcrc national calamities of nl0 mean order and certainly accelerated the pace of thc Maratha fall It is also true that after Nana Fadnavis therc was no OnC competent to unitc the divergent forccs that constituted the complcx organisation called the Maratha empire. But why did the Maratha race suddenly grow barren of great men? If the Marathas could survive Shivaji $ death, why could not survive Nana Faduavis? If able leadcrs canie forth to save the nation in 1690, why wcrc lacking in 1802? The death of Cavour did not arrest the progress of Italian why should the death of Nana Fadnavis or Mahadaji Sindhia cause the downfall of the Maratha empire? Accidents offer n0 satisfectOry explanation: Social reformcrs have attributed the misfortuncs of the Marathas to their caste dissensions Yct the Maratha empire came into undcr thc shadow of the caste system, it expanded and Hourished while that systen was in full operation. Shivaji, a Maratha, recruited his highest officers from the Brahman caste; the two greatest gene- rals employcd by the Brahmnan Peshwa in Northern India were both Marathas; Yamaji Shivdev, a Brahman, once intrigucd against the Brahman Peshwa; the pretender Sadoba found an ardent sup- porter in the Chitpavan governor of Ratnagiri, while Jaswant Rao Holkar, a Marathn (morc accurately a Dhangar), fought Daulat Rao Sindhia, another Maratha. Govind Pant Bundele, a KarhadaBrahman, complained that thcre was nonein the Brahman Peshwi's court to recommend his devoted services as he was only a Brahmnan scrvant of His Highness: The caste system has been responsible for many evils in India but for thc Ical cause of the downfall of the Marathas we must look elsewhcre: It has been suggestedthat the Marathas fell because neglected quick prime they they unity; being against they INTRODUCTION Xv tncir civil government; and lived on plunder and did not encourage trade and industry, agriculture and commerce: Defective 25 their civil institutions werc were n0 worse than similar institutions in contemporary Europe.1 Their government certainly degencrated in the closing years of the eightcenth century, but that was a fesult rather than thc causc of thc decline and fall that had already commenccd; Nor was their fall due to their policy of aggression. An imperial power in country like India must be aggressive, until its supremacy is fairly established over the whole country: In pursuance of such a policy they hud often recourse to diplomacy of & kind condemned by thcir critics Whatcver may happen in future, in the past abstract principles of morality playcd little or no part in diplomacy oriental or occidental. Neither Clive nor Cavour, nor Bismarck, nor Napoleon II[ would hesitate to hoodwink a rival o1 dupe an enemy: In the eighteenth century the standard of diplomatic morality in Europe was certainly not very high, as Albert Sorrel tells uS. In India were no better and no worse. If the Marathas coveted the lands of their ncighbours, their neighbours On their part Were not free from land hunger. cnvoy that the Bombay Govern- ment sent to Poona wasinstructcd to takc advantagc of the disunion and dissension that existed among thc Marathas Vansitart seriously contemplated 3 general invasion of the Maratha empire from all sides when he learnt of the disaster of Panipat, although there was peace between the two powers at the time. It is true that had the issue of thatbattle becn different, Vansitart' s protege at Murshidabad would almost immediately have felt the wcight of thc Maratha military power: But a policy of aggression proves futile if it is not provided with 3 propcr implement: An imperial power with an aggressive pro- gramme must have an efficient instrument of war: So as its army renained efficient the empire fourished and prospered; when the army grew weak and inefficient the Marathas naturally lost the pre-eminence nd prestige oncc cnjoycd and had to make room for their better equipped rival An enquiry into the causes of the decline and of the Maratha army may therefore The subject has been exhaustively trcated in my Administrative System of the Marathas: they they things Evcry long they decay xvi INTRODUCTION reveal the real causes that ledto the declinc and decay ofthe Maratha The army is an instrument of the State: in the constitution and organisation of the State is therefore bound to be rcflected in the organisation of the army: The rules and regulations which an army is governed always bear an impress of the idcals by which the State isinspired The history ofthe Maratha army does not offer any cxception to this axiom. The Marath[ state in its infancy was governed by an enlightened autocracy in the shape of a national monarchy: The army which gave expession to the idealsandaspirations ofrhis state was naturally a national institution with strict rules and regulatiors. It formed a homogeneous body, commanded by a cadrc of officcrs who had to one supreme commandcr . The monarchical autocracy was however soon replaced by & feudal despotism, and the national army had conscquently to make room for a feudal force. Discipline in such a body is necessarily lax and homogcreity is impossible: During the Peshwa therefore we n0 longer find a single army under one central organisation led and commard- ed by onc supreme leader but 2 conglomeration of different armies led by different feudal chiefs who were not always inspired by common ideals Or united by common interests. The total military strength of the State was under such circumstarces not available at any moment and one military officer of the State could be; and in fact was, of-en pitted against another. This necessarily reduced the military resources of the State and rerdered unity of command impossible: Unfortunately this was not all. With the change of its consti- tution the Maratha State gradually forsook its original ideal and the national elements in the army were in consequence largely replaced by foreign mercenaries. But this defect of rhe Maratha army, im- portant as it is, does not explain its discomfiturc; for the English army, against which it fought, was also composed of the same elements; and disunited as thc Maratha chicfs Were, some of them could and did to the field 2 much bigger force than the English could to muster. Their defeat must therefore be attri- buted to inferiority in disciplinc, equipment and command. The Marathas owed their early success their Muslim rivals empire. change Every by regular obey period given general bring hope against INTRODUCTION Xvii co superior disciplinc. But as thcir cmpire expanded and thehoarded wealth of Hindustan fowed into the saddle of the Maratha llorsemen, began co emulate thc grandees of the Mughal empire in their military custons and ways of Discipline was in consequence sadly impaired and the Maratha army of the later Peshwa suffered from the very defects that had led to thc fall oftheir Muslim rivals. The arms and cquipment of thc Maratha army wcrc of 3 heterogencous character. While adopted new arms did not rcject the old ones. Consequently the weapons used by the Maratha soldiers represented all stages of civilisation, and some of thcm were certainly handed down from the early stone age. In thc battle of Udgir bows and arrows were employed with matchlocks and muskcts and among the missiles hat dhonda or stoncs are men- tioned. In their choice of wcapons no evolution is perceptible but thcre was accretion The same remark is applicable to their tactics. When they began to the new tactics with which had become familiar in their warfare the Ettropeans, did not reject their traditional system of fighting: The two methods were found in practice to be irreconcilable but persisted in their useless efforts at hybridization in 3 way that inevitably led to disaster. The Maratha chiefs with their old cavalry force clung to the traditional ways without in any way improving them, while the new battalions consisted of foreign mercenaries commanded by foreign officers of doubtful character, diverse nationality and very little knowledge of their profession. Such an amy had of course no chancc their English opponents. The inefficiency of the command in the Maratha army can bc directly traced to its feudal organisation and their inability to in- prove their military and civil institutions were also due to the sam1e causc. In short the dccline and fall of the Maratha military power was due firstly to the revival of feudalism aftcr the death of Sambhaji, which caused disunion and dissension from which Shivaji had tried to save his people; secondly to thc rejection of Shivaji' $ idcal of racial on a religious basis in favour of the principle of personal aggrandisement which led to the denationalisation of thc bags they living: days they they they adopt thcy against they against amity Xviji INTRODUCTION Maratha armny, and thirdly and lastly to thc failurc of thc Maratha leaders to pace with the scicntific progress in other parts of the world, to learn and assimilatc what others had to teach and improve upon what had lcarnt. In .Europe thcre was stcady progress from feudalism to national monarchy and from national monarchy to democracy; in Maharashtra the process was reversed by the Peshwas, and the result was the decline, decay and fall of the Maratha empirc. kecp they CHAPTER I SHIVAJI AND HIS FOLLOWERS SPLENDID soldiers alone cannot make a splendid army and 2 nation of fighters does not necessarily rank 25 2 military power: Military efficiency demands discipline in the men and imagination tempered with common sense in their leaders.

The latter ruled over small principalities in the Konkan and Karhad but the kingdom of the former was of The Chinese pilgrim says of the people of Maharashtra: 'Thc inhabitants were proud-spirited and warlike; grateful for favours and revengcful for Wrongs; self-sacrificing towards supplicants in distress and sanguinary to death with any who treated them insultingly.

The ambition of the average Maratha was confined to his own and the ambition of the average Maratha chief seldom cxtended beyond the narrow confines of his paternal principality; But to every Maratha high or low one was of paramount importance: He livcd and dicd for his watan.1 What his bapoti? was to the Rajput, the watan was to the Maratha: Thcre was no Sacrifice he could not make for it; even apostasy from his religion was not too high a to pay for its retention_ As each watan had more than one claimant; it caused continual strifc between rival chiefs and rival families And as the Maratha of those did not Ieadily forget 2 loss or forgive an injury, these quarrels inevitably led to blood feuds, which could only be ended by the complete extermination of one of the rival families. 8 Such hostilitics the Maratha s0 busily engaged that he had hardly time or inclination to noticc the movements and progress of the extemnal world The habit narrowed his vision but made a soldicr of him; and thus when the time came, he was ready to take advantage of the new Situation and improve his fortunes: After the dissolution ofthe Bahmani kingdom the Maratha chiefs began to extend their view and civil and military situations in the new courts_ were welcomed by all the new houses who had partitioncd the old kingdom The policy of rival houses was uncertain and shifting and their allianccs were not of duration; and had no hesitation in joining their Hindu neigh- bour of Vijayanagar a brother Muhammadan Prince: After the battle of Talikota employed their cnergy and resources in the conquest of the weakest members of the confederacy, Berar Watan is an Arabic word and originally meant home, but in Marathi it has acquired 3 special significance; and stands for any hercditary right or property.

Yet when this was accomplished the survivors foud themselves unable to compose their differences, and while in this positiol, wcre suddenly confronted by a new menace from the North. These continual wars offered excellent opportunities to Maratha soldiers and Maratha diplomats, who were as eager to earn new as to retain their old watans: The beginning of the seventcenth century saw many Marathas in high positions i the military and the civil services of the Ahmad- nagar, Bijapur and Golkonda Governmcnts; In I61S Malik Ambar employed 2 Brahman diplomat, Kasi Pandit, to negotiate peace becween Ahmadnagar and the Portuguesc state in India. ! Four copies of the treaty rcsulting from this negotiation wcre made two in Portuguese and two in the 'Hindu language; " 01, mnore accurately, 'Hindu alphabet: (Dous de letra endu dous enl portuguez) . This clearly testifies to the growing influence of the Hindus in the court oftheir Muslin rulers. A fresh treaty was concluded two years later and as before two copies of the trcaty, apparently for the use ofthe Indian signatory, were prepared in the Hindu language instead of Persian:.? In this intercsting document the date of the Hindu calendar (0 premeiro do mes asar dos gcntios) is given side by side with those of the Persian and Portuguese reckoning: It was, however, in the army that the Marathas particularly distinguished themselvcs. The art of war was still in its primitive weapons like sword and spear, bow and arrows, lance and dagger, which demanded little or no technical knowledge were still in general use, so that every ablc bodied man was a potential soldier.

Naturally he tried to secure the bcst market for his commodity. This wes the time-honoured system in India and it is at least as od 2s the Sukranitisara.? Neither time nor foreign conquest had affected it in the least: Succcss added to thc Silhedar' $ reputation and follow- ing ad of course improved his worldly prospects, for his reward generally came in the shape of a jahgir Or military fief It was in this way that somc Maratha families fosc to promincnce: The most important of them in rank as well as in power were the Mores of Jawli with the twin titles of Raja and Chandra Rao. Next came the Savantas of Wari, the Ghorpades of Mudhol, thc Nimbalkars of Phaltan, the Jadhavs of Sindkhed, the Shirkes, only lately dislodged from their paternal principality, the Surves with whom the Shirkcs had fond an asylum, the Mahadiks, the Mohites and the Ghatgcs Oflcss note wcre chiefs like thc Jedhes, the Manes and the Dafles. These families formed the military aristocracy of the land, but it should not be forgotten that in Maharashtra the profession of arms was not limited to thc noble few. The social barrier was ncither strong nor insuperable: The Shelars and the Jadhavas,8 descendants of had declined in the scale, the Pawars, another princcly fanily, had reconciled themsclves to their humble lot and no longer hcsitated to mnarry Kunbi girls of lowly origin ^ still affected the title of 'Raje' after their first name, but that was the only trace of royalty now leftto them. This society was naturally Silhedar , more properly Silahdar, literally means equipment holder, i.ev a soldier who finds his Own horse and arms. Sukranitisara is the digest ofa work on polity attributed to the legendary sage Sukracharya. The school of Sukracharya is mcntioned by Kautilya in his Arthasastra, but I am of opinion that the digest in its present form cannot be older than the century A.D_ The Shelars claim to be the descendants of the Silaharas and Lukhji Jadhav was a direct descendant of Ramchandra Deva the last independent Yadava ruler of Devgiri.

MILITARY SYSTEM OP THE MARATHAS democratic, and the common dangers;, common risks, and common adventures of a soldier's life levelled what difference might have survived. A promising young man who had only rccently rejected thc plebeian plough for the more aristocratic sword, could aspire to the hand of a daughter of the Nimbalkars, and could de mand a matrimonial alliance with the princely fanuily ofthe Jadhavas Social intercourse was mnore intimate and less formal than what is possible in a modern barrack, and an1 able leader of magnetic perso- nality commanded not only the admiration but also the affection of his following: The CO1non soldiers, except the fcw who formed the King'$ bodyguard, had nothing to do with the state but looked for pay, promotion and preference to thc Jahgirdar under whom immediately served. A loyal Jalgirdar contributed to the strength of the Government; but in those it was no discredit to set up aS a 'pund palegar" or lawless chief; as oncc did a Nimbalkar and a Jedhe. 1 Yet the state continuedits policy of multiplying the military fiefs and conferring fresh jahgirs on cach enterprising Silhedar . Even a wise like Muhammad Adilshah laid down that while 2 disloyal Zemindar should be deprived of his fief, the loyal lord should On no account be discouraged or disturbed ? The incvitable result of this policy was that the civil Government of the country was subordinated to military necds and the major portion of Maha- rashtra was held by a number of ilitary lcaders serving under three different masters. When Shivaji rose to power, the principality of Ahmadnagar had already been aexed by the Emperor of Delhi and the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golkonda were awaiting & similar fate.

This, in short; was the situation whcn Shivaji appeared in the political arcna: With the advent of Shivaji 3 nCW era opened in the military history of the Marathas. He had a clear conception of military org?- nisation, dcfinite plans of military reform and vicws and opinions bascd upon past experience. He believed in personal selec- tion but had no faith in hereditary Hc approved of unity of command, but would not tolerate military interference in the civil adiinistration of the country: He wanted a strong monarchy as the only antidote to the prevailing discord, dissension and anarchy, and could not therefore reconcile himself to feudalisn and 2ll that it stood for. He had some advantage over his antagonists; His hands were not tied by precedents; but at the Same timc, as the founder ofa new kingdom and a new house, he couldnot ignore the tradition oftheland, nor could he afford wholly to alienatc the vestedinterests. His first steps were naturally cautious and circumspect. He started operations with a small force attached to his fathcr' $ jahgir, which probablyncededfcw officers But as soonas thisforce was augmented 1 Itis sid that Bajaji Rao Nimbalkar married a Princess of Bijapur after his conversion to Muhammadanism.

In this army the Silhedars did not preponderate although at first Shivaji had to depend mainly on these free-Jances. Of the three thousand horsemen under Mankoji Dahatondc, fully two thousand were Silhedars; but by 1659 the strength of the paga Or Ca valry had risen to seven thousand, while the Silhedars numbered only three thousand ? In other words the numerical proportion of the Silhedar had fallen from 66 %, to 33 % ofthe whole cavakry force available for service: This fcature of the Maratha army did not cscape the notice of the Muslim historians. Khafi Khan writes: 'It is said that Sivaji got togcther some ten Or twelve thousand of Kachh and Arab horses, so that when he sent out an army most of the horsemen were bargirs, i.e-, rode horses belonging to him' 8 Bhimsel, who served under Dalpat Rai, a Bundela chief, informs us that Shiveji employed Silhedars, but the Mahrattas, who had most pay, wcrc bargirs 4 Krishnaji Anant Sablasad is more positive in his statement: "The strength of thc paga (regular cavalry) was rendered superior (to that of the Silhedar): The Silhedars were placed under the jurisdiction of the It is needless to out that the numerical superiority of the cavalry ovcr the irregular Silhedar horse contributed to better disci- pline in Shivaji's army: But he did not stop here: A bom military leader, hc recognised early thc supreme need of unity of command in the battle-field and this he attained by establishing a cadre of officers both for the infantry and for the cavalry. Of the cavalry officers, the lowest in rank was the Havaldar. He commanded & unit of twenty-five horscmen, and to each of these units was attached a water carrier and a farrier. Over five such units was placed a Jumledar , while a Hazari had under him ten jumlas: Sabhasad , p. 8. Sen, Sivachhatrapati, P. 4 Sabhasad, p. II. Sen, Sivachhatrapati, p: 8.

A number of civil officers were attached to the army: A Jumledar was assisted by 2 Majumdar O accountant with IOO to I25 Hons a year: A Hazari' $ civil establishmcnt consisted of a Majumdar, a Karbhari and a Jamenis; and a similar staff, probably with more pay, was attached to the Panchhazari' $ office. Besides these there were the news writers of the camp, who held their office dently of the military commanders and reported to the or his Vaknavis.1 In the infantry the smallest unit consisted of tcn mlen, commanded by a Naik Five such units werc placed undcr a Jumledar, and two or three jumlas formed & Hazari' $ division. When this cadre was intro_ duced therc were apparently only seven divisions of Mawle and these were placed under thc Sarnobat Yesaji Kank who held the chief command The Sarnobat of infantry Was inferior in rank and status to the Sarnobat of cavalry, for, while the ktter was admitted to thc Ashta Pradhan Council the former had no place in tha: body: For their civil assistants the Junledar and the Hazari of thc infantry had each a Sabnis, who the account and the mustcr roll. Thc Sabnis of thc Jumledar drew 2 of 40 Hons;? while the officer of that name on the Hazari' $ staff was given IOO to 125 Hons.

Shivaji had tried his utmost to undo the cvils of feuda- lism by depriving the old Deshmukhs and Deshpandes of some of their obnoxious rights and prerogatives He had, likc Henry IL, down the fortified castles of thc petty local tyrants? and he was determinednot to create new ficfs and renew the evils of military tyranny and fcudal anarchy: No office in his army was hereditary, and all officers, high or low, werc liable to dismissal, transfer or censure a5 the case deserved.

The Maratha chroniclers assert with evidcnt that he fought with success against four great powers. The numerical strength of his army has been variously stated. Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad puts it well above IoO,o0o.

Their dcvotion no doubt was due to the personal magnctism of the leader, but what first caught their imagination and made them forgct their agelong policy of blood-feud and personal aggrandise- ment? In that agc the idea of nationality was yct unborn; but race and religion still stirred the decpest chord in the sentiment of the rude Maratha peasant soldicry: It was to thesc that Shivaji The idcal he set forward before his people was a Hindvi Swarajya (Hindu empire) , a Maharashtra Padshahi (Maratha dom); 1 but above all a Dharma Rajya, a kingdom of righteousness He assumed the title of Go Brahman pratipalak, and thc protection of the cow and the priestly castc was considered the paramount of every Hindu.? For this causc the Brahman could fight shoulder to shoulder with the meanest of the untouchablcs, the Mahar, who is not allowed to live within the walls. And The term Hindvi Swarajya is used by Shivaji in a lcttcr to Dadaji Naras Prabhu: See Rajwade, Marathyanchya Itihasachin Sadhanen, Vol: IS, p 272. The term Marhasta Rajya Occurs in Jedhe Yancha Karina published in Shiva Charitra Pradip, p. 43. When Chhatrasal the Bundela chicf waited on Shivaji, the Maratha urged him, in an inspiring speech, to return to his OWII principality and fight the Mughals there: Lal Kavi, who must have heard an account of this meeting from Chhatrasal himself, says that Shivaji addressed the Bundela prince thus: 'Docs not the Chuttree faith consist in protecting the cow and the Brahmuns, in guarding the Veda, in showing skill and valor in battle? and if you lose your Itife, will you not hrough the solar orb enter the mansion of bliss, enjoying plentitude ofhappiness and repose?'

In Indja religious intolerance has been very rare and Shivaji'$ conception of a Hindu empire was in no way identified with religious persecution: He enlisted in his army seven hundred Pathan deserters from Bijapur; at least three of his naval commanders were Muslims by faith; and he venerated the Muhammnadan saint Sheikh Muhmmad as he venerated thc Hindu Saints Tukaran and Ramdas. He inam lands for 'the illumination of, and food offerings to, the shrines of Muhammadan saints, and Muslim mosques were maintained by state allowance 1 Only Oncc in his eventful career did he fail to respect the given by 3 Muhammadan saint to sone fugitives;" 4 but he never failed to show due respect to the holy scriptures of the Muslims. And Khafi Khan who delights in shower- ing the most opprobrious cpithets (e-g, the reprobate, the son of the devil, the father of fraud, that hell evil malicious fellow)a on him is yet constrained to admit that, 'he made it a rule that whenever his followers wcnt plundering, should do no harm to thc mosqucs, the Book of God; Or the womcn ofany one: Whencver acoPy of the sacrcd Kurin Came into his hands, hetreated it with respect, and gave it to some of his Musalnan followers.

The Savants of Wari yielded to force but did so with reluctance and were ncvcr reconciled to their new lot. Even the Nimbalkars, nebr rclations of Shivaji, could not be accountcd steadfast friends. Thus Shivaji could not win to his side the land- owning interests, but the masses flocked to him, hailed him as their King and leadcr, and it was thc tillers of the soil, the hewers of wood and drawers of water, who formed the mainstay of the new movement.?

But a few letters 0n thc subject havc come down to US, which, while representingthe vicws of one party form conclusive evidence of the pre-Maratha origin of chauth. Thc first of these letters was addressed to Shivaji by Pedro d Almeida, Conde de Assumar, Viceroy of the Portuguese State in Edia, 011 10 January 1678.

The Viceroy, Dom Pedro &'Almeida, replied that he would send for information (on this subject) from the Captain General of the North and from the commandant of the fortress of Daman, and when the said informa- tion came he would advise Shivaji Raze to send a person with authority to settle this business with the said captains, after examining the terms under which the said chauth was created; but the said advice had not come and the decision that was expected has becn delayed. To this my answer is that the cause of the arose from the embarkation of the said Viceroy for Mozambique and o that account the said captains neglected to send the information he asked of them.

This treaty was ratified in 1670 and 1719 and it Rcis Visinlos, Vol. I, fol. 29. Historical Rccords at Goa, P. 2I. Abbe Carre says that the Portuguesc of Daman had stipulated to pay the neighbouring princes a certain sum per ycar for kecping their turbulent subjects in check and preventing then! from committing any trouble in Portuguesc tcrritorics In 1673 Shivaji demanded that the stipulated money should be to hini, and thc Portuguese Govemment was not inl a position to refuse payment. Carre was at Dannan when Skivaji s cnvoy arrived thcre, but he does not say probably bccausc he did not know, whether thc tribute denanded by Shivaji was called chauth ( Carre; Voyagcs Aux Indes Oriertalcs; Val: II, Pp: 25-32). Prof. Pissurlcncar Says that in 1684 thc Portugucse had agrced not Only to pay to Sambhaji the chauth of Daman bit also gaokhandi of the district of Basseil, while Sanbhaji undertook to defend the territories of the Portugucse: Thc cxtent and the prccisc maturc of Sambhaji' $ obligations cannot be asccrtained, as the original treaty has bcen lost and only 3 short paid parties good amity price prior King Sen, paid 26 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THB MARATHAS mentions in the preamble another treaty concluded as carly as I579,1 dcaling with the same subject ad the relation between the Portu - guese Government and the Raja of Sarceta or Asarceta in the domi- nion of Ramnagar. In I617, Jaeda Rana, of Sarceta, sent two envoys for the conclusion of a defensive alliance as well as for the regular payment and correct assessment of chauth; and in' 1604 2 alvara was issued on the subject:? This chauth, thercfore, came into existence as early as I579,ifnot earlier; and continued to be by the villagers of Daman and collected by thc Raja of Ramnagar until I7I9. Let u$ HOW determine what was exactly the relation becween this Raja and his Portuguese neighbours, in what form this contribution was and by whose agents it was collected. In a letter to His Majesty the of Portugal, dated II September 1638,the Viceroy, Pedro da Silva, defincd chauth, which was by the inhabitants of Daman to the Raja of Sarceta, as 1 kind ofimpost which obliges the said not to harbour robbers in his dominions and to refrain from capturing Ien and cattle be- longing to the farmers o the province of Daman" 6 Thc alvara or letter of 1604 states that the has been informed that the captains of Daman do not treat thc King Chauthia fairly, but pay his chauth in the form of overpriced old horses and other similar The King forbids this unfair practice On of sevcre penaltics, and orders all persons concerned to pay chauth in cash 8 Of more interest is the paper recounting the favours which Jaeda Rana of Sarceta solicited through his envoys in 1617. In the first place hc was anxious to secure military help from the Portuguese in caSc of foreign invasion. Then he goes on to ask that thc chauth belonging to one Berba may be_ to him, a5 the said Berba was his uncle, to whom the chauth had bcen given by the Raja'$ ancestors, and the sons and wife of Berba had now transferred to the Raja the chauth originally belonging to Berba by 1 dccd of gift, a copy of summary given in a contemporary letter is now available (P.

The further prayed that his chauth should be in Mahmudi Chalanis and not in Mahmudi Chaparis, as was then thc practicc, and suggested that a8 the Portuguesc inhabitants of Daman did not return 2 correct statement of the revenue of their and the Raja was thereby dcfrauded of his incomc, the Viceroy should send an honcst and conscientious Portuguese to make a11 cnquiry in the mattcr.1 The reply ofthc Portugucse Govemment and the observa- tions nade on the subjcct by Dr. Goncalo Pinto da Fonseca may bc over, for a subsequent documcnt informs us that the arrangement made on this occasion did not take cffect. It is, how- ever, worth ccmarking that whcn the Chauthia had declared war thc Portuguese statein 1614, thc Viceroy,Dom Jcronymo de Azevedo, had ordered the collection of chauth as usual by 4 com- mission of thrcc, especially appointed on that occasiom to mect the expcnscs of maintaining a small forcc of footincn for thc defcnce of thc chauth-paying territories out of thcfund collected which was hot otherwise to bc intcrfered with ? But the most intcrcsting documcnt is thc trcaty of 1635. The word chauth rcally signifies a but thc first Article of this treaty definitely laid down that the Chauthia should in no case receive 2 quarter of thc total revcnue collectcd ? In some parganas his share amountcd to 17 per cent. while in others he was enritled to IO more than 14 and 12} per cent , of the revenuc To avoid misunderstanding, thcse parganas wcre clearly mentioned in the text of the treaty, and Article 2 debarred him from making ay further demands from the peasants and landholders of these parganas, all his clims bcen included in thc abovc mcntioncd 17, I4 and 12} per cent: of the rcvenue.' It was settled by Article 3 that chauth should be collected annually in the month of October in the city of Daman and its sub-divisions, andnot in thc villages According to 1 Biker, Tratados da Indid, Vol. I, Pp: 197-200. 3 Biker, Tratados da India, Vol. II, Pp: 83-5. 8 Ibid, p. 63. Ibid, p. 63 King paid villages passcd King against fifty quarter' having 28 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS Article 4 the Raja Chauthia was expected to send his Pradhan and recciver at thc appointed time of collection to collcct and receive chauth, and two persons of noble birth and acknowledged honesty were to be elected by thc officers and people of Daman to act aS assessors of chauth. In retum for the chauth which he rcccived the Raja and his pcople werc expccted to Icfrain fron any injury to the chauth-paying districts; if any robbery or thcft was committed in the district of Daman by any of the Raja' $ subjects, he was to hand over the culprits to receive condign puishinent, which he would be obliged to pay compensation for the losscs by his people. He was not to allow the Kolis and other predatory tribesto pass through his lands. The Raja of Sarceta was also required to serve His Majesty the of Portugal with his army, whenever he was called upOn to do so by the Governor and captains of the fortress of Daman He WJs to bc a true and honcst friend of the city ad province of Dama, as his grandfather and father bcfore him had undcrtakcn to be. This treaty was with certain modifications renewed and rcconfirmed in 1670; but the first five articles which the payment and collection of chauth remained ualtercd, and from a letter of the Viceroy in 1719 it appears that the annual chauth (which n0 longcr fulfilled the conditions implied in the term) amounted to 18,000 Xerafuls 1 Despite the protest of Antonio Paes de Sande, thc paymcnt of chauth cannot bc as 3 privatc arrangemcnt o the villagers of Daman, when it formed the subjcct matter of s0 many treatics from 1579 to I719; nor could the Portugucse Govcrment have been s0 ignorant of this in 1678, since onc of thc trcaties had been renewed in 1670. It is equally clear that when the Portuguese Government conccded this impost to the of Ramnagar, otherwise called the Chauthia, didnot in any way acknowledge his supremacy or suzerainty: On the contrary, from the language of thc letter patent and the treatics already discussed, he seems to havc becn in the position of a vassal of the Portugucse. Hc rcccived the chauth as a sort of remuneration for the performance of certain duties.? It is notcworthy that in the viccregal lcttcr of 1638 chauth is described as an impost, and in another vicercgal lctter of 1 Biker, Tratados da India, Vol. VI, Pp 6-7. 2 See footnote $, p 26. doing and failing causcd King regulated regarded levy King they police CHAUTH AND SARDESHMUKHI 29 I719 it is called a pension. Prof. Pissurlencar, Curator of the Records at Goa, said in a paper published in I926 that in the old Portuguese records the chauth is never a tribute (Tanto isto c verdade que nOS antigos documentos 0 chouto designado como uma pcnsao ou foro e nunca como umn tributo), and he quotes Antonio Bocarro, who wrote in 1634 that the Raja Chauthia had enjoyed this pcnsion even in pre-Portuguese times 1 This may O may not be accurate; but the chauth which he collected in Portuguese times Ws hardly different from the perquisitcs in the of the Peshwas to thc Koli and Bhil Naiks for kecping their disorderly bands in check and maintaining and order throughout the countryside:? The chauth that Shivaji demanded from his cncmies and bours was different from a pension by a superior pOWer in considcration of his services Yet it is not difficult to see how the practice prevailing in the Portugucsc provincc of the North must have suggestedto the mind ofthe grcat Maratha leadcr the idea of exacting 1 contribution from his wealthy enemics to rcplenish his war chest.

Shivaji was in urgent need of money: War required funds for its prosecution, evcn in thosc medieval and hc was fighting simultaneously two powcrful cnemies He had done all that hc could to develop the natural resourccs of his territorics; but his normal income was hardly adequate for the incessant hostilities involved in the foundation of & new kingdom and the creation of a nation. He had therefore no alternative but to make war pay for War: Thc Muhammadan of India had set an example which he now enulated with effect: Hc sent his army on mulk-giri, which connoted its existence at other people'$ expense for eight months out of the twelvc This was obviously 2 dlumsy way of maintaining 3 standing army, for the matcrial advantage accruing to the invading force was bound to be far less than the loss it inficted on the invaded country: Shivaji realiscd that it would be far more profitable and convenient to exact a contribution from his cnemies in return for an udertaking to refrain from plundcr; ad this was in fact the salient feature of his subsequent demand for chauth. Shivaji made his position quite clear in a letter to the Gover- nor of Surat and Mirza Mosun to which referenceis made in a letter writtcn from Surat to Bombay O11 25 Junc 1672 (fol: 47, FR.

How sadly had failed in this primary is evident from the account of their defenceless condition as conveyed by the Surat factors to their friendsat Bombay on 26 1677 (FR.

Moreover, both he and his cousin of were eager to strengthen his cause by cnlisting on his side the moral support of the Mughal powcr, the visible sign of which was to be an impcrial farman for the chauth and sardeshmukhi of the six subhas (provinces) of the Dcccan, which the Maratha might then and cherish as his watan. The ministers at Delhi werc eager to take full advantagc of the intcrnal dissension prevailing among the Marathas by procrastinating and postponing thc issue of the farman sought by the rival parties; but the men on the spot found it difficult to maintain peace and order and to protect the peasant 0 whose labours thc state revenucs mainly depended, without coming to some sort of understanding with the Marathas. Daud Khan, thcre- forc, consented to pay chauth to the Maratha Chhatrapati with one important proviso I the chauth was to be collected for thc Marathas by the Mughal revenue officers. By this arrangement the Marathas would be unable to interfere with the peasantry or the internal administration of Mughal territory: This proposal, So necessary in the circumstances, did not mcet with the pproval of the Emperor and his ministers, and Chinkulich Khan, the next govero., was not disposed to accept the policy laid down by his predeccssor in the office. Syed Hussain Ali, who replaced Chinkulich, at first made a determined but ineffectual effort to check Maratha depredations, and shortly afterwards political cvents at Delhi, which nced no reference here, compelled him to purchase Maratha alliance at any Khafi Khan says that Hussain Ali came to an understanding with 'Balaji Bishwanath and Jamnaji' (Chimnaji:) through the media- tion of Shankraji Malhar, 2 Mabarashtra Brahman, who had once held an important office under Rajaram Chhatrapati: 'Thcre was to be to the officers of Raja Shahu" says Khafi Khan, a fourth of what amins, kroris and shikkdars collccted as land revenue, and as sair from the government lands and from jagirdars It was also settled that, in addition to thc fourth share which werc to get from the of the jagirdars, were to feceive from the raiyats ten per cent 2s sar-deshmukhi.

On the roll of the collection the signature of the sarristadar of the sar-deshmukhi was first placed, <d what was required the rules on that account was to be taken separately. 1 Thus the Marathas obtained their desire, thc right of collecting chauth on thcir own account and by their own agents; and although their demand was sometimcs cxcessive, thc arrangement, 2s Khafi Khan shows, had certain redeeming features In some places, e-g; Berar and Khandesh, the Marathis took onc third lcaving onc third to the raiyat and one third to the jagirdars and formerly rendered dcsolate wcrc JlOW restored to cultivation_ 2 But if this purchasc of Maratha protection was to the advantagc of the cultiva- tor,the presence of the Maratha tax collector in the Mughal provinces was incompatible with the sovereign righcs of an indcpendent power.

Thus both in its charactcr and in the method f collection chauth became in Shahu' $ time a pension, exactly as the Portuguese regarded it in1 theic relations with the Raja Chauthia of Rannagar: this neither Shahu nor any of his successors openly receded, though in practice seldom, if ever, honoured thcir obligations But if the Emperor could not cnforce the tcrms ofhis farnian on the Marathas, neither could he mnake his powerful govcrnors rcspcct it: This ledto constant mutual rccriminations; the Marathas could never rely On the punctual paymcnt of chauth; while thc contribution by no mcans always rcpresented a quartcr of the entire rcvenue: The Maratha chicfs would oftcn compound thcir claim for & lower sum, 3s did with Hyder; for the financial rcsults of a campaign of deprcda- tion did not always comc up to their expectations, as has becn out two writers of different ages ad differcnt nationalities.

'Thus at the head of a powcrful army, I shall wage war, contributions, and grant no respite till the encmy consents to pay the chouth: He may then remain unmolested ' This was the plan disclosed by Chhatrasal to his-brother Ratan Shah ?

Shivaji claimed to be thc hereditary sardeshmukh of Maharashtra and sardeshmukhi was supposed to be his watan. In this claim 1 Aitchison, Treaties, Engagements and Sanads, 19o9 edition, Vol VI, p $9. 8 Thisis apparent from the treaty of 17SS and those ofSalbyeand Bassein: 9 Aitchison, Treaties, Vol. VI, p: IS. good they long Lastly paid having during satisfy theory 42 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THB MARATHAS did not conflict with the sovcreign rights of the existing Govern- ments and could be conceded by them with better grace and less loss of prestige: According to Ranade, Shivaji first climcd sardesh- mukhi for Junnar and Ahiadnagar in I6so.

The first grew out of a precedcnt found in the Portuguese province of the North, and the sccond was bascd on 2 lcgal fiction suggested by thc prevailing revenue of the country.

That was the rcason he could not follow his ncighbours' custom of paying his mien by grants ofland or jahgirs, and was obliged to find moncy by other means.

The ardent loyelty to the which Shivaji had inspircd in his people, the iron discipline which he had cnforced in his army, the subordination of the military to the civil authority which he had striven to sccure, were not in any way thc result of orderly evolution from historic precedent; but were esscntially new revo- lutionary idcas conceived by the mind of a born leader of men. Novel though his ideas were, failed to shake thc implicit trust of the people in him Or to arouse their doubts as to the soundness ofhis policy. His succcssors, unfortunately, had neither the foresight nor the ability to carry on his unfinishcd work, and whcn the moral impetus which he had given to it was spent, old ideas rcgaincd thcir ascendancy and feudalisin cntered upon a new and vigorous life. Sambhiji has becn blamcd for undoing his father'$ work, but for the revival of feudalism hc was not fesponsible: Hc was a soldier but he did not possess his father' $ statesmanship, vision and idealism With his troops he was immensely and although his personal cxample was hardly calculatcd to improve disciplinc, he did nothing to encouragc hereditary appointments in the army: His financial difficulties WCTC grcat and punctual payment was impossible: This led him to relax the military code ofhis father; and of war which in Shivaji'$ time had formed the property of the State werenow left cntircly to thc army: Thisno doubt impaired discipline, but Sambhaji went 10 further. He did not try to solve his fmancial difficultics by crcating ficfs in favour of his military officers, and the inspiration which hc failed to give his lifc - time he supplied by his death: For though he lived a rake, he died 1 martyr and for a timc at lcast his dcmoralised followers WCre fired with a Ieligious enthusiasm that Sambhaji' s death had kindled: The period succeeding Sambhaji S death, though decidedly critical, was not wholly dcstitute of for the Marathas: It is truc wcre fort after fort, and that Rajaran, their new had to seek safety in distant Jinji, lcaving the defence of Maharashtra in other hands It is truc that Maratha officers, like Suryaji Pisar, did not hesitate, as in the of old, to sacrifice the interests of thc State to their OWIL . thanks to Aurangzib, a new spirit was king they good popular spoils during hope they losing king, days Yet, REVIVAL OF FEUDALISM 45 engendered among the Marathas and the triple barrier, which divid- ed them politically so was demolished by the Mughal conquest of Bijpur and Golkonde. Moreover, the imposition of jiziya was not calculated to conciliatc a warlike pcople who had been unfamiliar with religious intolerance. Unfortunately Rajaram, who did not possess the magnetic pcrsonality of his father, pcrmitted himself to delegate his authority to two Brahunan officcrs, and there- by lowered the prestige of thc kingly office in a12 when the ruler had perforce to be either thc supreme war-lord of the Statc, or, that, a nonentity: The task which he had thus delegated to Pralhad Niraji and Ramchandra Pant Hukmacpanha was unusual- ly arduous, for with an einpty war-chest, werc expccted to an attack backcd by the whole weight of the Mughal empirc: Aurangzib' S crrors of policy had disposed the majority of the Marathas to support theit cause; but despite this fact, their inability to command the samc devotion that was shown to Shivaji o that would have bcen shown to Rajaran; if he had inherited his father' $ qualities, obliged them to purchase thc loyalty of their adherents by concessions of the type most appreciated by thc Marathas. Here - ditary fcfs werc created in favour of successful warriors and fresh services were rewarded with fresh jahgirs. In fact the jahgir was often granted in districts still in Mughal possession and thc favoured jahgirdar had frequcntly to kill thc bear before he could own the skin. The old discipline fell rapidly out of date, and Shantaji Ghof- pade, the only oficer who adhercd to it,1 was weakly sacrificed by the impotent King to the of his discontented soldiers. Within years of his death Shivaji $ military reforms were relegated to the scrap-hcap, though thc kingdon hc had founded still survived. The decline of the monarchy continued steadily aftcr Rajaram'$ death; for thc minority of his two sons offercd excellent op- portunities to thc fief-holders of consolidating their power and Khafi Khan says that Shantaji used to inflict very severe punishment for the slightest offence: See Elliot and Dowson, History %f India, Vol. VII, p. 359.

Shahu' s success, however, far from restoring the power of the house of Satara, was merely symptomatic of the fevival of feudalism. Balaji Vishwanath, who contributed more than anybody else to Shahu' $ succcss, found it beyond his power to reduce Kanhoji Angria , but managed to achicve by diplomacy what he could not obtain by war. Kanhoji offered allcgiance to Shahu, but retaincd his fief and naval command. Probably this suggested to Balaji a new mcthod of conciliating othcr military clcfs and restoring internal peace and order by directing their attention abroad: Whcn he obtained the imperial farmans for chauth and sardeshmukhi for his master, hc had somcthing tempting and something definite to offer to those who would loyally serve Shahu and acknowledge his authority: The sardeshmukhi was the Raja' $ watan and could not be alienated; but only & quatter of the chauth was retained for the Raja and was henceforth styled Rajbabti or perquisite: The rcmain- threc-fourths of thc chauth was available for distribulion among Shahu' s followcrs, six per cent: of the totalchauth, callcd in Marathi sahotra, was set apart for thc Sachiv; another three per cent, wis dcnominated nadgaundi, while the balance called mokasa was granted to different military leaders, in return for their maintenance of 2 fixed military contingent and an undertaking to perform military service on bchalf of the Statc, whenevcr occasion so dcmanded. ding long regarded vassals they Kolhapur princi- option royal complete royal ing REVIVAL OF FEUDALISM 47 Balaji Vishwanath's settlement however, did not stop here. Lest the interests of the differcnt chiefs should jn any way clash and lead to hostilities, he clearly defined thcir of activity' Thus Khandesh and some part of Balaghat were reserved for the Peshwa; the Senapati reccived Baglan and Gujarat; to the Sena Saheb Subha was assigncd Berar and Gondwana and all the territories to the east; the Sarlaskar Was in of Gangthadi and the provincc of A urangabad; whilc the districts bctwcen the Nira and the Wara were lcft to the Pratiidhi' $ care.1 These chiefs wcrc to collcct chauth from the territories assigned to them; could jf liked extend their activities further in their immediatc ncighbourhood: were to mnake a stipulated contribution to the treasury and to mcet the expenses of some of the karkhanas or establish- ments; within thcir ficfs were to excrcise sovereign authority without any interference from the Raja.

The office of Senapati was on different occasions offered to Ramchandra Jadhav and Murar It is worth noting that Dalwai and Peshwa are synonymous terms, and both the officers exercised almost the same functions.

Thc officc of Sarlaskar was older than the other two andthe officc of Sena Khaskhel was originally conferred 0n a junior member of the Senapati' $ family, just as the posts of Scna Dhurandhar and Sena Bahadurl afterwards scrved to console thc junior memnbers of the Blonsla family, the eldest branch alone entitled to thehigher office of Scna Saleb Subha. To cach of thesc offices Was attached a jahgir in return for wlich the holder was expectcd to Iaintain a stipulated force: Thcse honours, it appears, were confined only to the older familics who had risen to promninence under Rajaram or Shahu. This systen did not work well, and led to conflict which it was expectcd to obvixtc: The Peshwa fought with the Senapati, the Dabhadcs could rcndcr no scrvicc to thc State as was not hereditary, the Gaikwad and tkc Bhonsla wcrc not vcry favourably disposed towards the Peshwa and thc Peshwa found it ncccssary to trespass 01l their rescrves.

Thc saranjam-holder had 2 twofold to perforn: He was not only a military commander, but also a civil administrator and in this lattcr capacity he had to finance the army under his command. Whcnever he was called upon to lead or take part in an expedition, he mobilised his army, enlisted ncw rccruits if necessary, and took the field as early as possible. Before, however, he could leave his hcadquarters, hc had to advance his Silhcdars : part of thcir pay under the style of nalbandi. Hc had to purchase arins and 2nmunition and cattle for transport purposes: The Peshwa's Government did not advance thc necessary funds and the saranjam-holder had gcnerally to raise it as best as he could.

Thus was crcated 1 vicious circle whereby military necds affected the cfficiency of the civiladministration and the inefficicncy of the civil government reacted disastrously upon military cfficiency: Both Sindhia and Holkar found it necessary to raisc mnoncy by mortgaging the future revcnuc of their provinces and governorships to thcir creditors.1 But even these makeshifts could not indefinitely postpone thc final disaster and thcre came a when the great chiefs found themselves unable to mcet the just intercept him; he there sits down in dherna, with poison, Or a poignard, or some Other instrurnent of suicide, in his hand; and thrcatcning to Usc it if his adversary should attempt to molcst Or pass him.

Baji Rao I fought Trimbak Rao Dabhade and defeated him; thus affording the strange spectacle of two servants o the same master cngaged in mutual hostilities. The Scnapati' $ powcr collapsed not so much by reason of that single defeat as from the fact that he had no able successor: Yet it was not possible to take full advantage of the victory by depriving the Dabhades of their extensive ficfs imme- diately after the battle of Dubhoi. Similrly Damaji Gaikwad was defeated by thc Peshwa' $ forces when he hastencd to the support of Tarabai; it was found impracticable to crush thc Gaikwads as the Dabhadcs had becn: I his conflict with these old Sardars or military chiefsthe Peshwa relied on the support ofhis Own adherents. These in their turn werc rewardcd with rich fiefs and becamc the fouders of new familics. At first their gratitude held them fastly to their master' $ sidc, but the bancful cxample of the master hiinself was too tempting for the ncxt gcneration Thc Peshwa continucd to multiply ficfs unchccked, and fired by his example; thc rulers of various Maratha principalities introduced widcspread sub-infeudation by rewarding thcir own immediatc adhcrents and followcrs in the samc mlanner. But the Peshwas wcre not altogether blind to the possibility of the sons and grandsons of thcir ioyal vassals growing weary of their allegiance: This tricd to prevent by playing on their mutual jealousy. Sindhia and Holkar were designed to be thc two stout pillars of the Maratha cmpire in the north; but not infrequently failed to agrec with onc another, and a came when becamne openly hostile and turned their arms one anothcr. The policy of the Poona Government was to effect & brcach and to it open, not merely betwcen two neighbouring chiefs but even between brothcrs of the sanc family.

The stream has added to thirst only. Raghuji ad Fatte Baba had in the past brought a strcan fron the south but its fow was interrupted at placcs. For many in the interval the streai from the south did not fow. By God's grace the stream of wealth is fowing well in this army this ycar but there arc many lands on tlie way to Poona and it will bc entircly absorbed (in transit) 0n that account: If the northern and the southern streams could in their high food be united at Poona without any absorption on their Way, then I could get rid of my debts and sccure rewards of my labour both in this world and the next: The Ganges flows to thc sea but savcs the whole world; in thc Jike manner do these northern and southern rivers flow in the prescnt agc and benefit many pcoplc: AlL rivers and streams fow to the occan, thc Kaveri alone has bcen brought to thc service of men.

Balaji Baji Rao like his predccessors still professed to be a cham- pion of Hinduism: He wrote rcspectful lcttcrs to Brahmans of known sanctity, granted them pensions and allowanccs, and some- timcs rcmitted thcir rent, and in his letters he often expressed an ardent desire to recover ftoin the Muhammadans the holy placcs of Benares and Muttra But Brahmans and holy mcn were not the only Hindus; and while mnight showcr their blessings on the Peshwa and his family, the Hindu princes alone could assist him in his wars the Muhammadans Evidently Balaji Baji Rao cared more for their money than for their armed forces, for it is during his regime that the Maratha arms fell heavily on theit gold golden Sing golden days dry they good quite they against REVIVAL OF FEUDALISM 61 Rajput co-religionists Hitherto the Rajputs had welcomed this I1CW power from the south a5 thc avcnger o Hindu wrongs in the north; but Balaji and his principal Sardars, Sindhia and Holkar, made the Rajput realisc that Maratha supremacy meant for them nothing but 2 of masters, and the was by no means for the better. So whcn the Marathas stood in urgent necd of men and money in 1760 and 1761 the Rajputs rcmained sternly aloof;, while all the Muhamnmadan princes and nobles of Northcrn India, including the Nawab of Oudh whom the Marathas had donc thcir utmost to conciliate and gratify, rallied to the Afghan banner. Nor wcre these thc only evil cftects of the sclfish policy of plunder and raid. It caused disunion and disscnsion within the Maratha cmpire: Thc Peshwa, iu want of mney, did JlOt hesitate to sell his assistance to the Nawab of Bcngal Raghuji Bhonsla of Nagpur. Raghuji, indced, was nOt wcll-disposed towards Balaji; but the moral effect of fighting a Maratha Sardar, while employed in a Muhammadan province, w2s simply disastrous. Baji Rao did not scek aid in his fight agaist the Senapati; but Balaji extended his protcction to Bengal 2 Sardar of the Empire; he joined thc English in order to about thc destruction of the Angria; and his $01 simply cmulated his cxample when he coalesced with Nizam Ali against Janoji Bhonsl. Thus the unhappy Raghoba ccrtainly committed ILO uprecedented offencc whcn he sought military aid to secure the nsnad of Poona: Balaji lamentcd the diffcrences betwcen Sindhia and Holkar and earncstly them to pursue a common policy in Rajputana, but he conveniently forgot that with the cxample he had sct in Bengal the only common policy could be cxpected to was one of 'self-aggrandise - ment. It is needlcss to remark that although the bulk of the Maratha army consisted of feudal levies, the Pcshwa had an additional force of his own, The composition of this personal force was naturally affected by the change of political ideal and political outlook Shivaji aimned at the foundation of a Maratha cmpire, and his army was mainly,ifnot wholly, composed of Marathas The Pathan regiment, he enlisted, probably consisted of Deccani Musulmans, who were for all practical purposes children of the soil and wcre by no means favourably inclined towards the Mughal empire.

This denationalisation with its conscquent demoralisation inevitably led to the final overthrow of the Maratha empire. Feudalism in itsclf was bad, but the employment of foreign mcrcenaries was, as we shall see, cven more disastrous. CHAPTER IV INFANTRY AND CAV ALRY KRISHNAJI Anant Sablasad says that Shivaji had 45,000 cavalry and only Io,ooo Mawle infantry in his army:8 But the few figures that wc have of his cxpeditionary forces at differcnt dates contradict this estimatc.

From the few figures available in thc contemporary correspondence of the English factors An expeditionary force scnt by Holkar, under an officcr named Chimaji Rao Bule, in 1783 consisted of 1,000 to I,S00 gardis, 2,000 to 2,S00 cavalry and 6,000 Pendharis See Maheshwar Darbarchin Batmi Patren, Vol. II, p. 40.

In 1675 Shivaji laid siegc to the fortress of Phonda and in thc besicging force, as we learn from 2 Carwar letter, dated I4 April, the cavalry was far outunbered by infantry; thcir rcspcctivc strength 2,000 and 7,020.8 On I9 November 1678, the Rajapore factors wrOcc to their friends at Bombay that the Bijapur gcuerals dared not attack Shivaji who hid IS,000 horse and 20,000 foot at Panhala. 4 Even i the sm2ll force that had joined Sambhyji in luis foolish Icbellion the cavalry formedthe mninority, for, when the prodigal son returned to his fathcr' $ castle at Panhala, he was accompanicd, according to 211 English report, by 300 horse and 1,000 foot 5 The infanty continucd to maintain its Inajority in the Maratha army even after Shivaji' s death, for in 1707 Dhanaji Jadhav, as we arc told by the Bundela chronicler, had under his command a strong infunntry force of 25,000, while his cavalry numbered $,000 only: 6 Ii the Peshwa period, however, the position Was Ievcrsed. The Marathas wcrc 10 longer compelled to dcfend their hearth and homc. Sccurc in their nativc territorics, were nOw in a position to carry war into enemy country, and in thesc distant tions, designed mainly for plunder, a cavalry force was far 1nOrc uscful than infantry: In a Portuguesc report; dated June 1787, thcrc- fore, wc read that the Peshwa could in the field 80,000 to IoO,OO horse, IO,ooo foot and 40 to So pieces of artillery:?

Till I750, therefore, the Maratha chiefs had employed in their army ad navy Europcan guuncrs, engineers ad" sailors, but in I7S1 Balaji Baji Rao realised the need of going a step further. In his war his hereditary encmy of Hyderabad he had suddenly found himself confronted with a ncw mcthod of warfare hitherto unknown to him. Bussy had carried the war into the Peshwa' $ own territories and penetratcd as far a$ Koregao. Balaji Baji Rao at once perceived that the superiority of the hostile army was not due entirely to their artillery, and the tactics of the French general were different from those known to his Indian opponents, although the men under his command had becn recruited in this country. The Peshwa adopted the time-honoured expedicnt of cxtracting a thorn with a thorn. He would gladly employ a European officer to face tbis new danger, but none, it appears, were available: He seriously thought of subsidising an English force, but the Govern- ment of Bombay was not in a position to lend any:? But if com- French and English officers were not available, there were Muhammadan adventurers with some knowledge and experience of the new methods to serve the Peshwa, and first Muzaffar Khan, and later Ibrahim Khan, entered the service of Balaji Baji Rao had both been trained by and were more or less familiar with his strategy and tactics, but could hardly be a5 fit substitutes for that general, and the Peshwa tried his best t0 induce him to leave Hyderabad for Poona. At one time the Peshwa felt sanguine about the ultimate success of his negotia- tions and in I756 he actually communicated to his Portuguese neighbours of Goa the happy news of the admission of Monsicur Bussy in his service: On 22 I756, he addressed two letters to the Governor and the Secretary of State: The concluding para- graph of the first letter runs 4s follows: 'In the company of Salabat Jang; who came to assist me; was M He left the said A Faithful Narrative % the Capture % the Ship Derby (bclonging to the Honourable the East India Company, Abraham Anselm Commander) by Angria the Pirate , p: III: Forrest, Selection from State Maratha Series, PP: Iz0-I. against Petent ready They Bussy they regarded May Bussy.

He had taken a pronnent part in the defence of that place the allied armies of the Peshwa &nd the Nizan: After the fall of Savnur he had been readnitted into the Peshwa'$ service in spite of the protest of Sada-. shiv Rao, but he plotted the life of that and was exe- cuted.

Thc conflict between the old ideas and thc new was pointedly brought homc to the Maratha leaders when Malhar Rao Holkar and oficers of the old school advocated the use of the traditional tactics (popularly called kava) against the heavily armed Afghan army, and Ibrahim Khan Gardi strenu- ously opposed their cqunsel He kncw that he and his men could not expect to pace with the light Meratha cavalry: In such an operation their artillery would be more of an cncumbrance than a1 advantage and the force would be easily annihilated by their Afghan opponents: He, there - fore, not only opposcd Holkar'$ suggestion but compelled its rejection by threats of opening his battery upon anybody who darcd to move away from the entrenched camp: For this obstinacy Ibrahim Khan with his life, but the irretrievable disaster streng- thcned thc conscrvative elcmnents in the Maratha army and became openly hostilc to the new-fangled ideas borrowcd from foreigners.

The Peshwa failed to scduce and could not secure the service of any othcr conpetent European oficer. Sindhia, howevcr, obtaincd in the person of De Boignc, an expert of ability and experiencc, trained in the best military schools of Europe, who had served under thc French and tlie Russian bcfore his arrival in India. It was necessity and not love of innovation that compelled Mahadaji to employ this Europcan vctcran for raising trained battalions for him. Mahadaji, ulikc the Peshwa, did not confine his ambition to pltn- raids, but hc wanted to establish His authority over the rcnant ofthe Mughal empire in Hindustan: This brought him into direct conflict with thc Rajput princes and thc Muhammadan gcne - rals who were still a sociatcd with the imperial Govemment or what remained of it To harass them in the open field was comparatively easy, and with reinforcement from Poona hc could cven beat their united army. but the prcdatory method of the Marathas had becn found useless in operations; and Mahadaji did not like to sharc his nCW conquests with the Government of Poona: The perinarent subjugation of the imperial territories, which Mahadaji aimedat, demanded the reduction of numerous forts and strongholds held by unfriendly chiefs and the annihilation of their armies in the open ficld. For such a work the service of infantry 'regiments trained in2 westcrn methods would be invaluable: He had witnessed thc splendid stand made by Ibrahim Khan and his at Panipat, and the achicveincnts of the small English army jnl the first Maratha war could not bul havc highly impressed him.

His nearest neighbour and rival, Holkar, was nOt in following his exanple, and appointed a French officer, Dud- rencc? , to conmand the trained battalions of his army_ Thc Poona Government enlisted sonlc white fficers for a similar purposc, although could not get a European of reputation before Boyd entercd thcir service. ? The growth of the army in Sindhia' $ scrvice was naturally slow: Mahadaji himself was fairly well convinced of its superiority, but he had to procccd with caution and circunspection. It is ncedless to say that his countrymen did not approve of his military policy, and the disastcr of Panipat apparently afforded considcrable justification for their prejudice: In I784 De Boigne was commission- ed to raise two battalions only. The two thousand men under his command formed an insignificant fraction of the immensc horde that fought at Lalsot and Chaksana. De Boigne did not as yet hold an independent command, but though the Maratha arny was beaten, the two battalions of De Boigne nlore than vindicatcd their employer' s confidence: When Sindhia's fortune was at low ebb, De Boigne left him, evidently because he was not content with 2 subordinate and the serv:ce did not offer any bright prospect in the immediate future But in 1790 he was recalled and asked to raise a brigade of ten battalions of infantry with a suitable comple- ment of cavalry ad artillery: The success of Patan and Merta led to the addition of a second brigade, and a third brigade was not Both Madec and Sombre wcre at one time in the scrvice of the Jat Raja; Madec had some guns manufactured under his supervision: Sce Emile Barbe, Le Nabab Rene Madec, P 30.

Evcn Jaswant Rao Holkar and Amir Khan, the two most unscrupulous military leaders of their time, had to bear the penaltics of this time-honoured custom with patience, though not forbearance.1 Encumbercd with innumerable women, tradesmcn, children and cattle, disturbed by the constant wrangling of debtors and creditors, without ordcr, without discipline as it was, the Maratha camp was not easy to surprisc.

It revealed the glaring defects of their nlitary and imperial organisa- tion that ultimately led to their overthrow. The contcst betwech the Marathas and the Afghans had becn long impending: Ahnad Abdali mnade his first invasion of India in I748. His first cxpedition proved a failure, but hcnccforth one party in the court of Delhi looked towards him for support, while the other prcferred 2 Maratha alliance Eventually, the Emperof, Almad Shah, came to an uderstanding with the Hindu power. The negotiation On the Maratha sidc was conducted by Malhar Rao Holkar and Jayappa Sindhia, and the Emperor granted the chauth of Thatta, Multan, the Punjab, Rajputana and Rohilkhand to the Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao,l who in his turm) undertook to dcfend thc Emperor his cncmics and disloyal subjccts, among whom arc spccifically mcntioned Abdali, the Rohillas, the Rajputs and the Amirs of Sind. The documcnt ufortunately bcars n0 date but probably this agrcemcnt had bccn concluded sometime about I7s0. The Peshwa had, thcrefore, ncarly tcn years for completing his military and diplomatic arrangements beforc his cousin met his Afghan rival OIl the fatal ficld of Panipat: According to thcir agrecment, thc Marathas madc a cxpcdition the Rohilla chiefs, and it was at the instancc of the latter that Abdali madc his second expedition to India, which resulted in the conquest of the Punjab. The Rohillas were hardly a match for the Marathas But, while common danger ccmented a union among the threatencd Muhammadan chiefs, the Marathas failed to pursue a common plen, for were more anxious to secure their personal ends than to serve the common interests of the empire: Sindhia and Hokkar, the two principal chiefs who were expected to look after the Maratha interests i the North, did not always agrec; Hingne; the diplomatic agent stationed at Delhi, had no confidence in his military colleaguc Antaji Mankeshwar; and the military force employed' in Hindustan was not always adequate; Rajwade, Marathyanchya Itihasachin Sadhanen, Vol. [, Pp: I-IO. they rcspite proved they guisc profit against against they THE THIRD BATTLE OF PANIPAT AND ITS LBSSONS I43 the Peshwa, above all, his officers to turn the channel of the stream from the North to the South: The result was that the Marathas made many encmies, had given offencc to the Rajputs, Jats, Rohillas and other Muhammadan chiefs by their financial demands, but their military expeditions were too short and the party strife in their council was too strong and thcir policy consequently was too to infict a crushing blow upon ay of their cnemics. Raghoba' s first expedition to Hindustan in 1753 did not improve matters. Sindhia opposed Holkar's resolution of exterminating thcJats; the Raja of Jodhpur W4s sccretly cncouraged by Holkar in his war Sindhia; and Raghoba had not the satisfaction ofbringing his brothcr the mnuch necded financial relief. But this was not all. In June 1754, Emperor Ahmad Shah was deposed and Mir Shahabuddin obtaincd the exaltcd office of the Vizicr of thc Empire with the help ofhis Maratha friends: The rcsult was that other at Delhi wcre alicnated from the Marathas, and the new Vizicr soon gavc thc powerful Afghan monarch a just cause for entering India for a third time by his inter - fcrence i1 the affairs of the Punjab. Among the Maratha officers employed in Hindustan nOne understood the situation bctter than Govind Pant Bundelc In February I75$, he addresscd a letter to the Peshwa explaining thc unsatisfactory political condition thcn existing and suggesting the necessary measure. He told the Peshwa plainly that force of at least 20,600 well trained and well disciplined men who were not given to plunder should be permanently stationcd in Northern India for safeguarding the Maratha interests and securing the Maratha possessions thcre: He plainly told that the force under him was not at all adequate and, in view of the impending retum of Raghoba to the Dcccan, he the necessity of scnding a strong army:1 About four years carlier Bapuji Mahadev Hingne had requested his brother to explain the necessity of posting a strong force at Delhi, for the Maratha cause was by no means popular there But all these warnings from the men on the spot went Itihas Sangraha, Aitihasik Tipnen, Pt.

Sindhia was still engaged in a protractcd War the de facto Raja of Jodhpur. This offered Abdali and his Idian friends an excellent opportunity of which did not fail to take an early and advantage. Hc cntered India at the head of a well appointed army of veterans and literally swcpt cverything before hin. The small Maratha army was easily to flight, Delhi Was occupicd by the Afghan and Rohilla troops and thc reccnt political arrangemcnts were entirely sct aside: Thc Peshwa sent his brother to mect the new and if hc had promptly procecded to the war-Z0ne, Raghoba might have cncountcrcd the Afghan army before it left India But he allowed himself to be divertedwith some moncy-raising cxpeditions in) Rajputana and lost the opportunity of overtaking a war-wom cnemy not a little fatigued by his movements in the unaccustomed heat of an Indjan sunimer. When Abdali had left and there was no formidablc opponent to Raghoba and Malhar Rao Holkar entered Delhi and inflicted a sevcre defeat upon thc Rohillas. But Raghoba committed thc mistake of extending his clemency to thc defeated Rohilla leader who was the staunchest supporter of Abdali in India and therefore the most irreconcilable enemy that the Marathas had.. Then he went to the Punjab, drove Abdali' $ agent from that provincc and planted the ochre-coloured banner of the Maratha empire on the banks of the Indus Here Raghoba lost an excellent opportunity: While on the banks of the Indus, he obtained an autograph letter ftom thc Shah of Persia proposing an alliance the common enemy_ Raghoba took it lightly: He undcrestimated the strength o his enemy and talked of the conquest of Kabul and Kandahar, as had once formed an integral part of the Mughal empire: But if he had been seriously thinking of fuuther conqucst and annexation, it is difficult to understand why a strong Maratha force was not permancntly posted on the natural frontiers of India.

When Raghoba left Hindustan, an cnormously heavy task was imposcd upon Sindhia. He had to look after the extensive region from Lahore to Muttra and he was further expected to lead an ex- pedition to Bengal, not for any political purpose but to rclicve the financial difficulties of the Peshwa It was expected that Holkar would co-operate with him, but a5 early as I756 Govind Pant Bundele had informed Sadashiv Rao that the prevailing difference between the two chiefs rendered any concerted action impossible, and thc situation dcmanded thc prcsence of both thc Peshwa and Sadashiv Rao at Delhi.1 As before, no nolice Seems to havc been taken of this warning: In 1759 Ahmad Shah Abdali came to India for the fourth time As usual hc was confronted by a hopelessly inferior force: Dattaji Sindhia had allowed himself to be duped by the friendly professions of Najib Khan, and, when he was at last undeceived, lack of boats preventcd him from crossing thc Yamuna ad punishing the per- fidious Rohilla. The appearance of Ahmad Shah at once turned the scales him. Loath to leave his post, he wrote to Holkar for speedy reinforcements. The joint army of the two chiefs might probably have yet stemmcd the tide of Afghan success, but Holkar, as usual, allowed himself to be engaged a Rajput chief; while the fate of his race was decided On the banks of the Yamuna. Dattaji rashly faced a superior Afghan army and for his with his life: His nephew, the legitimate hcad of his family, was woundcd and his army was totally routed Then Holkar tried the traditional harassing tactics ofhis race the formidable Afghan but in vain: The Afghans were mountaincers Rajwade, Marathyanchya Itihasachin Sadhanen, Vol. III, No. 149, Pp 137-8. 10 rainy against against being paid daring against cavalry, hardy I46 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS and, unlike the Mughals of the Deccan, could 10vc swiftly when wanted.

In July the Maratha army captured Delhi;, the Afghans had encampcd 0n the opposite bank but Wcre forced to witness the fall of the imperial without ablc to help their comrades: From Delhi Sadashiv Rao procecded to Kujapura ad reduced that place. Hitherto he had not becn guilty of any tactical blunder: He Was perfectly right in rcducing all thc Afghan stations on his side of thc river and trying to cut off the enemy s retreat; but n0 gcncral can be pardoned for omitting to provide for his Own in casc of an unforeseen defeat: The greatest blunder that Sadashiv Rao connitted at this stage was thathe didnot adequately the fords.

Sadashiv Rao was encumbcrcd with a crowd of non-combatants, and worsc still the presence of s0 many ladies of noble birth immensely added to his cmbarrassmcnt. His army was hardly competent to carry 0 those harassing tactics, the succcss of which depended entirely 01 He was, thercfore, right in rejecting Holkar' $ suggestion and his decision was further justified by the failure of such tactics in the late campaign. But it is difficult to Wlderstand he did not try to fall back o Delhi even at the risk of 2 battle and reopen his communication with his base of operation and his far-off native province: Instead of that he entrcnched himself strongly at Panipat: In his fortified camp defended by a ditch and a strong mud wall with mounted cannons he could easily beat off any attack of Abdali: Andit was his plan to compel his encmies to fight the Maratha army on its own ground. Govind Pant Bundele was expected to devastatc the territories of thc allied with a Aying corps of Maratha cavalry, cut offthcir supplies and drive Abdali to meet his destruction at Panipat: The plan looked wcil on paper, but its success dcpended mainly on the operations cntrusted to Govind Pant Bundele This officer, howevcr, had ncither the ability nor the mcans, as G.

Sadashiv Rao had attempted the combination of two fundamnentally opposite methods, and the result was disastrous. Wc necd not mention here the skirmishes that at different times took place betwccn differcnt companies of the two armies: From the middle of November the Marathas had begun to feel the want of foodand provender, but still their commander persisted in his policy of 'starving his cnemy, blindly ignorig the fact that his encmy had much better facilitics for procuring supplies than hc could have; unlcss and unti] hc succecded in reopening his communications with Delhi. Withthe first signs offamine in his camp Sadashiv Rao ought to havc attcmpted to forcc his way back to Delhi; but, aftcr Govind Pant Bundele s death in the third week of December, hc had no cxcuse for persisting in his original plan. Abdali could no longer be driven into thc snare laid for him. It was no longer possible to cut off his supplies, 011 tle other hand, it became increasingly difficult for the Marathas to send out their foraging Stillthe Brahman general'$ confidencc did not forsake him and evcn in the face of famine he persisted in the way of ccrtain destruction and ruin. He kncw well that peace on honourabletenanswasno longer possible, and Kasiraj Pandit tells us that Najib Khan was now oppos- ed to peace on any terms. He knew that thc Marathas were now completely at the mercy of the allied army; he knew that he had given them repeated offence and he dared not let them escape from their self-contrived annihilation: At last the Marathas could no longer bear the pangs of hunger: days days parties. quite ISO MILITARY SYSTEM OP THE MARATHAS Animals began to die in numbers, the privations suffered by men were enormous and couldno longer wait in their fortified camp: At this crisis it appcars that Sadashiv Rao did not possess the coolness and patience that the situation demanded. He resolved to fight, but cven at the last moment it was his to dircct the battle rather than throw himself desperately among his enemies: It was his to think out a fairly plan of battle, but at the last moment he wavcrcd. It was decided, if we are to rely on a contemporary chronicle, on the night previous that the army should form a hollow square, with the women in the centre, and with the help of the artillery try to cut its way through the hostile ranks.1 But on the following moming this plan was suddenly abandoned and the whole army was (rdered to fall upon the Muslim force: The Marathas advanced with thcir artillery in front On their left marched the trained infantry of Ibrahim Khan, on their right Iode the cavalry of Sindhia ad Holkar, while Sadashv Rao in person led the centre. No reserve wasleft,no strategy was tried, the artillery played no important part in this nomentous battle, the contest was decided by & close hand to hand fight, and supcrior man-powcr ultimately triumphed Ibrahin Khan Gardi was resolvcd to give a account of himself and his battalion. Hc took 2 banncr in his own hands and led a resolute bayonet against the Rohilla divisions of Hafiz Rahamat Khan &nd Dundi Khan: The Rohillas were utterly routed and broken, eight thousand of thcm were killed and wounded and hardly one thousand were left with each chicf: At thc samc time the Maratha centre led by Sadashiv Rao and Viswas Rao fell on the Afghan centre where thc Grand Vizicr commandcd a conpact of tcn thousand horse, seven thousand Persian musketeers and one thousand camels mounted with Zamburaks.

The Marathas fought with the courage of despcration and for a moment the Afghans lost hcart. But were led by a consumnate gencral.

The wester coast of India had from tiine immemorial been inhabited by an int trepid race of seafurers, but no evidcncc can be found to support the view that any attempt had bcen made in the past to cstablish a navalpower. Though the Yadava Kingdom, for examplc, had stretched right up to the scaboard, the ambition of the Devgiri princes seens to havc been land-bound; did not aspirc to rule the waves. Shivaji may, thercforc, be justly describcd as the fathcr of the Maratha navy: Thc English factors in thcir wrath called him a fobber and a pirate;! but he was in rcality trying to create a ncw sca power; and it was not his fault that thc Maratha fleet did not ride the sca with as much confidence a5 thc Maratha horse scoured the land.

Neither Shivaji nor his successors evcr accomplishcd the conquest of Janjira. The island of Bombay played a1 important and part in this struggle: year the Sidi's fect camc to wintcr at Bombay: Thcrc wcre provisioned and rcfreshed.

Shivaji protested and so did the English authorities, as cntirely depended on Shivaji' $ country for their fuel and food. The Maratha rightly complaincd that the English wcrC guilty of 2 violation of ncutrality whcn allowed the Sidi to make use of thcir port; He also complaincd that the provisions obtaincd from his country werc diverted to the benefit of his cneinies.

The most important clausc of the trcaty was the fifth which obliged the English not to permit forcign or vcsscls to fly thcir colours.1 It was the interpreration of this last term which led to hostilities a few ycars later betwcen Kanhoji and the English: In his treaty, or more accurately his agreemcnt, with Shahu; Kanhoji showed wisdom and modcration. Recognising that his strength mainly in the sca, hc relinquished his Ieccnt conquests 01 thc mnainland.

This was, however, not the only source of dissatisfaction. In 1715 Kanhoji complaincd to Governor Boone 'of ill usage in return for the offices he had done' while in March 1716 Boone wrote to his masters at home that he was not pressing the outstanding claims against Angria 'as werc not in a posture to Opposc him'.1 He was temporising in expectation of a suitable opportunity of vindicating English claims. The matter was eventually brought to 2 head by Kanhoji's capture of three in succession and his forcible appropriation of some timber from one of the Company' $ vessels: The first that Angria captured was the Success The English contended that it belonged to their broker Govardhan Das and was therefore an English ship. As the Bombay authorities were still unable and uwilingto break with Kanhoji; the President permitted the broker to try private negotiation; and it was ultimately settled that the should be returned in exchange for some prescnts.

Kanhoji was un to this demand, which would have meant financial loss to him. Five ycars earlier he might have becn more compliant, but his treaty with Shahu had strengthened his position On thc mainland, and his victory over the Sidi and the Portuguese had added to his con- fidencc, while the English had suffered & loss of prestige after the iL success of the Carwar expedition in I717.

After 2 sevcre cannonade a landing was cffected but no more than persons could be induced to volunteer for an assault. The assault made by such a small party naturally failed, though the failure was attributed to the treachery of Ramji Kamathi, a Hindu inhabitant of Bombay: He was accused of carrying on trcasonable correspondence with Angria and was condemned, though without sufficient evi- dence, to life imprisonment, while his property was confis- cated: From Kcnery the fect sailed to Kolaba and bombarded the placc at intcrvals, without however effecting any apprcciable loss, and then left for Ghcria.

With his demise the most successful of Maratha naval history came to 2 close. Sekhoji was succceded by hs brother Sambhaji, aI intrcpid but short-tempered seaman, who did not possess the wisdom and diplomatic qualities of his fathcr and eldef brothcr: He permitted himself to be involved in simultancous hostilities with the English and the Portuguese. His rclations with the Peshwa wcre most ufriendly and hc could not cvcn dcpcnd upon thc loyal allegiance of his father' $ army and navY, his authority bcing successfully contested by a half-brother, Manaji. This domestic disscnsion ultimately led to the ruin of the Angria'$ power: This fraternal strife commenced in 1734 within twelve months of Sckhoji' $ death Apparently, Sambhaji was to assign subordinate commands to his brothers as Sekhoji had done, and the reason of Manaji '$ defcction cannot be definitely stated, Anyhow, whilehis brother was fighting thc common cnemy, he took possession of Kolaba with the ofthe Portuguese and put out the cyes of Yesaji who had been left in of that fort.

Inferior 1s it was to the fighting flects of contemporary Eufope, Sambhaji Angria'$ nwvy enjoyed a great Icputation 0n the Malabar coast and was considercd an excellcnt school for naval treining: Both Ismail Khan, whom the Portuguese writers delighted to style a$ 'valoroso or valiant, and Apaji Gopal, thc Commander-in-Chief of Gaikwad's flcet, who had cared the cncomiumns ofhis Portuguese opponents by his intrepedity and skill, their naval career in Sambhaji' $ service.l But the Maratha navy was like a clild of arrested growth. It progressed satisfactorily Up to a ccrtain stage and then further improvements stopped. Sambhaji's death failed to rcstore wity in the Angria fanly: Tulaji succceded his brothcr in the principality of Suvamnadurg, while Manaji continued to rulc at Kolaba, and the breach between the two brotlcrs was as wide as in Sanbhaji' S Manaji had becn vcry shabbily treatcd by the Peshwa, some of his forts were taken by Sadashiv Rao, and he bittcrly complained to Slahu of the ugracious trcatment meted out to him, but cvcn thc common antagonism to the Peshwa could not induce thc two brothcrs to forget their family feud and offer uited opposition to deliberate aggression from Poona. On the other hand, Manaji was openly jealous of his youngcr brother and claimed that; as thc elder of the two, he should be honoured with his father' s title of Sarkhel. Shalu scems to have hinted that this honour could only be eamed by some distinguished deed of valour, and Tulaji proceeded to prove his superior ability by cpturing Arjanvcl.

After this he scems to have attemptedd to cultivate the fricndship of the Portugucse: The Marquis of Alorna writes that Manaji had always solicited his friendship and, since his arrival in India, he had received repcated offers of co-operation from Manaji Balaji Baji Rao.2 Tulaji also was aware of the that the Peshwa had hin; but; like his brother Sambhaji, he was no diplomat: Although tentative proposals for peace were made by hin from timc to time, no systematic O1 serious cffort was made to compose his differcnces with the Portuguese util 175S, when he found himself on the brink of ruin: In 1748 and 1749, Tulaji was at peace with the Governor of Goa; in the previous he had cven sent one Rudraji Dhulap to Goa to negotiate an alliance;8 but the resources at the disposal of the Viccroy were $0 very inadequate that he was forced to return 2 non-committal reply.

Only small rowing vessels were allowed free ingrcss and egress. Whcn other European nations came to India by the maritime route, the Portuguese attempted to shut them out of thc Indian trade by exercising the sovereignty of the sea, which claimed and which their Indian neighbours had to rcspect: In 1608 the ships of William Hawkins with their crew andcargo werescized and taken away by the Portugucse Captain Mor, and when Hawkins expostu - lated with a Portuguese officer, he was quictly told that thesc scas belonged unto the King of Portugal, and none ought to come here without his license The angry captain swore, fulminated and challenged his advcrsary, but to 10 cffect.8 Three years latcr, Sir Henry Middleton met with similar opposition ftom 2 Portuguese admiral.

The English had by similar means procured freedom ofnavigation for their own vessels and those belonging to their servants and subjects. In I713 Kanhoji Angria had undertaken not to molcst English but a controversy regarding thc status of vessels laden with English had led to a breach between the two powers The subject was, thcrcfore;, more clearly dealt with in I739, when a was concluded bctween Baji Rao I and the Government of Bombay: Article I of that treaty runs as follows: 'The English shall only issue passes to the Company' s vessels, the merchants Or servants, dependents, belonging to the island of Bombay, O other places where thcEnglish have settlement,and the English shall not interfere with Baji Rav's fcet, nor give convoy to vessels; save that if two Or three vessels should accidentally fall in company with the English, in such casc Baji Rav s feet shall not molest them.

The peculiar constitution of the feudal empire of the Marathas with 'its states within the state' led to 3 misconception of the political status of the Angria family particularly when were on un- fricndly terms with the Peshwa Thc inconsistencies resulting from the inalienable hereditary rights climed and exercised by each feudal family cused great confusion; and forcigncrs not familiar with such practices in their own country were naturally bewildered when found that Angriadid not respect the Peshwa' $ passports and the Peshwa'$ officers similarly took no noticc of any safeguard granted by Angria. This led themn to believe that Angria was nothing but a rcbel against his sovereign, and thc depredations which he committed on thc sea werc, therefore, regarded by them as acts of piracy.

The principal chiefs professed to serve the same mastcr and thc same State but; divided by personal jealousy, were scldom able to pursuc resolutely a concertcd plan or a coherent policy and common intcrests wcre frequently sacrificed to ends. The irregular cavalry was slow to mobilise and not generally available for prompt action or prolonged services in distant parts and the personnel of the army, therefore, had to be largely changed; the non-Maratha recruits who the Maratha horscmcn werc mercenaries of the worst type drawn by prospects of plunder and wcre not bound to thcir masters by racial O any other affinity: The policy of indiscriminate aggression for financial purposes initiated by Balaji 'From the century Denmark levied "Sound ducs" on foreign vessels passing through the strait, the Hanse traders and certain others exempt: In the I7th century quarrels arosc on this matter between Denmark and the Neherlands and Sweden, while in moder times the powers found the dues irksome, and in 1843 and 1853 protests were made by the representatives of the United States of America, but Denmark based her right on immemorial custom, and adhered to it: It was only from I April 1857, that Denmark consented to waivc this claim on receipt of a united compensation of 30,476,325 rix-dollars Or about La,ooo,ooo.

The great majority of these offcers were either English or French, and naturally sacrificed their masters' interests to those of their own and of their respective nations_ Thc craze for trained battalions of infantry led the Maratha chieftains to undercstimate the value of cavalry which had formed in the past the greatest source of their strength Cavalry was, there- fore, neglected and allowed to degenerate: The Marathas had been familiar with artillcry and firearms, but neglected to learn thescienceand technique of theseinvaluable weapons and continued till thcir final overthrow to rely for their supplies on the European settlements at Bombay and Goa. Nor was this all, the last decade of the cightecnth century found the Marathas without any able militaryleader, and it was no wonderthat the ill-led, ill-organised, ill-equipped and ill-disciplined hordes with irreconcilable methods of fighting wcre easily discomfited and routed by Wellington and Lake. The first stcp in the Wrong direction was the revival of feudalism. Shivaji knew the defects of Maratha character better than any of his predecessors OI successors, and he deliberately set himself to undo the evils of that disintegrating system: He found his country- men divided by mnutualjealousy andinherited rivakry andleft them fairly united under a ruler of their own race with a national banncr and a common object to strivefor. But his success was by no means complete: Even in his lifetime onc ofhis principal ministers, Niraji Raoji, served as an agent of the English East India Company at his court.1 Though the rivalry of Moro Trimbak Pingle and Annaji Datto did not find expression in any overt act of hostility while their great master was alive, lesser officials did not hesitate to let Sen, 'The English Procurator at Shivaji s Courl' , Calcutta Revicw, they large they long they May 1926. 232 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS colour their public acts When the Subhedar of Chaul quarrelled with the English of Bombay, seized theic and threatened to stop their supply of fuel and provisions from the mainland, his colleague, the Subhedar of Kalyan, encouraged the English by every means in his power and assured them of his friend- and support.1 It was, therefore, obviously necessary that the anti-feudal policy, so wisely initiated by Shivaji, should have been vigorously pursued by his succeSsors, but unluckily it was aban- doned by them. Feudalism was revived under unusual circumstanccs, first for the dcfence and later for the expansion of the Maratha kingdom, and it certainly served its immediatc purpose The Mughals were permanently from Maharashtra, and the Marathas soon afterwards penctrated into Gujarat and Malwa. But in the very prosperity of the Maratha empire the germs of its degeneration, decline and Whilc cngaged againsta power- ful external enemy, the Maratha generals could be cxpected to forget for the time their private differences, but hardly was that crisis over when recklessly prosecuted their quarrels, oblivious of everything clse. The Mughal hordes of A urangzib found them resolutely united, but the triumph of the Maratha cause was before marred by the ugly spectacle of Shantaji and Dhanaji engaged in a war of extermination: The crisis that culminated at Panipat rallicd the Maratha chiefs to the Peshwa' s banner; but the forces of disunion did not take to assert themselves, and Bhonsla and Gopal Rao Patwardhan openly ranged themselves with the Nizam, the hereditary enemy of the Maratha empire: The inexcusable insult offered to the Peshwa and Nana Fadnavis helped to bring together the principal chiefs at Kharda, but soon afterwards followcd suicidal civil war which offered the English an effective opportunity of firmly establishing thcir suzerainty in India. It is needless to say that their enemies always attempted to the dissension and disunion of the Maratha chiefs. That astute diplo- mat, Nizam-ul-Mulk, not only took advantage of the between Kolhapur ad Satara but further encouraged Trimbak Rao Dabhade to cross swords with the Peshwa Baji Rao.

It may appear strange thal in the light of their past cxperience the Maratha chiefs did not improvc their conduct; But feudalism is hardly conducive to and it helped to accentuate that selfish individualism which was rcsponsiblc for the political insignificance from which Shivaji had rescued them: As a matter of fact; were often aware of the evil conscquences of their selfish designs and yet persisted in their policy of self-aggrandisement, for national honour and welfare of the State were of little value to them: It is said that Malhar Rao Holkar had saved Najib Khan, an inveterate enemy of the Maralhas in Northern India, fromn imminent ruin because peacc would necessarily reduce his Own importance in the North: Raghoba feared that the English would make a puppet of him if he returned to Poona as their protege, for he had the significant example of Muhammad Ali before his eyes,1 yet he prcferred to Icmain under their protection. To him, as to many of his contcmporaries, his personal interests wcre of much greater 1mportance than national honour andnationalindepcndcnce, becausc the idea of nationality was yet unknown: It is on this account thal high officials of the Statc did not hesitate to serve as agents of= powers and openly Iecclve rewards for such scrvices as might render.

We have already scen how Holkar was with some unimportant operations in Rajputana, while Abdali was destroying Sindhia's army in detail. During the First Maratha War the fighting was invariably carried on in the Maratha territorics while those of the English were left undiscurbed. An invasion of Bengal from Nagpur was often talked of but never carried into cffect because the Bhonsl judged it in- expedient to take any vigorous stcp when his personal intcrests were not at stake: When the English were involved in a war with Hyder Ali and eager to have peace on honourable terms, the Mara- thas failed to bytheir difficulties, because there were differences in their own ranks and Mahadaji Sindhia wanted early peace: The Second Maratha Waragain found the great chiefs divided and dis- united; the English secured the moral advantage and the prestige of the Peshwa's support, and while Sindhia and Bhonsl were beatcn, Holkar still preferred to watch and wait, although the ultimate consequences of defcat were no longer obscure at that moment: Shivaji had urged racial unity on a religious basis He had attempted to suppress all separatist tendcncies by away with old feudal institutions. But new ideas persistent propaganda before are accepted and popularised Such propaganda was ably carried on by Ramdas in Shivaji $ time, but as Shivaji stands unique among his countrymen s0 docs Ramdas Neither of them foundable successors to carry on their work, and the idea ofnation- which might have one taken root in Maharashtra, died away in the uncongenial cnvironments of feudalism: When the Maratha empire expanded across the Narmada, became still worse. Thc first scttlers in Ccntral India had still some senti- mental tie with the Deccan, the hone of their childhood, but chiefs like Daulat Rao Sindhia and Jaswant Rao Holkar were Marathas by birth but not by breeding, and could not be expected to have that sentimental respcct for Poona or Satara which charac- terised Mahadaji Sindhia and Malhar Rao Holkar. The cleavage between the different parts of the empire thcrefore became wider and wider until it became impossible to bridge: When feudalism caused dissension between different principalities of the einpire, it could not have a different result within the busy profit doing require they day ality, things they CONCLUSION 235 principalities themselves When the hcad of a ruling family strove to improve his own fortune at the expense %f his lawful suzerain, it was futile to cxpect that his younger brothers and relatives should remain contented with their subordinate position. Internal dissension weakened the cmpire and family dissension weakened the chiefs. During the First Maratha War the Nagpur and Baroda families were suffering from fratricidal wars, while the main war itself was the outcome of the inordinate and selfish ambition of a junior member of the Peshwa family. On the eve of the Second Maratha War the widows of Mahadaji wcre at open war with Daulat Rao Sindhia, while Jaswant Rao and Kashi Rao Holkar were contending for the headship of the Holkar family and the person of the infant Khande Rao At the sane time the Southern Maratha country was sadly harasscd by a series of internecine wars, as Arthur Wellesley observes in one of his letters. Hc writes: 'In order, however, that the Commander-in-Chicf may form a judgment respecting what has been done, it will be necessary to inform him, that since the year 1800, when 1 was in this country before, it has been one continued contest for power and plunder between the different chiefs who have armies undcr their command; between the Putwurdun'$ (Purseran Bhow' $) family and Gocklah, in the countries bordering on the Toombuddra; Werdah, and Mal- poorba; between the Putwurdun and the Rajah of Kolapoor in those bordering on the Gutpurba and the Kistna; betwecn Bappojce Scindiah, the Killedar of Darwar, and the Rajah of Kittoor; between Gocklah and the Rajah of Kittoor; and Gocklah and Bappojee Scindiah; besides various others of inferior notc, either immcdiately employed under these, or for themselves under their protection. A state S0 divided and disunited was doomed to destruction; and the Peshwas never made any serious effort to save it. Their own example of coalescing with a foreign power Tulaji Angria was fraught with thc worst consequcnces Dissension and disunion were not the only evils for which the Marathas were indebted to their love of feudalism: At the most critical period ofits history the Maratha empire found itself without an able statesman who could put its undoubtedly great resources Gurwood, Dispatches of Wellington , Vol. I, p: 124. long being against 236 MILITARY SYSTEM OP THB MARATHAS to the best use; as Sir Thomas Munro explained to the Govcmor- General: It is not that want resources, that have not men and horses; but that there is no one amongst them possessed of those superior talent which are necessary to dircct them to advantage' 1 This lamcntable dearth of talent must be ascribed to the feudal organisation of the empire, which confined the princi- civil and military officcs of the State to a few families with inalienable hereditary claims. No family can produce great men forcver, and the dircction of the Maratha empire inevitably into weak and inefficienthands in course of time. Shahu wasthe last member ofthez family who couldclaim to possess even average abilities. The Peshwa family was more fortunate; in the senior branch it produced four generations of able men; Sindhias wcrc blessed with three generations of soldiers in the eldest line; but Malhar Rao had no such luck; and he did not stand alone in this misfortune Baba Fadke could hardly be callcd the worthy son of a worthy father, and if thc Bhanus had produced a Nana, were responsible for a Moraba at the same time. In I800 the Peshwa' $ musnad was occupied by 3 weak intriguer who has rightly been described as the 'offspring of the weakness of Raghu- nath Rao and the wickedness of Anandi Bai the vast resources of the Sindhia' s dominions were at the disposal of Dault Rao, who was equally devoid of military ability and political foresight; Raghuji Bhonsl, who ruled at Nagpur, had inherited only the name of his grandfather, but he did not possess even thc physical courage for which the Marathas were noted; Jaswant Rao Holkar was fully endowed with the warlike qualitics of his family, but he was nothing better than a military adventurer, cruel, licentious and unscrupulous Thcse WCIC the men in whose hands rcsted the fate of the Maratha empire, because military and civil officcs had been made hereditary in opposition to the principles and practice of Shivaji.

'Thc number of horsemen he wrote, who depend for their livelihood solely on military service is very small; it probably does not exceed the pro- portion ofone-tcnth of the whole horsemen usually employed under the southern jagheerdars. 1 This explains military traditions in Maharashtra diedso quickly,for which Field Marshal Earl Roberts felt justificd in clssing the Marathas with the people of Bengal and Madras as a non-martial race.

Of the traditional rivalry between France and Englandit was impossible to be ignorant, but did not know anything about the constitution of those countries, about their social, political and educational institutions, about their gcographical situation, and moral and material progress. The hatmen (topikav) , as the Europeans were called, were reputed to be sailors, soldiersand very obstinate (hatti) ; and obstinacy perhaps satisfactorily explained that sense of patriotism which the Marathas (like oher Indians) did not at that time understand. Foreigners from all parts of Europe and Asia had been readily admitted to the scrvices of the State by Muhammadan princes before the rise of the Maratha power, and adventurcrs from Persia and Central Asia not only supplicd loyal servants but formed the principal support of the Mughal Government in India. The Portuguese soldiers, who were the first Europeans to seek servicein the Indian States, seldom hcsi- tatcd to fight thc State of thcir origin on behalf of theic employers; some French deserters werc found in the English service and instances of Englishmen in French employ, though rarc, were not unknown: Maratha chiefs in the Nizam S servicc identified themsclves, as much as possible, with their master' $ causc and took a prominent part in his wars thc Maratha empire: Sindhia; Holkar and other Maratha chiefs, therefore, argued that could expect as much loyalty and devotion from French and English adventurcrs as from their Sikh, Rajput, Arab, Sindhi Or Gossain soldiers Thc European officers came in search f fortunc and obtained from their Maratha employers pay and rich jahgirs; some of them marricd in the country (both De Boigne and Gcorge Thomas had Indian wives), and their masters probably expected that like the Persian and Tartar immigrants of Mughal these foreigners would also permanently settle in the country and the rest of their lives in the service of those who treated them so well and generously. In this expectation, if it was ever entertained, were sadly disappointed; not only the English subjects in Sindhia' sarmy but the great majority of French officers also acccpted the Governor-General' $ offer and deserted Daulat Rao when their services were needed most; while Pohlman, a German who was they - good good against against they good days spend they CONCLUSION 239 present at Assaye, behaved so despicably that Sir John Fortcscue fcels inclined to suspect disloyalty: The Marathas made a serious mistake in entrusting the defence of their empire to foreigners, and hcavily did pay for their mistake: The employment of European oficers involved a serious change in the Maratha army: Their method of fighting was fundamentally opposed to the Maratha military traditions. Whether those _ two opposite methods could be profitably combined remains : doubtful question, but it is unanimously that the Maratha military leaders never made a serious cffort to find a satisfactory solution, and both at Panipat and at Assaye their discomfiture was largely due to thcir attempts to reconcile their old tactics with those they had recently introduced in thcir army but had not assimilatcd. In the meantime their reliance on trained infantry had led them to neglect their cavalry, and two competent military critics like Sir Thomas Munro and Sir John Fortescue agree that the defeat of Assaye was due to the degeneration of Maratha cavalry: Sir Thomas Munro wrote to his brotherl on I2 February 1804: 1 calculated, at the opening of the campaign, two years for the com- plete conquest of all che possessions of Scindia and thc Berarnan. I thought thcir cavalry would have shown 2 little more enterprise; but ruined it and destroyed its by teaching the troopers that did not depend upon cavalry, but upon infantry: By coming forward with regular infantry, gave US every advantage we could desire. opposed to us men that never could be made So as OUI Own, from the want of a national spirit among the officers,and of the support of European battalions; and trusicd the success f the war to the cvent of closc engagements More credit has been given to the firmness of their infantry than it deserv- ed: seem to have made but little opposition, except during the short time our army was forming, and to have relied more upon their artillery than thcir musketry, as is proved by our horse suffered little loss, unless by round and grape-shot' Sir John Fortescue'$ criticism is not so detailed, but he is equally positive about the mistakes made by thc Marathas. 'Had Pohlman Ibid, Vol. I, PP: 3S4-5. they agrced they spirit, thcy they - They _ good they They fully having 240 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS done his duty,' he remarks, 'he might at least have embarrassed Wellesley greatly; and if the Mahratta cavalry had behaved with evcn a show of spirit, the issue would have becn certainly doubtful, and most probably disastrous to the British arms'1 The degeneration of cavalry was also due to the departure from Shivaji' s practice. Had thc Peshwas continucdto replace the Silhedar force by state-paid and state-equipped horse, thc efficiency o€ theit cavalry would certainly have bcen maintained. But thc Ievival of feudalism naturally encouragcd the cmployment of Silhedars, who were unwilling to risk their horses which formcdthcir_ sional capital.

Yet were not intellectually deficient; the failure, thercfore, must be attributed to defects in education. 1 Fortescue, History of British Vol: V, p. 32.

Fighting was more or less & matter of experience, andthe general cducetion that was thcn avail- ablc consisted wholly of cultural training in literaturc, grammat, politics, logic and philosophy. There was no treatise 01 the science of war, and if we except a singlc chronicle, that with thc campaign of Panipat; therc was no record ofthe military cxpcrience of the Maratha generals. An officer never rctired from service and had thcrefore no leisurc for writing about the theories and practice of war. His experience was, thercfore, lost to posterity and only his near relatives, who had the fortune of serving with him, could by his teaching, and these couldnot always be expected to supply thc best or the aptest pupils. The progress that Europe w2s making in the eighteenth century in thcoretical science was abso- lutely unknown to the Indians of that age, and no Maratha chicf cvcr attcmpted to mastcr the superior military and nautical science of the west as Pcter thc Grcat did, The Maratha officers began their military carcers too early, werc muchtoo ticd to thc tine-honoured system to learn anything new and generally died carly; if some of thcm had thc luck of attaining a ripe old agc, were too with their annual expeditions to lcave a written account of their campaigns, and their linited cducation hardly qualificd thcm for such work: At the same time the Maratha nobility hed lost the simplicity of life that characterised thcir ancestors of Shivaji's time: What was condemnedasan inexcusable viceby the founder ofthe Maratha kingdom was regarded as a necessity of life by his successors in the latter part of the cighteenth ccntury: When the Peshwa'$ agent Tukoji Holkar to prohibit the sale of alcohol in his he protested that alcohol was a necessity of life and soldiers could not 16 public private they They dealirg good profit good they busy urged camp, 242 MILITARY SYSTEM OF THE MARATHAS be expected to dispense with it.1 Shivaji never allowed whores and dancing wenches' in his army: Govind Pant Bundele had to scnd handsome dancing-girls from Hindustan for thc Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao.? The degeneration was thus all-round and com- plete. The State dcgenerated from a national monarchy to a feudal confederacy, the army degenerated from a well-disciplined national force to an ill-disciplined band of mercenaries, and the military leaders degcnerated ffom simple hardy soldiers to case-loving turies. There could be but one result of such a general-sided decline both moral and material. A military empire cannot survivc its military efficicncy and unfortunately for the Marathas their rivals were cndowed with those very qualities which themselves lacked Thc English were imnbued with a strong sense of patriotism, combined individual sclf-sacrifice with national anbition, their ariny was well-disciplined and scientifically trained, their gcnerals wcre masters of military science; and the badly lcd, badly armed and badly organised feudal army of the Maratha empire had to relinquish the unequal contest aftcr 3 bricf struggle. The Maratha chiefs were compelled to acknowlcdgc thcir failure after two short wars, the Peshwa was pensioned off, the Bargirs converted thcir sword-blades into ploughshares, peace was restored throughout the length and breadth of India and the Maratha empire became & far- off memory.

Agaskar ~': .v9 Preface In the annals of history we come across a few outstanding men and women whose life and work stand out as beacons to succeeding generations, summoning them to endeavour and achievement. One such person is Chhatrapati Shivaji, to whose memory a grateful nation paid reverential homage on the occasion of the tercentenary of his coronation. Though the times in which he lived were vastly different from our own, the values of personal integrity, patriotism, religious tolerance and public welfare which he cherished and promoted are very much valid even today. Public administrators have especially much to learn from this noble ruler of men, whom his guru Ramdas aptly described as “the high mountain of determination, the support of many people, unflinching in his ideals and rich in asceticism” : f^^ra^atT i ii Deeply rooted in the glorious traditions of India’s ancient past, Shivaji was nevertteless innovative, pragmatic and even modern in his outlook and in his plans. He borrowed his administrative ideas from the ancient Indian writers on polity as well as from the contemporary practitioners of the art o government. But his practical statesmanship and constructive genius lay in the manner in which he successfully blended tradition with modernity and devised a novel system of administration suited to his times and his people. In this syster%the pivot was the king himself who ruled as well as reigned. He was the supreme executive, the supreme law maker and even the supreme judge. Being all in all, the ancient Indian aphorism that the king is the moulder of his age ('CT«IT fitted him like a glove. At the same time, he was a great upholder of Dharma in the most noble sense of that expression; and the weal of the common people, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, was the mainspring of all his actions. He threw careers open to talent and held his umbrella of protection and patronage over all his subjects alike. In an age of bigotry and ruthlessness Shivaji radiated tolerance and compassicm; and even today, after three vi centuries, we are struck by the width of his outlook and the breadth of his vision. Jadunath Sarkar rightly described him as “the greatest constructive genius of medieval India” and says that the memory of men like him reiriains “an imperishable his- torical legacy for the entire human race to animate the heart, to kindle the imagination and to inspire the brain of succeeding ages to highest endeavours”. As a part of the Coronation Tercentenary celebrations, the Maharashtra Regional Branch of the Indian Institute of Public Administration organised a series of lectures dealing with various facts of the many-splendoured achievements of Shivaji. These lectures, which were delivered by well-known scholars, attracted large audiences and were extremely well received. A suggestion was made to us that the lectures should be published in the form of a book so that a wider readership could benefit from it. We readily agreed; and the outcome is this slim volume which we are now placing in the hands of our readers. Appropriately, these lectures commence with a masterly survey of the life and times of Shivaji by Shri Setu Madhava Rao Pagadi, whose biography of the Chhatrapati released at Raigad on the tercentenary of the Coronation is a very valuable and a most recent contribution to the literature on the subject. Des- cribing Shivaji’s career as “an extraordinary story of expand- ing visions”, Shri Pagadi observes : “It was not as if he saw a vision in early childhood and then struggled for its attainment throughout his life. I believe that as he took one step, the next step became c^ear to him, and so he progressed, defeating the Jagirdars, securing the forts, annexing the Adilshahi territories, raiding the Mughal provinces and finally proclaiming himself Chhatrapati.... The seed which he planted in the soil of Maharashtra eventually grew into a huge banyan tree with branches sprawling far and wide; and within less than a century the Maratha influence was felt throu^out the length and breadth of this vast country”. Next in this series is a lucid paper by Shri J. V. Naik of the Department of History, University of Bombay. Shri Naik expounds the idea that “the foundation of Swarajya was a com- posite movement caused by the interaction of various forces which had long been at work in Maharashtra. But it was left to the supreme genius of Shivaji to canalize all the available forces into one patriotic current and to establish an independent Maratha nation-State”. Of special interest is the section in which Shri Naik explains what Shivaji owed to his father Shaliaji in the establishment of Swarajya, Shri S. R. Tikekar, well-known journalist and historian, narrates the story and significance of Shivaji’s Coronation which was performed “in full accordance with similar ceremonies as described in the Ramayana or the Mahabharat”. It symbolised “an act of deliverance, bringing great hope and cheer”, and Tikekar compliments both Gaga Bhatt and Shivaji for this epoch-making event. . ^ ; Dr. C. M. Kulkarni, who heads the Department of History at the University of Bombay, has contributed an erudite paper on the ideals and institutions of Swarajya. Describing Shivaji as “an untiring carrier-forward of the torch of the immortal values and traditions of our ancient heritage”. Dr. Kulkarni explains how the Swarajya was “the dharmarajya well organised with saptanga, all the seven limbs functioning efficiently and harmoniously towards the realisation of the ideal of the maxi- mum welfare of the subjects”. The concluding lecture by Dr. M. S. Agaskar deals with the place of Swarajya in Indian History. After delineating the cardinal principles of the new social and political order established by Shivaji, Dr. Agaskar observes that the departure from these principles in later Maratha history “broke up its organised unity and ultimately led to its dismemberment and dissolution”. We owe a deep debt of gratitude to our learned guest-speakers for the time and talent bestowed by them on these lectures. The brunt of the responsibility for the organisation of the lectures fell on Shri D. K. Kulkarni, Research Officer, of the Maharashtra Regional Branch of the Indian Institute of Public Administration. I would like to place on record the gratitude of the Institute to Shri Kulkarni and my deep appreciation of his excellent viii performance. We are also beholden to the Government of Maharashtra for readily coming to our help with a grant of Rs. 3,000/- towards the expenses of publication of this book. Last, but not the least, our thanks are due to M/s. Orient Longman for the elegance of this publication and for the promptitude with which it was produced. Our own efforts we shall consider amply rewarded, if students, teachers and general readers find this book interesting and useful. V. Subramanian Honorary Secretary 141, Sachivalaya, Indian Institute of Public Administration Bombay 400 032 Maharashtra Regional Branch Tbe Life and Times of Chfaatrapati Siiivaji Maharaj SETU MADHAVA RAO PAGADI I ' ' There are a nitmber of people in our country who have mental reservations about the importance of the study of Shivaji and the Marathas for a general student of Indian history. There is indeed a school of thought which takes a dim view of Shivaji’s achieve- ments in an all-India context. He is looked upon as the leader of a particular community and of a small region. Like Rana Pratap he is credited with heroism and gallantry; but it is urged that he was going against the main current of Indian history which was in favour of the hegemony of a single central power controlling the destinies of the country from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. While Ashoka, Akbar and Aurangzeb (and later the British) strove to establish an Indian empire, Shivaji, it is said, attempted to reverse that tide. But Shivaji initiated a movement, and to appreciate the wide ramifications of that movement, we must view the Maratha period of Indian history as a whole. In the 17th century, the Mughal empire covered a major portion of India from the province of Kabul in the north to Trichinopoly in the south; from Gujarat in the west to the very outskirts of Assam in the east. The writ of the Mughal emperor ran in every part of the country. But in 1719, within twelve years of the mighty Aurangzeb’s death, the Maratha militia entered Delhi and marched in the main thoroughfares of the Mughal capital. By 1740 the Marathas held sway over Malwa and Bundelkhand; in 1751 they overran Orissa and levied chauth on Bengal and Bihar; in 1757 they captured Ahmedabad, the capital of Gujarat, and in 1758 we find them subjugating the Pimjab and planting the Maratha banner on the fort of Attock; * The stories of the successive tri- umphs of Maratha arms read like romantic tales from the Arabian Nights; but they are neveithele^s true. The Marathas took upon 2 SHTVAn AND SWARAJYA themselves the responsibility of fitting the foreign foes. They liberated North Konkan from the occupation of the Portuguese, and laid down their lives on the battle-field of Panipat to drive out the raiders from Afghanistan. In 1784 the Mughal Emperor himself came under the protection of Mahadaji Shinde, and from 1784 to 1803 the Maratha flag fluttered prou^y on the ramparts of Delhi’s Red Fort. As Forrest observes, it was only with the battle of Assai in 1803 that the supremacy over India passed to the British. If Shivaji had not been born, and if the Maratha revolution had not swept away the debris of the Mughal empire in the 18th century, the course of Indian history would probably have run on different and disastrous lines. The European traders would perhaps have parcelled out ixwrtions of India among them- selves a hundred years earlier. It was Shivaji who gave the Marathas supreme self-confidence and inspired successive generations to deeds of courage and valour. Yet he has been the victim of much misinformed and biased writing. He has been described as a petty chieftain and a rebel against the established order, and also as a champion of Hindu India, bitterly anti-Muslim. It is therefore necessary that we should clear these misunderstandings and arrive at a proper estimate of Shivaji’s role in Indian history. The number of books written on Napoleon in all languages together runs into several thousands. As against this, I could count only 46 biographies of Shivaji. Amongst the biographies in English are those written by Chintamanrao Vaidya, Jadunath Sarkar, Bal Kjishna, H. G. Rawlinson, Dennis Kincaid, V. B. Kulkarni and D. F. Karaka. In Marathi we have the works of G. S. Sardesai, K. A. Keluskar. V. K. Bhave, D. V. Kale, B. M. Purandare, T. S. ShejwaUcar and V. S. Bendre. There is still scope for further research and for bringing out a comprehensive biography of Shivaji, as a considerable amount of contemporary source material is now available for that purpose in the Marathi, Sanskrit, Hindi, Persian, English, Portuguese, French and Dutch languages. In Marathi we have the Bakhar literature. An outstanding specimen of it is the Sabhasad Bcdzhar, written by Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad within about 15 years of Shivaji’s death. The 91-Qalmi Bakhar and the Chitnis Bakhar, however, are later works. The THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ ‘3 family of Kanhoji Jedhe has left behind the Jedhe Karina and the Shakavali, which is a chronology of events of Shivaji’s times written by his contemporaries. Shivaji’s court poet Paramanand wrote a biography of his patron and master in Sanskrit, entitled Shivabharat. It yields considerable material of rich historical value. Jayaram Pindye’s Parnala Parvata Grahanakhyanam which gives an account of the capture of Panhala by Shivaji in 1673 and another work, Shivaraja Rajyabhisheka Kalpataru, which describes the coronation of Shivaji, are two other contemporary works in Sanskrit which deserve our study. The Raja Vyavahara Kosh, or the Deccani-Sanskrit glossary of administrative terms compiled by Raghunath Pant at the instance of Shivaji, throws light on the civil and military esta- blishments of Shivaji. The Jaipur State Archives have yielded valuable source material about Shivaji’s visit to Agra in the form of letters written by Rajput Officers in the Dingal dialect, which is the Rajasthani variety of Hindi. These letters, which have been edited by Prof. Jadunath Sarkar and Dr. Raghubir Singh, faithfully report the day-to-day news from the imperial capital during the period that Shivaji was incarcerated there. ' In comparison with any other language, the wealth of source material available in Persian for a study of Shivaji’s times is indeed vast; and any student of Maratha history would be well-advised to learn Persian in sheer self-interest. Among the works compiled by Shivaji’s contemporaries at the Court of Ali Adilshah of Bijapur are Nurulla’s Tarikh-i-Ali and Nusrati’s AJimma which give an account (the latter in Deccani Hindi or Urdu) of the various battles fought by Shivaji. Muhammad Kazim, the official biographer of Emperor Aurangzeb, has written a book of 1500 pages entitled AJamgir-nama, in which he has given a detailed history of the first ten years of Aurangzeb’s reign. But the draft of the book had to be submitted for approval to the Emperor, who read every line of it. Consequently, all those episodes which ended in disgrace to the Mughals have either been conveniently left out of the des- cription Or considerably underplayed in this book. Tie sack of Surat has not been mentioned at all and the Shaista KJiUn cam- paign has been dismissed te'' three wcwrds—^‘MamJa ua bast’. Muhammad Kazfm tells lis’thfet Shaista Khan’s campaign a^inst 4 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Shivaji did not quite succeed; hence Aurangzeb decided to send Mirza Raja Jai Sin^ in his place. And that is about all 1 An important history in Persian is Saqi Mustaid Khan’s Masir- i-AIamgiri.yfbich. was completed within a year of Aurangzeb’s death. . Bhimsen Saksena’s Jarikh-i~Dilkusha and Khali Khan’s Muntakhab-ul-Lid>ab are also valuable works, as the authors lived in the Deccan during Aurangzeb’s times. Some allowance has, of course, to be made for the anti-Shivaji bias of writers like Mu- hammad Kazim, Saqi Mustaid Khan and Khafi Khan just as we must take cognisance of the fact that the authors of contemporary Marathi and Sanskrit works were dazzled by the achievements of Shivaji and credit him with supernatural powers and feats. Another important source of information in Persian is the Akhbarat or court newsletters which are available in a copious stream, and have fortunately been preserved at Bikaner in the Jaipur State Archives. We also have several important letters written by historical personages. About 200 letters issued from Shivaji’s Secretariat have been^foimd, and’nearly 50 of them, which carry the legend ‘Ajrakhtkhane Shivaji Raje’, were written prior to his coronation. A mass of English records is available in the archives of the Bombay Secretariat, which has about 12 lakh files covering the history of the last 300 years. You can find there the minutes of meetings held at Bombay Castle which throw a flood of light on contemporary events. Thus we come to know that in 1678 Shivaji threatened to burn the ships of the Siddi at Mazgaon; and the British were faced with the problem of what their attitude should be. The Home and Political Department files containing the correspondence of the British with the Marathas have also since been duly catalogued and published in three volumes edited by Dr. V. G. Dighe and Dr. P. M. Joshi. Several European travellers have left accounts of the Maratha country during Shivaji’s time. By far the most interesting among them is Storia do Mogor, which is the autobiography of an Italian named Niccolao Maniwci, who came to Surat around 1656 and died in this country in about 1717. He was in the employ of Mirza Raja Jai Singh during the latter’s expedition against Shivaji. His book contains a picture of Shiv^qi drawn by Mir Muhammad who was an employee of the Mugtol Prince Muazzam. William THE LIFE AND TIMK OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 5 Irvine has translated Manucci’s voluminous work into English. The Portuguese records of Shivaji’s time are also useful for an understanding of his military, naval and diplomatic activities. Prof. Panduranga Pissurlencar has done considerable research into these papers and brought out a scholarly work on the rela- tions between the Portuguese and the Marathas. Further, we have the contemporary records of the Dutch, which were removed to Amsterdam and lay there for two centuries until they came to the notice of scholars. It is to the Dutch that we owe one of the most authentic portraits of Shivaji. The papers were sent to Holland; the picture was etched out and sent to England where Orme noticed it. The Dutch records have also been helpful for fixing certain dates. To give an instance, the Dutch had a factory at Hyderabad, and one of the clerks in their factory, while closing bis account for the day on the 4th March 1677, recorded in the ledger book : ‘Today Shivaji met Qutb Shah in Dad Mahal’. A rich heritage of documents and other source material in various languages is thus available for a detailed study of Shivaji’s life and times. Let us now consider the situation in Maharashtra before Shivaji’s birth. The sixteenth century was a period of constant instability and violent change in the Deccan. The offshoots of the Bahamani kingdom were engaged in continuous internecine strife when the armies of Emperor Akbar swooped dovm on Maha- rashtra towards the close of that century. In 1596 the Mughals annexed Berar; in August 1600 they capured the fort of Ahmed- nagar and in 1601 annexed Khandesh. It appeared that the Nizam- shahi kingdom had come to an end; but just then Akbar had to return to the north, and died there in 1605. His son Jahangir resumed the war of conquest in the Deccan; but his forces were successfully kept at bay till 1626 by the astute Malik Ambar on behalf of Sultan Hizamshah. It was in the course of this war that Shivaji’s father Shahaji Bhonsale and other Maratha captains came into prominence as the lieutenants of Malik Ambar, who trained them in the tactics of guerilla warfare. The Marathas were waiting for such an opportuiuty and they readily joined the fray with their infantry and light cavalry. As Sayid Ahmed Tabatabai, an immigrant from Persia who joined the service of the Nizamshah and became 6 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA his official, mentions in his book Burhan-i-Masir, the Maratha bargirs were comparable to the Uzbeks in sheer bravery and endurance. They were therefore highly prized by the Sultanates of the Deccan as well as by the Mughals. Prominent among the Maratha chieftains was Lakhuji Jadhav of Sindkhed (the maternal grandfather of Shivaji), who entered the service of the Mughals in 1620 with a mansab of nearly 24,000 for himself and his de- pendents. In 1629, Lakhuji, his two sons and a grandson were treacherously murdered by the Nizamshah. Shahaji left the Nizam- shahi service and joined the Mughals as a Mansabdar of 5000. In 1632 he rebelled against the Mughals also and seized the entire territory from Poona and Chakan to Junnar, Sangamner, Nasik and North Konkan. He set up a puppet Nizamshah with head- quarters at Fort Mahuli and started raiding the Mughal territories as far as Daulatabad. He told the Adilshah that he would function as a buffer state between the Bijapuris and the Mughals, and thereby protect the former. Eventually Emperor Shah Jahan himself marched into the Deccan in 1635 and closed in on Shahaji with the cooperation of the Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda under threat of their complete extinction. Shahaji was thus com- pelled to leave Maharashtra and to build up a new barony in Karnataka as a servant of Bijapur. He, however, managed to retain his jagir of Poona, which he gave to his minor son Shivaji under the loving care of his mother Jijabai and teacher Dadaji Kondadev. We thus find that after the death of Malik Ambar, Shahaji followed in his footsteps and became the kingmaker of the Nizam- shahi. He knew the weakness of the Mughals; and, single-handed, he fought a running battle with them for four years from 1632 to 1636. This developed in him a confidence that he could stand up to the imperialist power in overt war as well as in covert diplo- macy in spite of his limited resources in money and manpower. Apparently, he transmitted this confidence to his son Shivaji who must have been inspired by the exploits of his father. It is, in fact, suggested that a ‘take-off stage’ was already reached when Shivaji took charge of his jagir at Poona with its surrounding Maval territory radiating a fierce air of freedom. But there was an essential difference between the father and . the son. The utmost ambition of Shahaji was to become a regent and a kingmaker; it was left to Shivaji to takd the further ihental jump and to aspire THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 7 to become king himself. • A theory has often been expressed that the saints and poets of Maharashtra between the 13th and the 17th centuries created an awakening among the people and roused them to social and political consciousness. It is suggested that they made the people acutely alive to the inequities of the Muhammadan rule and to the jeo- pardy into which the Hindu religion was thrown by that rule. The conclusion drawn is that the ground was thus prepared by these saints foi the founding of an independent State by Shivaji in defence of the Hindu religion. Let us see how far this conten- tion is correct. It is true that in the wake of the Muslim con- querors, a number of Sufis, Pirs and Fakirs came to the Deccan and they took advantage of royal patronage to promote their proselytising activities, generally in a peaceful manner, but at times resorting to even violent and iconoclastic methods. During the same period Maharashtra also produced a galaxy of Hindu saints like Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Eknath, Janabai, Gora Kumbhar, Sanvata Mali, Sena Nhavi, Kanhopatra, Chokhamela, Janardan Swami, Tukaram and Ramdas. These saints belonging to different castes toughened the moral fibre of the Hindus and impressed upon them the need to adhere to the faith of their forefathers. Apart from this, they made no effective contribution to the rousing of social and political consciousness among the people. With the solitary exception of Ramdas. who has written about the famine and the consequent degeneration of the people in 17th century Maharashtra, these saints do not appear to show any deep insight into the social and political problems of the time. In any case, we do not find them invoking the populace to rise in rebellion against the government of the day. It was Shivaji who created a political consciousness among his people, and if he was successful in the founding of Maratha freedom, it was solely by the force of his arms, and not tlirough the prayers of saints. It is said that when Shivaji came on the scene, the urge for independence was already there in Maharashtra, and as he lighted the torch of freedom in the Sahyadris, the Marathas readily rallied round his banner. Even this is not completely true. The leaders of Maratha society at that time were the feudal lords— the Jadhavs of Sindkhed, the Nimbalkars of Phaltan, the Desais of Sawantwadi, the Mores of Javli, the Ghorpades of Mudhol, s SHIVAJI AND SWARAJTSfA the Surves of Shringarpur and others. Some of them had borne the title of Raja for generations, but none of them was in sym- pathy with the movement initiated by Shivaji, and none of them shared his great vision. The Jadhavs of Sindkhed took pride in serving the Imperial Mughals. The records of the Phaltan dynasty of Nimbalkars hardly give any instance of their having fought on the side of Shivaji. The story of the Desais of Sawant- wadi is even worse. They sided with the Bijapur Sultanate against Shivaji,' and even went to the length of seeking refuge with the Portuguese to save themselves from retribution at Shivaji’s hands. Chandrarao More, who claimed his descent from Chandra- gupta Maurya, was a loyal vassal of the Adilshah of Bijapur and openly opposed Shivaji. When Shivaji called upon him to follow his lead, Qtandrarao More wrote : ttsw 'etc! ’pI’p spl aitaioslcf ^rr wlarasl ! g® aRBiT fisNat hti^! pmiKT 3r?r^, pt aarl'p $w ^ ®fT^ *rf 1 sf apias'W STfa.

The Sultan of Bijapur has been pleased to bestow on us the title of Raja and related insignia of kingship. We have been ruling over Javli for generations. Come to Javli by all means. Our ammunition is in readiness to welcome you.) The elite of the Maratha society thus spurned Shivaji’s lead and even opposed him actively. The Deshmukhs and the Deshpandes of the countryside also had a vested interest in the established order and therefore constituted a hindrance to any change. They spent most of their time in mutual blood feuds and in plunder and rapine for the sake of watans. The general run of the people were apathetic, and the village communities followed their own routine THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 9 without much intcrfercacc from the rulers. Revolutions can come about either through acute economic disaster or through high political consciousness; neither of these factors was present in 17th century Maharashtra. The economic situation was bad enough; but it was no worse than in other parts of the country. When people met in the shrine of Vithoba at Pandharpur, they might have talked of religious persecution by the rulers, or of the reduced condition of the peasantry; but it cannot be said that they had become politically conscious, or that the ground was ready for rebellion against the established order. In these circxunstancesj it was indeed an uphill task for Shivaji to organise the turbulent Mavlas, or even to retain their loyalty over a period of time in the larger cause of Maratha freedom. Yet he produced heroes' ‘out of ordinary mem and that is his greatness. Tanaji MaMar^i Yesaji Kank, Jiva Mahala, Moropant Pinglc. Prataprao Gujar —these were all unknown persons; but with the magic touch'^jof Shivaji they could withstand the mighty Mughals. They per- formed feats of uncommon endeavour and attained immortality: II When did the urge to found an independent kingdom' coirie to Shivaji ? There is a school of historians in Maharashtra who consider that Shivaji conceived his dream of an independent State or Hindavi Swarajya as early as in 1645, when he was'hbout 15 years old. This view is based on a certain letter dated 16th ’May 1645, in which Shivaji is supposed to have "written to Dadali Naras- prabhu Deshpande as follows : sft 3TTfe 'fimT sttI- ar ^ mrasr gvIaarR 5tt| . ^ trstsft aft ^ lanR ^ spnm gsnrw stt|. cirfH srir 5 %sr ^ 5TT^. ; . ^ f'. m , (Shri Rohireshvar, the divine master of yoi^ ^^|Iey,jhfs given us success and He will satisfy all our desires ,^2 us to esta- blish Hindavi Swarajya.

The authenticity of this letter has, however, been questioned by several eminent scholars, who consider that its language is not the language of the 17th century, Rajwade wrote that the contents of the letter might be true, D. V. Apte says: ^1f ^ 'xmmi «rrt (From a philological point of view at any rate, these letters can definitely be said to be unreliable; but the late Shri Rajwade was of the view that their contents might be true). T. S. Shejwalkar says : | tfsr (The letter is not so reliable). One difficulty in going through the source material available on the life of Shivaji is that a large number of spurious documents are also in circulation. These documents were contributed by various families in Maharashtra only in the 19th century when they were submitted by them to the Inam Commission just to show how close to Shivaji their ancestors were and what great exploits they had performed. Similarly, a number of documents produced by the families of Watandar Deshmukhs and Deshpandes in the course of mid-19th century civil litigations have also been found to be of a doubtful nature. The letter of 1645, in which the words occur, is also probably unau- thentic, as its language is distinctly modern and far too polished to belong to the 17th century. There is also no other evidence to show that Shivaji dreamt of an independent State in the year 1645. The story of oath-taldng in the temple of Rohireshvar, romantic as it is, has therefore to be disbelieved. Even if the letter is considered authentic, there is another aspect of the matter which must be taken into account. Words undergo a change of meaning with succeeding generations and a historical dictionary of a language is really necessary. When Shivaji spoke of Swarajya in 1645, he may not necessarily have meant an inde- pendent State. He was perhaps referring only to securing a free control over his jagir at Poona. To Brahme of Chakan he wrote : Xmm 'TTW (Because of your grace, I became entitled to this rajya). Here also Shivaji refers to his jagir when he speaks of the rajya. We should not THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATl SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 11 import 20th century meanings into 17th century words. To give you an instance, the word in Marathi today refers to a thoughtless speaker; but when Shivaji said he was referring to sub-standard horses and obviously not to horses indulging in thoughtless speech 1 Similarly, even if Shivaji mentioned or Trwr% in 1645 or 1648 it does not necessarily mean that he was contemplating the establishment of an independent State. I look upon Shivaji’s life and career as an extraordinary story of expanding visions. It was not as if he saw a vision in eariy child- hood and then struggled for its attainment throughout his life. I . believe that as he took one step, the next step became clear to him, and so he progressed, defeating the Jagirdars, securing the forts, annexing the Adiishahi territories, raiding the Mughal provinces and finally proclaiming himself Chhatrapati. The decision to have an independent State, implemented in 1674, could not have occurred to Shivaji in 1645 when he was barely 15 years old. Indeed, great movements often start with small incidents. In 1643, the Adilshah of Bijapur was annoyed with Shahaji and gave orders that his Poona jagir should be ravaged. When the Bijapur forces came, Shivaji had no place where he could move his family. In those days, while the villages were given to the Jagirdar, the forts were controlled by the Central Administration. The town of Poona and the villages of Maval region were with Shivaji; but the forts of Siiiligad, Torna, Lohgad, etc., were in charge of Adil- shalii nominees. It therefore struck Shivaji that it was essential to have forts in wJiich he could take shelter in times of danger. From that lime, the conquest efforts became a passion with him. Novelists ha^'e been eloquent in telling us that Torna was the first fort conquered by Shivaji. Hari NarayanApte has given a thrilling account of this episode in his novel ' ^ (Ushakal).., But no such event as described by him, ever occurred. For example, the novelist tells us 'that 'the Mayla soldiers hid their weapons in blankets and passed through seven gates. Proh N. R. Phatak, whose family.belongs to a village at the foot of this fort, told Haribhau that there was only one gate -to the fort and not seven as mentioned -by Jiim. Haribhau then confessed that ' ''^^he''; :ha;ciI:'mbveTv;:;been Torna;-.-:.-!.;;';”'.;-; r v •On 7th March, 1647, Dadaji 'Kondadev died and thereafter 12 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Shivaji launched upon his conquest of forts. First he took posses- sion of dilapidated forts and deserted hillocks. When the Adil- shall protested to Shahaji about it, the latter said that Shivaji was taking these deserted places only in order to make proper arrange- ments in them, and to maintain the fair name of the Bijapur Kingdom. Emboldened, Shivaji took Kondana (Sinhgad), the biggest fort in the region, by bribing the Governor of the fort, Siddi Ambar. This infuriated the Adilshah, who sent Fateh Khan and Musa Khan to attack Shivaji; but they were defeated. Shahaji, who was then at Jinji in the south, was arrested under instructions from the Adilshah and confined in prison at Bijapur. The return of Sinhgad was made a condition precedent to Shahaji’s release, Shivaji was therefore forced to surrender the fort, and Shahaji was allowed to go back to Bangalore in May 1649. There- after Shahaji lost interest in Shivaji and Jijabai, and left them to battle on their own against adverse circumstances. He became entangled in his affairs at Bangalore, with his second wife, Tukabai and her son, Vyankoji. He told the Adilshah that Shivaji was no longer of any concern to him, and the Adilshah could do what he liked to him. Some historians have been hard put to it to establish that there was a conspiracy of silence between Shahaji and Shivaji; but there is no evidence to support such a view, Shahaji was completely loyal to the Adilshah, and he no longer took any interest in the doings of Shivaji. By 1654 Shivaji had taken the forts of Toma, Rajgad and Purandar, and brought under effective control most of his jagir spread over Poona, Supa, Baramati, Indapur and Chakan. At this time, four-fifths of Maharashtra was controlled by the Mu- ghals, and the question before Shivaji was whether he should now proceed northwards into the Mughal territory. But the Mughal monster was too powerful for Shivaji to tackle. Nor was it possible for him to attack the areas directly administered by the Bijapur Government. He therefore decided to attack the Hindu vassals of Bijapur so that the Adilshah would think the attack only meant that two Hindu jagirdars were fighting with each other. Accordingly Shivaji stmek at Chandrarao More of Javli and completed the campaign against him within a year. The noted historian Jadunath Sarkar has observed that “the acqui- sition of Javli was the result of deliberate murder and organized 13 THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ treachery on the part of Shivaji ” !; but this comment appears unfair. As the letters recently edited by Avalaskar show, it was a hard and open fight which resulted in the complete liquidation of the Mores. Thereafter Shivaji built the fort of Pratapgad near Javli and extended his territories right up to Mahad, so that they touched the boundaries of the Siddi of Janjira and in the north approached the district of ELalyan. In November 1656, Muhammad Adilshah of Bijapur died. Prince Aurangzeb, who was at that time the Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, felt that this was an opportune time to annex the kingdom of Bijapur. He marched his armies against Bijapur and the 20 years’ peace between the Mughals and the Adilshahi initi- ated by Shah Jahan in 1636 thus came to an end. Aurangzeb captured Bidar and Kalyani. Shivaji suddenly realised that the kingdom of Bijapur was in the process of disintegration. Siddi Jauhar had become semi-independent in Karnul, Bahlol Khan was extending his sway over Savanur and Bankapur; Rustam- i-Zaman ruled in South Konkan and Kanara. These noblemen of Bijapur had no roots in their fiefs. On the other hand, Shivaji was. a son of the soil, and he started asking himself why he should not have his own State among his own people. In the meantime, the Bijapuris approached Prince Dara, the elder brother of Aurang- zeb, and through his intercession a peace treaty was signed between the Mughal Emperor and the Adilshah in August 1657. Under the terms of this treaty, Bijapur surrendered to the Emperor the Nizamshahi territory earlier obtained by it under the treaty of 1636. This territory included not only Chaul, Bhivandi and Kalyan in North Konkan but also Poona, Supa, Baramati, Indapur and Chakan, which were held by Shivaji as his jagir. Shivaji had never denied his status as a Jagirdar (or Mokasdar as the term was in those days) of the Adilshahi. If he was trying to seize more territory around his jagir, it was what all the Adilshahi noblemen of bis time were doing. But now Shivaji became over- night a subject of the vast Mughal Empire and the Bijapuris thought that he would meet more than his match in Aurangzeb. As luck would have it. Emperor Shah Jahan feU ill in September 1657. This gave the signal for a war of succession among his sons, and Aurangzeb had to hurry to the north. In the meantime 1. J. N. Sarkar, Shivaji and His Times, Orient Longman, 1973, p. 43. 14 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA the Bijapurl Governor of Kalyan had left for Bijapiir. The Mughals had jiot taken charge of the Kalyan Bhivandi' area. In the void thus' created, Shivaji swooped down with the swiftness of an eagle and seized the town of Kalyan on 24th October 1657 and Bhivandi soon thereafter. There he laid the foundations of the Maratha navy which was the first of its kind in Indian history. A good deal of information about the orders given by Shivaji for the construction of ships, the material collected, men employed, etc. is available in Portuguese sources. Shivaji also constructed a small fort at Durgadi, To Aurangzeb he must have written somewhat as follows : Your Majesty’s district of Kalyan Bhivandi is safe under me and so is the district of Poona. After all, this Empire belongs to Your Majesty and I am only an humble subject. Your Majesty may kindly be pleased to confirm me in my Jagir. Aurangzeb must have wrung his hands in sheer helplessness. His eyes were then glued to the Imperial Throne at Delhi. Diplo- matically, he wrote back to Shivaji : We are happy to receive your offer of loyalty and shalL certainly consider your petition. But in separate letters to his officers, Nasiri Khan and Multafat Khan, he ordered : Watch that dog Shivaji; go and devastate his territories. In February 1658, Aurangzeb left Aurangabad for the north for a decisive battle for the throne. One story which has gained currency in the popular mind in connection witli Shivaji’s raid of Kalyan relates to the capture of the young and beautiful daughter-in-law of the Governor of Kalyan by Abaji Mahadev and her presentation to Siiivaji as .a gift. Shivaji is said to have promptly sent back the lady to her home with all dignity and honour, saying, 'Tf rny ovwi moilier was' as beautiful, I too would have -been handsome.” This story is a’ total fabrication,- as there is no evidence for it in any conteni-* porary writings. In fact, ‘ Miilla . Ahmed, Governor of Kalyan, was at Bijapur along with his family from 1646 to 1656, and his son and daughter-in-law were at Bijapur at the urne of SkiViiji's raid of Kalyan. Surely there is no need to attribute such fantastic stories to Shivaji (and inlhe 'pxocessmmke him utter uncharitable words about his own mother) to highlight his moral rectitude. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ ^[5 It is well known that even the contemporary Mughal historian, Khali Khan, who was by no means an admirer of Shivaji, has written : Shivaji was careful to maintain the honour of the women and children of Muhammadans when they fell into his hands. His injunctions upon this point were very strict and anyone who disobeyed them, received punishment. In April 1659, the Bijapur Government sent Afzal Khan to arrest or kill Shivaji. An eloquent account of his campaign has been given by the poet Paramanand in his Sanskrit poem Shiva- bharat, which was written during Shivaji’s lifetime. According to Shivabhamt, Afzal Khan had instructions to arrest Shivaji and to produce him before the Adilshah. But Tarikh-i^Ali, a contemporary Persian work of Nurulla, the Court poet of Bijapur, hints that the Adiishah’s orders were that Shivaji should be des- troyed “by flinging the fire of death on the harvest of his life?’ A Dutch dispatch from Vengurla dated 5th May 1660 also men- tions that Afzal Khan had been directed by the Adilshah to kill Shivaji either in battle or by deceit, and that a very prominent nobleman from the Court of Bijapur had passed on this infor- mation to Shivaji. Perhaps the nobleman in question was Rustam-i-Zaman who was friendly to Shivaji. The story is told that during his march to Wai, Afzal Kdxan broke the image of the Goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur and also the image of Yithoba at Pandharpur. One contemporary document men- tions : Perhaps this means that the images in the various temples were removed and kept safe from molestation by the invaders (which was not an unusual practice); but the word was changed to implying that the images were ground to pieces. In any case, even geography gives the lie to this story. Tuljapur is very much to the north of Bijapur across the river Bhima, and it is certainly not on the way from Bijapur to Wai. Afzal Khan was also accompanied hy a number of Maratha chiefs such as Ghorpade, Kate, Pandhare Naik, Kharate Naik, Kalyan- rao Jadhav, Zunjarrao Ghatge, and Mambaji Bhonsale. 16 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Paramanand too has given a religious colour to the Afzal Khan episode, and described the struggle between Shivaji and Afzal Khan as a fight between the gods and the demons. While this approach may have been natural to Paramanand, as he was nur- tured in the tradition of the Puranas, the modern historian must exercise his judgement and take a more rational viewpoint. The conflict between Shivaji and Afzal Khan was clearly a political issue; it was not a Hindu-Muslim conflict. Paramanand himself tells us about the warning letter sent by Afzal Khan to Shivaji after his arrival at Wai in July 1659. In this letter Shivaji is asked to return to the Mughals the territory of Poona, Chakan, Kalyan, Bhivandi and Chaul along with its forts, to restore to the Adilshah the principality of Javli, and to surrender unconditionally. To submit to this demand would have been political suicide for Shivaji. He was also aware of the murderous designs of the Bijapuri general. In a diplomatic move he informed Afzal Khan that he was prepared to surrender, but the latter should come and meet him at Pratapgad. Shivaji’s envoy Pantaji Gopinath also told Afzal Khan that Shivaji was mortally afraid of him and would not come to his camp. Afzal Khan’s ego was tickled and he agreed to meet Shivaji at Pratapgad despite his counsellors’ advice to the contrary. In Tankh-f-Ali, Nurulla describes this incident very poetically in the following words : Like a young husband who moves impatiently to his newly wed wife, infatuated by her beauty and love, Afzal Khan moved towards Pratapgad and towards his own death. Both Paramanand and Sabhasad have given graphic descrip- tions of the Shivaji-Afzal Khan meeting on 10th November 1659. One issue which was under debate in 19th century Maharashtra was: who struck the first blow ? The Chitnis Bakhar gives the impression that Shivaji was almost waiting for the first blow to fall from Afzal Khan. He seems to say : I mxmm mm (It is good that you struck the first blow. Now meet my Bhavani sword.) As Paramanand says, when two persons meet even God will hesitate to say what transpired between them. It is clear that 17 THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ both of theiR were harboxiring treacherous thoughts. For a burly man like Afzal Khan the temptation to strangle the puny, pigmy figure of Shivaji must indeed have been great, especially as the latter appeared to be clinging to him in sheer terror. Shivaji also could have felt that a struggle would be fatal and he may therefore have plunged his dagger into the Khan’s abdomen with- out the least delay. As Sarkar says, it was “a case of diamond cut diamond” and the more alert person, namely Shivaji, won. The rest was all tragedy. Afzal Khan’s head was cut off and his bodyguards were killed. The Marathas fell upon his army and about 3000 of his men were slaughtered. An immense booty was carried off and according to Sabhasad it included 4,000 horses, 65 elephants, 1,200 camels, 2,000 bundles of clothing and Rs. 7 lakhs in cash and jewellery. This was clearly not a Hindu-Muslim conflict, as there were several Hindus in Afzal Khan’s camp and several Muslims on Shivaji’s side. Among the Khan’s bodyguards were two full- blooded Marathas, Shankaraji and Pilaji Mohite. Shivaji’s own uncle Mambaji Bhonsale was in Afzal Khan’s army and was killed in the carnage. The Khan’s envoy to Shivaji was also a Hindu, named Krishnaji Bhaskar. On the other hand, one of Shivaji’s aides was a Muslim of the name of Ibrahim. We learn from Paramanand that Afzal Khan was killed at about 2 p.m. on Thursday, 10th November 1659. That was a moment which was crucial to the birth of the Maratha State. So far Shivaji’s steps had been hesitant, but now he gained con- fidence. Had he been killed in the encounter with Afzal Khan, there would perhaps have been no Maratha Period in the history of our country. We must remember this when anyone speaks of Shivaji’s treachery in the Afzal Khan episode. Shivaji followed up his victory over Afzal Khan by over-running the districts of Satara and Sangli, and capturing the fort of Panhala; but in March 1660 he was besieged at Panhala by the Bijapuri general Siddi Jauhar, who had been given the title of Salabat Khan. In the meantime the Emperor Aurangzeb had sent his uncle Shaista Khan as the viceroy of the Deccan, and he too had been approached by the Bijapur Government for help against Shivaji. On 9th May 1660, Shaista Khan entered Poona, 2, J, N. Sarkar, op^ cit,^ p« 74, 18 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA and from there he proceeded to capture the fortress of Chakan, so as to connect his camp with the line of supplies at Ahmednagar. That small fortress was, however, so ably defended by Firangoji Narsala that the Mughals, in spite of their vast superiority in numbers, took nearly two months to capture it. 268 Mughal soldiers were killed and 600 were seriously injured. Shaista Khan therefore returned to Poona, which now became the headquarters of the Mughal province of Deccan. He set up his civilian govern- ment there and started administering the surrounding territory. Shivaji was at that time under siege in the fort at Panhala. On the night of I3th July 1660 he slipped out of the fort, but was hotly pursued by the Bijapur forces. The road led through a narrow ravine which was defended against heavy odds and with conspicuous bravery by Baji Prabhu Deshpande until Shivaji safely reached the fort of Vishalgad. Baji Prabhu died in the encounter. He has been immortalised in song and ballad. In November 1660, the Mughal forces took possession of the fort of Parenda from the Bijapuris, and in May 1661 they re- captured the district of Kalyan in North Konkan. Shivaji had earlier defeated the Mughal general Kar Talab Khan at Umbar- khind in January 1661 when the latter was trying to descend into the Konkan. He now diverted his activities to South Konkan and captured DabhoL The English factors of Rajapur had supplied grenades to Siddi Jauhar when he was engaged in the siege of Panhala. In reprisal, Shivaji made a surprise raid on Rajapur and plundered the English factory. He carried off as prisoners the English President Revington and three other factors, whom he released only after a few years. According to contemporary estimates, the strength of Shaista Khan’s army was about a lakh of soldiers and he was camping at Poona for a full three years from 1660 to 1663. Yet after the cap- ture of Chakan, we do not find him making any efforts to capture the many forts of the Marathas in the Poona region. As Sarkar says, perhaps the loss of nearly 900 soldiers at Chakan may have deterred him.^ Some interesting sidelights on the motivations of Mughal generals are also available in the Persian autobiography of Bhimsen Saksena, whose father was the accounts officer of the Mughal artillery at Aurangabad, and w^hose uncle was a clerk in 3, J. N, Sarkar, op. dt., p. 82. » * THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 19 Shaista Khan's camp at Poona. Bhimsen tells us about the levity and corruption of the Mughal camp. Shaista Khan was the brother of Emperor Aurangzeb's mother Mumtaz Mahal. His daughter Pari Begum was married to the Prime Minister Muham- mad Jafar's son. The boy's mother was also a sister of Mumtaz Mahal. This marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendour at Poona when Shaista Khan was camping there, and the festivities went on for a whole month. Bhimsen tells us that Jafar's son Namdar Khan who was at Poona asked Shaista Khan : “Uncle, why should it be difficult for us to subjugate Shivaji, who has only about 3,000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry and a few forts ? I think I could bring him to book in about three months if you would give me a force of 10,000.” Shaista Khan replied: “You are still a child, Namdar Khan. If we bring the campaign against Shivaji to an end, Aurangzeb will have no enemy left throughout the length and breadth of this country. He will then set his heart on capturing the Fort of Kandahar. It is very cold there and you will have to flight against the Pathans and the Persians. Are you ready for it ?” Namdar Khan said : “That would certainly be a tough proposition.” “Then don’t talk of finishing Shivaji,” said Shaisia Khan, “Go on sending dispatches every week about the various victories won, and carry on with the present campaign. If the war against the Marathas is over, Aurangzeb will also insist on retrenching our force of 75,000 soldiers. Are you prepared to take the curses of these poor, helpless people who will lose their jobs?” “No 1 No !” said Namdar Khan, and he did not pursue his argument. Such was the corruption among the Mughal generals. Shaista Khan started practising seduction on Shivaji's officers also. He offered them tempting monetary rewards and mansabs for deserting Shivaji and taking up service under the Mughals. After all, the resources of the Mughal Empire were vast, and Shaista KJian could afford to pay ten times the salary which Shivaji gave to his officers. For three years the seduction of Shivaji’s men went on apace, and we have a sickening tale of able Maratha officers deserting him one after another. Even Sambhaji Kavji who had played a notable part in the campaign against Chandra- rao More left Shivaji and went over to the Mughals. This was a loss in terms of both brain and brawn and it deeply shocked Shivaji. He felt that a time would soon come when the only man who would be leii to defend the freedom of Maharashtra would 20 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA be Shivaji alone. The sheer physical presence of over 75,000 Mughals in the Mafatha territory was also a brutal fact which had to be reckoned with. Shivaji therefore made peace with the Adilshah by returning to him the fort of Panhala, and then decided on the daring plan of striking at Shaista Klian in his own camp. At midnight on 5th April 1663, Shivaji himself led a band of selected soldiers and broke into the residence of Shaista Khan at Lai Mahal which was the home of Shivaji’s childhood in Poona. The Mughal historian Khali Khan, whose father was a servant of Shaista KJian, has narrated the story of this event. It was the month of Ramzan, and apart from some cooks who were busy preparing the food for the next day’s breakfast, most of the servants were asleep. The Marathas forced their entry by re- moving the bricks of a wall and made their way towards Shaista Khan’s bedroom. It was pitch dark, and whoever came in the way —^whether it was a soldier or a servant, male or female—was struck down by the intruders. Shaista Khan got up from his sleep and tried to throw a spear at the assailants. But he was promptly attacked and in the blow that fell his fingers were chopped off. Two of the Marathas tinnbled over a fountain of water, and in the confusion that ensued, some slave-girls removed Shaista Khan to safety. The killing continued for some time, and among the casualties were Shaista Khan’s son Abul Path, six of the KJian’s wives and slave-girls and forty of his attendants. Next morning everyone was aghast at the previous night’s hap- penings. Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur who was camping nearby came to condole with Shaista Khan; but the latter sneer- ingly remarked : “Are you still alive ? When the enemy attacked me, I thought you had already died fighting in defence of me! ” Bhimsen Saksena tells us that rumour was indeed rife in the Mughal camp that the previous night’s incidents had taken place with the connivance of Jaswant Singh. The humiliation heaped by Shivaji on the Emperor’s uncle and premier peer (amir-ul-umra) of the Mughal realm made a deep impression all over India. No feat was considered im- possible for him. The fact that in an assignment so full of danger he had himself jumped into the fray in total disregard of his personal safety won the hearts of his devoted followers. They vied with each other to shed their blood where Shivaji’s perspira- tion trickled to the ground. Utterly humiliated, Shaista Khan THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHAKAJ 21 retired to Aurangabad and the Emperor shortly transferred him to the province of Bengal. Prince Mtiazzam took over as the new Viceroy of the Deccan in January 1664. Shivaji felt that it was now high time to visit the Mughal terri- tories with the same kind of devastation as was inflicted by them on the homeland of the Marathas. He moved rapidly via Kalyan, Jawhar, Ramnagar and Ganadevi and suddenly arrived at Surat on 6th January 1664. Surat was then a very rich city, which yielded an annual revenue of Rs. 12 lakhs by way of imperial customs alone. This revenue was assigned to the Emperor’s sister, Jahanara Begum, as her privy purse. As soon as the news of Shivaji’s arrival came, Inayat Khan, the Mughal Governor of the city, fled to the local Fort, and others followed him; leaving the city defenceless. For a full four days Shivaji’s men plundered the city and set fire to houses. The devastation of the Maratha territories by the Mughals was thus avenged, and Shivaji obtained a booty of over a crore of rupees. Most of this wealth was uti- lised by him for the construction of the naval fort of Sindhudurg near Malwan. Slowly, the western coast was covered with a string of forts like Vijayadurg, Suvarnadurg andPadmadurg and Shivaji built up his navy which acted as a check on the expansionist activities of the Siddis of Janjira, the Portuguese and the English. In a letter of 1664 addressed to the Counsellors of the Emperor Alamgir (Aurangzeb), Shivaji refers to the Mughal attempts to conquer his homeland. He specifically mentions in this letter : '*lt is my duty to guard my land.” This shows that the objective of Shivaji in the sack of Surat was not only to gain wealth but also to teach a lesson to the Mughals to keep their hands off Maratha territories. In September 1664 the Emperor appointed Mirza Raja Jai Singh to vanquish Shivaji. Jai Singh arrived at Poona on 3rd March 1665 along with his deputies who included men like Dilir Khan, Daud Khan Qureshi, Raja Rai Singh Sisodia, and Raja Sujan Singh Bundela. Jai Singh was one of the greatest generals and. diplomats of the 17th century. He was more than a match for Shivaji. He planned his campaign with consummate skill and combined against Shivaji all his enemies such as the Bijapuris, the Portuguese and the Maratha chieftains like Nimbalkar and More. Roving columns of Mughal armies kept the Marathas 22 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA continuously on the run, burnt their villages and captured men. women and cattle. The entire Maratha territory was thrown into disorder, and streams of refugees started moving from place to place. Dilir Khan laid siege to the fort of Purandar which put up a gallant fight under the brave Murar Baji who laid down his life after a heroic struggle and became immortal in history. Shivaji now realised that it was futile to continue this unequal struggle, and on 11th June 1665 he walked into the camp of Jai Singh offering an unconditional surrender. The terms of a permanent peace were then negotiated and after much bargaining on both sides, the following terms were agreed upon, in what is known as the Treaty of Purandar : (i) That Shivaji should surrender to the Mughals 23 of his forts covering a territory with an annual revenue of 4 lakh hons (Rs. 20 lalis). (ii) That Shivaji should retain with him only 12 forts (including Rajgad) with an annual revenue of 1 lakh , hons (Rs. 5 lakhs). (iii) That Shivaji should be loyal to the imperial throne and also assist the Mughals in the campaign against Bijapur with 2,000 cavalry of his son Sambhaji’s mansab and 7,000 infantry under his own command. Some of our historians have tried to establish that Shivaji was not really defeated by Jai Singh; and that he sued for peace because Hindus were dying on both sides. Even Dr. Bal Krishna cites a long letter in Persian in which Shivaji writes to Jai Singh that both of them were Hindus and that they should come together to bring down the Alamgir from the imperial throne of Delhi. This letter is certainly a spurious document. Apparently, it is an essay by a postgraduate student of Persian from a college in Bihar, who was asked to try his hand at Persian verse on an imaginary conversation betw'een Shivaji and Jai Singh; and it is now being cited as an authentic document to support the diplomatic victory of Shivaji ! There is no gainsaying the fact that Shivaji was totally defeated at the hands of Mirza Raja Jai Singh and the treaty of Purandar was one of the greatest disappointments in his life. His dream was shattered and on bended knees he had to accept the Emperor’s THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 23 farman in September 1665. Even Ms letters to Anrangzeb during this time are couched in a language of abject surrender, and he refers to himself as “an offender and a sinner deserving of all kinds of punishment’’. To this our historians would say that Shivaji did not know Persian and he signed whatever was put up to him by Jai Singh’s draftsmen ! Every human being, however great, has his ups and downs and the greatness of Shivaji does not lie in not having been defeated at any time. What is significant is that every time he had a set- back, he rose up once again. Adversities did not make him bitter; they made him more broadminded. He knew how to conquer not only fear but also hatred; and therein we see his real great- ness. When I review the career of Shivaji, I am deeply impressed by his high intelligence, his superb strategy, his firm determination and persistence and above all, by his unflinching faith in the goal which he had set before himself. I am equally appalled by the corruption that oozed from the Mughal Courts, and by the sheer shortsightedness of the Mughal Emperor. Aurangzeb never showed any consideration for Shivaji. The Mughals also wasted their time and resources in conquering Bijapur and Golkonda which were already on the decline. Jadunath Sarkar has men- tioned a conversation between Dilir Khan and Mirza Raja Jai Singh which is significant. Dilir Khan said : “Maharaj ! Don’t invade Bijapur. You have conquered Shiva, let him manage things in the Deccan and conduct our business there”. But Jai Singh answered : “Bhaiji, don’t you speak”, to which Dilir Khan retorted, “I will not say anything more now. This campaign will end by ruining both you and me, and then I shall speak.” The Mughals had a splendid opportunity to contain the Marathas in the South by making Shivaji their general in the Deccan and permitting him to conquer Bijapur on his own. That would have enabled them to concentrate on the North. Both Elphinstone and Lane Poole have referred to this blunder on the part of the Mughals. Lane Poole observes : Seldom was political sagacity more at fault. The rude high- lander (Shivaji), who might have been converted into a power- ful prop of the empire in the Deccan, was allowed to escape 4. J. N. Sarkar, House of Shivaji, 3rd ed., M, C. Sarkar & Sons, Calcutta, 1955, p, 163. 24 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA (from Agra) in disguise, affronted and enraged, to resume his old sway in the mountains. Too late the Emperor attempted conciliation : the old antagonist had become a personal enemy and nothing could soothe his resentment.^ In fact, Aurangzeb was not very happy even about the decision to allow Shivaji to retain twelve forts and a territory of Rs. 5 lakhs in the Maratha country. Jai Singh’s letter of explanation reads almost like an apology. He says : Although we could have put down Shivaji and Bijapur, yet I felt I could not drive Shivaji too hard. He had made arrangements for the defence of his territory. The Adil- shah of Bijapur had also made an offer of putting up a united front with Shivaji against the Mughals. That is why I left this territory to Shivaji. At the instance of Jai Singh and under his solemn assurance of protection, Shivaji went to Agra to have an audience with the Emperor on i2th May 1666. In fairness, proper courtesy and even generosity should have been extended to this great warrior who had fought so gallantly.But Aurangzeb did not utter even one word of welcome or recognition when Shivaji presented to him his nazar and nisar. Khilats (robes of honour) were presented to the Royal Princes, to the Grand Vazir Jafar Khan and to Raja Jaswant Singh, but not to Shivaji, who was made to stand in ignominy behind several rows of noblemen. Shivaji felt greatly insulted. A bunch of letters in the Dingal dialect of Rajasthan written by officers of Kumar Ram Singh (Jai Singh’s son and Shivaji’s caretaker at the Emperor’s Court) have been discovered in the Jaipur State Archives. As mentioned earlier, these letters give a graphic eyewitness account of the happenings at Agra during these fateful days. We learn from these papers that Shivaji flew into a rage at the ignominy heaped on him and his eyes became wet. Noticing this, the Emperor told Kumar Ram Singh : ‘‘Ask Shivaji what ails him.” Accordingly the Kismar approached Shivaji and the latter said ; “You have seen, your father has seen, your Padishah has seen what a man I am; and yet you have deli- berately made me stand up so long. I cast off your mansab. If 5. Stanley Lane-Poole, Medieval India Under Mohammedan Rule^ T. Fisher Unwin, London, 1903, p. 392. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 25 you wanted me to stand, you should have done so according to the right order of precedence/' So saying, he proudly turned his back to the Throne and walked away. The Kumar followed him and tried to reason with him. But Shivaji said : “My destined day of death has arrived. Either you will slay me or I shall kill myself. Cut off my head if you like, but I am not going to the Emperor's presence again.” Ram Singh reported the matter to the Emperor, who sent Multafat Khan, Aqil Khan and Mukhlis Khan to console Shivaji, invest him with a Khilat and lead him back to his presence. Shivaji told them : “I refuse to accept the Khilat. The Emperor has deliberately made me stand below Jaswant Singh. I am such a man and yet he has wilfully kept me standing, I decline the Emperor's mansab; I will not be his servant. Kill me, imprison me> if you like; but I won’t wear the Khilat.” The Emperor was diplomatically informed that Shivaji had been taken ill in the unaccustomed heat of the Imperial Darbar and Ram Singh was then ordered to take Shivaji back to his re- sidence without waiting till the end of the Darbar. Thus ended the historic meeting between Shivaji and Aurangzeb, when not a word passed betw'een them. Shivaji was placed under semi-detention at Agra. Aurangzeb asked him to hand over all his forts and territory. Shivaji, on his part, offered to pay the Emperor two crores of rupees if all his lately ceded forts weie restored to him and he was allowed to return home. Aurangzeb tightened the net around him and his detention became very strict. Shivaji then petitioned the Em- peror : “I am willing to cede all my forts. But my merely sending orders from here will not do, as my officers will not obey them. If I go there, 1 shall fight with my officers and hand over the forts to the imperial agents.” The Emperor, however, insisted that Shivaji should only wTite to his officers to surrender the forts. Shivaji’s life was literally hanging in the balance. The records mention at least three occasions when his death was imminent, but was postponed for some reason or the other. In the mean- time, Shivaji also made every effort to secure his freedom. The greasing of the palm of every functionary from a peon to the Prime Minister merrily went on for three months, and Shivaji ran into a debt of Rs. 66,000. He borrowed the money from Ram Singh by giving him a hxmdi payable by his officers to Jai Singh in the Deccan. The hundi was duly: encashed at the Rajgad treasury. 26 SfflVAJI AND SWARAJYA Soon Aurangzeb ordered SMvaji to be removed to tKe residence of one Vithaldas. According to Maniicci, the macliinations of the Miighals were that once Shivaji was interned in Vithaldas’ house, he was to be strangled to death at a suitable opportunity, and the whole episode was to be given the appearance of an acci- dent. The official history of the Mughals is silent on this point ; but Manucci certainly had good means of knowing what was going on at the Imperial Court. Shivaji himself wrote to Jaswant Singh on his return to the Deccan : ‘T fled from Agra in fear of my life.” On 17th August 1666 Shivaji escaped from detention, and throwing his pursuers off the scent, safely reached Rajgad—on 12th Sept- ember 1666 according to one report. Annoyed and angered at the escape of Shivaji, Aurangzeb ordered the arrest of his lieutenant Netaji Palkar who had defected to the Mughals. After three days of torture, he was forced to embrace Islam and named Muhammad Quli. His wives were also brought from the Deccan and made Muslims. He was then sent to Kabul to serve with the Mughal army for ten years. He could return to Shivaji only in 1676, when he was converted back to Hinduism. After his return to the Deccan, Shivaji diplomatically wrote to Aurangzeb in more or less the following terms : It w'as my ardent desire to remain at Agra and to serve Your Imperial Majesty further. I would even have gone on an expedition to Kandahar.lt is indeed my lasting mis- fortune that I was separated from the august feet of Your Imperial Majesty. With the Persian invasion threatening on the north-western borders of India, Aurangzeb also thought it fit to send a reply of which the gist was : Very happy to receive your letter. How much we wish you could have stayed for a longer period and tasted of our welcome at Agra. We had decided to load you with more favours and to show you greater grace and kindness. We can only regret your departure; but we wish you well Now our son Muazzam is in Aurangabad. Be firm in obedience to him and you may conquer as much of Bijapur as you can. Both diplomats of the first order ! But Shivaji used to say till the end of his days that the only mistake he committed in his life THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAKARAJ * 27 was his visit to Agra and Aurangzeb said his greatest mistake was that he allowed Shivaji to escape from Agra ! Aurangzeb died on 20th February 1707 and in his last will and testament he wrote: The greatest pillar of a Government is the keeping of information about everything that happens in the kingdom, while even a minute’s negligence results in shame for long years. See how the flight of the wretch Shiva, which was due to carelessness, has involved me in all these distracting campaigns to the end of my days. Ill Prof. Jadunath Sarkar observes : The historian who digs down to the root causes of great events cannot help feeling that Shivaji’s visit to Aurangzeb produced as its ultimate consequence a revolution in the destiny ofthe Maratha people. This event marks a decisive turning point in the history of India as a whole. The insults heaped by Aurangzeb rankled in Shivaji’s mind till the end, and he became convinced for ever that the word of the Mughal was not to be trusted. For the next three years, however, Shivaji tried to curry favour with the Mughals with all the arts of diplomacy -that he could command. He had to consolidate his own position first, before he could contend with the mighty Mughals. He wTote to Prince Muazzam, the new Viceroy of the Deccan : My son Shambhuji has been created a commander of five thousand but has received no jagir as tankha. I now beg that His Majesty may pardon the offences of this servant, restore the mansab of my son and assign a jagir to him. I am ready to render service in person wherever I am ordered. This was agreed to by the Emperor, and Sambhaji met Muazzam at Aurangabad on 4th November 1667. Sambhaji was created a commander of five thousand with a jagir at Malkapur in Berar and on 5th August 1668, a Maratha contingent left for Auranga- bad under Pratap Rao and Niraji Raoji. 6. J. N. Sarkar, Shivaji and Hisi Times y p. 138. 28 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Shivaji also requested that the title Raja might be conferred on him. Some of our modern historians feel that Shivaji could never make such a request. One historian goes to the extent of saying that Shivaji’s open defiance of the Emperor at Agra was in fact motivated by a desire to escape being given the title ‘Raja’ by the Emperor in a fit of generosity 1 The significance of one of the proudest moments in the history of India is thus being distorted! Another suggestion is that the securing of the title ‘Raja’ was indeed a feat of diplomacy on Shivaji’s part. The Sultans of Bijapiir and Golkonda called him a robber and a free- booter, as he had seized areas from their kingdom; but now their overlord, the Emperor of India, had himself called Shivaji a Raja. It was as if Shivaji had flaunted in their face a regular order from the highest imperial authority recognising his status. On 9th March 1668, Prince Muazzam himself v/rote to Shivaji : His Gracious Majesty has elevated your head by granting you the title of Raja, which was the extreme point of your desires. It is clear that Shivaji stooped to conquer and his intention was not merely to conquer but even to destroy the Mughal Empire when the moment was opportune. For three years, from 1667 to 1669, Shivaji was busy husbanding his resources, framing regulations for the governance of his territory, and preparing for his final assault on the bastions of the Mughal empire. In November 1667, Shivaji’s forces marched into the Portuguese territory of Bardes in pursuit of the Desais of South Konkan, who had taken refuge there and were making it a base of their operations against Shivaji. Some historians have tried to show that Shivaji attacked the Portuguese to punish them for their proselytizing activities. He is thus sought to be projected as a champion of Hinduism I There is no doubt that Shivaji was a devout Hindu. His renovation of the temple of Saptakotishvar at Narve and of Jagadishvar at Raigad, and the grant given by him to the temple of Ghrishneshvar at Verul, are standing examples of Shivaji’s great concern for the religion and culture of his forefathers. But he did not allow politics to be mixed up with religion. The object of his campaign against the Portuguese was purely political, namely, to punish them for having given refuge and encouragement to the rebel Desais of South THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJl MAHARAJ * 29 Kottkan. Prof, Pissurlencar, who has brought out a well-docu“ luented study of Portuguese-Maratha relations, has expressed similar views. The terms of the treaty of 1670 between Shivaji and the Portuguese also do not refer to any religious issues. In 1670 Shivaji broke his peace with the Mughals and the fury of his attack was so great that he was immediately rewarded with a series of successes which wiped out the humiliation of the Treaty of Purandar. On 4th February, Kondana was captured after a memorable fight in which Shivaji’s lieutenant, Tanaji Malusare, hid down his life. On 8th March, Purandar was recovered by Nilo Pant. By the end of June 1670, the forts of Kalyan, Lohgad, Mahuli, Karnala and Rohida fell to Shivaji. In October of the same year, Shivaji made a second raid on Surat and plundered the larger houses of that opulent city for three whole days, carrying off a booty of Rs. 66 lakhs. As the raiders were returning with their loot, they were confronted by the Mughal army under Daud Khan. But the Mughals suffered heavy losses in the battle of Dindori which took place on 17th October 1670. Bhimsen Saksena has given a graphic eyewitness account of this battle in his Tarikh-i-Dilkusha, In December 1670, Shivaji captured the forts of Ahivant, Markanda, Ravla and Javla in Baglana and entered the territory of Khandesh. Advancing still further, he carried off booty worth nearly a crore of rupees from the rich and fertile province of Berar. In the meanwhile, Moro Pant Peshwa had captured the fort of Trimbak in October 1670 and on 5th January 1671 the fort of Salhir also fell to the Marathas. The English records mention that the Mughal generals, Bahadur Khan and Dilir Khan, were forced to retreat from the Maratha country with shame and loss. In 1672, the Marathas annexed the Koli States of Jawhar and Ramnagar in North Konkan. During all this time Aurangzeb was busy suppressing the Pathan rebellion in the north, and the stream of reports that went to him from the Deccan spoke of a succession of reverses for the Mughal armies. Shivaji’s conception of strategy was brilliant. He made use of every instrument of war. The nature of his attacks,their timing and the methods of warfare he employed win our instant admiration for this outstanding leader of men. Shivaji’s intelli- gence system is also praised by Francois Martin, the French P. S. Pissuriencar, Portuguese Marathe Sambandh^ Poona University, ^ 1967 . 30 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Governor of Pondicherry; The English records of Bombay mention that Shivaji’s spies were spread all over the island. Fort after fort was seized from the Mnghal qiladars and Aurangabad was flooded with refugees from all parts of the Deccan. The Mughal s were aghast. In August 1669, Aurangzeb had destroyed the Vish^eshvar Temple at Benares, and some historians hold that Shivaji's fierce attack on the Mughals was in retaliation for the Emperor's icono- clastic measures. However, Shivaji appears to have been moti- vated more by political than by religious considerations. Ever since his return from Agra, it had been clear to him that Au^ang- zeb wanted to destroy him, and a war with the Mughals was therefore inevitable. He had accordingly been preparing for it. Considering the tiny kingdom of Shivaji, with only twelve forts, and the vast resources of the Mughal Empire, a lesser man than he would have shrunk from such a course. But Shivaji knew that the Mughal Empire was an empty show; he had seen it in ail its glory and all its decadence during his visit to Agra. Moreover, he was fighting for the protection of his motherland and he knew that his cause was just. It was this conviction that sustained him as well as his successors in the long struggle against Aurangzeb which continued for almost forty years until the death of that Emperor in 1707. In the intervening period, Shivaji died, his son Sambhaji was captured and put to death by Aurangzeb, Sambhaji’s wife and son were taken prisoners and Rajaram who succeeded Sambhaji also died. The struggle went through many vicissi- tudes; but ultimately the Marathas emerged victorious and Aiirang- zeb died a broken man. At this stage we may pause to consider the nature of Mughal rule in India, as that will enable us to understand wliy Shivaji decided to strike a decisive blow against it. The Mughals were not really Mongolians; they were Turks froan Central Asia. Emperor Akbar was a great gift of the Turkish people to our country. He realised that there could be no salvation for the State unless there was a genuine understanding among the various religious communities living in a country. Akbar appointed a bureau of translators which translated into Persian the eighteen cantos of the Mahabharata including the Bhagavadgita, ana the THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 31 Yogarasistha. The torch was carried forward during the reign of Emperor Jahangir, when Mulla Masih translated the Ramayana of Valmiki and Faizee wrote an epic poem in Persian on the story of Nala and Damayanti. Prince Data Shufcoh, the eldest son of Emperor Shah Jahan, was an outstanding scholar who studied the doctrines of the Vedanta, the Talmud, and the New Testament besides the works of Sufi writers. The patron of Pandit-raj Jagannath, he also arranged for the translation of the Atharvaveda and of several Upanishads into Persian. This trend towards liberalism was however reversed by Aurangzeb when he became the Emperor in 1658. In order to strengthen his hold on the Imperial Throne, Aurangzeb wanted to condemn his eldest brother, Dara Shukoh as siding with the infidels; he also wanted to gain the support of the Mullahs and Moulavis by waging a ceaseless war against the infidels. Himself an orthodox Muslim belonging to the Hanafi school of the Sunni sect, Aurangzeb looked upon the Mughal Empire as an Islamic State, and he subordinated the policies of his government to the dictates of orthodox religion. Under his rule, the Hindus were equated with the Kafirs who fought against the Prophet at Mecca. On 9th April 1669, a general order was issued for the destruction of Hindu temples. The temple of Vishvanath at Benares was razed to the groimd and a mosque was built in its place. Keshavji ka Kathda at Mathura, to which Dara had presented a beautiful balustrade, was pulled down, and a mosque of red stone was erected in its place. Jaziya was imposed on all Hindus, and the Hindu merchants were required to pay an additional import duty of 3% on all imported goods. The Hindus thus became second class citizens under Aurangzeb’s rule, and their way of life was in complete jeopardy. Secondly, there was personal rule during Aurangzeb’s time, and all powers were concentrated in the person of the Emperor who was the fountain-head of all decisions. He ruled with the help of a bureaucracy which consisted mostly of foreigners. Although Aurangzeb was born in this country and he died in this coimtry, he was extremely proud of his Turrani origin and his racial consciousness was very strong. He held the Indians in contempt and often made a distinction between “you Hindus- tanis” and “we Turranis”. Turks from Central Asia and even Persians were preferred to Indians for recruitment to positions of authority. In his book The Mughal Nobility under Aurangzeb, 32 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Prof. Mohammad Athar Ali of Aligarh University has given a Civil List of Aurangzeb’s time indicating the racial origins of the various dignitaries, and it is very revealing. The Mughal Empire then consisted of 22 Subahs and during the fifty years of Aurangzeb’s reign a toal number of 137 persons were appointed as the Governors of these Subahs. Only two of them were Hindus, namely, Mirza Raja Jai Singh and Maharaja Jaswant Singh. The remaining 135 were Muslims, and of them only a very few belonged to families which had settled down in India for five to six generations. The rest had come recently from Samar- kand, Bokhara, Khorasan or Iran, or from some other place in Central Asia. 75% of these officers were thus foreigners. After Jaswant Singh’s death, the I'ecruitment of Rajputs to higher positions in the Mughal Empire was stopped. Indeed, the men who ruled India from the central throne of Delhi during the medieval period, and their leading noblemen, were all foreigners and not Indian Muslims. As Prof. M. Mujeeb observes in his scholarly work on the Indian Muslims, Muslim rule in medieval India was a minority government based on the apathy of the ruled and consisting heavily of foreign elements.® It was this alien rule, which became intolerable under the fanatic Emperor Aurangzeb, that Shivaji wanted to bring to an end. It is interesting to note in this connection that in Shivaji’s docu- ments Mughals are referred to as or (the red-faced ones). A mention of their religion is rarely made. The Siddis too are called not the Muslims of Janjira but (the dark complexioned people of Janjira). The emphasis in Maratha documents is thus on the racial characteristics of these foreigners. On 6tli June 1674, Shivaji had himself crowmed at Raigad. thereby proclaiming to the world that he had thrown off the foreign yoke and become a legally constituted monarch in his own right. He wanted to give to his people an administration which would strive for their welfare and which would make no discrimination on grounds of race or religion. He set up a system of government based largely on the teachings of the ancient , 8. 'M. Mujeeb, The Indian George Alien & Unwin, London, 1967.

Instead of ' ’ we now find the document mentioning ‘ ntfft 33rT5fT A new era called the ‘Rajyabhisheka Era’ was commenced and a new leaf was opened in the history of this country. Let us now get back to the conquests of Shivaji. On 24th November 1672, Ali Adilshah II of Bijapur died and he was succeeded on the throne by a boy of four years. The kingdom was riven with dissension and discord among its leading noblemen, and disturbances broke out. Shivaji took this opportunity to strike at this enemy of the Maratha kingdom. On 6th March 1673, the fort of Panhala was recaptured, and soon thereafter Parli and Satara also fell to the Marathas. In 1675 Shivaji marched into South Konkan and seized the most important Bijapuri fort of Phonda near Goa. Proceeding to Kanara, he captured Karwar and by 25th May 1675 the Adilshahi territory as far south as the Gangavali river passed into his hands. From 1672 to 1677 Bahadur Khan was the commander-in- chief and Mughal viceroy of the Deccan. He shifted his head- quarters from Aurangabad to Pedgaon (near Daund) which was renamed Bahadurgad ; but the Maratha forces kept him constantly on the run. Bahadur Khan was harassed so much by the manoeuvres of the Marathas that in 1675, when Shivaji opened peace negotiations with him, he readily welcomed them. As a matter of fact, Shivaji wanted some respite from possible Mughal attacks while he was busy with the siege of Phonda. It was proposed that Shivaji would surrender 17 of his forts to the Mughals, and also send his son Sambhaji to serve under the Mughal viceroy. The negotiations were purposefully prolonged. Eventually, when the Emperor accepted these terms, Bahadur KJhan sent his envoys to Shivaji to ask him to receive the imperial farman and deliver the forts. But by this time Phonda had already been captured by the Marathas. Bhimsen Saksena tells us that Shivaji received the Mughal envoys with all hospitality ; but on the next day told them i “What brave deeds have you done that I should seek peace with you ? Get away from here speedily 3 34 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA or else you may be disgraced,” Time and again the Mughal generals thus fell a prey to the baits laid out by Shivaji 1 Shivaji’s attention soon turned further south, to the large and rich province of Jinji which was known as Bijapuri Karnataka. One third of it was held by Shivaji’s half-brother Vyankoji as successor to their father Shahaji, and two thirds by two Adilshahi noblemen named Nasir Muhammad Khan and Sher Khan Lodi. Shivaji wanted to conquer the baronies of these two noblemen and to add to them his share of his father’s estates, so that he could carve out a separate dominion in the south. Fortunately, Raghunath Pant Hanmante, who was for a long time the guardian and regent of Vyankoji, had now entered Shivaji’s service and his great local knowledge of the southern kingdoms was of consi- derable help to Shivaji. Madanna, the influential Hindu Vazir of the Qutb Shah of Golkonda, was also favourable to Shivaji. He was in fact keen on a joint enterprise between the Qutb Shah and Shivaji to conquer Bijapuri Karnataka at this most opportune time, when the Adilshahi was paralysed by a civil war between its Pathau and Deccani noblemen, and the Mughal Viceroy Bahadur Khan was also intent on destroying the Adilshahi kingdom. Shivaji was certainly not the person to miss this favourable concourse of circumstances for achieving his own ends. He sent his minister Niraji Raoji to Bahadur Khan, to induce him to maintain peace during his projected campaign in the Karnataka. The Mughal Viceroy, who was weary of his war with the elusive Marathas and wanted to intensify his campaign against Bijapur, readily agreed, though it is said that he received a large bribe in the bargain. An interview was then arranged between Shivaji and the Qutb Shah of Golkonda through the good offices of Madanna and Pralhad Niraji, Shivaji’s resident ambass- ador at Hyderabad. Shivaji left Raigad and in February 1677 reached Hyderabad where he was received with great honour and gaiety. He met the Qutb Shah at Dad Mahal (Palace of Justice) on 4th March 1677. The Shah was deeply impressed by the personal magnetism of Shivaji and by his wonderful achievements. The two monarchs came to a secret understanding for the conquest of the Tanjore region for which the Qutb Shah agreed to supply both men and money. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 35 After leaving Hyderabad, Shivaji paid a visit to the sacred shri xe of Shri Shaila and then proceeded to linji. He captured the fort of Jinji in May 1677 and then laid siege to the fort of Yellore. However, as the siege was prolonged, Shivaji left it in the hands of his lieutenants and himself marched south- wards, where he inflicted a crushing defeat on Sher Khan Lodi of Wali-gunda-puram. Advancing further south, Shivaji went right up to the bank of the Kolerun river, collecting tribute from the Nayak of Madura. The French envoy, M. Germain, who spent three days in Shivaji’s camp on the Kolerun, is all praise for the latter’s simplicity and efficiency. He says : Shivaji’s camp is without any pomp and unembarrassed by baggage or women. There are only two tents in it, but of a thick simple stuff and very small—one for himself and the other for his minister. What a striking contrast with the Mughal general ! Bhimsen Saksena tells us that Mahabat Khan, whom Aurangzeb had sent to the Deccan in 1670 to overcome Shivaji, had in his camp 400 dancing girls from Kabul and Kandahar ! A meeting was soon arranged between Shivaji and his half- brother Vyankoji ; but no agreement was possible about the partitioning of their father’s estate. The armies of the two brothers stood facing each other across the Kolerun and they joined in battle in November 1677. Eventually a peace was made. Shivaji retained the Jinji territory, a few forts, and for some time the Mysore tableland. The territory south of the Kolerun was left to Vyankoji, along with some portion to the north. Shivaji commenced his return journey to Maharashtra at the beginning of November 1677 and reached Panhala in April 1678. On the way he took possession of his father’s jagir districts of Kolar, Hoskote, Bangalore, Balapur and Sera. In August 1678 the fort of Vellore also fell to the Marathas after a protracted siege. In March 1679 Shivaji captured the fort of Koppal to the north of the Tungabhadra river so as to connect his newly won dominion in the south to his northern kingdom. Sabhasad has estimated that the territory gained by Shivaji in the Karnataka 36 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA (including parts of both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu of the present day) contained a hundred forts and yielded an annual revenue of 20 lakh hons. According to Sarkar, “Shivaji’s grand coronation in June 1674 had greatly reduced his treasury balance” and “gold, not land, was his chief object” in the Karnataka expedition.^ On the other hand, Shejwalkar has expressed the view that Shivaji wanted to present himself as an heir to the fallen Vijayanagara empire by capturing its erstwhile capital of Vellore, and to bring under his banner the Hindu chieftains of the south in a united campaign against the Mughals, Shivaji is thus credited with a consciousness of history, and an ideological base is sought to be given to his southern conquests. Shejwalkar’s view is based on a letter which Shivaji is supposed to have written to Vyankoji in 1675, urging him to capture Vellore. It is, however, doubtful whether this letter is genuine. No other evidence m support of Shejwalkar’s contention seems to be forthcoming. Apparently, territorial annexation was a major objective of Shivaji’s expedition. In any case, the fort of Jinji provided a safe refuge for Shivaji’s son Rajaram a decade later when he had to flee from Maha- rashtra against the advancing Mughal armies. In December 1678 Shivaji met with a major disappointment in his life. His son and heir Sambhaji deserted him and joined the Mughal general, Dilir Khan. Many attempts have been made to explain Sambhaji’s alienation from his father who, it is said, did not understand the psychology of his son. During his Karnataka campaign, Shivaji had left Sambhaji at Shringaipur in charge of the Subhedari of Prabhavali, so that there might be no conflict at Raigad where the younger son Rajaram was kept. But Sambhaji entered into secret correspondence with Dilir Khan, and when this came to light, he was removed to the fort of Parli under the care of Samarth Ramdas Swami. On 13th December 1678, Sambhaji overawed the qiladar and fled to Dilir Khan’s camp. Shivaji’s son-in-law Mahadaji Naik Nimbalfcar, who was then in the Mughal camp, asked Sambhaji why he had come to Dilir Khan. Bhimsen Saksena tells us that Sambhaji reported this to the Khan, who promptly airested Mahadaji and kept him in confinement for some days. Sambhaji 9. J. N. Sarkar, op.cit.^ p. 276. THE LIFE AN0 TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ * 37 accompanied Dilir Kliau on hi& campaigns, but in about a year’s time got sick of him and his cruel ways. In the meantime, Shivaji’s agents were also active in trying to persuade Sambhaji to return to his father. On the night of 20th November 1679 Sambhaji slipped out of the Mughal camp and reached Panhala by about the 4th of December. Sabhasad has given a very touching description of the reunion that took place between father and son, when Shivaji said: (Do not desert me, my child) He offered to Sambhaji the dominion of Jinji, but the latter replied: «Trm% (I crave for your august feet and shall lead a life of simplicity in your service). In August 1679, Shivaji took up seriously the work of forti- fying the island of Khanderi, 11 miles south of Bombay and 30 miles north of Janjira. His idea was to build up a naval base there to counter the activities of the Siddi of Janjira who was well entrenched on the western coast and caused harassment to Shivaji’s subjects. The English, who had their seat at Bombay, were however apprehensive at this and their Deputy Governor requested the Maratha Commander to ‘‘quit the place (Khanderi) as it belonged to the island of Bombay”. As the request was declined and the work of fortifications went ahead, an encounter took place between the Maratha s and the English in which the latter were worsted. In November 1679 when the Siddi also joined the English in blockading the island of Khanderi, Shivaji threatened to invade Bombay and gathered a large army at Kalyan. The President and the Council of the English at Surat became alarmed at this and, much against the recommendations of the Deputy Governor, they made peace with Shivaji. Khanderi remained in the hands of the Marathas. On 2nd April 1679, the Emperor Aurangzeb issued a general order imposing jaziya on all his Hindu subjects. This brought forth a spirited but cogent letter of protest from Shivaji which entitles him to a place among the greatest Indians of all times. The letter was drafted by his secretary, Nilakanth Prabhu, in eloquent Persian. Shivaji writes : SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA To the Emperor Alamgir. This firm well-wisher Shivaji, deeply grateful for divine favour and your kindness as clear as daylight, begs to inform your Majesty as follows : I returned from your presence without seeking your permission. It is my misfortune. But I am ready to serve you in every possible way. . May your kindness be felt by everybody. As a well-wisher I am placing some matters before you. Recently it has come to my ears that owing to your war against me, your treasury has become empty. You have decided to meet the expenditure through the imposition of jaziya on the Hindus. Your Majesty, Akbar the founder of your empire ruled for fifty-two years. He adopted the excellent policy of treating with peace and equality, Christians, Jews, Muslims, Dadupanthis, Stargazers, Malakis, Atheists, Brahmins, Jains, in fact all the communities. His aim was to ensure the welfare and prelection of all. That is why he came to be known as the jagadguru. The result was that to whatever direction he turned, success and glory attended his arms. He brought most of the cotmtry Under his sway. After him Nuruddin Jahangir ruled for twenty-two years. He led a life full of good deeds and became immortal. Shah Jahan ruled for thirty-two years. He too made his life fruitful through good deeds. That is why these rulers were successful in whatever direction they turned. During their rule a number of provinces and forts came under their sway. They have passed away, but their name endures. Their greatness is beyond description. One measure of their greatness is that Alamgir has tried to imitate them but without success. He is at a loss to understand why this should be so. The previous rulers, had they so desired, had certainly the power to impose jaziya. But they felt that all men, big and small, were the children of God, and all religions, but means to the worship of the Almighty. They never allowed the feeling of religious hatred even to touch them. The memory of their kindness, and the good deeds they did. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI MAHARAJ 39 : is always fresh in the world. All men great and small praise and bless them. During their rule the people had peace, and as a result, their glory increased day by day and success attended their affairs. But during your regime many provinces and forts have gone out of your hands. The remaining provinces and forts too will be lost to you. I will not spare any effort to ruin the provinces. Your subjects are crushed. The income from your Paraganas and Mahals is decreasing day by day. It is difficult to realise even one thousand from places the income whereof was one lafch previously. Poverty is striking the kings and princes. The plight oiF noblemen and mansabdars is apparent to everybody. At present your soldiers are discontented, the Moslems are in anguish and the Hindus are scorched. Men are pining for bread. They are red in face because they have been striking their mouths with their hands. They are in such deep distress, and yet you have imposed jaziya on them. How could you do this? This evil news will spread from east to west. People will say ‘‘The Emperor of Hindustan has taken a begging bowl and is out to realise jaziya from Brahmins, Jains, Sadhus, Jogis, Sanyasis, Bairagis, the poor and the starving people. He takes pride in doing so. He is laying in dust the name of the Taimur dynasty.” Such will be the deep feeling of the people. Your Majesty, in the Quran, God has been described as the Rabbul Alameen, the Lord of the entire universe, and not as Rabbul Musalmin, the Lord of the Mussulmans. In fact, Islam and Hinduism are both beautiful manifestations of the Divine Spirit. The call for prayers is given in the mosques, bells ring to the Divine glory in the temples. Any- one bearing fanaticism and religious hatred must be said to be acting against the commands of God. To presume to draw lines on these pictures is verily to lay blame on the Divine Artist (God). To point out blemishes m any creation only means that you are blaming the creator. Do not do so. To be just, jaziya cannot be justified on any grounds. It is an innovation in India. This is unjust. If you feel 40 SHIVAJI AND SWARArYA that on grounds of religion and justice the imposition of this tax is essential you should first realise it from Raja Rajsingh. For he is the leader of the Hindus. It will not then be difficult to realise it from this well-wisher. ^0 This plea for tolerance in public affairs is indeed the plea of a great patriot and a great Indian. In an age of bigotry, Shivaji stands out as the beacon-light of true religious understan- ding. As Sarkar observes : Religion remained with him an ever-fresh fountain of right conduct and generosity ; it did not obsess his mind nor hardenhimintoabigot.il Shivaji made endowments for Hindu temples as well as for Muslim mosques and saints’ tombs. Persons of all religions and commu- nities were equally eligible for service in his civil and military establishments. His private secretary was a Muslim named Qazi Haidar ; his chief naval commanders were also Muslims of the names of Daulat Khan and Siddi Misri. The insignia of royalty and the minting of new coins which Shivaji ordered indicate that he wanted to demonstrate his total break with the Mughal Empire. It was also his firm belief that his kingdom was divinely ordained TTSST f an^) and he used his royal authority for the well-being of his people. Shivaji was especially solicitous about the welfare of the peasantry. As the Zamindars were often unjust to the cultivators, he kept them under strict control ; and he did not create any fresh middle- men between the government and the tillers of the soil. Shivaji’s letter dated 1 6th April 1 673 addressed to the Jumledars, Havaldars and Karkuns in charge of his army at Chiplun, speaks volumes about his concern for the common folk in the country- side. Shivaji writes in this letter : 5^3^ f3T5arT% 5TW WWC, *1113, waft, Tr%. qft aft iinsf! aftawm 3rt|a ftf? arra; wnJrft WT^RftH. cUTsi lift 4ft tftw? 10.

There is no need for you to force any- body or to quarrel with anybody.) Shivaji threw careers open to talent and built up small men to achieve great deeds. Therein lay his genius as an administrator. Moro Pant Pingle, a family priest, could become his Prime Minister ; Annaji Datto, a village accountant, could rise to be his Finance Minister. The men groomed by Shivaji faced the greatest generals in battle and the greatest statesmen in diplomacy. Sonaji Pant Dabir negotiated with Aurangzeb and Sundarji Prabhu with the English. Prahlad Niraji was the Maratha envoy at the court of the Qutb Shah. Jadunath Sarkar has succinctly described the administrative deals of Shivaji in the following words : Shivaji aimed at giving Iris subjects peace, universal toleration, equal opportunities for all castes and creeds, a beneficent, active and pure system of administration, a navy for promoting trade and a trained militia for guarding the homeland, f 2 After December 1679, Shivaji’s health started declining. The incessantly hectic activity of nearly 35 years was telling upon him. On 23rd March 1680, he fell ill and around noon on Saturday, 3rd April 1680 (which was the full moon of Chaitra), this great son of India passed away into eternity. 12. J. N. Sarkar, House of ShivaJh p, 114, 4 42 SHIVAH AND SWARAJYA As I said earlier, the career of Shivaji is a fascinating story of continuously expanding horizons. The seed which he planted in the soil of Maharashtra eventually grew into a huge banyan tree with branches sprawling far and wide ; and within less than a century the Maratha influence was felt throughout the length and breadth of this vast country. A small stream had grown into the mighty Ganges. When Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded India from Afghanistan, the Rajput Princes remained aloof while the Rohillas and the Nawab of Oudh joined hands with the foreign invader. It was only the Marathas who met Abdali in battle in 1761 on the famous field of Panipat. They suffered grievous losses ; but Abdali returned to Afghanistan and never saw Delhi again. In the early 19th century even the British regarded the Marathas as their principal enemy and they sought to eliminate them from the pages of Indian history. The period up to 1760 was described in our text books as the Mughal Period and it was immediately followed by the British Period. No independent status was accorded to the Marathas. They were also characterised as plunderers and freebooters ; but mere plunderers and freebooters could not have ruled for over a hundred years. The 18th century in Indian history was truly the century of the Marathas, and it was Shivaji who awakened his compatriots to a consciousness of their national identity and inspired them to break asunder the several centuries old yoke of Turkish domination. The Royal Seal which Shivaji adopted aptly described his ideals and his achievements ; tITTffffr: TO (Like the new moon, this seal of Shiva, son of Shahaji, grows in splendour with every passing day. Respected by the whole world, it spreads its benediction over one and all.) May the memory of Shivaji and his teachings of patriotism, tolerance and universal welfare guide us in all our endeavours ! The Foundation of Swarajya J. V. NAIK The fouixdatioa of Swarajya by Shivaji was a decisive historical event. This unique phenoioenon in Indian history can hardly be ascribed to any particular cause. It was a composite movement caused by the interaction of various forces which had long been at work in Maharashtra. But it must be said at the very outset that it was left to the supreme genius of Shivaji to canalize all the available forces into one patriotic current and to establish an independent Maratha nation-state. Contemporary authors and later Bakhar writers considered Shivaji Maharaj an avatar (incarnation) and saw a divine hand in the foundation of Swarajya.^ Considering the almost mira- culous achievements of Shivaji, we can well understand their feelings. But curiously enough, even the contemporary foreign accounts lend support to the avatar theory when they speak of Shivaji in superhuman terms. ^ It was Justice Ranade who for the first time in hisj classic Rise of the Maratha Power gave a lucid exposition of the rationale behind the birth of the concept of Swarajya. The rise of Maratha Power, he pointed out, was not a mere accident of history; it was a great manifestation of a true national spirit, embodied in the concept of Swarajya. There is considerable force in Ranade's argument that “the ground was prepared partly by nature, partly by the ancient histoi*y of the country, partly by the religious revival, but chiefly by the long discipline in arms which the country had undergone under Mahomedan rule for three hundred years”.® 1.

Ranade, Rise of the Maratha Power, Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Delhi, 1961, p. 17. 44 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA One may not agree with all the conclusions of Ranade, but few will deny that it was he who for the first time took a dynamic view of Maratha history, and presented a new approach and a fresh outlook regarding the foundation of Swarajya. Ever since the days of Ranade, incessant research has been carried on in Maratha history.. The prodigious labours of historians like Rajwade, Kiiare, Sarkar, Sardesai, Bal Krishna and many others during the course of the present century have uncovered facts which impeach the validity of some of the former generalisations respecting the political life and thought of the Maratha people. The invaluable material that they have brought to light helps us to understand the Maratha freedom movement, under the extraordinary leadership of Shivaji, in its true historical perspective. The ideal of Swarajya came into being in response to the pressing need of the times. It signified the resurgence of Maha- rashtra which had fallen into a moribund condition under alien rule. It was not by accident that the Marathas inhabiting the hills of Sahyadri came to be politically sensitized beyond all other nationalities of India so as to establish an independent nation-state. Under the impact of forces working from within and without, there cropped up in Maharashtra something very akin to nationalism which facilitated the process of nation- building. Maratha nationalism was a compound of geographical integration and linguistic and cultural affinity, cemented by a common religious faith and stimulated by the galling Muslim domination.^ Of the various elements that went into the making of the Maratha nation, religion was perhaps the strongest at least in its formative stage. Ever since the advent of the Muslim Rule the people of Maharashtra had lived in a terribly depressing condition. Their freedom was lost; their religion was treated with open disregard and their cherished susceptibilities were outraged in a wanton manner.^ It was in this condition that 4. V. V. Joshi, C/as/i of Three Empires (The Rise of the Maratha Nation)^ Kitabistaii, Allahabad, 1941, pp. 49-70. 5, G. S. Sardesai, The Main Currents of Maratha History, (Mahikavati Bakhar cited), Keshav Bhikaji Dhavale, Bombay, 1933, p.3. THE FOUNDATION OF SWARAJYA 45 the concept of Maharashtra Dharma, which was at the root of Swarajya, came into beiag in defence of their way of living. It was not directed against Islam, nor was it intended for the propagation of the Hindu religion. It was certainly not meant to establish a communal empire. Its basic aim was to preserve and carry forward the ancient religion and culture of all the people residing in Maharashtra who are known by the compre- hensive term Maratha. But ‘^once the safety and integiity of Maharashtra Dharma was secured,” observes Prof. S. R. Sharma, "'it ceased to be merely or even mainly religious. It tended to become more and more political; but the original impulse indubitably came from religion,”^ A new moral force was added to the existing influences by the teachings of the saints of Maharashtra. Though it may be difficult to assess with precision their contributions to Maratha freedom, there is no doubt that the movement which the saints led for the spiritual and social emancipation of the masses produced a new spirit of democractic equality and homogeneity among the people of Maharashtra. The intensity of this socio-religious movement can be gauged from the fact that not only the peasantry but even the depressed classes produced saints like Chokhamela and Banka Mahar. ^ With Ramdas, the reformist movement underwent a profound metamorphosis ; it became a religio-political rather than a purely religious movement. There is no unanimity among historians and scholars regarding the exact relationship between Shivaji and Ramdas.^ Whatever the degree of their mutual acquaintance or intimacy, I suppose it will be agreed that they were "the best and greatest exponents of Maharashtra Dharma”, one represen- ting the political power of Swarajya and the other, the spiritual. The sterling qualities of the Maratha character form another important factor that needs to be stressed while accounting for the rise of the Maratha nation. After all, a nation could only be what its people make of it. The nature of the Maratha country 6. S. R. Sharma, The Founding of Maratha Freedom, rev. ed., Orient Lcng- nian, 1964, p. 2. 7. M. G.

They are : '‘self-reliance, courage, perserverance, a stem simplicity, a rough straight-forwardness, self-respect, a sense of social equality and consequently pride in the dignity of man as man”.^ These qualities of the Maratha character arc graphically recorded by a foreign traveller, the Chin- ese Yuan Chwang, as early as in the middle of the seventh century. When these spirited people came under the magic spell of Shivaji with his extraordinary vision combined with an equal capacity for initiative and organisation, they responded splendidly to his call for Swarajya. Another factor that contributed to Shivaji's phenomenal success in his nation-building activity was the existence of small centres of Maratha power scattered aU over Maharashtra. Owing to the smallness of their numbers, the Muslim Powers of the E>eccan had to leave much of their administration to the Hindus them- selves. Some of these Hindus rose to high positions in both the civil and the military administrations of the Deccan Sultanates and were granted watans and jagirs commensurate to their status. Some of the Maratha Deshmukhs must have held watans even before the start of the Bahamani rule. Thus, at the beginning of the 17th century there was a galaxy of Deshmukhs or Watandars—the Moies, the Shirkes, the Dalvis, the Jadhavs, the Nimbalkars, the Ghorpadcs, the Surves, the Sawants and others—^who were practically independent of the ruling authorities. Of course, there was no love lost bet- ween these Watandars. They had not only remained separate, but separatism had become the key-note of their political beha- viour. Their rivalries were so numerous, their feelings so hot, and their collisions so frequent, that for the sake of watan they were ever ready 'to do and die.’*° Shivaji shrewdly sought to convert the turbulent spirit and the intense love for the original patrimony of the Maval Deshmuklis into the larger and nobler cause of Swarajya by welding them into a single body politic. Those like the Mores who opposed him came in for severe punish- 9. J. N. Sarkar, Shivaji and His Times, 6th ed* Orient Longman Ltd., 1973, pp. 6-7. 10. Ibid, p. 10. THE FOUNDATION OF SWARAJYA 47 iBent. Tbe Ghorpades of Mudhol and the Manes of Mhaswad remained the faithful servants of Bijapur till the very end of that kingdom. The Sawants of Wadi yielded with reluctance to a superior force. It should therefore be noted that the old Maratha aristocracy contributed very little or practically nothing to the national movement until a later stage. It was the masses of Maharashtra, who suffered under these warring Deshmukhs and their overlords, the Muslim rulers of the Deccan, that hailed Shivaji as their deliverer and hero. It was these common folk of Maharashtra who constituted the real strength of Sh’vaji in his bid for Swarajya.’^l All these factors plus the two traditions coming down from the Yadavas of Devagiri and the Hindu Empire of Vijayanagara had prepared a psychological and moral background for the emeigcnce of the Maratha nation. Shivaji’s real work was to turn into one patriotic current all the available forces of the time political, moral, religious, anti-forcign—to build up a politi- cally independent Maratha State. The skill, tact and darirg with which he mobilised these forces and co-ordinated them for the common purpose of the attainment of Swarajya mark him out as the outstanding genius of his time. Without his guiding genius, it is oifficult to imagine how the Maratha political unity could have been achieved. The clue to Sbivaji’s amazing success in establishing Swarajya on a firm basis is to be found in the combined effects of the following : (1) The pioneering work done by his father Shabaji. (2) Shivajfs clear vision. Right from the start he was clear in his mind of the ultimate objective of achieving political independence for himself and his people. (3) His ability to make a conect appreciation of the existing geo-political situation of Mabarashtia and exploit it with consummate skill tc attain the end in view. (4) His military genius. He adopted such strategy and employed such military tactics as were eminently suited to bis purpose*- - 11. S. N. Sen, The Military System of the Marathas, Orient Longman, Bombay, 1958, p. 19; M. G. Ranadc, op, cit^ p. 31; J, N. Sarkar, op. cit., p. 30. 48 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA (5) His total self-reliance and complete independence from any oatside authority. Right from the very start he never recognised anyone as his suzerain. He was his own suzerain. (6) His capacity to harness the moral force which the people had derived from the preachings of the saints in the cause of the nation, by setting before them the grand ideal of Swarajya. (7) His success in securing the devotion of his people by good management and just administration. In short, it was the excellence of Sbivaji’s versatile genius that made the dream of Swarajya a dazzling reality. Shivaji did not start his work with a clean slate. Among the pioneers of the Maratha freedom movement. Shivaji’s father Shahaji occupies an important place. Both directly and indirectly he contributed to the marvellous success of his gifted son in the foundation of Swarajya. He provided Shivaji with an impreg- nable base in the Western Ghats for his early operations. When Shahaji sent his young son Shivaji to take charge of his Jagir in Poona, it seems he consciously provided him with a cabinet worthy of an inuependent King. Shamrao Nilkanth Ranjhekar was appointed as the Peshwa (Prime Minister); Balkrishna Hanu- mante was Mrrzumdar (Accountant General) , Sonaji Pant was Dabir (Secretary); and Raghunath Ballal was Sabnis (Paymaster). Besides these four trained and tried high-ranking officials, there was Dadaji Kondadev, a veteran administrator, who was charged with the duty and responsibility of guardian and tutor. ^ 2 Another direct inheritance of the son from the father was a grand lesson in strategy. As in Maharashtra, so also in Karna- taka, Shahaji had made a chain of forts connected with a forti- fied port the basis of his power, so that he could escape by sea if overwhelmed on land. Shivaji adopted and perfected the same policy for his own self-defence and aggressive movements. ’3 Indirectly, Shahaji inspired his son by his own dignified con- duct in his dealings with the Nizamshahs of Ahmednagar and the Adilshahs of Bijapur.

When that kingdom was extinguished in 1636 by the joint action of the Mughals and -the Adiishah of Bijapur, Shahaji was obliged to transfer his allegiance to the Court of Bijapur. But then he did two things, both of which proved to be of great significance in the history of Swarajya. Firstly, he insisted on and retained his Jagir in Poona> which subsequently became the cradle of Swarajya. Secondly, he con- sented to move off to the far south,, away from court intrigues, to find a new career of semi-independence. He acquired con- siderable territory in Karnataka. Later, Shivsji Maharaj strove hard to bring it into his own possession and named it ‘"Swarajya”, which significantly served as a place of refuge to tlie third Maratha King, Rajaram, in the hour of his distress. An authentic letter dated 6th July 1657 from Shahaji to Adii- shah provides a clue as to how Shivaji got his main inspiration for undertaking the difficult experiment of establishing Swarajya. Among other things, Shahaji writes. : I must remind your Majesty that I am a Rajput by race and will therefore never brook disgrace or disfavour while performing my duties to your Majesty. I have served four » different Courts till now, but never have I suffered indig- nities on any account ...If your Majesty therefore wants my services in the future, I demand that my status be restored to its former height; if I am not required, Your Majesty had better at once relieve me. After all this, I have no desire now to go in for any ambitious pursuits in search of fortune. I wiU retire to a sacred place of the Hindus and will serve there my Almighty Master and ever pray for Your Majesty. This document provides a commentary upon the character and ability of Shahaji. There is yet another valuable document which distinctly proves how Shivaji had the blessings of his father in his bid for Swarajya. It is a letter by Shivaji to his father in about 1664 informing him how he avenged the wrongs done by Baji Ghorpade, and of his success in that campaign against Khawas Klian, Sawant of Wadi 14.

What is important for our purpose is quoted here. Writes Shivaji : I have just received your letter blessing me in the following words: .... .... “By the Grace of God, I got over the difficulty, Kind Providence having given you the strength to fight for Swarajya and religion God Shiva and Goddess Amba are always your protectors and will. I am sure, give you victory. You must avenge all the previous wrongs on this occasion: I bless you, my worthy son”.l5 It is true that Shahaji did not have the clear conception of Swa- rajya which his gifted son had. But it must be admitted that Shahaji, in his own humble way, did serve the noble cause of Swarajya*which his great son made the mission of his life. The eternal gratitude of the son to his father is imperishably ins- cribed in Shivaji’s seal : That Shivaji had a clear conception of Swarajya, right from the start of his career, is proved by the letter he wrote to Dadaji Naras Prabhu Deshpande of Rohidkhore on 17th April 1645 Invoking Lord Rohireshvar, Shivaji writes : * TO 5 5$ ^ RHlw gTfqvirc ...... (It is God Rohireshvar that has given us victory; and that God would enable us to fulfil our wish of Hindavi Swarajya. It is God’s will that this kingdom should be established.) The memorable phrase “Hindavi Swarajya” appears for the first time in this historic letter. Some scholars followang Rajwade have expressed a doubt regarding the authenticity of this letter. Referring to this and two other letters in the same series, Rajwade says TO arlTORpfhl”. (The contents are true, but the letter is unreliable.) S. N. Joshi in a scholarly work, Arvachin Mahara- shtratihaskalatil Rajyakarbharacha Abhyas, says that we need not doubt the authenticity of such letters simply because 15. Ibid, pp. 144-5. ——— ' ' ' THl lOUKDAIfON OF SWAIUJTA 51 those who wrote thein out might have made some mistakes in transcribing certain words. V. Kale in his learned biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj included this letter among the credible oncst^^ Notwithstanding the authenticity or otherwise of this letter, the independent stand which Shivaji took right from the beginning of his political career is proof enough that he had a clear conception of Swarajya. Shivaji had received from his father a small jagir bounded by the rivers Bhima and Nira in the Poona district. Making it his base, Shivaji cautiously proceeded to accomplish his noblest mission of establishing Swarajya. In this his mother’s role was certainly the most decisive. It was Jijamata who moulded his mind and consciously and diligently prepared him for his historic role. Throughout his life, she was his constant source of in- spiration and courage in everything that he did for the sake of Swarajya. She was his living deity; indeed, ‘‘she was his living Bhavani”.^^ At the time of Shivaji’s appearance on the scene, Deccan politics were in a state of turmoil. Of the three surviving dynasties of the old Bahamani dominion, the Nizamshahi kingdom, which formed the major part of Maharashtra, was extinguished in 1636, and its territory was divided between the Mughals and the Adil- shah. And although in outward appearance the Adilshahi of Bijapur still looked imposing, in reality it had become decrepit and was tottering to its fall, owing partly to its own internal dissensions and partly to the Mughal onslaughts. It is at this point that young Shivaji, seeing his opportunity, entered on the ingenious, daring arid systematic course of liberating his country from the Mahomedan yoke. As Owen puts it: “Never was a great revolution begun more quietly and unostentatiously. A movement which was to pervade and convulse all India took its rise, like one of these Dekkan rivers (so to speak), in a corner, and in the bosom of the hills”. 16. S. N.

Owen, The Fall ofthe Mogul Empire, John Murray, London, 1912, p.57. 52 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA The nature and geographical situation of the Maratha country played a vital role in the consumniation of Shivaji’s grand scheme. The homeland of the Mavles is a conglomerate of rugged mountains and deep valleys, difficult of* access. The Maval country in Western Maharashtra had never really been subjugated by any Muslim power of the Deccan, in the sense that the Desh was. Here then was Nature, out to favour- the brave. It was here that young Shivaji first won the b.carts of b.is fellow countrymen by his great personal charm and magnetic personality. The brilliant image that he projected as a just ruler of the Maval region soon spread far and wide throughout Maha- rashtra. This historic land not only provided Shivaji with a strong base but also with his most tmsted lieutenants such as Baji Pasalkar, Yesaji Kank. Tanaji Malusare and others, who all became the pillars of his strength in his struggle for Swarajya. Truly, “the Maval country was the cradle of Shivaji’s power and the Mavles formed the backbone of his army”.’'b During his boyhood, Shivaji had the good fortune of having Dadaji Kondadev, a conscientious and able administrator, as his tutor, and also as the manager of his father’s jagir. Dadaji looked after the interests of his young master with honesty and integrity. He brought ordei- out of virtual chaos in the Maval country. He bestowed peace on its much harassed inhabitants by bringing to submission the turbulent and warring Deshmukhs and by introducing wise civil administration and revenue reforms. Thus he gave a good start to Shivaji’s great career. No doubt, Shivaji’s superb conduct of the administration of Swarajya was essentially due to his own creative genius; but the early lessons in the art of government which he received from Dadaji must have made deep impressions on his receptive mind. Brought up in the tradition of the old school, Dadaji could not however rise to the height of Shivaji’s lofty ideal of Swarajya. In fact, he was at times terribly distressed at the unconventional behaviour of his revolutionary ward. But it must be said in defence of the good old man that when he reahsed that Siiivaji was both earnest and capable of creating a new order, he whole- heartedly blessed him. Shivaji inaugurated his momentous journey towards independence 20, -J. N. Sarkar, op. cit., p. 27. 53 THE FOUNDATION OF SWARAJYA with the capture of Torna (1646) and successfully completed it with his coronation at Raigad in 1674. His career during this period is indeed a romance , of history. The remaining six years of his life were mainly devoted to the consolidation of Swarajya and adding to its territory by making fresh conquests in the far south. - The grand exploits of Shivaji are too well-known to be repeated here. We may just touch on those principal events in his career which form milestones in the rise and fulfilment of Swarajya. He began his independent career by capturing old forts and build- ing new ones, and enforcing his authority judiciously but firmly in his father’s jagir. The acquisition of Javali from the Mores forms the next landmark (1656). Three years later, through sheer personal valour he scored a brilliant victory over the boast- ing Bijapuri Sardar, Afzal Khan, and thoroughly exposed the pretensions of the Adilshahi might (lOth November 1659). The very next year, he succeeded in fooling the enemy at Panhala (13th July 1660). Thereafter he did not have any appreciable resistance from Bijapur. His first serious encounter with the mighty Mughals ended in the utter humiliation of Shaista Khan, Mughal viceroy of the Deccan (1663). These and the many other incredibly daring feats of Shivaji struck terror into the hearts of ail his rivals, and at the same time firmly established his repu- tation as a born leader, intrepid soldier and grand strategist. A realist to the core, Shivaji next made a friendly compromise with Jaisiiigh by signing the treaty of Purandar (1665), and upon his advice visited the Mughal court at Agra (May 1666) and used this opportunity to study the condition of the Mughal Darbar. Flis dramatic escape from captivity is nothing short of a miracle. Back at home, he devoted his first three years to the internal administration of his kingdom, and thereafter continued his career of uninterrupted conquest, and in 1674 had himself crowned Chhatrapati at Raigad. The Rajyabhishek which took place on 6th June 1674 was only the grand culmination of a unique career which evoked the admiration and wonder of one and all, including his political enemies. After having established him- self as sovereign over Maharashtra* Shivaji Maharaj turned his attention to Karnataka. His conquests in the far south, which he made an integral part of Swarajya, form the last phase of his glorious career. 54 SHITAJI Am> SWAItAJYA From a small jagir of his father’s from Junnar to Supa, Shivaji extended his Raj from the Arabian Sea in the West to the river Bhima in the East, and from the Godavari in the North to the KLaveri in the South. This he achieved in the teeth of the opposi- tion of the Mughal Empire, then at the height of its power, and of Bijapur, Golkonda, the Portuguese in Goa, ard&e Siddisof Janjira, not to speak of numerous other small chieftains. In this and in several other respects, Shivaji stands alone and unique in the whole of Indian history. No doubt the compact kingdom of Shivaji Maharaj was not very large in physical extent, but the real glory and greatness of Swarajya was essentially due to the ideals for which it stood, and the principles by which it was governed by its great founder. Ramchandrapant Amatya, who accurately reflects the political mind of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in his AJnapatra ani RajanitU provides us with a clear idea of the essential features of the grand polity of Swarajya. The cardinal principles of Shivaji’s administration of Swa- rajya were ; i) To promote the well-being of his people and the general welfare of the State. ii) To maintain an efficient military force to defend Swarajya. iii) To provide adequately for the economic needs of the people by encouraging agriculture and industry. As Jadunath Sarkar has correctly described it, ‘‘Shivaji’s domination spread fiirst of all through the conquest of hearts which the honest and strong administrator alone can achieve among a simple rustic population”. His truly paternalistic approach, his strong sense of justice and genuine concern for the welfare of his people made an intense appeal to the people of Maharashtra. They looked up to him as their liberator, emancipator and protector. The unbounded admiration which the 21. A.

Shivaji was a pious Hindu and a great devotee of the Goddess Bhavani, but his piety was a purely personal affair. When it came to the affairs of the State and the welfare of his subjects, whether Hindu, Muslim or Christian, he never allowed religious considerations to affect his State policy. He appointed a number of Muslims to .high positions of trust and responsibility in the civil as well as in the mihtary establishment. How greatly he respected Islam and its followers is borne out by evidence from no less a person than his worst critic Khafi Khan, the celebrated historian of the Emperor Aurangzeb.^^ Swarajya could hardly have been founded without the military genius of Shivaji. He was a born military leader. He thorou- ghly imderstood the geographic factor in military tactics. For the protection of Swarajya he made the hillforts along the Sah- yadri Ghats his main line of defence. With sound military instinct he created a marvellous second line of defence in the Kaveri valley, to which he could retire in an emergency. Reali- sing that it would not be possible for a power to dominate the Deccan without a strong navy of its own, he created the Maratha Navy.2^ He kept his army in constant readiness by providing all essentials and enforcing exemplary, discipline.^^ He developed an extremely mobile mode of warfare, avoided pitched battles, and adopted guerrilla tactics which eminently suited the genius of the Maratha people. He had the divine gift of judging charac- ter at sight and choosing the right man for the right job.^? Above all, not by precept but by personal example, he inspired all who had the privilege to serve under his command. The concept of an economic^y prosperous and flourishing people was ever present in Shivaji’s ideal of Swarajya. He knew that the first duty of a ruler is to make his people prosper.

Thus, not only did Shivaji found Swarajya, but he placed it on a stable and solid foundation. The splendid achievement of Shivaji Maharaj is brilliantly summed up by Ramchandrapant Amatya in a single sentence : '' (He created an altogether new order of things.) What does ‘Swarajya’ signify to us? The coming of Swarajya opened a new and glorious chapter in Indian history, written by the genius of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The imperish- able achievement of Shivaji’s life was to breathe into his fellow- countrymen a spirit of self-reliance and independence.'^^ The resolute passion for independence which he kindled in the bosom of his people is the most precious legacy of his Swarajya to modern India. The grand lesson that he gave us in patrio- tism is something unique and eternal. Among his other great gifts were peace and beneficent administration. When we view bis total performance, especially against the socio-political back- ground of his times, this sovereign of Maharashtra stands com- parison with any of the greatest nation-builders and benevolent rulers of the world. The impact of Swarajya on Iiftian history has been a decisive factor in later events.

THE FOUNDATION OF SWARAJYA 57 from tlie Maratha War of Independence (1689“ 1707) to India's struggle for freedom, every great national movement has drawn inspiration from the life and deeds of Shivaji. In spite of his best efforts and enormous resources, Aiirangzeb failed against the Marathas because “he was totally unable to appreciate their higher moral characteristics; the resolute passion for national independence which their leader had kindled in their bosoms; their intense devotion to the memory, the example, and the institutions of their heroic and indomita- ble chief; and the confidence which he had imparted to them that the Imperial power, so far from being irresistible, was extremely vulnerable, and if persistently assailed on his method, might be brought low in the end”.^l The successful Martatha War of Independence against Aurangzeb was the vindication of the national spirit that Shivaji had so assiduously cultivateb among his people. Many a soldier and leader of the Indian Revolt of 1857 against the British Raj was inspired by the memory of Chhatrapai Shivaji Maharaj. The leaders of the nineteenth century India- Renaissance like Nyayamurti Ranade looked back to the resur gent Maharashtra of Shivaji’s making, for their guidance and inspiration. “Swaraj is my birth right and I shall have it”, declared Lok- manya Tilak, who started Shivaji Utsav to stimulate Indian nationalism against British rule, perhaps only an echo of what that great master and maker of the Maratha nation had said as early as the year 1645. 31. S. J. Owen, op. cit., p. 90. Ihe Significance of the Coronation S. R. TIKEKA.R The entire Hindu world has rejoiced, as never before, in three or four great events in recent times. The Coronation of Chhatra- pati Shivaji 300 years back is, of course, the first of them; and the second place can be given to the installation of the Shrine- eternal of Somnath after we became free. About the third, there are likely to be two opinions, but unanimity can be achieved by taking the two together as one big event. The completion of the History of Dharmasastra, which is in fact a cyclopaedia of Hinduism, by Mahamahopadhyaya P. V. Kane, is one event and the other is the completion of the critical edition of the Mahabharata with international cooperation. These then are the events that have had a continuous and cumulative effect of happiness and satisfaction on the Hindu mind. Shivaji, son of Shahaji Bhonsale, was crowned Ciihal.apaii; and Gaga (also known as Vishveshvar), son of Dinkar Bhatt had come all the way from Benares to officiate as the royahpriest. Any other Brahmin would not have served the purpose, and it is doubtful whether anyone had come forward to take up the responsibility. For one thing, there was no information about a function of that magnitude in the living memory of the local priests. It was doubtful if even their grandfathers had heard of a coronation. For another, the difficulties of undertaking such a function in the case of Shivaji, according to small minds expert in making out a case why a proposal cannot and should not be accepted, were: (i) the Kshatriya origin of the Bhoiisales had to be established, (ii) adequate expiation for the lapse of many years without an upanayana had to be made, and the ceremony performed at that late stage, and (iii) marriages had to be performed according to Vedic rites (with the same wives). Each of these points was knotty enough to be decided only by the Pandits of Kashi, which was the place of appeal in all such cases. Gaga’s willingness to undertake the entire responsibility THE SIGNIFICAKCE OF THE CORONATION 59 shows his sterling merits and his conMence in his capacity to plan out the details of a ritual that had not happened in living memory. That master-mind was able to devise the 10-day ceremony in all its functional and ritualistic aspects and to lay down the modus operandi in a clear-cut and easily understood way for the local Brahmins to follow. Needless to say, such a peformance was quite impressive to the local priests, and they bowed down before the authority of the learned pandit from Benares. In implicitly following him and his instructions in the ceremonial ritual, they paid their tribute to his standing in the priestly world. In thus shouldering the responsibility of the Coronation, it was obvious that Gaga had found solutions for all the three knotty problems which stood in the way of Shivaji’s rising to the throne to occupy it in his own right. How he did it, and under what authority from the Dharmashastras, can best be judged from a battle royal that went on between two stalwarts, each worthy of salutations from one and all in the academic world. The way in which Gaga overcame the hurdle of the lapse of many years without an upanayana was not quite justified, according to a brilliant scholar and judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice K. T. Telang. He was not able to find support for Gaga’s action imder the circumstances. Justice Telang com- plained that Shivaji had already been married eight times before being crowned; his son was already married at the time. To make amends at such a late stage in life, for all these years of lapse from performing the thread ceremony, was too much for Justice Telang to condone. So his outburst was expressed in strong words: The thread ceremony essential for a Kshatriya was performed on Shivaji at a time when he was forty-six or fifty years old and had already had two sons—an irre- gularity wliich also was, we are told, expressly assented to by all the Brahmans and Pandits, How the Brahmans and Pandits worked their way to this decision, none of our authorities states. Further, it is remarkable that none of those authorities anywhere mentions the performance of the thread ceremony upon any of the members of Shivaji’s SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA 60 " family, except the ones who were installed on the gadi.^ To this judicial giant, another intellectual giant. Dr. P. V. Kane, nas given a fitting reply : Mr. Justice Telang writes rather like a judge than like a scholar or a historian. The judge has to give a decision on the evidence adduced by the parties before him. It is no part of his business to collect evidence for himself. But the role of a historian is entirely different. He must not only try to read all the evidence available till the time he writes; but he must himself ferret out all possible evidence and make searches in places where evidence is likely to be found. Above all, he must be cautious in his condemnations of persons long dead, on the strength of the meagre evidence read by him. Mr. Telang wrote the paper above referred to in 1892, but long before that, Poraskar (in 1892) and Apastamba (in 1886) had been translated and published in the Sacred Books of the East series. But he, though a great judge and also a great Sanskrit scholar, nowhere shows that he had cared to see whether shastric rules allowed the Upanayana of a man himself at any age whatever after some penance. If he had seen those rules, he would not have unjustly taken to task Pandits that flourished 200 years before him and attributed irregular motives to theni. It does not appear that he made any search in the archives of Udaipur durbar to see how Shivaji traced his descent from the Sisodia clan nor does it appear that he even went to Mudhol and other places in Maharashtra where ancient Maratha families have been holding sway for centuries.^ Here then you have a battle of wits at the highest intellectual level. The historian of the Dharmashastra has of course the last word and we must take him as the final authority. That shows what a controversial decision Gaga had taken in the interests of the people of the times; and such a step was possible only because of his towering stature. 1. M. G.

Hindus that in the Kaliyuga there was no Kshatriya living, which meant that no Hindu could be a real king. Raja as an honorary title, many sardars could have; but a throne and a coronation were far beyond their reach. Kingship was equated with a divine authority; it was not the divine right of kings as understood in Europe. This was a firm belief that a ruler, a crowned king, was like a God. The exact saying is: > literally meaning that only Vishnu can be the Lord of the Earth (King). Kingship meant sharing the mastery over the earth; and the earth as Bhu Devi is the second wife of Vishnu, the first being Lakshmi. Hence a king shares the lordship over the earth with Vishnu. To be able to be a peer of Vishnu, you must belong to the Kshatriya class, and in the Kaliyuga that class did not exist. Be that as it may, the conditions of the times were such as made another coronation necessary, and it was under the gui- dance of Nischalpuri that it was carried out. Here the Mantric and Tantric—^but not Vedic—^rituals dominated. The differ- ence between the two indicates clearly the local prejudices which were firmly embedded in the public mind. Even the greatest authority of Gaga from Benares did not prove impressive before them. Hence Nischalpuri's effort of appeasing the local gods. This is neither the place nor the occasion to go into the disputed point of the Vedic versus the Mantric type of coronation. In Maratha social life, the controversy has raged over many years and it is known as the Vedokta Prakarana. For the purposes of our topic it is enough to note that there were two coronations: one to establish that Shivaji belonged to the Kshatriya clan and that he could be crowned a Chhatrapati and the other to show that he was not entitled to the Vedic form of recitations at the time of the coronation* It must then be taken as a progressive acceptance on the part of Nischalpuri that he approved of the proposal of Gaga to have Shivaji crowned; the way of crowning may be different. But that Shivaji was considered worthy to be crowned was quite a welcome and reformist attitude. But what does a coronation really mean? What constituted its full performance ? Actually, from the term employed in the Dharmashastras, the coronation of a King is a ceremonial bath, an abhisheka. 62 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Whether a crown was actually used or not in India, we do not know. The reference to patta (in pattabhisheka, patta-rani) is there, and out of fifteen different meanings of the word, one does signify a head-dress, which may be considered as a sort of a crown. In one book it is mentioned that th.:: length of the patta should be twice the breadth at the centre v.nd this does indicate that it was a broad head-dress. In many it^ge-plays even today the royal figures appear with a silken broad cloth round the head. That again is according to a meaning of the word patta. The King is considered the protector of the earth; in fact he is wedded to her, and hence becomes a part of Vishnu whose second wife is Bhu Devi, the earth. According to the English custom, the sceptre and the crown seem to be the symbols of royalty. According to the Hindu custom, chamara and chhatra are the inseparable emblems of royalty. Chamara is the fly-whisk made from the tail of the wild cows of Nepal (Chamari; hence, i. e. the wild cows are killed for the sake of their hair), and chhatra, a royal umbrella. The danda is also mentioned; but it is to be carried by others, not by the King. The chamara and chhatra also are carried by others. Only the patta, whatever it may mean, is put on the head or forehead by the king. According to the Islamic custom, the morchel and mahimaratab were the insignia of royalty. A morchel was a bunch of pea- cock tails held on one side of the person, while he occupied his exalted seat. On the other side was the flag with the figures of a fish. The coronation of a Hindu King meant that he undertook to rule the country and its people according to the dictates of Dharma. What he had to do was to observe Dharma so that the people were protected and that they were happy; thus the earth too was happy and prosperous. It is interesting how the texts of the various authorities are unanimous on this point. In, the happiness of the people, the kings sought their own happiness. At one place, the Mahabharata asks the king to follow the way of the would-be-mother. As she is very careful about the well- being of the child unborn, so also should the king be careful that he guards the interests of the people entrusted to his care. Was THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORONATION 63 it a chance coincidence or was it by plan, that those very sentiments found a place in Queen Victoria’s Proclamation, issued as she took over the empire of India under her care ? In their prosperity will be our strength; in their content- ment our security, and in their gratitude our best reward. The Hindu ceremony of instituting authority in an icon or an idol has its counterpart in human relations also. The ruler had to be properly instituted with authority to be able to rule. Without such a ceremony, his writ had difficulty in being honoured and respected. With the investiture of authority, i. e. after the coronation, the ruler was within his right when he issued this order or that. He had the full judicial authority to pronounce capital punishment, even as a king had the inherent right to grant pardon in such extreme cases. The need for such a ceremonial function will be realised only after appreciating the scale of gradation, into which the people were divided; and gradation was the hall-mark of Hindu society. Thus the Mores of Javli considered themselves far superior to the Bhonsales. Why? The reason may sound ridiculous; but even as seniority in service counts for much in government, one need not laugh at the Mores, who considered themselves superior to the Bhonsales on the strength of the family’s far longer service under the Adilshahi. By the coronation, the Bhonsales were at once raised to the highest place in the social scale. According to one authority on Shivaji’s times, some of the Brahmans were not so willing to obey Shivaji’s orders, and they considered him not to be a constituted authority for dis- pensing justice in social or other disputes. To satisfy such doubting Thomases, it was necessary to have a regularising ceremony—the coronation—^performed as soon as possible. It is pertinent to note that among the expiations W'^hich Shivaji underwent before being formally crowned, there was one for a possible Brahma-hatya (death of a Brahmin) by one who was already a grand hero of many battles. What then were the responsibilities of a king crowned according to the Dharmashastras? What did the coronation signify? Rajadharma enjoined on the kings to undertake to govern according to dictates, not of his own but of Dharma. ^nd that Dharma was as old as man. 64 , SHIVAJI AND SWAEAJYA (When there was neither king nor kingdom, no punishment nor punishing authority, [ under such conditions ] the people protected themselves [by mutual cooperation ] by observing Dharma*) A crowned king has to respect the dictates of such a Dharma, which assures full protection to all the people. It is common knowledge that the king as a ruler was entitled only to a sixth of the total produce of the land, which comes to a little more than 16%. So the ancient texts fully regulated the powers of the Sovereign, although he was equated with Vishnu, thus firmly establishing the overriding supremacy of Dharma. For these reasons, the coronation had established the Hindu Dharma firmly at a time when it was believed to be on the wane. Historians call the function epoch making because it does mark the beginning of a new, bright and hopeful era. That is also why the Raja Shaka, a new era, was introduced from the day of the coronation. The people were not expecting anyone from among themselves to be a king in his own right. But they were prepared to accept any Sultan or even a Siddi as a ruler on par with Vishnu ! It did not matter to them at all that the ruler was anti-Hindu in spirit and deed. Shahaji, for instance, was virtually a king-maker; he carried the infant Nizam shah in his lap. The thought of having a throne for himself never crossed his mind. Similarly, many Maratha sardars knew full well that this or that Sultanate depended on their valour and swordsmanship. Yet they never desired a throne for themselves. Their loyalty even to the weak occupant of the throne was exemplary. They were more loyal than the king! It was a curious mind that believed that there were no kshat- riyas living and therefore the Hindus could not be kings, but at the same time felt that any chance comer who could usurp the throne by hook or crook was entitled to be respected by the people. It was this utter humility to and full dependence on the Sultans that Shivaji revolted against. He wanted his countrymen to be free and self-respecting. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CORONATION 65 Reverting back to Gaga and his grand ceremonial, we note with an unusual satisfaction that the royal function as outlined by him. was in full accordance with similar ceremonies as described in the Ramayana or the Mahabharata. Coronations had become quite unusual in those days and Gaga could only depend on the details as mentioned in the epics. He must be complimented for his wise vision and his uncommon boldness in acting up to that vision. Another contemporary pandit, the poet Bhushan, has observed: “If there were no Shivaji, all India would have been converted to Islam”. This then is the answer to the question about the significance of the Coronation. “If there were no Shivaji”, is the poefs way of saying, “if there were no coronation and if there were no Chhatrapati”, because Shivaji and his coronation are inseparables. When two cultures, the Hindu and Islamic, were together in close juxtaposition, with a powerful Islamic ruler at the top, there was always the fear of total disappearance of the other. In the present secular state of the Republic of India, we may not be in a position to appreciate adequately what the corona- tion meant to the then Hindu mind. We have seldom consi- dered why most of the historical Marathi papers that have been printed so far invariably bear dates according to the Islamic calendar. It is not yet adequately realised that Marathi voca- bulary generally and that of diplomacy in particlar, is overladen with Persian-Arabic words and expressions. All this has happened because of the dominant position which Islam enjoyed during many centuries. To a dominated people, the Coronation was an act of deliverance, bringing great hope and cheer. Shivaji by his coronation preserved this aspect of Hinduism for centuries. We are grateful to both Shivaji and Gaga for this epoch- making coronation, which was performed at Raigad just 300 years, back. The Ideals and Institutions of Swarajya CHIDAMBARA KULKARNI At the outset I must state that my study of Shivaji and the Marathas has been a part of my study of Indian history. There- fore I am compelled to present Shivaji, his ideals, institutions and achievements in the context of the long and fascinating his- tory of om motherland and to emphasize the significance of Shivaji as a great champion, a dauntless defender, an untiring carrier-forward of the torch of the immortal values and tra- ditions of our ancient heritage. History, according to the Indian tradition, is the unfold- ing of the human values symbolised by the term purushartha consisting of dharma, artha, kama and moksha. As these values are too well-known, I do not desire to elaborate on their meaning and significance. However, I want to bring to your notice that: The Indian life and culture, in all their myriad facets of religion, philosophy, ethics, literature, social organisation and traditions of art and architecture, have their secure roots in purushartha alone. A long procession of poets, philo- sophers, teachers, saints, law-givers and historians from the earliest age to this day have endeavoured to explain these universal values and have enjoined our people to strive for their realization in life. Purushartha, therefore, is the cri- terion of our history. An objective study of Indian history is possible only when we bear this in mind. Then alone we can discover the meaning and message of our heritage. Ihe message of our history is Universal Harmony. Indeed if one were to sum up the dominant theme that runs through Indian history in one word, it is samanvaya or har- mony-harmony between the individual and the society, between the ruler and the ruled, between the nation and the imiverse, between action and knowledge, between the material and the spiritual, between earth and heaven, and THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAIYA 67 not less significant, tlie harmony among the various castes, communities, creeds and faiths, gods and goddesses. Any meaningful interpretation of the events, personalities, tra- ditions and institutions has to project itself from this basic factA And the study of Shivaji’s ideals and institutions cannot be an exception to this. Students of Indian history can proudly recall to their minds the glorious periods when our ancestors reached great heights in various fields of life and culture by faithfully adhering to these values. We are also painfully aware of the periods of distress when departure from the accepted and well-tried tenets led to considerable disorder and chaos in our society and state. Precisely during such critical periods, there emerged great men thinkers, saints, rulers—^who succeeded in restoring faith and order and set the pace for progress. In fact Indian history is made up of a continuous series of renaissance movements. Shivaji appeared during one such distressing period. He was a product of the age of conflict. He imbibed into himself the spirit of renaissance. He understood the will of his age, put it into words and deeds and accomplished it. In Hegelian terms, what Shivaji did was the heart and essence of his age; he actualised his age. His ideals evolved as he grew; he established the institutions that reflected and facilitated the realization of these ideals. To understand fully the ideals of Shivaji and his swarajya, we have to look into his heritage, contemporary political and socio-cultural environment, the influences that moulded his personality, his own utterances and announcements, his coronation, his patronage of religion and scholarship and his creative struggle from the very beginning of his career to invest his polity with the spirit and form of dharmarajya. Such a study alone can help us to grasp fully the significance of Shivaji’s exploits, and policies and his mission in life, which was to lift up his people and weld them into a nation of strong, upright and valiant defenders of our precious heritage. To begin with, it is wefl to remember that Shivaji, as every- one else in the Deccan and the South, was an heir to the glorious 1 . Chidambara Kulkami, Vedic Foundations of Indian Culture, Shri Dvaipayana Trust, 1973, p. 66-7. 68 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA heritage of the Vijayanagara empire founded with the avowed purpose of defending the Hindu Dharma. Inspired and blessed by the great sage Vidyaranya, this great citadel of Vedic culture soon grew to be one of the most glorious empires in the world. Its impact on the course of Indian history and culture has been unique. Its abrupt collapse in 1565 was a national disaster and naturally lingered long in the minds of all patriots. The impact of Vijayanagara on Shivaji is seen in some of the dominant traits of his character, T. S. Shejwalkar points out that the great Maratha leader absorbed the spirit of Vijayanagara and this could be seen in Shivaji’s voraciousness in imbibing Hindu scriptures; his puncti- liousness in following the tenets of the Hindu religion; his enthusiasm in attending, when possible, the religious ser- mons; his humble submission to the religious preceptors; his generosity in endowing the edifices of God and the Brah- manical seats of learning; his faithfulness in proceeding, at great inconvenience and risk sometimes, to the shrines of deities to perform religious rites and offer devotion; and last but not least, his religious frenzies and his secret com- munion with the goddess Bhavani; all these speak of the man Shivaji and bear witness to the make-up of his mind. ^ Further, Shejwalkar believes that the atmosphere in Mahara- shtra was not congenial to the arousal of such religious fervour; Shivaji could, in all possibility, have absorbed these features during his stay at Bangalore with his esteemed father, Shahaji. But historians are not unanimous on this point. Indeed, the correct sequence of facts of Shivaji's early life is yet to be fixed beyond doubt. However, what is relevant to our discussion is that Shivaji most certainly imbibed the spirit and zeal of Vijayanagara and it does not matter much whether he absorbed it at his father’s court or from his learned tutors, who could not have totally missed the significance of the great empire which had collapsed not more than a century earlier, and which was still struggling to exist in the South. Shejwalkar asserts : 2. T. S. Shejwalkar, Vijayanagara Sexcentenary Commemoration Volume^ Vijayanagara Empire Sexcentenary Association, Dharwar, 1936, pp. 129-30. THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 60 We can take it almost for certain that Sivaji’s mind had become full of tales of Vijayanagara, of the exploits of its heroes and the cultural work of its learned men like Vidya- ranya. The fame of ‘Rama Raja Kanada’ and the historic battle of ‘Rakshastagdi’ had spread far and wide in Maha- rashtra, as we can judge by the existence of Marathi Bakhars on the subject and the casual mention of his name elsewhere. Subjectively speaking, it seems clear to us that Sivaji’s ideal was formed in the shadow of Vijayanagara. ^ That Shivaji aspired to stand forth as the successor to the great Vijayanagara empire is revealed in his later conquest of the Karnataka territory, his adoption of the Vijayanagara coin, the honnu, his modelling the governmental machinery on the Hindu pattern, his patronage of Vedic scholarship, his coronation and his dedication of the Kingdom to Ramdas. In brief, the Swa- raj}ra was, as S. R. Sharma puts it, the continuation of the Vija- yanagara Samrajya. It is desirable to note in this context that Maharashtra and Karnataka have been, since time immemorial, identical in culture, religion, deities, society, food, dress, language and literature. The close cultural affinity was maintained during the period of our study by the movement of troops, saints, scholars and traders up and down the entire Deccan and the South. The chosen deity of the Maharashtrians, Vitthal, was carried to Vija- yanagara for safe-keeping and brought back to Pandhar- pur when the situation became favourable. It is well-known that Vitthal is described as Kanadavu, his place as Karanataku. The social and religious movement launched by the saints of Maharashtra was again the continuation of the movements initiated by the Alvars, the Nayanars, the Shivasaranas and the Dasas. ' This is a convenient stage for passing on to a brief review of the nature of the bhakti movement and assessing its impact on the contemporary society and possibly on* Shivaji. Jnanadev was the first and foremost of the Maharashtrian saints. He brought the sacred knowledge within the reach of the humblest and thus ushered in the era of democracy in religion. That 3, T. S. Shejwalkar, opacity p, V29* 70 ' SmVAn AND SWARAJYA there were as many as five hundred and more saints in Maha- rashtra during the five centuries that followed the age of Jnanadev speaks for the tremendous vitality of the movement as well as its tenacity.. These propagators of the Bhagavat Dharma were acutely conscious of the miseries of the people and the oppressive rule of the mlenchhas. We may confine ourselves to the study of the conditions of the period as revealed in the writings of some of the prominent saints. Namdev for example says : The unclean yavanas have become kings; sins are being committed everywhere; hence there hath been divine mani- festation to blot out the evils of Kali. Kama says : the people, having foimd the yavanas unendurable, are singing the praises of God, for these are ever the means of redemption. Eknath wrote Wicked kings began to rule, and they exploited their subjects like thieves. Themselves worse than Shudras, they con- verted people of all castes. Such being the condition, Brahmanas gave up studying scriptures ; they became drunkards, served the ignominious, and fed themselves like dogs on the leavings of the Turks’ tables. In many of his abhangas, Tukaram sets forth a high and noble ideal of moral life. Sincerity, tolerance, forgiveness, humility, purity, compassion and service are stressed by him as aids to mukti. Above all, he emphasizes the unity and universality of life Through God the whole world is related to us; when a rope is stretched, every fibre is tense. The world is not worth- less or an object of scorn; see how each life is blended with the life of all. The joy and grief of others affect us, as our joy and grief affect them. Tuka says, when this pure prin- ciple dwells within the heart, the outward man is radiant with delight. It is no wonder that Tukaram made a profound impression on Shivaji, who used to attend the kirtans of this great saint. However, traditibn asserts that Tukaram directed Shivaji to Ramdas. Ramdas was a prophet of activism. He believed in and prea- ched social and political action. In his Dasbodh the religious quest is integrated with various arts and sciences of life. He 71 THE IDEALS AND INSTlTUnONS OF SWARAJYA founded 800 maths with akhadas and with the images of Sri Rama and Hanumant. In a letter addressed to Shivaji, Ramdas gives a poignant picture of the society and gives a call for con- certed efforts to throw away the oppressive yoke of the Mughal rule : Places of pilgrimage have been destroyed and homes of Brah- mans desecrated; the whole earth is agitated; Dharma is gone. Therefore, the Marathas should be mobilised; Maharashtra Dharma should be propagated. The people should be rallied and Med with a singleness of purpose; sparing no effort, we should crash upon the mlenchhas. It is also necessary to note that Ramdas advocated modera- tion. He declared that the wise should never be fanatical. Ramdas transformed the sahishnu attitude of the bhakti move- ment into the jayishnu attitude of the defenders of religion. It is not necessary to examine here the controversy over the nature of the relationship of Shivaji to Ramdas. It is enough to note that the teachings of Ramdas deeply influenced Shivaji, so much so that he dedicated his kingdom to the great saint. More than that, the teachings of Ramdas gave the people a correct idea of the great mission of Shivaji. This was a great help to the builders of the new nation. The contribution of this bhakti movement towards the foundation of Swarajya has been succinctly put by S. R. Sharma : In terms of Maratha history, we might describe Shivaji as a combination of Hanuman and Sri Ramachandra in the eyes of the masses. The emotional mysticism of Tukaram and the intellectual pragmatism of Ramdas must have been of considerable assistance to Shivaji in building up his great movement. He was certainly not writing on a blank page of history. The entire galaxy of saints had as much to do with the creation of a new Maratha Society as Shivaji. The psychological and moral foundations had been well laid before Shivaji’s military and political genius laid the coping stone. Maratha Swarajya of the 17th century was not the work of a single man, howsoever gifted. It was a mansion built by several hands, directed by several brains.^ 4. S. R. Sharma, The Founding ofMaratha Freedom, Orient Longman, 1964, p. 128. 72 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA More intimately, Shivaji was influenced by the teachings of his mother, his tutor and other learned scholars who were sent by Shahaji to train and prepare his illustrious son for the great mission of building up swarajya. Shivaji’s determination to establish an independent kingdom was given strength and sub- stance by all these elders who stood by him throughout his career. Shivaji’s letters, seals, titles and the very nature of his admini- stration, all breathe the spirit of the ancient Ramarajya or Dhar- marajya. His one great aspiration was to liberate the people from the oppressive rule of the Muslims. G. S. Sardesai quotes a passage from the writing of the court-historian, Sabhasad: Why remain content with the gifts conferred by foreigners or with our paternal acquisition only? We are Hindus* this whole country is ours, and yet it is occupied and held by the Muslims. They desecrate our temples, break our idols, plunder our wealth, convert our countrymen forcibly to their religion, kill cows openly; we will suffer this treat- ment no more. We possess strength in our arms. Let us draw the sword in defence of our sacred religion, liberate our native country and acquire new lands and wealth by our own effort. We are* as brave and capable as out ancestors of yore. If we undertake this sacred task, God will surely help us. All human efforts are so helped. There is no such thing as good luck or ill-luck. We are the captains of our soil and the makers of our freedom.^ Sardesai thinks that this passage gives expression to Shivaji’s sentiments. But what is more certain is that this passage sug- gests how the contemporary observers interpreted Shivaji’s mission. There is no doubt that Shivaji aspired to get rid of the Muslim rule and establish an independent polity which could ensure the people of the safety and security of their religion and culture. His ideal naturally was the ancient dharmarajya securely founded on the principle of samanvaya. There is ample evidence to show that Shivaji strove hard to establish a just rule, a rule based on the instruction of the shastras, traditions and opinions of the wise (shishta). The culmination of this endeavour was 5. G. S, Sardesai, New History of the Marathas, Voi. I, Phoenix Publications, Bombay, 1971, p. 103. THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 73 the grand coronation which gave formal recognition to the swarajya and defined its ideals and obligations in clear terms. The tercentenary of the Coronation in 1974 naturally created considerable interest in the people of India about Maratha history in general and Shivaji and his coronation in particular. There- fore, I do not wish to discuss it in detail. However, it is necessary for my study to point out that coronation enjoys the most pres- tigious position in the Hindu tradition. One becomes a ruler only after coronation; otherwise one remains a military adven- turer, however strong, just and humane one might be. Corona- tion invests in one the spiritual and political power to rule, protect and conquer. Shivaji was, before the coronation, an established ruler with an organised machinery of administration; he had the title Raja, his own flag, his own seal ; he was a sovereign both de facto and de jure in his own territory. In his age, the recognition accorded to him by the Mughal emperor was suffi- cient to make him the de jure ruler. But that did not make him an accredited monarch according to the shastras of the faith which he shared with his own people. Shivaji ardently desired to be such an accredited monarch and therefore he decided to undergo this very cumbersome and expensive Vedic ritual The coronation secured for Shivaji the approval of the people, invested in him the powers of the guardian-deities, and at the same time bound him by oath to the rule of dharma. It is signi- ficant to note that Shivaji did not acquire more powers by the coronation; on the contrary his absolutism was chastened into a monarchy obliged to rule according to the sacred law of the land. He could levy taxes, administer justice and cany on the military campaigns only according to Law and not according to his whims and fancies. He could never be arbitrary ^ Malhar Ramrao Chitnis in his Shiva Chhatrapatichen Charitra mentions that Shivaji took an oath (pratijna) at the coronation to restore the world which had been overrun by the yavanas (yavanakranta) and re-establish the Hindu dharma and to govern in accordance with the dharmashastras as befits a descendant of the ancient Sesodia line. That Shivaji willingly accepted the limitations on his sovereignty made him wwthy cf universal respect. The coronation assured Shivaji a place in the galaxy of the great monarchs of yore and inaugurated a new epoch in 6 74 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA the history of our country. Thus, Shivaji’s heritage, the spirit of the age, the influence of his mother and tutors, his own observations, the impact of Ramdas, all these moulded Shivaji’s personality. His ideal was the ancient dhaimarajya. Shivaji became, as Nehru points out, the symbol of a resurgent Hindu nationalism, drawing inspira- tion from the old classics, courageous and possessing high qualities of leadership. We have to assess and appreciate Shivaji’s achievements in this light. Long before the coronation, however, Shivaji had made the ideals of the dharmarajya his own. They were reiterated at the time of the coronation and again proclaimed in a document dated 28th January 1677, which S. R. Sharma terms as the possible Magna Carta of Maratha Swarajya : This document recounts the circumstances of Shivaji’s coro- nation in accordance with ascertained sacred laws for the protection of all Hindu religious and social traditions. It promises to render the most speedy and impartial justice to all who should invoke Shivaji’s dispensation following established traditions, scriptures and public opinion and calls upon people of all communities to act with one accord and cooperate with the government in defeating the yavanas coming from the north. This document reveals the spirit of Shivaji’s administration. It shows that he was not a mere empire-builder adding territory to territory. It proves that Shivaji was a man with a mission who drew his inspiration from history, from the classics, from the society and culture around him, from Ramdas and the saints of Maharashtra, and more constantly from his mother Jijabai as an embodiment of all these. Now, what were the ideals of dharmarajya adopted by Shivaji for his swarajya? The dharmarajya aimed at establishing a society based on dharma, the principle that holds people together. In other words, the ideal of the state was to promote , harmony among all people by protecting their life, property, rights and duties. The ruler was thus a symbol of harmony. He was to protect the subjects, promote their welfare, and administer justice, 6. S. R. Sharma, op, cit,, p. 198, THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 75 punish the wicked and in general create conditions necessary for progress. The conditions of an ideal state are summed up thus : 5T % sr i f?r: u (In my kingdom there is no thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without a sacrificial fire, no ignorant person, no adulterer, and where is the adulteress?— Upanishad, V. 11-5). The state must create such conditions that the people can live fearlessly as sons move about freely in their father’s house. The oft-repeated benediction reflects the aspirations of the people : 'irSOTsaien’iT t *«#»r ’Ptff \ ^T: >1 (May there be good for the subjects ! May the rulers rule the land by the path of justice! May there always be good for the cows and the brahmanas! May all people be happy!). Kingship in this context could be an institution of service and not of power. Bhishmacharya defines the rajadharma thus: Sacrifice of the self, kindness towards all beings, under- standing and protecting all people, redress of the aggrieved and rescue of the oppressed—^these constitute the dharma of rulers. The ruler was thus expected to identify himself with the subjects. The happiness of the subjects was to be his guiding motto. He had no other interests. What was liked by the people was to be the desire of the ruler. A ruler’s highest aspira- tion was the greatest happiness of his subjects. All ancient Indian thinkers thus emphasize the obligations of the ruler to society. Society indeed was higher than the state. The func- tion of the state was to maintain and protect the social order with all its values, institutions and traditions. Individuals and groups were to be given opportunities for performing their duties without let or hindrance. Erring individuals were to be punished, but according to law. Thus, the state and monarchy were endowed with powers because they were to perform the necessary functions. The very nature of the kingdom as con- ceived and practised throughout long centuries precludes all possibility of despotism. 76 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA The state or kingdom, according to Indian tradition, is a cor- porate entity with seven limbs or elements: swami, amatya, kosha, bala, durga, janapada and mitra. I will briefly discuss the nature and significance of some of these, with particular reference to their place in swarajya. Fortunately we have a comprehensive study of Shivaji’s polity in the Ajmpatra ani Rajaniti of Ramchandrapant Amatya. This great treatise not only summarises the traditional thought and practices but also deals with several contemporary situations and innovations introduced by Shivaji. The ‘swami’ or the ruler was undoubtedly the most important limb of the state. He was responsible for everything good or bad that happened in the kingdom. It was his responsibility to pilot the ship of state smoothly and ‘successfully. The ruler was to be a father to the fatherless and a son to the sonless.. Therefore, ancient thinkers emphasized the king’s personal character, his education and training, his austere life and his constant consultations with elders and ministers. The ruler had to perform a number of functions. A list of functions given by Ramchandrapant Amatya is interesting : Regulation of the royal troops, forts, fortresses, cavalry, infantiy; protection of the people; enquiring and looking into the prevalence of dharma and adharma; giving gifts at the proper time; payment of fixed salaries to the servants; collecting taxes from the people at the proper time; storing of acquired articles; keeping a regular check on income and expenditure; anticipating general, special, routine and unforeseen works by planning their execution beforehand according to their nature; punishing the guilty after deter- mining the punishment in accordance with the shastras and taking into consideration what is just and what is unjust; planning of the means to ward off the dangers of foreign invasion; collecting information by sending spies to different countries; timely consideration of diplomatic ties—^peace, war, neutrality towards the enemy; protection of the existing territories and acquisition of new ones; proper observance of delicate rules regarding female apartments; promoting further the prestige of respectable persons and keeping baser elements within limits; acquiring the blessings of gods and THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 77 god-fearing and pious brahmanas; destroying unsocial tendencies and promoting dharma, thereby gaining the shelter of the eternal world. These and such others are the duties of the king. All students of Shivaji’s career know that Shivaji exerted him* self to the utmost to perform all these functions and more, most efficiently and with an eye on the welfare of his subjects* All sections of the subjects praised him without reservation. The Brahmans called him ‘go-brahmana pratipalaka’ ; the Marathas felt elevated; the merchants, agriculturists and artisans breathed freely; the masses were liberated from the oppression of the yavana rule and hailed him as an avatar of Shiva. Per- haps the most wholesome appreciation came from Swami Ramdas: Remember Shivaji! And count this life as grass! In this world and the next, rely on fame alone. Remember Shivajil His form, his noble arms. Forget not also all his valiant deeds on earth. It is eigrJficant that this praise is from one who ruthlessly censured all the hypocrisy and magic of the so-called saints. Ramdas Swami was a hard task-master, and that Shivaji could win such adoration from him is really gratifying. Even Aurang* zeb had to admit Shivaji’s magnanimity and outstanding ability* The unique character of Shivaji as a ruler will be brought out in the concluding remarks. Here it is sufficient to note that Shivaji achieved remarkable success in realizing the ideals of a dharma pravartaka. Cleverly enough, Ramchandrapant gives the list of royal func* tions at the beginning of the section on ministers and points out that these functions can be performed only with the assistance of the ministers. But curiously, he does not make any reference to Shivaji's council of eight ministers. The minister in the Ajmpaira i» no doubt an exalted functionary but only a sar- karkun. He is next to the ruler in authority, dignity and qualifi- cations. Perhaps this arrangement was suggested by him for the smaller state of Kolhapur* Yet it is difficult to understand why the author, himself a member of Shivaji’s council, did not refer to the most important limb of the Maratha State. It is certainly a serious lacuna in the otherwise comprehensive treatise Perhaps some pages might have been irrevocably lost. '78 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA There is no doubt that Shivaji governed with the help of an Ashta Pradhan Mandal consisting of the Mukhya Pradhan (Peshwa), the Amatya (Majmuadar), the Sachiv (Shuru-navis), the Mantri (Waqia-navis), the Senapati (Sar-i-naubat), the Sumant (Dabir), the Panditrao (Sadr) and the Nyayadhish (Qazi-ul-quzat). There was also a secretariat attached to this Council. All these ministers and secretaries worked during the pleasure of the monarch. They had no constitutional or legal status except that granted by the ruler. Yet it is to be noted that Shivaji’s ministers were of great eminence, senior in age, ripe with experience and unsurpassed in loyalty. As such, he usually listened to their advice. After all, the relation between the ruler and his ministers varies according to the relative strength of their personalities. What is quite relevant to our purpose is that Shivaji did have a council of ministers, as prescribed by traditional texts, to help him in governing the territory; and all of them shared his enthusiasm for bringing about the conditions necessary for the peace, progress and welfare of the subjects. Next in the order of importance is the element of the kosha or the treasury. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of a full treasury, a sound financial policy, a just system of taxes, revenue and customs and protection of trade and commerce, for the realization of the aims of a welfare state. That Shivaji took proper care of all these is well known. However, it is nece- jssary to emphasize at least two aspects of Shivaji’s financial admini- stration. Shivaji always exerted himself to keep his treasury full. And at the same time, he was very vigilant about expenditure. Ha did not like pomp or grandeur but lived in a very simple style. Orme writes : His life was simple even to parsimony; his manners void of insolence or ostentation; as a sovereign most humane and solicitous for the well-being of his people the same principles of frugality and expense were observed in the municipal disbursements of his governnient.^^ ;• It is true that Shivaji paid his ministers, officers and servants of all cadres quite well. But he was careful to maintain a strict 7. Cited in V. B. Kuikarni, Shivzsi \ theFortra.it of d. Patriot^ Orient Longman, 1963, pp, 218-19. THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA 7f watch on expenditure, so as to avoid any kind of waste. Such a sense of judicious economy is quite relevant today. Our administrators can learn at least this one important lesson and much of the present-day suffering of the people could be reduced It may be mentioned here that the Peshwas who refused to learn this lesson landed themselves and their people in serious trouble. Shivaji was a child of adversity and, appreciating the advice of the ancient thinkers, followed it faithfully, so that he was never handicapped in his career for want of money. Grant Duff, by no means an admirer of Shivaji, freely concedes: We view his talents with admiration, and his genius with wonder. For a popular leader, his frugality was a remark- able feature in his character; and the richest plunder never made him deviate from the rules he had laid down for its appropriation.^ Shivaji could restrain himself thus because he was free from any kind of addiction and was a man of strong and resolute character. This is an aspect of the great man’s personality that ought to be cherished by our leaders and administrators of today- The second aspect of Shivaji’s financial administration is the generosity with which he looked after the needy and patronised learning, religion and culture. It was the duty of the Panditrao to promote learning and dharma and to reward scholarship generously. One of the principles rigidly and constantly upheld and advocated by our ancient thinkers was that in a welfare state^ a state aspiring to achieve progress, men devoted to the propa** gation ofknowledge and enlightenment should never be compelled or even allowed to suffer destitution or seek patronage outside the state. On the contrary, the ruler of a dharmarajya should be able to attract scholars and wise men from the different regions. This again is one of the most relevant lessons for us today. If we take proper care of our men of genius and talent, the much-' lamented brain-drain will be considerably reduced.

To sum up, Shivaji’s Swarajya was the dharmarajya well- organised with saptanga, all the seven limbs functioning efficiently and harmoniously towards the realisation of the ideal of the maximum welfare of the subjects. Great historians and scholars have been full of praise and admiration for Shivaji’s success as a conqueror, ruler, leader and administrator. Jadunath Sarkar’s ©ft-quoted estimate of Shivaji is: Shivaji has proved by his example that the Hindu race can build a nation, found a state, defeat enemies; they can con- duct their own defence; they can protect and promote literature and art, commerce and industry; they can main- tain navies and ocean-trading fleets of their own and conduct naval battles on equal terms with foreigners. He taught the modern Hindus to rise to the full stature of their growth. ® But more eloquent and imbued with a pardonable sense of achievement is Shivaji’s own report communicated to his guru, Swami Ramdas : Obeisance to my noble Teacher (Ramdas), the father of all, the abode of bliss. Shivaji, who is merely as dust on his Master’s feet, places his head on the feet of his Master, and submits: I was greatly obliged to have been favoured by your supreme instruction, and to have been told that my religious duty consists in conquest, in the establishment of Dharma, in the service of God and the Brahmans, in the amelioration of my subjects, and in their protection and succour. I have been advised that therein is spiritual satisfaction for me. You were also pleased to declare that whatever I should earnestly desire would be fulfilled. Con- sequently, through your grace, I have accomplished the destruction of the Turks and built at great expense fastnesses for the protection and perpetuation of my kingdom. What- ever kingdom I have acquired I have placed at your feet and dedicated myself to your service. I desired to enjoy 9. J. N. Sarkar, jS/r/vaj/ and His Times^ Orient Longman, 1973, p.389. THE IDEALS AND INSTITUTIONS OF SWARAJYA Bf your close company, for which I built the temple at Chaphaj, and arranged for its upkeep and worship. Now, by way of conclusion I would like to say a few words about Shivaji’s unique role in history. In the life and achieve- ments of every great man there are discernible two distinct traits : one topical and regional and the other eternal and universal. Shivaji’s conquests, administration of Swarajya and humanitarian measures were of the first category. But his profound and burning patriotism, his passionate love of religion and culture and above all, his valiant but wise efforts to bring about harmony among the people of the two major communities as well as among the people of different castes of his own commu- nity belong to the category of the universal and the eternal They have made a lasting impact on the course of our history and culture* Shivaji’s life and achievements have been a perennial source of inspiration through Raja Chhatrasal, the Rani of Jhansi, Nana- saheb, Tatya Tope, KLumvarsinha, the revolutionaries of our freedom movement both in the North and South, the leaders and prophets of the greatness of Lokmanya Tilak, AurobindOa, Laia Lajpat Rai, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bipinchandra Pal and a thousand other soldiers of freedom as well as through eminenf poets like Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, Subrahmaaya Bharati and writers like Hari Narayan Apte and Venkatesh Tirako Kulkarni Galaganatha. Perhaps most relevant to our times and problems is Shwaji’s endeavour to establish harmony between the Muslims and Hindus, and among the people of different castes. Shivaji demonstrated great respect for Islam. He revered the Muslim saints and the Holy Koran and built mosques for the Muslim soldiers in his employment. He thus showed great tolerance and trusted the Muslim officers of Swarajya. Here what is note- worthy is that one can be tolerant and magnanimous only when one is strong. The move for harmony could be initiated only from a position of strength. This is the lesson we have to learn. The second aspect of social harmony achieved by Shivaji is quite enlightening. It is claimed that Shivaji’s employment ^ men of dijFferent castes was to effect a sort of check by them on each other. However, this interpretation is unfair to the great ruler who was also a visionary* Shivaji employed men of different SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA 82 eastes because he wanted them to learn to work and live in complete harmony and co-operation. Shivaji never assumed that men of different castes were rivals or jealous of each other. Today we are faced with this problem. I hope that our leaders, scholars and rulers will learn a lesson from the great founder of Swarajyaand spare no efforts to bring about complete harmony, not only between the principal religions and regional groups, but also among the citizens of different castes. Let us pray to that great Maker of History to lead us along the right path so that we can live and work in peace. ijTtrGsr w taaa ii Agni Deva who knowest all the ways.

(Yajurveda Vaj. XXVI. 2) The Place of Swarajya in Indian History M. S. AGASKAR During the 15th and 16th centuries there was a religious, social and literary revival in India, which was especially notable in the Deccan. This revival was chiefly the work of saints who belonged to different castes and classes; but it was not ortho- dox or ritualistic in character. Rather, it embodied the cult of Bhakti, which recognised no distinctions based on birth, caste or class, and advocated true devotion to God and love for one’s fellow-beings in preference to meaningless rites and rituals.* This socio-religious movement brought in its wake the pulsa- tions of a political awakening which prepared the Marathas to participate actively in the mission of Shivaji, and finally culmi- nated in the establishment of Hindavi Swarajya. In order to arrive at a proper assessment of the place of this Swarajya in Indian history, I propose to review briefly : 1. The origin, growth and extent of the Swarajya. 2. Its socio-administrative organisation. 3. The new principles and trends it introduced. 4. Its impact on the course of Indian history. Shivaji carved out his first compact possessions from the tract between Chakan and the Nira. In his early career, he was always thrown on his own resources and this enabled him to develop not only self-reliance but also a capacity to take the initiative without any sense of subordination or responsibility to a higher authority. Like Sher Shah who organised the tur- bulent Af^ns under his banner, Shivaji too organised the Marathas who resembled the Afghans “in their comWnation of courage, cleverness and power of endurance, in their ability to plan and execute surprises and night attacks, and in theij 1. M. G. Ranade, Rise of the Marathsi Power, University of Bombay Bombay, 1961, p.5. M' SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA skill at extricating themselves from a tight corner or varying their tactics according to the changing phases of a battle, without waiting for guidance from a superior.”^ But Shivaji’s master- mind was seen not only in his military exploits, but also in his organisation of a socio-political order which alone could repulse the Mughals even after his death. His Swarajya was a far- stretching but well-knit kingdom with a body of competent administrators and ah army which was ever in readiness to crush the enemy. It guaranteed security to life and property, and social peace for which the common people of Maharashtra had longed in vain during the protracted conflicts of the Deccan Sultanates in the preceding century. The need of the hour was the foundation of a state based on principles of justice, and it was Shivaji who responded to the clarion call and satisfied this need. Before Shivaji came on the scene, the Maratha Deshmukhs were ready to die for their watans, but they never cared for the Welfare of their subjects.There was utter lawlessness all around. In such a situation, guided by Dadaji Kondadev, Shivaji played the role of an ‘honest judge and strong magistrate’. Sarkar observes : As the fame of his justice, firmness, and stand for the weak was noised abroad from village to village in Maharashtra more and more looked up to him as their protector and longed to come under his rule. His dominion spread first of ail through the conquest of hearts, which the honest and strong administrator alone can achieve among a simple rustic population. And then came his appeal to their individual ambition by providing them with undreamt of opportunities of advancement from the status of com- mon soldiers to that of barons under his banners. In the end, the corporate spirit of the Marathas was kindled and sublimated; they gloried in the evident fact that they were a nation at last rousing itself like a strong man after a long ; and painful sleep under Muslim tyranny or like an “eagle mewing its mighty youth”. Shivaji succeeded because he was his people’s hero as king. ^ • 2. J. N. SsixkAi\ Shivaii and His Times, Orient Longman, 1973, pp. 7-8. 3, I R. Sarkar, c/7., p. 30, THE PLACE OF SWARAJYA IN INDIAN HISTORY • ' 85 Sliivaji did not aim at the establishment of an all-India empire under his direct control. All that he wanted to achieve was '‘to secure the freedom of his own people and to unite them into one nation, powerful for self-defence and for self-assertion also ; the extinction of all other powers was not contemplated by him”.^ In fact, he entered into friendly relations with the southern kingdoms of Golkonda, Bednore and^ even Bijapur and permitted his brother Venkoji to have a jagir all to himself south of the Kolenin. Shivaji made a clear distinction between Swarajya (i. e., territory directly governed by him) and Moglai (i. e., territory governed by Muslim kings outside his Swarajya) and contented himself with the levy of only Chouth and Sardesh- mukhi from the Mughal dominions. Justice Ranade has given the following details about the extent of Shivaji’s kingdom, which appear to have been based on the Chitnis Bakhar, though there are some variations in the number of forts mentioned by Ranade : , ‘ Besides his ancestral jahagir about Poona, there was (1) Prant Maval—corresponding with the Maval, Saswad, Junnar, and Khed Talukas of the present day, and guarded by eighteen great hill forts; (2) the Prants of Wai, Satara, and Karad— corresponding with the western portions of the present Satara District, guarded by fifteen forts; (3) Prant Panhala corresponding with the western parts of Kolhapur, with thirteen hill forts; (4) Prant South Konkan—-corresponding with Ratnagiri, with fifty-eight hill forts and sea-fortresses; (5) Prant Thana—corresponding to North Konkan District with twelve forts ; (6) and (7) Prants Trimbak and Baglan corresponding with western parts of Nasik, with sixty-two hill forts. The territories occupied by the military garrisons were: (8) Prant Wanagad—cortesponding with the southern parts of Dharwar district, with twenty-two forts; (9), (10) and (11) Prants Bednore, Kolhar and Shrirangapatan correspond-- ing with the modern Mysore, with eighteen forts; (12) Prant Karnatik^being the deded districts in the Madras Presi- dency south of the Krishna, with eighteen forts; (13) .Prant M. G. Ranade. op^cit., 86 SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA Vellore—modern Arcot district, with twenty-five forts and (14) Prant Tanjore, with six forts.® While Shivaji retained with himself the ultimate power of government in the Swarajya, he distributed the detailed work of administration among a Council of Eight Ministers as men- tioned below (1) The Mukhya Pradhan or Peshwa (Prime Minister) generally looked after the welfare of the state, acted for the King in the latter’s absence and kept peace among the other officers, promoting harmony in administration. All Royal letters and charters bore his seal below the King’s. (2) The Amatya or Majmuadar (Auditor General) checked the accounts of public income and expenditure and reported them to the king. He counter-signed all statements of accounts of the kingdom as a whole and also of particular districts. (3) The blantri or Waqia-navis (Chronicler) had to maintain a daily record of the king’s doings and court • incidents, and to keep a watch over the king’s invitation- lists, meals, companions etc., so as to guard against murder plots. (4) The Sachiv or Shuru-navis (Superintendent) saw to it that all royal letters were drafted in the proper style and revised where necessary. At the head of charters, he wrote the words ‘shuru shud’ meaning ‘Here begins’. He had also to check the accounts of the Mahals and Parganas. (5) The Sumant or Dabir (Foreign Secretary) advised the King on relations with foreign states, waging of war and declaration of peace. He had to keep intelligence about other countries, receive and dismiss foreign envoys, and maintain the dignity of the state abroad. (6) The Senapati or Sar-i-naubat (Commander-in-Chief) was the head of the armed forces. (7) The Panditrao or Sadr . (Ecclesiastical Head) was the judge of canon law and censor of public morals. He decided theological questions and caste disputes, fixed dates 5. M. G. Ranade, op.cit,, p.64. 87 THE PLACE OF SWARAJYA IN INDIAN HISTORY for religious ceremonies, punished impiety and heresy and ordered penances. He also functioned as Danadhyaksha or Muhatasib (Royal Almoner) and honoured and rewarded learned Brahmans on behalf of the King. (8) Nyayadhish or Qazi-ul-quzat (Chief Justice) tried civil and criminal cases according to Hindu Law and endorsed all judicial decisions, especially about ri^ts to land, village headmanship, etc.® Barring the last two, all these Ministers were also required to command armies and go out on expeditions. No post was hereditary, and jagirs were not granted for service to the state. Shivaji changed his Peshwa once and his Senapati three times. All royal letters, charters and treaties had to bear the seals of the Kling and the Peshwa and the endorsement of the next four Ministers. The basic unit of Shivaji’s government was the hill fort with the territory controlled by it. These forts were the saviours of the Swarajya in its days of difficulty; and Shivaji spared no money or efforts in repairing, garrisoning and provisioning them. He also constructed a number of new forts. Every fort was placed under three officers of equal status, the HavaMar, the Sabnis and the Sar-i-naubat, who .were required to act jointly. While the Havaldar and the Sar-i-naubat belonged to the Maratha caste, the Sabnis was selected from amongst the Brahmans. A Kayastha officer, known as Karkhanah-navis, was given charge of the stores and provisions in the fort and he had to maintain accounts of the incomings and expenditure. The walls of the bigger forts were demarcated into five or six sections, each of which was guarded by a Tat-Sar-i-naubat. Men of the Parwari and Ramoshi castes were employed to keep a watch on the environs of each fort. Shivaji gave minute written instruc- tions about how each fort was to be adequately stocked with provisions, building materials and munitions, and how the watch and ward duties were to be performed. These instructions were strictly enforced. Thus, the Havaldar himself had*to lock the gates at sunset, carry the keys with him, sleep with them under his pillow and open the gates at sunrise. 6. J. N. Sarkar, op. at., pp.361HS2. 88 SHIVAH AND SWARAJYA Shivaji’s army consisted of about a lakh of soldiers. All of them—^whether musketeers, spearmen, archers or swordsmen were enlisted only after a careful personal inspection by Shivaji himself and after taking security for every new soldier from those already in service. During the rainy season, the troops lived in cantonments in the home territory. Their huts were thatched with grass; and grain, fodder and medicines were kept in stock. On Dassara day, a grand durbar was held, when men, horses and equipment were subjected to a minute scrutiny. Thereafter the army set out on its campaign of conquest.. At the time of its departure, a list was made of all the property that every man, high or low,, carried with himself, and on return he was required to give up whatever he possessed over and above his original list. No woman, female slave or dancing girl was allowed to accompany the army. The soldiers were required to behave themselves during the campaigns and molestation of women, children. Brahmans, husbandmen and cows was for- bidden even during war. Punishment for breach of discipline was swift and exemplary. Turning next to the revenue; administration of the Swarajya, . we find that the land in every province was measured and the area calculated in Chavars. An estimate was made of the expected produce of each bigh.a, three parts of it were left to the peasant and two parts taken by the state. The revenue was collected in kind at harvest time. New ryots who came to settle were given money for seeds and cattle and the amount was recovered in two or four annual instalments. The Swarajya was divided into Prants, Siibhas and Mahals. The average - revenue of a Mahal ranged from three-fourths of a lakh to a lakh and a quarter. Two or three Mahals made a Subha or a district. Shivaji did not continue the old Mughal system of leaving the revenue management solely in the hands of Village Patils. The work of management was carried on directly by the Subhedars or Mahalkaris for the Subha or the Mahal, while every group of two or three villages was managed by a Kamavisdar who made direct collection of revenue. Sabhasad, a contemporary of Shivaji, tells us : In the NizamsKahi, Adilsh^ and Mughal territories annexed, the ryots ha# formerly been subject to Patils, Kulkarnis and THE PLACE OF SWARAJYA IN INDIAN HISTORY 89 Deshmukhs; who used to do the coicction work and pay what they pleased to the state—somletimes only 200 or 300 hons for a village yielding 2000 hons as revenue. These Mirasdars, thus growing wealthy, built forts, enlisted troops and became powerful. They never waited upon the revenue officer of the Government, and used to show fight if he urged that the village could pay more to the state. This class had become unruly and seized the country. But Shivaji dis- mantled their castles, garrisoned the strong places with his own tioops and took away all power from the Mirasdars. Formerly they used to take whatever they liked from the ryots. This was now stopped. Their dues were fixed after calculating the exact revenue of the village and they were forbidden* to build castles.'^ Shivaji thus sought to do away with this class of middle-mea and to bring his government into direct relations with the culti- vators. He also realised the dangers of conferring gifts of land for military or other services rendered to his government. The lands cultivated by the Sar-i-naubats, Majmuadars, Karkun® and officers in the King’s personal service were subject to assess- ment like the fields of the ryots, and the revenue amount due was deducted from their pay. They received the balance of their salary from the treasury of the capital or the district. The men serving in the army, the militia or the forts were also paid either by assignments of revenue or by cash from the treasury, and proprietory or mokasa rights over an entire village were not given to them. The religious policy of the Swarajya stood in marked contrast with that of the Mu^al Emperor Aurangzeb, who had brou^ about a deliberate reversal of the policy of tolerance adopted by his predecessors towards their non-Muslim subjects. Auran- gzeb was a fanatical believer in the orthodox interpretation Islamic theology, according to which : The highest duty of the true believer is to make exertioa (jihad) im the path of God by waging war against infidel lands (dar-ui-harb) till they became part of the realm of Islam (dar-ul-lslam). Alter conquest, the entire infidel 7. Cited in J. N. Sarkar, op. cit., p. 367 so SHIVAJI AND SWARAJYA population became theoretically reduced to the status of slaves of the conquering army. A non-Muslim, therefore, cannot be a citizen of the state; he is a member of a depressed class; his status is a modified form of slavery. He lives under a contract (zimma) with the state for the life and property that are grudgingly spared to him by the Commander of the Faithful; he must undergo political and social disabilities and pay commutation money (jaziya). He must show by humility of dress and behaviour that he belongs to a subject class. No non- Muslim (zimmi) can wear fine dresses, ride on horseback or carry arms; he must behave respectfully and submissively to every member of the dominant sect. The zimmi is under certain legal disabilities with regard to testimony in law courts, protection under criminal law, and marriage. The state, as the other party in the contract (zimma), guarantees to him security of life and property and a modified protec- tion in the exercise of religion. He cannot erect new temples, and has to avoid any offensive publicity in the exercise of his faith.® In a charter granted to the priests of Benares in the very first year of his reign, Aurangzeb had declared that his religion forbade him to allow the building of new temples but did not enjoin the destruction of old ones. But this was before his throne was secure, and soon he ceased to respect the distinction earlier made by him. His iconoclastic zeal burst forth in full force on 9th April 1669, when he issued a general order to the governors of all provinces “to demolish ail the schools and temples of the infidels and to put down their religious teaching and practices”. Officers were sent to every Pargana to demolish local temples, and the governor had to send a report of the execution of the order under the seal of the Qazi and attested by pious sheikhs of the locality. Censors of public morals (Muhatasibs) were appointed to every subdivision and city, and it was their normal duty to go round and destroy Hindu temples within their jurisdiction. So large was the number of officiar tcmple-demolishers that a Darogha had to be appointed ovel 8. J. N. Sarkar, History of Aurangzehf Vol. HI, M. C. Sarkar & Sons, Calcutta,. 1928,i>pp-249-“53.

B esides number- less shrines the empire, all the most famous Hindu places of worship now suffered destruction—the temples of Somnath at Patan, Vishvanath at Benares and Keshav Dew at Mathura. Even the loyal State of Jaipur did not escape, 6i temples being demolished in the capital city of Ambar. In Udai- pur and Chitor alone, in two months 239 temples suffered ruin by Aurangzeb’s order. The work of destruction was often accompanied by wanton desecration , such as the slauglitering of cows in the sanctuary and causing the idols to be trcdden down in public squares. The abwabs or illegal exactions levied during the Mughal period were also a prolific source of oppression to the people. These included duties on the local sale of prcduce, fees on sale of immovable property, perquisites exacted by officials for their own benefit, as well as fees and commissions levied on behalf of the state on almost every conceivable occasion, licence tax for plying certain trades and forced subscriptions.^ There were special imposts on Hindus, including for instance a tax of Rs. 6.25 per pilgrim for bathing in the sacred waters at Allaha- bad, and a fee charged for carrying the bones of dead Hindus to throw them into the Ganga. As a tax was also levied oh the father for the birth of a male child, it could truly be said that under the Mughals, illegal cesses pursued a man from birth to death. “In this age of renewed persecution,” says Sarkar, “Shiv# appeared as the star of a new hope for the Hindu World”.'I® His spirited letter of protest to Aurangzeb on the reimpositioB of jaziya is justly famous. He wrote: In strict justice, the jaziya is not at all lawful. If you imagine piety to consist in oppressing and terrorising Mm Hindus, you ought first to levy the tax upon Rajsinh who is the head of the Hindus. But to oppress ants and flies, is neither valour nor spirit. If you believe in the Koran, God is the Lord of all men and not of the Muhammedans only. Islam and Hinduism are only different pigments 9.

To show bigotry for any man’s creed and practices is to alter the words of the Holy Book. Your officers neglect to tell you of the true state of things and cover a blazing fire with straw”.^^ Although Shivaji considered it his mission to defend the Hindu religion and way of life against the onslaught of the Murals, he was not animated by any hatred towards Muslims. Full relHgious liberty for all was his ideal as well as practice in the Swarajya. He respected the holy places of all religions even during his raids and made endowments not only for Hindu temples, but also for mosques as well as tombs of Muslim saints. Just as he granted pensions to Brahman scholars versed in the Vedas, he built hermitages and provided subsistence for the holy men of Islam, notably Baba Yaqut of Kelshi in Ratnagiri district. He also employed a number of Muslims in positions of trust and responsibility, and they served him with great zeal and devotion. About the patronage extended to learning in the Swarajya, the Bakhars tell us : The lost Vedic studies were revived by Shivaji. One maund of rice was annually presented to a Brahman who had mastered one of the Books of the Vedas: two maunds to a master of two Books, and so on. Every year the Panditrao used to examine the scholars in the month of Shravan and increase or decrease their stipends according to their progress in study. Foreign Pandits received pre- sents in goods, local scholars in foed. Famous scholars were assembled, honoured and given money rewaids. No Brahman had occasion to go to other kingdoms to beg.^^ As Justice Ranade observes in his Rise of the Maratha Power Ihe system of civil government established by Shivaji was distin- guished from those which preceded it or succeeded it in several important respects : Firstly—^In the great importance he attached to the hill forts, Ih Cited in G, S. Sardesai, New History of the Marathas, Vo!. 4 Phoenix Publications, Bombay, 1971, p. 260. 12. Cited in J. H. Sarkar, Shivaji and His Times, op. cit,, p . 368. THE PLACE OF SWARAJYA IN INDIAN HISTORY * 93 which were virtiially the starting unit of his system of govern- . ^ ment. . , _ . Secondly—^In his discouragement of the hereditary system of transmitting high offices in one and the same family. Thirdly—In refusal to grant Jahagir assignments of land for the support of Civil and Military Officers. Fourthly—^In the establishment of a direct system of revenue management, without the intervention of district or village zamindars. Fifthly—^In the disallowance of the farming system. Sixthly—^In the establishment of a Council of Ministers with their proper work allotted to them, and each directly responsible to the King-in-Council. Seventhly—In the subordination of the Military to the Civil element in the administration. Eighthly—In the intermixture of Brahmans, Prabhus and Marathas in all offices, high and low, so as to keep check upon one another. 13 The men who occupied the seats of power in later Maratha history departed from the sound system laid down by Shivaji, either because they did not appreciate the wisdom of his plans or else because they succumbed to the needs of expediency and present convenience. This encouraged the growth of centri- fugal forces in the Swarajya, which broke up its organised unity and ultimately led to its dismemberment and dissolution. Shivaji had set up the Council of Eight Ministers as a repository of outstanding talent for continuous aid and advice to the mon- arch. But in the reign of Shahu, this system gradually fell into disuse, as the Peshwa alone started managing the affairs of state and functioned as his own general, his own finance minister and foreign minister too. This system of personal rule by a single minister deprived the government of the multi-pronged support it would have received from the institutional arrangements devised by Shivaji. With the Peshwaship becoming hereditary, all other hr^ offices of State also became hereditary in the later Maratha 13. M. G. Ranade, op. aV., p. 71-72. 94 SmVAJI AND SWARAJYA period. .But natural capacity and talent are not always inherited; and inefficient and unworthy persons occupying important positions became a drag on government. Really competent persons had to resort to force and craft in order to climb to positions of power and this gave rise to an unhealthy rivalry and court intrigue. Shivaji had tried to maintain a social balance between the different communities in his kingdom by equitably distributing among them the various offices of state according to their inherited aptitudes. The Peshwas tilted this balance in favour of Brah- mans, which sowed the seeds of bickerings. The Prabhus ceased to occupy any important positions in the later Maralha pericd. Shivaji had realised that the Jahagirdars were a source of weak- ness to the Central Power; and he therefore sought to defeudalise his state. This wise precaution was, however, thrown to the winds by his son Rajaram and grandson Shahu. Whatever may have been the justification for it, there is no doubt that the growth of Saranjams in later Maratha history ultimately spelt the ruin of the Swarajya. The Gaikwads became the virtual rulers of Gujarat, the Bhonsales became supreme in Nagpur and Shinde, Holkar and Pawar had the north all to themselves. They resented any interference from the Central Power and soon became unamenable to its control. This hastened the process of disintegration of the Maratha State. The salutary principles of government laid down by Shivaji were thus abandoned by his successors, and this was one of the major causes of the decline of Swarajya. Yet it cannot be denied that Shivaji and his Swarajya have had a significant impact on the course of our history. The intense love for our motherland and for our culture generated by Shivaji are power- ful forces even today. His achievements inspired many a leader and soldier of our freedom movement. Indeed, Shivaji’s ideals and virtues are an eternal source of inspiration and guidance. Let us pray that we will be wise enough to learn useful lessons from the fascinating storjt^f his life and work. v:- ^ \s LIBRABY 'S'' , ij Camp\s JWJtoiFM Rashtrapati Bhavan New Delhi Accn- No- Jill Call No, SH1VAJI THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT by V.

Kulkami was good enough to request me to write a Foreword to his book on SHIVAJI. There are several books on Shivaji, but, as Shri Kulkami has himself stated, the aim of his book is very simple, viz., to present Shivaji not only as a man of great personal rectitude, of broad humanity and of a wider perspective, but also as a maker of history. Although it is stated that the book does not seek to unearth any startling facts or throw new light on the obscure comers of Maratha history, there is no doubt that Shri Kulkami has drawn upon a large number of published works on Shivaji and presented a lucid picture of the Maratha history of the period. Shivaji played a very important role in the resurgence of our nation. He was not only a great warrior but a sound administrator. His life and work is no doubt a source of great inspiration to all of us. I am glad that Shri Kulkami has attempted in this book to present the subject methodically and in lucid language. I have no doubt that the book will be a useful addition to the study of the life of Shivaji and the Maratha history. Y. B. CHAVAN Union Minister for Defence, New Delhi New Delhi 15 April 1963 PREFACE The aim of this book is to present a true picture of Shivaji’s greatness as a soldier-statesman. Like some historical per- sonages, Shivaji has suffered grievously at the hands of a few but influential writers. The fact that they too acknowledge his greatness rather emphasises the Olympian stature of Shivaji than bear witness either to their sense of impartiality or their faculty for sound judgment. Shivaji’s true eminence can be understood only after a full realization of the deplorable condition to which the majority of the Indian population had been reduced before his rise to power. Similarly, we cannot measure the depth of the degra- dation of the people of his time unless we gain a clear perspec- tive of the heights of civilization that had been scaled by their ancestors in ancient and medieval India. It is for this reason that the first chapter in the book has been devoted to a detailed discussion of this essential theme. Shivaji’s message will r'emain valid so long as courage, self- reliance and tolerance are esteemed as virtues worthy of cultivation. It was with the aid of these qualities that he succeeded in changing the course of history. Perhaps, the best justification for the present book is that it seeks to prove that he was indeed a man destiny. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Y. B. Chavan, India’s Defence Minister, for writing his Foreword to this book. I thank Mr. D. S. Bakhle, I.C.S. (Retd.) for going through the typescript of this book. My thanks are also due to Mr. A. A. E. Rasquinha for his help. CONTENTS CHAP.

DOWN THE AGES There are already a number of books on Shivaji, but the need for many more well-informed and competently written ones will always be felt Like things of beauty and joy, the lives of truly great men are of abiding interest and instruction. We behold the mighty and towering Himalayas and are again and again lost in wonder at their rugged and snow-crowned splendour. It is equally so with the grandeur of human achievement. We cannot turn our backs on history and yet remain loyal to our heritage. The civilization of mankind is the sum total of the strivings of a succession of exalted per- sonages. It is precisely for this reason that our interest in the doings of such men as Alexander, Ashoka, Caesar, Augustus, Napolean and Abraham Lincoln is undiminished and peren- nial. Shivaji’s title to fame and to our grateful remembrance rests on sound foundations. By his historic labours he uplifted a downtrodden and degraded people and restored to them their manhood and the immemorial pieties of their ancient land. He saw with the clarity of a statesman the need for asserting the political independence of the Hindus as the only means of establishing a real community of interest between them and the Muslim minority. He realized the futility of promoting such concord so long as the majority of the population lay suppliant, with no courage or ability to remedy the wrong. It was only from a position of strength that the aggrieved community could hope to create a new basis for Hindu-Muslim relations. Shivaji undertook this historic task with the sword in one hand and with the emblems of peace and tolerance in the other. There was no hatred or animosity in his campaign on behalf of Hindu resurgence. His respect for Islam and its Holy Book, his veneration for the learned men of that faith and the liberal recruitment of Muslims to his army and navy, furnish 2 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT the most convincing proofs of the essential catholicity of his crusade. For this reason and for many others that will be discussed in the subsequent chapters, Shivaji stands apart from, and far above, the successful adventurers. Indeed by founding the Maratha Empire he gave a new direction to the Indian his- tory and thus paved the way for Hindu-Muslim collaboration in the common cause of national freedom when in later cen- turies the country came under the rule of another alien power. Such a new dispensation could never have been possible if the Muslim rule had remained unchallenged. Shivaji was thus the benefactor, not of any one community, but of the entire Indian nation. His cause and its success brought him instant recognition as a great liberator. “Divine honours,” says Mahamahopadyaya P. V. Kane, “were paid to Shivaji even in his lifetime for effectively freeing his people from the curse of capricious and tyrannical rule.” It, there- fore, behoves us to make a deeper study of this remarkable man and to reflect on the lessons which his achievements have taught us. The abiding significance of his contribution to Indian history can best be understood by recalling the splen- dour of the ancient Hindu civilization, its decline and its even- tual rehabilitation, following the patriotic labours of outstand- ing men like him. The history of India, beginning with the Indus Valley Civili- zation, dates back to many millenniums before Christ and unfolds to our view the spectacle of the monumental achieve- ments of her people in all the essential domains of human activity. The Aryan seers, who gave India and the world the Vedas and the Upamshads, those archives of Hindu wisdom, delved deep into the unprobed regions of the mind and stumbl- ed upon new truths and experiences that have made a vital contribution to the philosophic heritage of mankind. The antiquity, the depth and the great empirical quality of the Hindu philosophic literature have made a profound impression on many distinguished Western scholars and thinkers. “The study of the Upamshads/’ declared Schopenhauer, “has been INDIA. DOWN THE AGES 3 the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death.” The eminent Professor Max Muller, besides heartily endorsing this remarkable affirmation of faith, proclaimed his own indebted- ness to Vedanta in guiding him through life. Ancient India’s contribution however, was, not confined merely to the concerns of the spirit. She rose to great altitudes of material prosperity and played no small part in extending the frontiers of secular knowledge. A long procession of poets, bards, scholars, sculptors, artists and master-builders flourish- ed during the Hindu period, continually enriching and enlarg- ing the culture of the country. Pursuit of knowledge became the governing passion of the country which abounded in schools and teachers, and the gift of vidya or knowledge was consider- ed the highest form of charity. The traditions of scholarship established at such ancient and celebrated seats of learning as Taxila, Banaras, Nalanda, Kanchi, Vallabhi and Vikramasila have ensured the preservation of the country’s enthusiasm for knowledge down the ages so that education has never been exotic in this land. Indeed, in no country were the words of Cicero in praise of the study of literature better appreciated than in India. The classical language of the land, Sanskrit, was developed to the highest pitch of excellence, evoking the unstinted admiration of many scholars, including that of that linguistic genius, Sir William Jones, who wrote that, whatever could have been its antiquity, Sanskrit was of a “wonderful structure, more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin and more exqui- sitely refined than either”. India’s record in art, architecture and painting is no less inspiring. Beginning with the austerely utilitarian architecture of the Indus civilization, she steadily built up her artistic traditions which found their highest fulfil- ment in the times of the Guptas, rightly described as the Peri- clean Age of India. Among her votive offerings to human knowledge the invention of the decimal system is perhaps 'the most precious and conspicuous. The greatest Indian astro- nomer and mathematician, Aryabhata, discussed with profound understanding such abstruse subjects as quadratic (equations 4 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT and sines and explained eclipses, solstices and equinoxes, be- sides announcing the roundness of the earth and its diurnal revolution on its axis, in “daring anticipation of Renaissance science”. Great progress was also made in the science of medicine and as far back as the sixth century before Christ, Hindu physicians were able to describe a large number of the delicate parts of the anatomy hidden from the eye with amaz- ing clarity and confidence. We have the testimony of foreign observers like Megastha- nese and Hieuen Tsang that ancient and medieval India abounded in wealth and prosperity. She owed her might, majesty and affluence pre-eminently to the industry and re- sourcefulness of her people who were convinced adherents of the doctrine that the greatness of a country depends upon wealth and that wealth is created by work. The wide ranging interests of the Indians and their spirit of adventure yielded astounding results. The country’s vener- able and beneficent culture spread to far-off lands, and more especially to those of South-East Asia, which accepted India’s ministrations without doubt or demur. They learnt from her the inestimable art of writing, readily adopted her crafts and skills and enthusiastically allowed their native religion and cul- ture to be fertilized and enriched by those of India. At no time was the sword employed in accomplishing this historic revolution in those far-off lands. “From Persia to the Chinese sea,” says Sylvain Levi, “from the icy regions of Siberia to the islands of Java and Borneo, from Oceania to Socotra, India has propagated her beliefs, her tales and her civilization. She has left indelible imprints on one-fourth of the human race in the course of a long succession of centuries. She has the right to reclaim in universal history the rank that ignorance has refused her for a long time and to hold her place amongst the great nations, summarising and symbolising the spirit of humanity.” Such was the greatness and glory of ancient and medieval India. But,' after shedding the lustre of her civilization in her own land and in many others for long ages, she fell, irresistibly INDIA DOWN THE AGES 5 reminding us of de Tocquille’s sage observation that sometimes the progress of man is so rapid that the desert reappears be- hind him. Such a catastrophe overtook India because, to- wards the end of her noble career, her immense capacity for the absorption of alien races and cultures and her ability to adjust herself to the changing times gave place to rigidity and stagnation which, in the history of all civilizations, have always been the precursors of decay and dissolution. “A great civili- zation,” says a writer, “is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself within.” The downfall of the Hindus was indeed inevitable. Seldom democratic in its content, their social organization developed graver iniquities in course of time, while their political and military systems became dangerously outmoded and unservice- able. For four hundred years, broadly from A.D. 600-1000, India lay prostrate, with no strong government to guard her frontiers and no stirring reformist movement to revitalize her body politic. She invited conquest, and it came in all its frightfulness. A venerable , civilization, defended by feeble hands, was confronted by a young foreign power that had only lately crossed the threshold into the polity of Islam. During its historic march towards the goal of world domi- nion, Islam did not, in the early period of its career, have re- course to violence or coercion in order to gain new adherents to its creed. The success of the Arab government, says H.AX. Fisher, “largely consisted in the wise policy of toleration which they practised towards Jews and Christians, presenting in this respect the happiest contrast to the persecuting practices of their successors.” Indeed, it was as a pacific religion that Islam first came to India in the beginning of the eighth century and was cordially welcomed by princes and people alike. There cannot be any doubt that the religious and political , history of India would have been entirely different if the pene- tration of Islam into the country had continued to be peaceful, deriving its strength and sanctions solely from the approbation of the people and the toleration of the rulers of the land. The fact that it did not happen so is a national misfortune, the dis- (x 3HIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT astrous effects of which are reflected in. the artificial and arbi- trary division of the country into two mutually exclusive and independent States. It was perhaps a perverse freak of history that the task of the message of Prophet Muhammad in India fell on the Turk. Embracing the new faith with neophyte intensity, the freebooters from the steppes of Turkestan, armed with short bows and curved scimitars, overran large parts of Asia with such swiftness that in 1055 their leader, Togrul Beg, was proclaimed Sultan in Baghdad and was “loaded by the effete Abhasid Caliph with all the titles and honours which are indi- cative of secular pre-eminence in the Moslem world’’. The forte of the Turk, says Dr. Habibullah, was the sword and in all fee tasks that he undertook he brought to bear upon them a “boundless energy, an all-pervading racialism and the fierce orthodoxy of a neo-convert”. With complete freedom from consistency, the Turk joined to these qualities a “grossly mate- rialistic" outlook on life. It was this race of foreigners, led by Mahmud of Ghazni, that descended upon India, determined, not to participate in the joys and the abounding prosperity of her people, but to despoil and humiliate them. Beginning from 1000, Mahmud invaded the country seventeen times and carried away immense wealth from the shrines and homes of its inha- bitants whom he treated with primeval ferocity. In the ex- pressive words of Will Durant, the Sultan of Ghazni was in- deed a “magnificent thief” and his idol-smashing ecstasies were essentially inspired by the knowledge that the poorly-defended temples of India abounded in wealth. And yet by a cynical misinterpretation of the basically tolerant tenets of Islam, this specialist in spoliation, rapine and wreckage was acclaimed as a God! Rapturous accounts of his exploits in India were written by bigots who produced a mighty volume of violent literature glorifying his misdeeds. After Mahmud’s death in 1030 Northern India was not convulsed by any major invasions for nearly one century and a half, but the Hindus persisted in their folly of fighting among INDIA DOWN THE AGES 7 themselves and thus exposing their homeland to fresh aggres- sions. The new invader was Muhammad of Ghor, who, like the earlier freebooter, was drawn towards this country by its teeming riches. His discomfiture in 1178 and his defeat in 1191 at the hands of Prithviraj Chauhan, merely postponed the downfall of India. In the following year he returned to the country and encountering Prithviraj on the same battle- field of Tarain, delivered a decisive blow to Hindu power. Prithviraj, the hero of many stirring ballads, was killed and with him perished the independence of Northern India. After collecting immense booty which was carried on 1400 camels the victorious Sultan returned to his country, leaving behind Qutb-ud-din Aibak to prosecute the war against the ‘infidels’. Aibak, a manumitted slave and a “typical specimen of the ferocious Central Asian warriors of the time”, became the founder of what has come to be known as the Slave dynasty, with which Muslim rule began in India—a fitting retribution to the disunited, demoralised and suicidal Hindus. Aibak’s able general, Muhammad Khalji, played a notable part in ex- tending the frontiers of Islam in India by conquering Bihar and Bengal. After the destruction of Hindu independence in the north it was impossible to expect that the Deccan and the south could long be successful in defending their integrity. They too presented the melancholy picture of a house divided against itself. In fact, the region had deteriorated into a verit- able cockpit of competing sovereignties, inviting conquest and enslavement. In 1294 Ala-ud-din Khalji, Governor of Kara, waged a successful war against Ramachandra, the Yadava ruler of Devagiri and, capturing his capital, exacted an astounding amount of tribute from him. After stealing the throne of Delhi by cruelly putting his aged uncle and patron to death, Ala-ud-din, who has won notoriety in history as the man who “shed more innocent blood than a Pharaoh was ever guilty of”, deputed his favourite, Malik-Naib Kafur, on a second expedition to the south. Kafur was a converted eunuch and there was ironic justice 8 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT in the choice of this commander for the destruction of Hindu manhood in the south. Devagiri was promptly reduced to sub- mission and thenceforward Ramachandra, its ruler, became the most pliant and debased tool of the Delhi Sultan. To retain the favour of his paramount lord, Ramachandra sold the honour of his family and became an accomplice in the destruc- tion of the ancient ruling houses of Warrangal and Dwara- samudra. The victorious general penetrated deep into the south and desecrated the temples of the famous pilgrim centres of Chidambaram, Srirangam and Madura and returned to Delhi laden with immense booty. Two years after Ramachandra’s death, his assertive son was defeated and the historic realm of the Yadavas was finally annexed to the Sultanate of Delhi in 1313. Earlier, in 1297, Ala-ud-din’s army had overrun Gujarat and eclipsed its independent sovereignty. The reasons for the downfall of the Hindus and the conquest of their ancient land by a handful of foreigners comprehend nearly all the important aspects of their national life. First, the institution of Ashwamedha or horse sacrifice, originally conceived and used as a device for bringing the entire or large parts of the country within the frame of a single government, eventually degenerated into a potent instrument of disunity among the members of the ruling class. A weak emperor be- came a convenient target of attack by his vassals whose com- petition for independent sovereignty gravely undermined the country’s political unity. The fact that Mahmud of Ghazni could' launch seventeen sanguinary invasions against India with impunity furnishes the most conclusive evidence that the princes of the country had forgotten the value of concerted action both then and thereafter. Secondly, the Hindus showed an amazing inability to adapt their military methods to the changing requirements of the times. The composition and the strategy of their armies were dictated by principles that had become hopelessly out of date, especi- ally when they were ranged against a resourceful and determin- ed enemy like the invading Muslims. Their absurd and incur- able faith in the value of war-elephants was often disastrous INDIA DOWN THE AGES 8 to their cause. The vastness, combined with the looseness of the Hindu hordes, gravely undermined the mobility and the striking power of their troops. There was no provision in their strategy against the contingency of surprise attacks from the flanks and the rear. It did not take long for the Mus- lim commanders to detect the fatal weakness of their adversa- ries, against whom they invariably won resounding victories with ludicrously small but well-disciplined and mobile armies consisting mostly of cavalry. Thirdly, the concept of fair fighting was often carried to absurd lengths by the Hindus, despite their repeated experience that the opposing forces were inhibited by no such scruples. The Rajput, for example, was imbued with all the kindred vir- tues of the Western cavalier*, he was recklessly bold and more than a match for the redoubtable Turk, but he was extremely deficient in organization. His belief that he should win or perish on the battlefield was suicidal both to him and to his country. Large-scale self-destruction, involving the flower of Hindu chi- valry, rendered the task of the enemy in overrunning the country much easier. The concept of retreat and of rearguard action in order to be able to return to the attack under more favourable conditions did not find much favour. “The live dog,” says Professor Basham, commenting on Hindu strategy, “was no longer thought to be better than the dead lion, in so far as the spirit of the Epics permeated Hindu life.” Fourthly, the issues of victory and defeat were often staked on the safety of the commander. An entire army, even though it might have been on the verge of victory, was apt to suffer a complete rout if it became leaderless due to the sudden death or disappearance of its commander. Again, the fortunes of an entire kingdom and the fate of many generations were almost irretrievably committed to the outcome of a single battle. One decisive blow nearly ended all effective future resistance. Too much was staked in a single throw of the dice. Lastly, social disharmony hastened the dissolution of Hindu leadership of the country. By abandoning their wide-ranging interests, the Hindus developed strange obsessions and preju- 10 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT dices that were most inimical to progress and reform. Albe- runi, the eminent Muslim scholar and a man of keen perception, noted and deplored the conceit, the smugness and the narrow outlook of the Hindus and, commenting on their fallen condi- tion, recalled that their ancestors were refreshingly different from them. The Hindus were brought face to face with the Muslim invaders when they were in such a degenerate condition. The newcomers were not barbarians, but most of them were indifferent to the fact that tolerance is the highest attribute of civilized behaviour. The sword having won the most glittering prize for them, they refused to see any greatness in the country and its people. The immense undefended wealth of the land excited their avarice beyond measure, provoking them to acts of unbridled vandalism. Bigotry also played no small part in distorting their mental outlook. Ala-ud-din Khalji, for instance, framed comprehensive rules to hasten the debasement of the sons of the soil and to ensure their exploitation. “No Hindu,” it was decreed, “could hold up his head and in their bouses no sign of silver or gold ... or of any superfluity was to be seen.” Another monarch, Firuz Shah, claimed that India was a Mussalman country and sought to make good this assertion by encouraging widespread apos- tasy. Commenting on Firuz’s missionary labours and their success, the Oxford History of India says: “Such was the origin of a large part of the existing Muslim population. Several other sovereigns continued the process of conversion by bribery.” And such, we may add, is the perversity of human affairs that, by a process of political jugglery, the descendants of these very converts were in later centuries transformed into a separate ‘nation’ and given a new homeland by partitioning the country. The disabilities of the Hindus were indeed all-embracing. Since it was impossible on religious grounds to take them into partnership in the government of the country, they were reduc- ed to the status of a disfranchised community, with no political rights of their own. “If their existence,” writes Sir Jadunath Sarkar, the eminent historian of the Moghuls,, “was tolerated, it INDIA DOWN THE AGES 11 was only to use them as hewers of wood and drawers of water” and as tax-payers “for the benefit of the dominant sect of the faithful”. The list of Hindu disabilities presented by Sarkar is formidable, and the unjust treatment meted out to the com- munity offered the most convincing proof of the need for creat- ing a new order based on justice and tolerance. There were, of course, excellent Muslim princes like Sher Shah and Akbar who refused to surrender their sense of justice and fair-play to fanaticism. But, apart from the fact that there were no enforceable sanctions to ensure the continuity of good and impartial government under successive Sultans, there was an inherent injustice in the very basis of the country's political disposition. No system of government could be morally or legally acceptable so long as the majority of the population was denied a share in the administration in its own right. Such a partnership between the Hindus and the Muslims became virtually impossible when the entire policy of the government was so blatantly religious and communal. To add to these political disabilities, the Hindus were often subjected to religi- ous persecution. Relief for the Hindus, therefore, lay in the recovery of their manhood and in the restoration of their sovereignty. Such resur- gence was inaugurated in the south by the great Rayas of Vija- yanagar. Founded in 1336 to stem the tide of Muslim conquest, the Vijayana^ar Empire served as the citadel of dharma for nearly two and a half centuries, during which period it rose to great altitudes of prosperity, attaining the highest glory under the government of its wise and valiant ruler, Kri- shnadeva Raya. The Muslim succession States of the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan had never accepted the existence of a powerful Hindu empire in their proximity as a desirable political dispo- sition, but their predilections were of no importance so long as the Rayas remained invincible. They, however, succeeded in uniting among themselves and in destroying the great empire in the fateful battle of Rakshasa-Tangadi, miscalled Talikot, on January 25, 1565. The victorious armies of the allied Mus- 12 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT lim powers fell upon the noble city of Vijayanagar with un- exampled savagery. ‘‘Never perhaps in the history of the world," writes Robert Sewell, “has such havoc been wrought, and wrought so suddenly, on so splendid a city; teeming with a wealthy and industrious population in the full plenitude of prosperity one day, and on the next seized, pillaged, and reduced to ruins, amid scenes of savage massacre and horrors beggaring description.” Reflecting on the destruction of Vijayanagar, Will Durant writes with deep sadness. “It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace, may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within.” After the disappearance of the Vija- yanagar Empire, panic and defeatism once again gripped the hearts of the Hindus who began to share the conviction of their conquerors that it was the unalterable ordinance of Providence that the Muslims alone should govern the world. Only a man of genius and of superhuman abilities could combat such fears and frustrations. Shivaji accomplished this task with conspi- cuous success. The aim of this book is, therefore, simple. It does not seek to unearth any unknown or startling facts or to throw new light on the obscure comers of Maratha history. Its central object is to present Shivaji, not only as a man of great personal recti- tude, of broad humanity and of penetrating perception, but also as the maker of history. In trying to appraise his stature we should ask ourselves what the fate and the future of India would have been if he had not been bom and fulfilled his mis- sion. If he and his successors had not proved conclusively that military skill and valour are not idle exclusive monopoly of any one race or community, it is inconceivable that the de- based Hindus and the exultant Muslims would ever have come together on the plane of equality, accepting India as their com- mon mother-land. In fact, it was the Maratha military victories that ushered in a new era in the Hindu-Muslim relations, des- troying once and for all the complexes that had for centuries INDIA DOWN THE AGES 13 kept them apart. Such mutual understanding and concord stimulated among them in later centuries a common spirit of nationalism which alone made it possible for India to regain her political independence from the British. We do not know whether Shivaji or the Peshwas could foresee that their actions would lead to such amazing results, but no right-thinking per- son can deny the fact that that is how history took its course. The following pages are intended to unfold the story of the remarkable man that inaugurated such a revolution in India’s life. REFERENCES Kane, P.

CHAPTER 2 A NEW STAR RISES Maharashtra, the home province of Shivaji, 1 was pre-eminent* ly suited for the inauguration of a new era of Hindu re- surgence. The physical features of the region and the traditions and the temper of its inhabitants favoured the pro- motion of such a momentous enterprise. Maharashtra, which holds a pivotal position in the Deccan, consists of two clearly- demarcated geographical regions, namely, the coastal strip call- ed the Konkan and the plains of the Desh. The Sahyadri mountain ranges, running almost parallel to the western seaboard, have from time immemorial played a decisive part in moulding the political, social and economic life of the people of Maharashtra. Lofty, rugged and in most places barren, the Ghats, as the mountain ranges are also call- ed, dominate the landscape, towering majestically over the sur- rounding valleys and plains and standing sentinel to the free- dom of the people. Their numerous passes, little known to outsiders, and the inaccessibility of the rugged terrain around the hills, offered a veritable tactical paradise to men inured to elusive warfare and a logistical nightmare to the invading armies. Here, in these mountain fastnesses, sheltered by deep and wooded valleys, the hillmen of Maharashtra performed prodigies of valour, often defeating and disgracing the mighty hordes that were sent against them time and again. The ex- ploits of the Marathas were greatly helped by the hill-forts about which we will write at some length in a later chapter. In many places the flat summits were converted into strong- holds, whose natural strength and inaccessibility made it rela- tively easy for a small but determined and resourceful garrison to hurl defiance at the most powerful enemy. The heavy rains on the Ghats, which in some places are as much as 250 inches in one season, ensured a regular and abundant supply of water to the defenders of the hill-forts. Grant Duff, who wrote his 1 Now known as Western Maharashtra. A NEW STAB RISES 15 famous history of the Marathas more than a century ago, was perhaps right when he claimed that militarily there was “pro- bably no stronger country in the world” than the hilly regions of Maharashtra. The Konkan is a narrow strip of country sandwitched be- tween the Arabian sea and the Sahyadri mountains. At no place in this region is the land between the sea and the monu- tain more than sixty miles broad. The climate of the Konkan, which receives a heavy rainfall, is generally moist and humid. During the monsoon the rivers overflow their banks, some- times causing heavy damage to property, before they empty their waters into the sea. Most of them go dry during the hot months. While the land is singularly barren in places where the terrain of the Ghats dominates, the other districts are remarkably fertile and produce abundant crops, especially rice. The Konkan strip is inhabited by an enterprising people who, besides their seafaring traditions, have in the past sup- plied some of the ablest rulers, warriors and administrators to Maharashtra and indeed to India. The second geographical region, the Desh, forms a considera- ble part of Maharashtra, where the bulk of the State’s popula- tion lives. The people here are more sturdily built and are pas- sionately devoted to their farmlands. The rolling plains are ideally suited for modem agricultural operations. In spite of the insufficiency and the uncertainty of the rains, the Desh has long been the granary of Maharashtra and grows wheat, jawar and cash crops in abundance. Fortunately, Maharashtra is well-served by large rivers like the Godavari, the Bhima, the Krishna, the Koyna, the Tapi, the Wardha and the Vainganga. The comprehensive proposals under the successive five-year plans to harness these rivers for purposes of irrigation and power supply will, when they materialise, not only liberate the peasantry from the vagaries of the monsoon, but also usher in a new era of industrialization in the State . 2 1 The new State of Maharashtra, consisting of Vidarbha, Marath- wada and the Marathi-speaking districts of .the former State of Bombay, came into existence in May 1960. It has an area of 16 ctttvajt : THE PORTRAIT OF. A PATRIOT Dating back to many centuries and recorded by diverse observers, we have copious accounts about the racial charac- teristics of the people of Maharashtra, their courage and re- sourcefulness, their pride and patriotism, and their hospitality and generous disposition. As in most parts of the country, the Maharashtrians are a composite race, in whose veins the blood of both the Aryans and the non-Aryans flows. The famous Chinese traveller and scholar Hiuen Tsang, who visited Maharashtra about the year 641 during his long stay in India, writes about its people: “Whoever does them a service may count on their gratitude, but no one who offends them will escape their vengeance. If any one insults them, they will risk their lives to wipe out the affront. If any one in trouble ap- plies to them, forgetful of themselves they will hasten to help him.” The courage of the Marathas on the battlefield and their skill and determination in facing the most implacable enemy are the subject of high praise both by medieval and modem writers. In the days of Shivaji and the Peshwas and in our own time during the two world wars, the Maratha troops covered themselves with glory by their unflinching courage and valour. They are indeed the sword-arm of the Deccan. The Maharastrians have shown the same sterling qualities in pur- suit of peace and this is exemplified by their devotion to reli- gion, art and literature. The simplicity, the frankness, the spirit of independence and the liberal outlook that mark the character of the people of Maharashtra are fully shared by their women-folk. There is nothing weak or pliant about these women who bring lustre to the Maharashtrian homes by their vivacity and by their re- freshingly realistic attitude towards life and its problems. They are in fact looked upon and treated as honoured part- 1,18,459 square miles and .accounts for more than 10 per cent, of the total extent of the Indian Union, of which it forms an integral and important part. The State has twenty-six administra- tive districts,- with a population of 3.95 crores, according to the census of 1961. A NEW STAB RISES 17 ners whose counsel is much prized and respected. As we shall see in the following pages, the influence of Jijabai upon her great son, Shivaji, was decisive. Her granddaughter-in-law, Tarabai, has won an honoured place in history by leading her people to victory against the powerful Moghul aggressors. Who has not heard of Ahalyabai Holkar whose piety and noble deeds are still remembered with deep respect? Nor can we forget the celebrated exploits of the Rani of Jhansi during the great uprising of 1857. Such is the glorious tradition of the womanhood of Maharashtra. •We may now refer briefly to the history of Maharashtra be- the doings of the great Shatavahana rulers who flourished for some three hundred years till the second century before Christ, but we are vouchsafed a fairly vivid picture of the doings of the great Shatavahana rulers who flourished for some three hundred years till the second century A.D. Paithan, their capital, was acclaimed as “the jewel and glory of Maharashtra” and abounded in spacious palaces, splendid mansions and gorgeous temples. It was during the sway of the Shatavahanas and their successors that the largest and most famous artificial caves were excavated in the Western Deccan. Bhaja, near Poona, is the oldest cave temple in this part of the country and it set the pace for a further development of shrines of this kind both in size and splendour. Probably excavated about the beginning of the Christian era, the Karla cave temple, with its, great chcdtya hall, is described as the finest single example of such places of worship. , The Shatavahanas were followed by the Traikutakas and the Vakatakas. The latter were powerful monarchs whose govern- ment lasted from 300-600. The Vakatakas were patrons of art and learning and encouraged further excavations of the famous Ajanta caves. The earliest of these caves date back to the second century before Christ, but the series were not completed before the seventh century A.D. “The splendid sculpture and lovely paintings,” writes Professor Basham, “with which they are adorned make them one of the most glorious monuments of India’s past.” As observed earlier, 18 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT the murals of Ajanta are pronounced to be “among the great- est surviving paintings of any ancient civilization”. Then came the imperial Chalukyas of Badami in the Bijapur district of north Karnatak. They governed extensive regions of the Deccan, including Maharashtra, for about two centuries from the middle of the sixth century till about the middle of the eighth century. Pulakeshin II (A.D. 610-11 to 642) was their greatest ruler and the Aihole inscription claims that the Chalukyan monarch defeated the great Harsha of Kanauj. Pulakeshin’s conquests were extensive and they secured for him sovereignty over three maharashtrakas or great kingdoms con- sisting of 99,000 gramas, a word of doubtful meaning. It was during the reign of this king that the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang visited Maharashtra. Pulakeshin’s fame spread far and wide and he was known in Persia. The Chalukyas were re- nowned patrons of art and architecture. About 752, the Chalukya dynasty was overthrown by Danti durga, a feudatory of the Empire. His successors, the Rashtra- kutas built up another extensive empire which they governed with great wisdom and efficiency. Distinguished among the Rashtra- kuta rulers was Krishna I who was not only a great conqueror but also a mighty builder. He patronised the construction of the famous rock-cut Shiva temple at Ellora which is rightly looked upon as a marvel of architecture. The ascendancy of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan lasted from about 753 to 975. Paying a high tribute to them, Dr. Altekar says that “no other ruling dynasty in the Deccan played such a dominant part in the history of India till the rise of the Marathas as an imperial power in the eighteenth century”. Similar eulogy was bestow- ed upon them by the Muslim writer Masudi who praised the dynasty for its tolerance towards his co-religionists. Refer- ring to the Rashtrakuta Kings as Balhara, Masudi wrote: “There is none among the rulers of Sind and Hind who in his territory respects the Muslims like Raja Balhara. In his king- dom Islam is honoured and protected. And for them mosques and congregational mosques, which are always full, have been built for offering prayers five times/' A NEW STAB HISES 19 There was a revival of the Chalukyan hegemony in the Dec- can which lasted with varying degrees of effectiveness till 1189. The last king of the dynasty was stripped of his sovereignty by Bhillama in that year or earlier. Bhillama founded the Yadava dynasty which began to govern the Deccan from Devagiri. The Yadava monarchs were enlightened men who liberally used the resources of their State to promote learning and scholarship. It was during their reign that Marathi took a definite shape, claiming its rightful place among the important languages of the country. A good deal of uncertainty exists about the actual antiquity of the Marathi language, but it is, without doubt, much more than seven hundred years old. A large part of the Marathi literature of the pre-British period has still to see the light of the day. Even so, there is ample published material, which is being continually augmented by the devoted labours of con- temporary writers. The classical Marathi poetry is of great excellence and the richness and the variety of the language is best reflected in the ballad poetry and folk-songs. Marathi is indeed a vigorous and resilient language, which is wholy un- affected by the prejudices of the so-called purists against en- riching itself by means of judicious adaptations from other tongues. It is precisely because it has protected itself from stagnation and atrophy that Marathi faces the future with great confidence, being determined to develop itself into an effective vehicle of thought and expression in order to meet the manifold needs of a modem society. The first great Marathi author was Mukundaraja whose famous philosophical work Vivekasind.hu was written in 1190. He wrote many other books on philosophy and was greatly honoured for his scholarship. By far the greatest luminary in the Marathi literature is Dnyandev whose historic contribution to the domain of letters will be discussed pre- sently. Much impetus was given to the language and literature by the movements in Maharashtra devoted to the reformation of the social and religious life of the people. Pre-eminent among such crusaders were the inspired band of the poet- 20 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT saints of the Pandharpur school whose pious labours, as we shall soon see, caused a great revolution in the mental outlook of the common people, thus paving the way for Shivaji’s cam* paign for political emancipation. The sovereignty of Maharashtra and indeed of the entire south suffered a long period of eclipse following the defeat of die Yadava King, Ramachandra, by Ala-ud-din Khalji in 1294. The circumstances in which Hindu leadership in the south was destroyed by the Muslim invaders have already been discussed in the first chapter. As in the north, perpetual warfare among the rulers of the Deccan and the south gravely undermined their unity and their will to resist the aggressors. It was, for example, the proud claim of the Rashtrakuta imperialists that during the reign of Dhruva, one of their ener- getic and expansionist sovereigns, a number of his neighbouring princes were either in his prison or were his defeated vassals. Again, Ramachandra, the unfortunate Yadava King, failed to realize, notwithstanding his wisdom and benevolence, that a career of conquest was extremely dangerous when his own State and the entire south were threatened with common ruin by the waxing power of the Muslims. The fact of the matter is that the Hindu princes were obsessed with the misguided belief that territorial aggrandizement was part of their kingly responsibilities and a religious obligation. And when their thrones toppled down, it was not they but the common people who struggled and finally succeeded in winning back the herit- age of the land under the inspiration of saints and savants. As we saw earlier, among the many factors that contributed to the downfall of the Hindus was the failure of their social organisation to retain its pristine vigour and resilience. It is true that an essential feature of the caste system was the divi- sion of society into a hierarchy, with its principles of status and subordination, but the gradation had caused no great harm so long as the social order functioned basically as a nexus of rights and obligations. It was precisely because of its remark- able adaptability that such diverse races as the Greeks, the Huns and the. Scythians that poured into the country from A NEW STAB RISES 21 time to time, found a ready asylum in its hospitable and capa- cious bosom. There would indeed have been no religious problem in India if Hinduism had exercised a similar benefi- cent influence upon the early settlers of the Islamic faith in this country. Its failure to do so and the absence of a spirit of adjustment and accommodation among the newcomers, especially in the government of the country and in the propa- gation of their religion, caused a further demoralization in the Hindu ranks. Seldom in history have a defeated people served as a model to their masters in fashioning and regulating their lives. Restoration of cohesion and flexibility to the social system of the Hindus thus became a necessary prelude to the realiza- tion of their political aspirations. Religious reformers arose in many parts of the country and turned a powerful stream of criticism on the champions of the status quo, reaction and obscurantism. The Alvars and others of the Tamilnad, the great Basaveswara of Kamatak and his followers known as the Lingayats, the Vaishnava devotees of Bengal led by Chaitanya, Baba Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, and many others, inveigh- ed against caste arrogance, against a blind adherence to ritual and dogma and against unbridled fetish worship. In fact, they declared war on every belief and practice that lengthened the distance between God and man. The tradition of reform and progress was particularly strong in Maharashtra. A succession of saints and scholars, drawn from every stratum of society, proclaimed the unity of God's creation and from the depth of their own mystic experience, communicated the “symphony of the soul” to their followers. The leader of this great movement was Dnyandev, who flourish- ed towards the end of the thirteenth century. He was a man of amazing versatility and, besides being a saint and a scholar, he was an outstanding literary genius. His masterpiece, Dnyaneshwari, which is an exposition of the Bhagavad Gita, is venerated as a treasure-house of Marathi literature. “All the weight and distinction,” wrote the late Mr. - Justice M. G. Ranade, “that the Marathi language possesses, it owes to 22 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Dnyaneshwar” and added that “to realize the depth of meaning that is contained in the language one must study the Dnyaneshwari.” The rendering of a great work in a foreign language is per- haps a form of vandalism. It has been truly said that you have only to translate Cicero to despise him. Bearing this limita- tion in mind, we may reproduce here a piece from the 'Dnya- neshwari: Who day and night are from all passion free, Within their holy hearts I love to be, Dwelling in sanctity. Hearts of a fervent faith to them belong, Where Dharma reigns; in them that power is strong, That knows right or wrong. They bathe in Wisdom; then their hunger stay, With Perfectness; lo, all in green array, The leaves of Peace are they. Buds of Attainment these; columns they are In Valour’s hall; of joy fetched from afar Each a full water-jar. So dear the path of bhakti, they despise The great Release; e'en in their sport there lies The wisdom of the wise. With pearls of Peace their limbs they beautify; Within their minds as in a scabbard I, The All-indweller, lie. Therefore their love waxes unceasingly, These great-souled ones; not the least rift can be Between their hearts and me: This great prophet of Vedism, who bore the weight of his knowledge so lightly, disdained boastful scholars and taught them some memorable lessons in humility. He dismantled the barrier between the common man and the learned few by writing his great works in Marathi, the language of the people. He was foremost in establishing the tradition that language is a cultural instrument par excellence and certainly not a collec- tion of dead sentences. A NEW STAR RISES 23 The example of Dnyandev communicating his experiences, thoughts and wisdom through the language of the people was followed by a band of poet-saints who not only revolutionized the Marathi literature, but also stimulated a feeling of oneness among the people. Pandharpur became the centre of their devotions and Vithoba, the presiding deity, the object of their adoration and pious labours. The movement was broad-based and democratic and gathered strength and volume with the efflux of time. Men of humble origin, equipped with no formal education, sang in praise of Gbd with all the fervour of their unsophisticated consciousness. Namdev, a saint of the fourteenth century, was a tailor and yet the fact of his so-called low birth did not prevent him from writing lyrics of unsurpassed beauty and simplicity, which still work like an enchantment on his readers. Indeed, so great and popular are his literary compositions that they have secur- ed an honourable . mention in Guru Nanak’s Granthsaheb. Namdev died at the age of eighty in 1350 and had the satisfac- tion of watching the amazing career of his female attendant, Janabai, who became an accomplished poetess, her devotional songs winning a distinctive place in the abhanga literature of Maharashtra. Here is a brief example of Namdev's abhorrence of egoism. He says: From Vedic students first the truth I sought, And found them full of “Thou shalt”, “Thou shalt not”. Never shall they possess tranquillity, For mighty in them is the power of “me”. Eknath, described by G. S. Sardesai, the well-known histo- rian of the .Marathas, as the “greatest Marathi writer of the sixteenth century,” was a Brahmin who sincerely strove to eliminate all man-made distinctions among his fellow-men. He pleaded for the firm establishment of equality and fraternity in the regulation of human affairs and set a shining example in religious and social democracy by taking his place with the humble and the lowly. The doctrine of equality, sd eloquently preached by Eknath and others, crystallized into what is known 24 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT as the varkari movement, the fundamental aim of which was to ignore the unjust and inequitable caste distinctions and grada- tions in the Hindu social system. “The varkari preachings of equality,” says an authority, “find willing hearers among the Deccan Marathas who in peace as in war have always a hanker- ing after equality.” Eknath urged for a democratic outlook, not only in the relations between man and man, but also in the domain of letters. He showed exemplary devotion to Marathi, his mother tongue, and asked, if Sanskrit was the creation of gods, whether Marathi was the offspring of thieves. Eknath’s liberal outlook is best portrayed in the following lines: They say that women and Shudras belong to a low caste. But when you say that God dwells everywhere, then is He not in the heart of a Shudra? Has not a Shudra come from the same place as the Brahman? Is he not also composed, of five elements? Has he no Jbirth; has he no death?, Eknath says: You are misguided when you say that a Shudra belongs to the lowest class. The spiritual and cultural renascence in Maharashtra assum- ed wider proportions as more and more' poet-saints of the Pan- dharpur school came forward to educate and enlighten the mind of the common man. Men and women, drawn from all classes and creeds and from 'every station in life, constituted this ga- laxy. Saint Sena was. a barber, Sawata, a gardener, Chokha- mela, an untouchable; Narahari, a goldsmith and- Joga, an oil- man. • Far from being a disability,- their humble origin was .their best qualification for teaching the common man the first prin- ciples in belief and in social outlook- so that, he could emerge all the more, readily from the trammels of superstition and ritu- alism. Indeed, it was the untiring labours .of these devoted sons and daughters of God that greatly .helped to .popularize religion and to give unity of belief, “a tranquillizing daily ritual A NEW STAB RISES 25 of prayer and a disciplined perspective of life” among all sec- tions of the people. The name of Tukaram stands pre-eminent among these popu- lar teachers. This unique saint, whose abhangs are sung daily in millions of homes, sang in praise of Vithoba, his favourite deity, with an ecstasy that surpasses belief. His songs, meant for the learned as well as the lowly, are composed in the lan- guage of the common man with uncomman wisdom. Tukaram hailed from the vani or trading community and was a contem- porary of Shivaji. It was both beyond his scope and his tem- perament to preach the sermon of political revolt to the people, but by stimulating in them a passionate devotion to their faith, he paved the way, perhaps unwittingly, for the advent of swa- rajya under the leadership of the great liberator. As a Marathi writer pertinently remarks, the region of Tukaram’s ministra- tions became a prolific ground for the recruitment of soldiers to Shivaji’s army. The following passage vividly portrays Tukaram’s capacity for complete self-surrender to God. He sings: “This is my pray- er to Thee, 0 God. I place my head on Thy feet. Let my body be where it likes, but let my mind always rest on Thy feet. Let me spend my time in meditating on Thee. Let me turn away from body and mind and wealth. Release me at the time of death from such dangers as phlegm and wind and bile. So long as my senses are whole, I have called upon Thee, in order that, Thou mightest hplp, me. ultimately.” , . Ramdas Swami, who was bom in 1608 and survived his royal disciple,- Shivaji, by a year, was cast in a different mould from that of the religious teachers that preceded or were contem- poraneous with him.. He was indeed a saint without the sack cloth. The -tireless labours of a succession of poet-saints, ex- tending over many centuries, had created among the people of Maharashtra a sense of oneness in their social and spiritual concerns, thus preparing the ground for a rapid growth, of political consciousness. Ramdas Swami took full advantage of these favourable conditions. His heart bled at. the sight of poverty and suffering and he was roused to indignation at the 26 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT degradation of his people and their unchallenging submission to tyranny and oppression. He was a Brahmin, but he attacked the priestly class with devastating frankness for its failure to maintain high standards of personal rectitude, of learning and of leadership. He exposed the folly of despising worldly wis- dom and refused to countenance any extreme form of “other- worldliness”. It is precisely because Ramdas’s teachings constituted a re- markable combination of the spiritual with, the mundane that they became most acceptable to Shivaji. The Swami advised his disciple “to adorn his body, not with clothes and ornaments, but with shrewdness and wisdom”. To spread the message of God, to protect the poor, the pious and the helpless, to strive for the well-being of his subjects, to remain eternally vigilant, and to practise the virtue of forbearance and tolerance— these, declared Ramdafs Swami, were the essential qualifications of a good and great ruler. He assured Shivaji that he enjoyed all these noble attributes in full measure and bade him Godspeed in his mighty undertaking. “Activism,” declare the learned authors quoted earlier, was the most characteristic feature of Ramdas’s teachings. “No wonder,” they add, “that, with this teaching, he helped the foundation of the Maratha kingdom as no other saint had done before.” Conditions were thus most propitious in Maharashtra for striking boldly, in the cause of independence, but the tasV could be undertaken only by a man of genius. Maharashtra abounded in powerful Maratha chieftains, but they had all sworn undying loyalty to one or the other of the three surviv- ing succession States of the Bahmani kingdom, namely, Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Golkonda. Lukhji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed, Shivaji’s grandfather from his mother’s side,' was the premier Maratha nobleman at the court of the Nizamshah of Ahmadnagar. He was in command of ten thousand horse, for the support of which he enjoyed large estates. He \vas a man of great distinction and affluence and was widely respected both in the realm of his sovereign and outside. But his ambi- tion never transgressed the bounds prescribed for a dutiful A NEW STAR RISES 27 feudatory—a melancholy fact which did not prevent him from holding himself in the highest esteem, especially in his dealings with his fellow-Marathas. Shivaji's own ancestors, the Bhosles of Verul,* a village near Daulatabad, were in the service of the Sultans of Ahmadnagar. In conformity with the convention of the time, they claimed descent from a remote scion of the Sisodia dynasty of Udaipur in Rajasthan. Maloji, Shivaji’s grandfather, was an ambi- tious and determined person and it was these estimable quali- ties, more than his lineage, that brought him to the fore. Maloji and his brother, Vithoji, did not inherit any great for- tune, but the absence of material prosperity at the beginning of their career was amply compensated for by their supreme confidence in themselves. Both were sturdily built and both were endowed with an abundance of courage and daring. They were never in doubt about their ability to forge to the forefront by their own resourcefulness. Maloji began his career by taking service under Jadhavrao, but the social dist- ance that separated him from his master never daunted this determined man from entertaining the most vaulting ambitions both for himself and his family. His pertinacity and his value to the Sultan as a competent soldier eventually gave him suc- cess in full measure. After much hesitation, the proud Jadhavrao gave the hand of his daughter, Jijabai, in marriage to Maloji’s son, Shahaji/the illustrious father of Shivaji. Bijapur claimed the allegiance of a larger number of Maratha families among whom the Mores were pre-eminent. The Mores of Javli, near Mahableshwar, the famous hill-station in the State of Maharashtra, rose to power by their unflagging devotion to their Muslim overlords and by their ruthless cam- paign of aggression against their own kinsmen. They received the hereditary title of Chandrarao for the conspicuous display of courage by the head of the family in a critical situation and enjoyed a plenitude of prestige and influence in the hilly region till a just retribution overtook them for their perfidious con- duct towards the great liberator. “The invariable submis- * Now known as Ellora 28 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT sion,” writes Grant Duff, “manifested by this Raja probably induced the government to exact little more than a nominal tribute from districts producing so little, and which had always been in disorder under Mahomedan management” The Nimbalkars of Phaltan, whose original surname was Pawar, were among the other Maratha pillars of the Bijapur Sultanate. Jagpalrao Naik was a shining light of the Nimbal- kar family and, both in his ambitions and in his ability to rea- lize them, he bore a striking resemblance to Maloji Bhosle, upon whom he bestowed his sister, Dipabai, in marriage. The union of the two distinguished families was of much signific- ance and the advocacy of Jagpalrao on behalf of his brother- in-law played no small part in influencing the decision of the chief of Sindkhed to marry his daughter to Shahaji. Though small in size, Phaltan survived many political vicissitudes and functioned as a feudatory of the British Government in India till, along with the other Deccan States, it was integrated into Bombay State, following the merger agreement of February 1948. It is profitless to pursue further the story of the Maratha vassals of the Muslim rulers, but the Ghorpades deserve special mention. With a few exceptions, the Ghorpades played an outstanding part both during the war of independence and later, thus winning an honoured place for themselves in' the annals of Maharashtra. Originally known , as Bhbsles, they secured the new surname, following the display of exceptional resourcefulness by one of their ancestors. During the Bahmani dynasty, a daring Bhosle scaled what was regarded as an im- pregnable fort in the Konkan with the aid of an iguana or ghorpad, thus winning for himself and his 'descendants the new surname. Among the Maratha captains that hastened the des- truction of the Moghul Empire after the death of Shivaji by demoralizing and defeating Aurangzeb’s armies, the name of Santaji Ghorpade stands supreme. But the record of some of the Ghorpades of Mudhol was darkened by treachery and in- trigue against their own countrymen. In the wars between Bijapur and Vijayanagar, the sword of Mudhol. was always em* A NEW STAB RISES 29 ployed against the great Hindu empire. In 1520, Maloji, the ruler of Mudhol, laid down his life in one such conflict in an attempt to save that of his master, the Sultan. His son, Karan- singh, out-heroded Herod by enthusiastically participating in the great coalition of the Muslim Powers of the Deccan that led to the destruction of the Vijayanagar Empire in 1565. The intrigues and machinations of Baji Ghorpade in Shivaji's time indicated the depth of degradation to which some of the mem- bers of the family had descended. Indeed, selfishness, treachery and an abject submission to Muslim authority were the triple evils that dominated the careers of most of the Marathas before the advent of Shivaji. They were animated by no noble ambitions nor were they in- spired by any high sense of purpose. Quick to take offence, they fought among themselves with bitter animosity, much to the advantage and delectation of their Muslim sovereigns. A mere rood of land, the headship of a petty village and an in- sult, real or imaginary, could set off the most murderous strife among the chieftains, while their principal concern ought to have been to unite and to strive for the restoration of the country’s greatness. Grant Duff writes : “Neither national sentiment, nor unity of language and religion, prevented their fighting against each other. Not only did Mahratta subjects of these governments (namely, Bijapur, Ahmadnagar and Gol- konda) stand in array opposed to each other, but the most active enmity was frequently evinced between members of the same family. They fought with rancour wherever individual dispute or hereditary feuds existed; and that spirit of rivalry in families, which was fomented by the kings of the Bahmani dynasty, was one means of keeping the Mahrattas poised against each other in the dynasties which succeeded them.” The pestilential doctrine of divide and rule has always proved a potent instrument in the hands of aggressors to keep their subject peoples in a state of helplessness. The Muslim rulers reaped a rich harvest from Maratha dis- unity in precisely the same manner as the British Government in India profited from Indian disunity in later centuries. By 80 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT skilfully playing one Maratha chieftain against another, they insured and strengthened the loyalty of both factions to their own person and dynasty. Having thus secured the adhesion of these powerful but misguided men, they could play with impunity with the life and honour of individual Marathas, no matter how highly they were placed. The extent of the internecine quarrels in Maharashtra is best illustrated by the uncompromising hostility that plagued the relations between the Jadhavs of Sindkhed and Shivaji’s father and grandfather, although the two families had been united by the sacred ties of marriage. It was the certainty of the know- ledge that no retribution would overtake him that the Nizam- shah could summon courage to massacre treacherously such a powerful military leader as Lukhji Jadhavrao, his sons and his kinsmen on July 25, 1629. No Maratha raised his little finger in an attempt to compel the Sultan to atone for his crime. Shivaji’s own father, the powerful Shahaji, could be imprison- ed, humbled and humiliated with impunity by the Bijapur Sultan, despite the fact that the stability of the State depended in no small measure upon the sword-arm of the Maratha nobleman. There cannot be a shadow of doubt that the unquestioning loyalty of the Marathas was ill-requited by their Muslim mas- ters. Commenting on the “unattractive” story of the Bahmani dynasty, the Oxford History of India says : “Between 1347 and 1518 the throne was occupied by fourteen sultans, of whom four were murdered, and two others were deposed and blinded. With the exception of the fifth sultan, a quiet peaceful man, all the sovereigns who attained maturity were bloodthirsty fanatics. Humayun was a monster, comparable only with the most infamous tyrants named in history”. Calling attention to the fact that the achievements of the dynasty were sterile, the same authority goes on to say: “The Bahmani sultans failed in the atrocious attempt made more than once by mem - bers of the dynasty to exterminate the population of the Hindu states of the Deccan, or in default of extermination to drive it by force into the fold of Islam”. The author points out that, A NEW STAR RISES 31 in spite of their mad orgy of murder and massacre, the rulers signally failed in their wicked purpose. The record of the rulers of Ahmadnagar and Bijapur was certainly less sanguinary and some of them were in fact inspir- ed by a genuinely broad and catholic outlook. For instance, in the counsels of Ibrahim Adilshah, the Hindus held a domi- nant position and his indulgence towards their faith won for him the somewhat flamboyant title of Jagadguru or “world- preceptor”. Incidentally, Ibrahim’s reign furnishes a signifi- cant example of how easy it was to win the gratitude and adulation of the Hindus who, in their debased condition, con- sidered every trivial concession as the highest act of generosity. The fickleness of their good fortune was, however, power- fully borne in upon the Hindus in the reign of Mahmud Adil- shah when intolerance and oppression were again enthroned. Like the fanatical Sultans of Delhi, he adopted as his state policy grossly discriminatory measures against the Hindus who were prevented from holding high positions in his government. No Hindu could claim the right of equality with any Muslim, no matter what the status and the standing of the latter was and no matter how depraved and despicable the former happened to be. Among the duties prescribed for the kazi or judge was one of destroying and despoiling Hindu temples—a very honourable and meritorious function indeed! This “enlighten- ed” monarch held sway during the rise of Shivaji. None of the great Maratha families in the service of the Sultan—-the Bhosles, the Nimbalkars, the Mores and the Ghor- pades—ventured to protest against such calculated affront to their religion, honour and manhood. A Marathi author writes with evident indignation and bitterness that the Marathas of the time were only capable of fighting like game cocks among themselves and of readily perishing for their masters. They had in fact sold both their swords and their souls for a mess of pottage. It is useless to labour the point further. In all countries and climes and at all times, a prince without power is an object of contempt and derision. It could not be other- wise in India or Maharashtra. Shivaji succeeded in enforcing SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT the payment of tribute to him by the kings of Bijapur, his father’s overbearing overlords, and in treating the Sultan of Golkonda on terms of equality, besides winning the unstinted admiration of all who watched his achievements, entirely be- cause he had acquired an irresistible power in order to compel compliance with his will. Shivaji was bom on April 6, 1627* in the hill-fort of Shivneri, overlooking the town of Junnar near Poona. Neither the state of the country nor the condition of his parents conduced to the child’s growing in peace and security. His father, Shahaji, whose restless disposition drove him to change his masters from time to time, had made the wrong choice of championing the dying cause of Ahmadnagar, the destruction of which had become a major aim of Emperor Shah Jahan, who realized it in 1632. In order to avert it, Shahaji had set up a young prince of the Nizamshahi house as a roi faineant in the hope of administering the State himself, but his ambitious pro- ject was defeated by the superior resources of the Moghuls. Himself pursued by the enemy, he was unable to give protec- tion to his wife, Jijabai, and her infant son, who, as members of his family, also incurred the displeasure of the commander of the imperial forces. Jijabai received little help from her powerful father, Lukhji Jadhavrao, who had now made com- mon cause with the Moghuls. She suffered many privations and humiliations during her wanderings through dangerous and inhospitable regions in her desperate attempts to elude the Moghul troops. She was eventually caught and interned at Kondana or Sinhgad, the famous hill-fortress near Poona. She, however, successfully shielded her new-born child from the difficulties and dangers that surrounded her by concealing him in an unknown place like “a flame in a vessel”. The married life of Shahaji and Jijabai was not quite happy. Apart from the fact that he had taken another wife, which was, * The actual date of Shivaji’s birth is the subject of much learned debate and discussion. Whether he was born on the date indi- cated above or on February 19, 1630, as some authorities contend, the basic facts about his career and achievements remain un- affected. t A NEW STAR RISES 83 however, in perfect accord with the prevailing custom, there was an obvious incompatibility of temperament between the two. Jijabai was a sensitive and proud lady who had seen much at Ahmadnagar to cause her deep distress about the unhappy condition of her countrymen. The iron had entered her soul, following her harrowing experiences soon after Shivaji’s birth. If a high-born and influential lady could not gain immunity from persecution, it was easy to imagine the plight of the com- mon, defenceless people. Besides experiencing the imperious will of his wife, Shahaji could not escape the premonition that his son, when he came of age, would not be readily amenable to paternal discipline, except on his own impossible terms. When peace was restored in the Deccan, Shahaji entered the Bijapur service in October 1636. There, in the capital of his new master, he received ample evidence of his son’s recalci- trance and spirit of rebellion. A growing lad of ten, Shivaji spent the most impressionable three years at the Adilshabi court, which, thanks to his precocity, gave him a valuable in- sight into the political system of the Muslim kingdom. Intro- duced to Mahmud Adilshah, he declined to make the traditional obeisance of servility, contenting himself with the manlier Maratha style of salutation. Perhaps, it required all the persua- sive eloquence of Shahaji to pacify the irate Sultan and his mischievous courtiers, who regarded the advent of the new Maratha chieftain to the court as an unpardonable invasion of their own interests. The city of Bijapur was large, well-populated and abounded in stately mansions and splendid tombs and mosques. Ihere was wealth, luxury and refinement, but to the common folk these amenities were as remote as the stars in the sky. “Behind the splendid facade of the 1 fcity’s life,” writes Dennis Kincaid, “the display of the courtiers ‘insolent and stubborn and not easily bridled’ and the apparently universal reverence shown to the Sultan ... there was a darker side to life in Bijapur. Apart from the Violent tenor of life inevitable in such a society, it was obvious that the majority of the Sultan’s Hindu subjects were oppressed intermittently but irritatingly.’'’ 34 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT In this city of splendour and barbarism, where “processions of execution were as frequent as processions of holiday and fes- tival”, Shivaji saw much that both instructed and repelled him. He saw how persistent attempts to impose the hegemony of the minority over the majority with the aid of intolerance and oppression had led to an almost irreconcilable estrangement between the two communities. He also saw how the noblest sons of the Maratha race prided themselves upon being privi- leged to place their heads on the foot-stool of the Sultan. Burn- ing with anger, the mettlesome youth created a stir in the capi- tal and gravely compromised his father’s position by registering an open protest against cow slaughter. His spirited attack on the Muslim butchers was an unheard of occurrence in the city. The parting of the ways between father and son came sooner than was probably anticipated by either. Shahaji, who was directed to proceed to the south on a military expedition, wel- comed the opportunity to send his wife and son to Poona, the seat of his jagir, so that the youth might no longer implicate himself and his father by getting into new scrapes. Thence- forward the company of his father became rare and uncertain for Shivaji. He, therefore, began to lean heavily upon his mother whom he gradually raised to the pedestal of a deity, The ways of his father were indeed different. Shahaji was brave, chivalrous and generous to a fault. He was also a great patron of learning; indeed, he was endowed with all the gifts and abil- ities necessary for raising the standard of revolt. But he re- coiled from that undertaking, seeking solace from the belief that he, at any rate, was not equipped to tempt fate. He, therefore, felt no uneasiness when drawing tlie sword against the remnants of the Vijayanagar Empire in the south. Nor did he allow himself to be roused to anger when the Bijapur armies plundered the great pilgrim centres in the south and earned away the rich booty to the capital. Shahaji was a valiant; soldier, but unhappily he was not gifted with a wide-ranging mind When he met his death by accident in January 1664, he had , however, the supreme satisfaction of seeing his son grow in power and glory as an independent sovereign. A NEW STAR RISES 35 The task of preparing Shivaji for his historic mission fell upon two outstanding persons. His mother, a woman of great perception and of masterful personality, decided that her son, in whom alone she now found the solace of her life, should not on any account seek a career for himself under a Muslim monarch. Like Euripides, she defined a slave as a man who had lost his liberty of thought, opinion and action. It was im- possible that Shivaji should sink into ignoble anonymity by join- ing the crowd of enslaved sardars at the Muslim courts. He should be prepared for a truly noble and exalted task, namely, the liberation of Maharashtra and through it of India from the incubus of intolerance, oppression and misrule. In this great undertaking, Jijabai was enthusiastically sup- ported by Dadaji Konddev, the kulkarni of the village of Mal- than, who was, in the words of Grant Duff, one of Shahaji's “most confidential men”. Dadaji was much more than a village officer. He was shrewd, competent, industrious and, whac was rare in his time, absolutely honest. The jagir extended from Junnar in the north to Wai in the south and “included Chakan, Supa, Baramati and Indapur as the principal Talukas”. Dadaji built a large house for the young jagirdar and his mother at Poona and set about improving the condition of the village which was then little better than an unhealthy and rob- ber-infested place. He hunted down the wild animals that roamed in the region and restored law and order by firmly suppressing robbery and brigandage. The magnitude of the reform undertaken and accomplished by him and the blessing which it conferred on the people of the jagir is best illustrated by the following description of the lawlessness that had pre- vailed before he took charge of the estates. “To grow a crop.” say Kincaid and Parasnis, “was merely to invite a troop of hos- tile cavalry to cut it and probably kill its owner. Nor was this the only danger. The invaders usually carried away with them tie children of both sexes and the young women and forcibly converted them. Thanks to Dadaji’s efficient management, confidence revived and more and more hillmen descended to the plains to till the lands that were offered to them on easy 86 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT and attractive terms. Cultivation increased, and with it, pros- perity returned to the jagir. Fruit trees were planted on an extensive scale, and the mangoes of Shivapur are still greatly prized in the district. Dadaji’s personal rectitude became pro- verbial and made a profound impression upon the mind of his ward. Great care was taken by Jijabai and the Brahmin tutor in preparing Shivaji for his responsibilities. He was taught history in order to make history. Dadaji was a learned man and show- ed great earnestness in painting before the young patriot an inspiring picture of India’s ancient greatness, her spiritual and material splendour and her monumental achievements. He described to the wondering lad the heritage of the country, as portrayed in its great religious and literary works, including the Epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Arjuna, the incom- parable archer, and Bhima, the club-wielding Hercules of the Epics, were held before Shivaji as exemplars of ancient India’s brave and skilful warriors. The virtues of Dharmaraja were ex- plained to him to prove that truth and goodness would always prevail when judiciously supported by strength. . The Ramayana also became an enthralling theme for Dadaji’s discourse: And ’tis told by ancient sages, during Rama’s happy reign, Death untimely, dire diseases, came not to his subject men; Widows wept not in their sorrow for their lords untimely lost, Mothers wailed not in their anguish for their babes by Yama crost; Robbers, cheats and gay deceivers tempted not with lying word Neighbour loved his righteous neighbour, and the people loved, their lord, Trees their ample produce yielded as returning seasons went, And the earth in grateful never-failing harvest lent. Rains descended in their season, never came the blighting gale, Rich in crap and rich in pasture was each soft and smiling vale, Loom and anvil gave their produce, and the tilled and fertile soil, ' And the nation lived rejoicing in their old ancestral toil. A NEW STAB RISES 37 This is utopia par excellence, but the receptive mind of Shivaji accepted it as a feasible goal. At any rate, it was perfectly within tiie region of possibility to rescue Maharashtra from the vale of tears. Besides these heart-warming stories, he was instructed in the simple wisdom embodied in the sayings and songs of the saints of Maharashtra. In short, all the latent impulses in the young man were roused to active consciousness by reminding him of India’s past greatness and of her present prostrate condition. In addition to the training of the mind and the intellect, Shivaji was taught all the accomplishments necessary for the profession of arms. Perhaps the most significant part of his education was the opportunity presented to him to learn invalu- able lessons from the book of life. As part of the practical training of the young man in the administration of the jagir, Dadaji often took him to different parts of the fief during his tours of inspection. What he saw and heard during these visits was a great revelation to Shivaji. He soon developed a pas- sionate attachment to the country around the Sahyadri hills known as Maval and its hardy inhabitants called Mavlas. The unadorned beauty of nature, represented by the rugged and tree- clad hills and valleys, exercised an irresistible fascination on him. Not only on the occasion of Dadaji’s tours, but indepen- dently and more often, he ran to the hills around Poona and held long and intimate communion with nature. He saw with the eye of a bom military leader that no terrain could offer better scope for the Parthian methods of warfare. He wandered widely but purposefully in the wilderness 1 and became familiar with every nook and comer and every glade and thicket of the forests. The hills and valleys unfolded their secrets to the dili- gent explorer whose wanderings, besides hardening his body, inspired him with lofty resolutions. Shivaji evinced a sincere and spontaneous affection and admi- ration for the humble hill-folk, whose rough exterior, he real- ized, merely screened their sterling qualities. They were brave, loyal, hardy, hospitable and industrious. Despite their poverty and subjection to unjust government, they had not abandoned .38 stttvajt : THE PORTRAIT’ OF A PATRIOT the old virtues of rustic simplicity, of honest toil, and of un- affected devotion to their ancestral faith. With such inestim- able qualities in them, it was possible to organise them into an irresistible force and to win great causes. “Shivaji,” says Grant Duff, “was always partial to the Mavlis” because he obseived that “they were active and intelligent in anything to which they had been accustomed, and remarkably faithful in situations of trust.” The earnestness of Shivaji and his attractive personality fasci- nated young and old that came near him. To the old beards, from whom he heard harrowing tales of suffering and humilia- tion, he confided the hopeful message of early deliverance. It was a period of anxiety and uncertainty, but the wise men of the villages soon discovered in the young master a true incar- nation of courage and fortitude. They readily assured him of their own co-operation and that of their sons in his crusade for national independence. To the young men in particular the attraction of Shivaji’s personality was irresistible. Though the son of a nobleman, his democratic attitude, his affability, and his spirit of comrade- ship won for him the undying loyalty of the flower of Miha- rashtra’s manhood. Gomaji Naik Panasambal, Yesaji Kank, Tanaji Malusare, Baji Pasalkar and Bajirao Jedhe were among his earliest adherents. Some of these men enjoyed much pres- tige and influence in their villages and their adhesion to Shi- vaji’s cause gave a great fillip to the patriotic movement. A shrewd judge of men and things, Dadaji clearly foresaw the coming events and inwardly rejoiced at his protege’s noble incli- nations. The old Brahmin, however, owed a responsibility to Shahaji and shrank from the risk of being accused of negligence in the performance of his duties or of conniving at what an adherent of the status quo would undoubtedly have regarded as the growing intransigence and “disloyalty” of Shivaji. Even so, hig protests to the young man were mild and were merely intended to ensure that Shahaji was not implicated by his son’s adventures. A NEW STAB BISES For his jpart, Shivaji was careful not to embarrass Dadaji and regulated his conduct accordingly, without at the same time compromising with any of his cherished principles. The old and trusted friefad of the family died on March 7, 1647 which released the fledgling genius from all unnecessary con- straints, his future course of action being guided almost entirely by the exigencies of the situations that confronted him from time to time. Besides, he was fortified in his resolution by the benedictions of the dying man who, to quote Grant Duff, “advised him to prosecute his plans of independence; to pro- tect Brahmins, kine, and cultivators; to preserve the temples of the Hindus from violation; and to follow the fortune which lay before him”. It was impossible for Shivaji to adopt any other course. Apart from the dying wish of his respected benefactor, his own incli- nations were strongly in favour of striving for an independent career. “There seems to be little doubt,” says Rawlinson, “that Shivaji grew up with a genuine sense of a mission— that his career was inspired by a real desire to free his country from what he considered to be a foreign tyranny.” Moreover, his mother’s firm conviction about the need for establishing a new polity in the country through his instrumentality admitted of no doubt or vacillation on his part in the choice of his career. Apart from these considerations, everyone of which was weighty; the situation in the country clinched the issue. In Bija- pur, to which his father had pledged his loyalty, a tyrant and a bigot was on the throne. Sir Jadunath Sarkar draws attention to a Muslim authority’s detailed description of the unbridl- ed oppression of the Hindus by Mahmud Adilshah as a deliberate State policy. Besides, “the inconsistency, intrigue and bloodshed which stained the court of Bijapur” were the most decisive deterrents to Shivaji’s acceptance of service under its Government. “I have seen,” declared Bis- marck, “three kings naked and the sight was not always a pleasant onel’\ The sight of a single nude sovereign was evidently too much for Shivaji! 40 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT A career in the Moghul Empire was fraught with even graver consequences. “The imperialists,” to quote Sarkar again, “had killed Kheloji Bhosle, his uncle, and their superior resources and organization made it unlikely for the Hindus of the Deccan to enjoy greater toleration or power under them than under the weaker and smaller sultanates close at hand”. Shivaji, there- fore, gladly responded to the natural bent of his mind and took the solemn decision to draw the sword in the cause of inde- pendence, depending for his success on the righteousness of his undertaking and the spontaneous support of his people.

His ambition and his audacity were indeed amazing. The son of a Sardar, whose strength and status depended entirely upon his unflagging devotion and loyalty to the throne of Bijapur, chose to uproot the most firmly en- trenched Muslim rule in India. The resources of the Deccan jagir of Shahaji, from where his son launched his campaign for independence, were pitifully inadequate for raising armies or for waging wars of long duration. Many who failed to grasp the moral and spiritual significance of the movement, wondered whether Shivaji had not in fact set out to achieve the impos- sible. His attempt, they thought, was like an anthill seeking to measure its absurd height with that of the towering Himalayas! They were not wrong in their forebodings. Ranged against the young patriot was the kingdom of Bijapur which was still at the height of its power and glory. Even more formidable was the Moghul Empire which, under the government of Shah Jahan, the grand monarch, had attained the pinnacle of strength and splendour. It was indeed the noon of Moghul imperialism in India. Shivaji’s war of independence was, however, begun, not against the Moghuls, but against his neighbour, Bijapur. The resources of this Muslim State in the Deccan, though not comparable with those of the imperialists, were formidable enough to crush any rising power in its neighbourhood. The realm of the Adilshah was in fact the .largest and the most powerful among the surviving Sultanates of the Deccan. Its annual revenue in 1656 totalled nearly eight crores of rupees, besides Rs. 5^ crores received from its feudatories. It was defended by a large and well-equipped army consisting of 80,000 cavalry, 250,000 infantry and 530 war elephants. Such were the mighty powers with whom Shivaji decided to measure his strength. 42 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Shiva] i took the first step towards independence unobtru- sively in 1646 by gaining possession of Toma, a hill-fort “ex- ceedingly difficult of access”, situated twenty miles south-west of Poona. While reconstructing the fortress, ' he • discovered a treasure-trove which, containing two lakh hons, furnished him with the much-prized sinews of war. He welcomed the find as auguring well for his cause and used part of the treasure in equipping his adherents with arms and ammunition. The bulk of it was, however, employed in the construction of another fort on the crest of the same mountain called Morbad. He gave the new hill-fort the name of Rajgad. The task of building the fort was entrusted to Moro Pingle who showed considerable engineering skill in making it an impregnable stronghold. Raj- gad became the capital of Shivaji’s kingdom for many years till Rairi, rebuilt and renamed as Raigad, won this honour. The revolution, though silently started in a sequestered part of the country, did not fail to attract the attention of the Bija- pur Government, although Mahmud Adilshah, who held sway over a large kingdom, was not unduly perturbed by the initial activities of Shivaji. It is, however, evident from the Sultan’s letter to a local baron that the young Maratha’s adventure was by no means overlooked by 1 his father’s master. Shivaji’s clever explanation of his action, which he defended on the plausible ground that he was a. far more zealous protector of the Sultan’s interests than his venal, lazy and inefficient officers, appears to have satisfied the distant Government and the amour propre of its head. A judicious distribution of gold at the court also played some part in allowing him freedom to pursue his con- quests. Shivaji’s exploits soon became popular among the Marathas who swelled the ranks of his followers in ever-increasing num- bers. An outstanding man to champion his cause was Phiran- goji Narsala, the valiant commander of the strategically impor- tant fort of Chakan on the Poona-Nas'ik road. The example of Phirangoji, whose prestige and influence in the district were great, was followed by many other officers, young and old, all of whom swore unswerving loyalty to their new master. THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 43 Perhaps Shivaji’s most important acquisition at this time was the surrender of the famous fort of Kondana to him by its Muslim commander. Situated about twelve miles immediately south of Poona, Kondana has become famous in history as the scene of the most stirring and heroic deeds. Its strategic im- portance has been well stated by Kincaid and Parasnis who write: “Whoever held Kondana, dominated not only the Muta valley but the Poona plain as far as Chakan.” The name of the fortress was appropriately changed to Sinhgad or Lion Fort after its transfer to Maratha hands. In 1648 Shivaji gained control over Purandar, another cele- brated hill-fort of Maharashtra and probably even more stu- pendous than the Lion' Fort. Lying eighteen miles from Poona and to the south-east of Sinhgad, the fortress of Purandar was under the command of a Brahmin called Nilkanth Samaik who held his charge under the Bijapur Government. Nilkanth was known in the neighbourhood as a man of stern and sombre rectitude. He had caused his wife to be blown to pieces from the cannon’s mouth for provoking his fiery temper. The death of this extraordinary person gave rise to a dispute over the succession among his sons. Bijapur was distant and its deci- sions were notoriously dilatory. Shivaji, whose star had by now begun to rise, was invited to arbitrate. The importance of the fortress and its value to his scheme of things, decided him to place the common cause above the interests of the factious brothers. The wisdom of his disposition was fully confirmed by subsequent events. The family of Samaiks remained steadfast in their loyalty to the Maratha Empire till its dissolution, while his control over the fort gave Shivaji immeasurable strength in facing his formidable enemies. Shivaji thus steadily advanced towards his goal by employ- ing every means within his scope. He combined adroit diplo- macy with an eloquent appeal, to patriotism, both of which ;were occasionally supported by force. The end was indeed the paramount consideration and nothing could deflect him from his resolution to reach it. He gave early proofs of the inflexi- bility of his determination by surprising an elderly but hostile 44 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT kinsman in his own town and sending him away to distant Bangalore. Sambhaji Mohite was the commander of the Supa Petha. He obstinately refused to make common cause with Shivaji, although the entire neighbourhood had proclaimed its adhesion to the young man’s movement. There was evidently no place in resurgent Maharashtra for a man of Mohite’s out- moded outlook and he was accordingly despatched to Shahaji, his brother-in-law. By gaining control over the important forts around Poona, which stood sentinel to his new territory, Shivaji began to func- tion, not as his father’s deputy or as an agent of the Bijapur Sultan, but as a prince in his own right. He now stretched his gaze beyond his modest realm, “watching and crouching, ’’ as Grant Duff has so expressively put it, “like the wily tiger of his own mountain-valleys, until he has stolen into a situation from which he could at once spring on his prey”. The tiger had not long to wait. From the outset, Shivaji had organized an admirable intelligence service. He had taken in his pay a number of able and energetic men who roamed far beyond his own territories and sent him accurate and up-to- date information about all important happenings in the coun- try. Thus apprised, he was able to make careful preparations for meeting any critical situation with the thoroughness of a man who has been forewarned of coming events. One day, his scouts brought him news that a large treasure was on its way from Kalyan, then as now an important town at the head of the Bombay creek, to Bijapur to relieve the financial embarrass- ment of the Sultan's Government. The route of the convoy was through the rugged hills of Maharashtra and it would have been the height of unwisdom on the part of Shivaji not to annex such a great prize. He made careful preparations to intercept the convoy and to capture the treasure by surprising the guards. The Mara- thas fell upon the Bijapur troops as the convoy was laboriously negotiating a difficult ascent along a mountain pass and gained possession of the treasure by killing or dispersing the Sultan’s soldiers. The loss of life in the skirmish on Shivaji's side was THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 45 negligible, but the families of the men that fell in action were generously rewarded, while the wounded were suitably looked after and provided for. Shivaji had no illusions about the consequences of his open defiance of the Bijapur Government and in order to gather more strength for consolidating his posi- tion, he made a surprise attack on the forts in the vicinity ot Kalyan and annexed as many as nine of them to his territory. More important among these acquisitions were Lohgad, Raj- machi and Rairi. Rajmachi is a stupendous fortified hill at the foot of the Bhor pass, while Rairi eventually won the distinc- tion of becoming Shivaji’s capital, as much on account of its natural strength as because of its accessibility to the plains of the Konkan and the mountainous regions of Maharashtra. The traveller from Poona to Bombay can see the lofty fortress of Lohgad, with the sister hill-fort of Visapur, perched on the heights of the Bhor Ghat. While Shivaji was making these important conquests, one of his officers made a surprise attack on Kalyan and captured it. Kalyan was the seat of the Muslim Governor of the Bijapur Government and, besides being a prosperous port, was the chief “point of departure for the numerous pilgrim-ships plying be- tween Western India and Mecca”. At this time, the office of Governor was held by an Arab foreigner called Mulla Ahmad, one of the leading nobles of Bijapur. His administration was lax and unpopular and a change in the government was heartily welcomed by the people. “The capture of Kalyan,” says Pro- fessor H. G. Rawlinson, “was the signal for a general uprising. The people were tired of Mahommedan misgoverament, and Shivaji prudently established Dadaji’s wise revenue system in each of his fresh acquisitions. Fort after fort opened its gates and the Konkan, as far as the border of Sawantwadi, was soon in the hands of the Marathas.” The Government of the new province was placed in charge of Abaji Sondev, a trusted officer of the Maratha State. Many pleasant episodes have been recorded in the annals of Maharashtra to illustrateyShivaji’s abounding generosity, his innate goodness and his sense of rectitude when dealing with 46 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT women. It was customary for Mulla Ahmad, the dispossessed Governor, to spend most of his time away from his charge in order to .be close to his sovereign at Bijapur. When Shivaji conquered Kalyan, the family of Mulla Ahmad fell into the hands of the Marathas. The young daughter-in-law of the Muslim nobleman, a woman of striking beauty, was sent to Shivaji. The great Maratha rose as the lady was brought into his presence and, bowing to her graciously, complimented her on her charming appearance, exclaiming: “How I wish that my mother had been as beautiful as you are! I would then have been more handsome!” The assembled persons were dumbfounded at the spectacle. By his simple and soft-spoken words, address- ed to a captured lady, Shivaji proclaimed his firm adherence to the noble policy of respecting women, no matter to which reli- gion or country or station in life they belonged. To give another example of Shivaji’s large-heartedness during his expedition around Kalyan, he captured Prabalgad, near Panvel, then under the control of a Bijapur officer called Kesari Singh. The commandant was killed in action and his family sought refuge in a comer of the fort, fearing that the Maratha leader would put them to the sword. When the report of their panic and distress was brought to Shivaji’s notice, he promptly went to the place where the mother and other members of Kesari Singh’s family had taken shelter ahd prostrated himself before the lady as a token of his respect for her. Despite her grief, the woman was mollified by his kindly behaviour and was sent back to her village in a palanquin, loaded with riches and with a liberal provision for the surviving members of the family. The mortal remains of the dead captain were consigned to the flames according to the prescribed rites and with all the honours due to a valiant foe. Such examples of Shivaji’s sense of fair play and generosity towards his adversaries greatly increased his reputation as a high-principled and humane conqueror. Bijapur was now roused to a fuller realization of the magni- tude of the peril that threatened it from Maharashtra. But there was no change in the imbecilityesrf-the court which clung to the absurd belief that a great movement, deriving its strength THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 47 and sanctions from popular support, could be smothered by wielding the simple but despicable weapon of reprisals. The advisers of Mahmud Adilshah deluded their monarch with the suggestion that Shivaji- could be reduced to submission by arresting and threatening the life of his father. Decadent governments, with premonitions of their impend- ing doom, commit the most unpardonable blunders in a des- perate attempt to save themselves from dissolution. Shahaji had rendered distinguished military services to Bijapur and had helped it to carry arms deep into the south. Besides losing his eldest son in one of the southern campaigns, he had, with the resignation of a fatalist, accepted his subordinate status almost as a divine dispensation. This man, who had dedicated the best part of his chequered career to the advancement of his Muslim rulers’ cause, was unceremoniously arrested on August 6, 1648 by the commander-in-chief of the Bijapur army which was then engaged in investing the famous Jinji fort in the dis- trict of South Arcot. The details of the part played by Baji Ghoxpade, the chief of Mudhol, in this sordid affair are not clear, but the fact of his collusion with Shahaji’s captors is un- doubted. The proud Maratha nobleman was sent in chains to Bijapur as if he was a common felon. Shivaji was in a dilemma since further inroads into the Bija- pur territory would undoubtedly have sealed the fate of his father. But the edifice of independence he had built with such patience and foresight could not be allowed to be destroyed for any personal reasons, however weighty they might be. He took counsel with his mother and the wise men around him, but opinion was divided. Eventually, he decided to appeal to the Great Moghul to intercede with the Bijapur Darbar on his behalf. He offered to. serve the Empire with distinction if his prayer was granted. The weight of evidence disproves the general belief that Shahaji's release was accomplished through Shah Jahan’s in- tervention. Sarkar categorically discounts it by maintaining that the Emperor “always treated Muhammad Adil Shah with marked courtesy and kindness, while Shahaji was bitterly hated 48 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT at the Mughal Court for the trouble he had given them in 1633- 1636”. It is, however, possible that the Bijapur Government belatedly realized the monumental folly of humiliating and punishing a powerful officer without any evidence to establish his guilt. Shahaji’s Muslim friends at the court must also have played their part in hastening his release and in the restoration of his property and military contingent. The reconciliation between the Sultan and his Sardar was perhaps complete. Years later, on May 26, 1658, Ali Adilshah, the son and successor of the guilty monarch, assured Shahaji of his complete confidence in him and promised not to inflict any vicarious punishment on him for the “disloyalty and auda- city” of his son, Shivaji. The Sardar was exhorted to serve the Bijapur throne with his customary zeal and devotion, re- joicing in the knowledge that his sovereign and master would not entertain any allegations and calumnies against him in future. Shivaji did not, however, forget the affront to his illustrious father. No special act of retaliation was necessary against the Bijapur Government since the whole purpose and significance of his career was to overrun it. But the Maratha chieftains who refused to countenance his grand project and, what is worse, who missed no opportunity in their attempts to defeat it, deserved special attention. Notable among such misguided noblemen was Chandrarao More of Javli, about whom a brief reference has already been made in an earlier chapter. The Mores were men of great influence who had acquired large territories around Mahableshwar and accumulated a vast amount of wealth by an unashamed policy of appeasement and subservience to the Sultans of Bijapur. They refused to see the signs of the times or to note the ferment that had begun to change the minds of the people and determine them to oppose misrule and religious persecution. With Mores, as with other Sardars, loyalty to the Bijapur Raj had become an obses- sion and a disease of the soul. Nothing could move their hearts and nothing could convince them about' the paramount need for destroying the iniquitous' status quo. Their most ambi* THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 49 tious and exalted aim was to serve the Sultan with undeviating loyalty and to strive for their own advancement. In pursuit ot this two-fold objective, they were prepared to sacrifice any principle. Chandrarao gave shelter and facilities to Baji Sham- raj, who had been sent by the Bijapur king with a large force to capture Shivaji by fair or foul means. The fact that the designs of the treacherous foe were frustrated by Shivaji did not diminish the enormity of the guilt of Chandrarao who deserved condign punishment for so flagrantly violating the obligations of a neighbour to the great liberator. Nevertheless, with exemplary patience and perseverance, Shivaji attempted to cure the Mores of their warped mentality. He tried to convince them of the paramount necessity of esta- blishing a system of government that ensured religious freedom and promoted the welfare of the people. He pointed out the injustice of a dispensation which condemned the real produ- cers of wealth and prosperity to the status of serfs so that their masters could with impunity abandon themselves to luxury and indolence and saunter away their lives in secluded places, refus- ing to recognize that there existed an entity called the common man. It took years for Shivaji to realize that the Mores were least susceptible to the promptings of patriotism. After all, you can- not make silk purses out of a sow’s ears! Only the argument of force could wean them from their selfish and suicidal course. Shivaji accordingly took the deliberate decision to destroy the Mores by any means. Being in possession of Javli, they held a key position which effectively prevented his expansion in the south and south-west. All the leading men in the area, such as Kanhoji Jedhe and Haibatrao Silimkar, were Shivaji’s enthu- siastic supporters and it was impossible to allow the common cause to suffer merely because a misguided chieftain, obsti- nately refused to abandon his selfishness. "The State of Javli”, says Sarkar, "by its position, barred the path of Shivaji’s expan- sion in the south and south-west. Chandrarao thwarted Shi- vaji’s policy of drawing the various Mavli headmen to his side, and tried to form in that locality an anti-Shivaji coalition in 50 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OP A PATRIOT concert with the neighbouring Adil Shahi governor, because the progress of Shivaji in that region would have naturally led to the loss of More’s power and independence.” Shivaji, therefore, decided that there should be no Mores at Javli. He entrusted the task of encompassing their end to Raghunath Ballal Korde and Sambhaji Kavji, two of his trusted comrades, who overran Javli with complete success. Most of the leading members of the More family were killed, while their large accumulations of wealth were confiscated. Shivaji himself promptly moved into the town and, in January 1656, annexed the important and extensive principality to his own govern- ment. His gain in prestige and resources was immense. The conquest gave him control over “all the twelve Mavals from Junnar to Wai,” while the hardy hillmen and the intellectuals of the region supplied soldiers to his army and administrators to his government. Another notable achievement of Shivaji on this occasion was the adhesion of Baji Prabhu, the deshpande of Javli, to his cause. The heroic sacrifice of this man in defence of his new master will be described in a later chapter. Shivaji built a fort on the crest of the hill commanding the valley of the famous Parghat and appropriately gave the new stronghold the name of Pratapgad, which, in less than four years after its construction, became the scene of his historic encoun- ter with Afzal Khan. The fort was built by Moropant Pingle who gave much care to ensure its impregnability. The Javli episode furnished one more proof to the people of Maharashtra that Shivaji's government was not a fleeting phenomenon but an abiding fact of history. The retribution that overtook Baji Ghorpade of Mudhol was no less terrible. In pliancy and subservience to the Bijapur throne, the Ghorpades of Mudhol were the equals of Mores, and, as we saw earlier, one of their ancestors had won notoriety by fighting energetically on the side of the Muslim coalition against the Vijayanagar Empire in the famous battle of Raksha- sa-i angadi. Baji Ghorpade had forfeited all claims for conside- rate treatment at the hands of Shivaji on account of the assist- ance he had rendered in the arrest and humiliation of Shahaji THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 51 and the hilitary aid he had given to the enemy when the fort of Panhala in which he, Shivaji, had taken shelter in 1660 was being closely invested by the Bijapur troops under the com- mand of Jauhar. Deeply offended by the perfidy of his own kinsman, Shahaji had secretly exhorted his son to wreak a terrible vengeance on Baji Ghorpade. Shivaji’s pre-occupations had long prevented him from giving his attention to Mudhol both for settling his own accounts with its chief and for fulfill- ing his filial obligations to his parent. In November 1664 Shivaji suddenly struck a heavy blow at Mudhol whose ruler had committed many other aggressions during the intervening years. The fact that Baji was his cousin did not deter him from punishing the man in die only manner he deserved. The capital, Mudhol, was attacked with great severity and the vaults of the Raja, which contained large treasures, were thoroughly sacked. Baji courageously faced Shivaji and was slain in the encounter. It was an unhappy epi- sode which caused deep distress to him. He installed the slain Raja’s son, Maloji, on the gadi and returned to his stronghold, taking comfort from the knowledge that one more implacable opponent to his great cause had at last been removed. By investing the son of Baji with the ruling powers Shivaji demonstrated that annexation was not his motive in invading Mudhol. Nor did he desire to perpetuate the suicidal feud between the two great Maratha families and proved the sin- cerity of his wish for reconciliation by writing cordially to the new ruler. The letter, addressed to Maloji years after this event, recalled the part played by Baji in securing the arrest of Shahaji and the bitter animosity which it had aroused be- tween the two families. “The time has arrived,” Shivaji de- clared, “when we should draw a veil over the unpleasant past and re-establish our relations on a basis of mutual affection and regard.” The eventful career of Shivaji abounds in episodes, portray- ing his remarkable courage and resourcefulness and his uncanny ability to emerge victorious from the most difficult and dan- gerous situations. But, among his personal exploits, nothing 52 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OP A PATRIOT strikes the imagination so vividly as his defeat and destruction of the powerful Afzal Khan, his night attack on Shaista Khan, the premier nobleman of the Moghul Empire, and his celebrated escape from the imperial city of Agra. Shivaji’s growing fame, power and popularity deeply offended and alarmed Bijapur which, after attempting various futile methods to encompass his ruin, finally decided to send a power- ful military expedition against him. Following the death of Mohmud Adilshah in November 1656, the administration of the Sultanate was vested in his widow Badi Sahiba, a dominating and self-opinionated woman. She governed the State on behalf of her young son, Ali Adilshah, and strove with much determi- nation to regain the lost territories of the realm. She realized that no half measures could stop the extension of Shivaji’s sovereignty and, therefore, decided to send a strong army against him. But the task was not an easy one. Few among the generals of Bijapur showed any enthusiasm to undertake the perilous mis- sion. The great military talent of Shivaji, his formidable capa- city to launch a counter-attack, and the advantage derived by him from the lie of the land from which he operated, were among the major factors that deterred the Bijapur commanders from readily agreeing to proceed against him. At last, Abdullah Bhatari, sumamed Afzal Khan, consented to invade Mahara- shtra. The Khan was in every way qualified to lead the expedition. He was a Titan in physical strength and had graduated in all the arts of diplomacy and deceitfulness. On many previous occasions he had made the most intimidating display of his ability to practise treachery and savagery. In 1639 he had faithlessly murdered Kasturi Ranga, the Raja of Sera, while engaged in parleys with him as the chiefs host. He had com- mitted a similar crime in November 1657 by murdering Wazir Khan Muhammad. It was the same sinister man to whom the person of Shahaji had been entrusted during the latter's journey from the south to Bijapur as a captive. THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 53 Indeed, Afzal Khan was no ordinary adversary. He was a front rank noble at the court and, as a general, he was of the “highest standing" in the Bijapur kingdom. His record in the campaigns against the Moghuls and in the south was brilliant. Great preparations were made to ensure his success against Shivaji and nothing was left to chance. He was given an army consisting of ten thousand cavalry, besides artillery, transport and all other military equipment. In their prowess the men that accompanied him were among the best and in fact belong- ed to a fighting force that had often humbled the imperial armies. Their weapons too were among the best that the age could produce. In the first and fateful encounter with the infant State of Maharashtra no precaution was overlooked in order to make sure that victory was not denied to the invading army. Nevertheless, there was an under-current of anxiety both at the court and in the heart of the Khan about the outcome of the contest. The Dowager Queen was especially overcome by grim fears and forebodings and instructed the Khan to strive for the capture or murder of Shivaji by “pretending friendship with him”. A contemporary record of the episode, written by an Englishman on December 10, 1659, makes it abundantly clear that in the expedition against Shivaji the rulers of Bija- pur clearly and unequivocally meditated treachery, besides the use of overwhelming force. Revington, the Englishman who wrote from Rajapur, says: “Against Shivaji the Queen this year sent Abdullah Khan with an army of 10,000 horse and foot, and because she knew with that strength he was not able to resist Shivaji, she counselled him to pretend friendship with his enemy, which he did”. Shivaji, who was fully apprised of the Khan’s antecedents, prepared himself to meet any contin- gency. Afzal Khan began his journey to Maharashtra in September 1659. If tradition can be trusted, before leaving the capital he put to the sword his numerous wives as the only means of ensuring their chastity since he could not be certain that he would emerge victorious or alive from the ensuing > trial of 54 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT strength with Shivaji. The gruesome episode is a true measure of the truculence and savagery of which he was capable. The witlessness of the man was indeed as massive and towering as were his cruelty and treachery. “The Bijapur general," says Sarkar, “had accepted the command in a spirit of bravado” and had in fact boasted in open court that he would bring Shi- vaji to the capital without even condescending to dismount from his horse! Brave words do not always have their counterpart in action. During his progress on the journey Afzal Khan committed re- volting crimes against the religion of the people. He first marched to Pandharpur where he desecrated the famous shrine of Vithoba, the deity that had inspired generations of saints and savants to compose and sing stirring songs in praise of God and to preach the abiding oneness of mankind. The Khan inflicted similar indignities on the Hindu faith by defil- ing many other famous temples and showed his utter contempt for the religious feelings of the people by singling out Tuljapur for an unbridled display of his image-breaking ecstasy. Goddess Bhawani was the guardian deity of Shivaji. The image was removed from the shrine, broken to pieces and then pounded to dust in a grinding-stone! Retribution for such calculated acts of vandalism and desecration was inevitable. Shivaji watched the excesses of the Khan with indignation, but he was too prudent to take any rash or false step. He moved to the lofty fortress of Pratapgad from where he could meditate in safety on the counter-measures that would end the invader’s career of conquest and spoliation. The Khan marched to Wai and encamped there in order to be near Shivaji. Wai had earlier been the seat of his satrapy, and his governorship of the province from 1649 to 1654 had given him much useful knowledge and insight into the state of the country and the temper -of its inhabitants. During his residence at Wai Afzal Khan had successfully dis- suaded Chandrarao More from making common cause with Shivaji by offering him every encouragement to reject the latter’s overtures. Indeed, it had been his special responsibility as the THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 55 Governor of Wai to destroy the infant State of Maharashtra and towards this end, he had actively instigated all the dissident elements in the area to take up arms against Shivaji. More’s in- transigence in his relations with Shivaji was in no small mea- sure due to the Khan’s connivance. On the present occasion, too, he made persistent attempts to stir up local disaffection against Shivaji, but his insolence and intolerance and the grow- ing realization by the people of Maharashtra of the true signi- ficance of Shivaji’s aims and ideals robbed his intrigues of much of their effectiveness. The Khan spurned no weapon in his atempts to ensnare Shivaji. He wrote a seemingly conciliatory letter to the latter and despatched it to Pratapgad with Krishnaji Bhaskar, the kulkarni of Wai, whom he employed as his envoy. The letter read: “Your father has long been a great friend of mine and you are, therefore, no stranger to me. Come and see me and I shall use my influence to make the Adil Shah confirm your possession of the Konkan and the forts you now hold. I shall secure for you further distinctions and military equipment from our Government. If you wish to attend the Court, you will be welcomed. Or, if you want to be excused personal attendance there, you will be exempted.” Shivaji deeply reflected on the implications of Afzal Khan’s invitation. He could see that the Khan’s offer of friendship was a mere delusion and a snare, but the danger of its rejection was as great as its acceptance. His submission to Bijapur would most certainly have ended his career as an independent prince and destroyed the deeply-cherished hopes and aspira- tions of the people of the land for a government that guaranteed liberty of conscience, besides striving for their wel- fare. Moreover, if he abandoned his mission at the most crucial stage of its fulfilment, posterity would undoubtedly brand him as an adventurer who; at the first encounter with a really formidable enemy, chose the easier and cowardly course of submission and surrender, thus preferring ignoble safety to a distinguished place in the history of his motherland. He took counsel with his mother, Jijabai, and with some of 56 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT his intimate companions in whose wisdom he had great confi- dence. They pondered long and deeply but could offer no unanimous advice. The magnitude of the peril and their attach- ment for Shivaji clouded the judgment of some of his advisers who urged that there should be no meeting between him and the treacherous Khan. It was perhaps good that such divided counsel gave Shivaji an invaluable opportunity to make his own decision and thus rise to the full stature of his masterful personality. A man of deep religious convictions who was guided on all critical occasions in his career by an intuition that, as subsequent events fully justified, never failed him, he sought through prayers light and guidance for his future course of action. Very soon his doubts and fears were dismissed and he took the manly decision to face the Khan. His mother, who had con- sistently encouraged him to face the peril boldly, rejoiced at the fulfilment of her own desire and heartily blessed him in his undertaking. Shivaji’s plan was simple. It was, of course, impossible for him to go to Bijapur. He should, therefore, employ all his persuasive eloquence and blandishments in order to induce Afzal Khan to return empty-handed. If such a manoeuvre failed and if war became inevitable, the invaders should be forced to give battle in a place of Shivaji’s own choice. It was a well-considered plan and no effort was spared to secure the Khan’s approval. Meanwhile, secret orders were seat to the Maratha armies, stationed in the Konkan and the Ghats, to proceed in the direction of Pratapgad and take post in its vici- nity. They were commanded by seasoned officers like Moropant Pingle, Netaji Palkar and Kanhoji Jedhe. With his line of action settled, Shivaji wrote a cordial reply to Afzal Khan whose protestations of friendship and regard for him and his father were acknowledged with gratitude. The letter conveyed his anxiety to meet the great commander, not only to give proof of his esteem for him, but also to seek the Khan’s sage advice about his own future career. It was, of course, impossible for him to cast doubts on the bom fides of THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 57 his benefactor, but unfortunately his self-confidence and courage failed him at the thought of meeting the great man in his armed camp. Would he, therefore, condescend to proceed to Pratapgad and accept his humble hospitality? Every arrangement would be made for his reception on a scale appropriate to his eminence. The letter served its purpose admirably. Afzal Khan suppressed his initial apprehensions about the wisdom of meeting his adversary on his own ground by fetching his iron muscles and comparing his own enormous physical strength with the small build of Shivaji. The great dissembler was hoist with his own petard ! Shivaji’s carefully worded and diplomatic reply was sent to Afzal Khan with Krishnaji Bhaskar who was accompanied on his return journey to Wai by Pantaji Gopinath, a man of keen perception and sound judgment. It was the task of the clever Brahmin, who acted as Shivaji’s agent in the negotiations, to divine the mind of the Khan and, by an astute display of elo- quence and earnestness, persuade the Bijapur general to agree to meet his principal at Pratapgad. Shivaji took the additional precaution of sending with the party Viswasrao Nanaji, an expert spy, who, assuming various guises, was able to collect useful intelligence about the Bijapur military camp. During his secret interviews with the Khan’s envoy, Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji had gained sufficient knowledge about the Khan’s evil intentions. His impressions were fully confirmed by his agent, Pantaji, who, by a liberal recourse to bribes, learnt from high authority that Afzal Khan “had so arranged matters that Shivaji would be arrested at the interview, as he was too cunning to be caught by open fight”. But it was the Brahmin’s greatest achievement that he succeeded in inducing the Khan to fall in with Shivaji’s pre-concerted plan. The stage was now set for the historic encounter. The jungle was cleared and a road made from Wai to the foot of Pratapgad for the movement of the Bijapur army. Food, water and recreation of the choicest kind were arranged in profusion at different places along the entire route to relieve the tedium of the journey. The Khan and his men were supremely happy 58 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT at the excellence and the cordiality of the reception. Mean- while, with great discernment Shivaji selected the crest of an eminence below the fort of Pratapgad as the site for conferring with the Khan. Visitors to the fort and the place where the two men met can only gain a faint idea of the frightening character of the terrain as it was three hundred years ago." To-day a modem motorable road leads the traveller to the foot of the fortress, the doors of which are no longer shut so that, without much trouble or exertion, he may visit the famous temple of goddess Bhawani for worship and then, after surveying the rolling hills and valleys that lend enchantment to the landscape, proceed to see the recently installed equestrian statue of Shivaji that dominates the scene miles around the mountain ranges. But in the time of Shivaji the region was incredibly inhospit- able, with the jungle growing in all its chaotic exuberance so that the traveller was forced to watch every step of his lest he should be tripped up by the uncleared undergrowth or be taken unawares by the denizens of the forest. Sitting serenely on a maze of tree-clad and mist-crowned hills and overlooking valleys sunk deep into the bowels of the earth, Pratapgad des- pised the pitiful attempts of evil-minded men to gain possession of her by force or fraud. Built on a high rock near the source of the Krishna, it commands the entire area embraced by the banks of the Nira and the Koyna, besides, at the time of which we are writing, strengthening the defences of the Par pass. About the natural strength of Pratapgad a writer says: “The western and northern sides of the fort are gigantic cliffs with an almost vertical drop in many places of seven or eight hundred feet. The towers and bastions on the south and east are often thirty to forty feet high, while there is in most places a scarp of naked black rock not much lower.” Overlooking the Koyna valley, the place selected for the Khan’s reception was least suited for conversion into a battle-ground. When the Bijapur general agreed to meet Shivaji on this cleverly chosen site, it was decreed by an inscrutable destiny that the THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS Khan should not return alive. Rightly does Khali Khan say: “The Angel of Doom led him by the collar to his fate.” An artistically decorated and richly furnished shamiana was erected in the open space for the reception of Afzal Khan. As the day of the interview dawned, November 10, 1659, Shivaji rose early, offered devout prayers for victory against the mighty enemy and prepared himself to meet any situation. He ap- pointed a small council, with his mother as the head, to carry on the administration of his newly-acquired realm in the event of his death or imprisonment. To secure his person from sudden and treacherous attack, he donned a light but well- made armour and similarly covered his head with a steel hel- met. A sharp and short sword called bichwa was concealed under his long and flowing robe, while a set of steel claws known as waghndkh worn on the fingers of the left hand, completed his precautions for self-protection. As the appointed hour for the interview approached, Shivaji bowed reverently before his mother, Jijabai, and taking Jivba Mahala and Sambhaji Kavji, both distinguished for their courage and skill as swordsmen,* as his companions, descended slowly from the fort to meet the waiting Khan. The Khan, who had been transported earlier to the shamiana in a palan- quin, was foaming with fury at the costliness of the pavilion and its furnishings and asked the waiting envoys how such appurtenances of royalty could have been acquired by the son of a mere Sardar. The Brahmins diplomatically pacified the angry man by assuring him that the things that belonged to the Sultan would soon be restored to His Majesty ! Shivaji, who had now approached the shamiana with his attendants, saw Syed' Banda, the famous swordsman of Bijapur, inside the tent and sent word that the man should be removed from the place and stationed at a distance. Seeing that his * Different authorities give different names of the men that accompanied Shivaji during his interview with Afzal Khan. B. M. Purandhare, in his Marathi volumes on Shivaji, quotes a source which mentions the following names: Jivba Mahala, Sambhaji Kavji Kondhal- kar, Sambhaji Karvar, Kathoji Ingle, Kondaji Rank, Krishnaji Gaekwad, Siddi Ibrahim, Surji Katke, Visaji Murumbak and Esaji Kank. 60 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT request was complied with, he walked briskly towards the pavilion and entered it, leaving his men outside. The Khan, who was seated on a heavily cushioned platform, rose ostensib- ly to embrace his host. Taking advantage of his superior height and strength, he suddenly drew Shivaji towards him and raising his left arm caught the head and the neck of the Maratha under it. Shivaji was overwhelmed by the sudden- ness of the assault and the terrible pressure on his neck. The Khan next unsheathed his sword and struck a savage blow at Shivaji who was now almost entirely at his mercy. He was, however, saved by the hidden armour he had so prudently worn. Shivaji, who had been temporarily put out of action by the suddenness of the attack and by the equally unexpected impact of a vastly superior physical strength upon his body, recovered quickly and, realizing the magnitude of the peril that faced him and the need for prompt action, struck the waghnakh at the Khan’s body with all his strength, the sharp steel claws biting deeply into the powerful man’s bowels. With the same sudden- ness that had made him helpless Shivaji now became the master of the situation. His blow relaxed the Khan’s strangle- hold and, releasing himself promptly from the man’s “embrace”, Shivaji struck the enemy again this time with his bichwa. The Bijapur general was not made of clay, but even his powerful frame could not sustain two smashing blows. He fell down bleeding profusely and shouting “treachery”. Syed Banda, the faithful attendant of Afzal Khan, who was watching the grim drama from a distance, rushed at Shivaji and struck a powerful blow at the latter’s head with his long sword, but again Shivaji’s forethought saved him. Borrowing one of the two swords held by his companion, Jivba Mahala, Shivaji faced his new assailant, but before the two accomplished swordsmen could make much progress with their duel, Jivba made short work of the Syed with his other sword. The mortal agony of the severely wounded and disembowelled Afzal Khan was mercifully ended by Shivaji’s second attendant, Sambhaji THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 61 Kavji, who cut off the Khan’s head as he was being carried to the waiting palanquin. A stirring ballad on the famous encounter was composed in Marathi soon after the event and even at this distance of time it is heard with unabated enthusiasm and excitement over the length and breadth of Maharashtra. Here are a few lines from Acworth’s excellent translation of the ballad, describing how the two men met: “The Moslem leap’d upon him, His grasp was fierce and fell, And how he plied the dagger The dinted mail might tell. But Shivaji the Raja In answer made him feel The twin sting of the scorpion* The deadly claws of steel. His entrails torn and bloody Gap’d through the horrid wound; But Abdul was a warrior bold And falter’d not nor swoon’ed, He loos’d his girdle deftly, Uncoil’d the sword below, And dealt upon the Raja’s head A fierce and furious blow. It cleft the embroider’d turban, And twisted chains fourteen, And the Raja felt, as steed the spur, The sword edge sharp and keen. His blade leap’d out and wrapped the Khan, Like the sacred thread to view, Between the neck and shoulder It struck and clove him through. He fell, down fell the Moslem, While steadfast stood the King. Hearken, Maratha princes, His glorious state I sing.” "The bichwa, derived from bichti or scorpion, is a double-bladed dagger. 62 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT When Shivaji and his companions returned to the fort with their ghastly trophy, a gun boomed to announce their arrival in safety. It was also a signal to the waiting Maratha armies to attack the enemy. The carnage on the Bijapur side was terrible and only those that promptly surrendered were spared. Some members of the dead general's family, including his eldest son, Fazl Khan, who lived to become Shivaji’s inveterate enemy, escaped. The booty that fell into the hands of the Marathas was im- mense. “All the artillery," says Sarkar, “wagons, ammunition, treasure, tents and equippage, transport — cattle and baggage of an entire army, fell into the victors’ hands. Among them were 65 elephants, 4,000 horses, 1,200 camels, 2,000 bundles oi clothing, and 10 lakhs of rupees in cash and jewellery.” Thus ended the career of a man and his army that had sallied forth with exultant hopes of extinguishing the flame of independence kindled by Shivaji. Afzal Khan’s severed head was buried beneath a tower in the fort of Pratapgad and is called Afzal Buruj. Conflicting versions concerning what is known as the Afzal episode have found their place in the pages of history. With a self-assurance wholly unbecoming of responsible writers when dealing with dubious facts, some historians have branded Shivaji as a “treacherous Maratha”. None of the persons on the side of the Khan, excepting his Brahmin envoy, Krishnaji Bhaskar, who were present in the shamiana escaped alive after the Bijapur general’s death. How then could an eye-witness account be produced on behalf of the so-called “murdered” man to prove that Shivaji struck the first blow? And yet what may truly be described as one of the most impudent fakes has been given currency by some writers as a sober fact of history. The king of Maharashtra was a man of great veracity and he could be trusted to present an unvarnished account of his meeting with Afzal Khan when narrating it to his spiritual leader, Ramdas Swami. Shivaji told the Swami: “When at our interview, Abdulla (i.e. Afzal Khan) caught me under his arm, I had almost lost my consciousness. But for the Swami’s blessing, I would not have escaped from his grip”. THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 63 Any detailed discussion of the rights and wrongs of the episode is, however, as irrelevant as it is absurd. Afzal Khan was notoriously unprincipled and cruel and to these forbidding traits he added the unforgivable offence of bigotry. The death of such a man, in whom the milk of human kindness had congealed into a poisonous hatred for his fellowmen, certainly does not deserve the tribute of tears, no matter in what maimer his earthly career was ended. When dealing with this episode, we may well recall the struggle between Christian and Apollyon in John Bunyan’s Pilgrim's Progress, Christian, the embodiment of goodness, with his face turned towards the light; Apollyon, the very incarnation of evil, rejoicing, to quote a famous' writer “in his own wickedness and using every device of cunning and trea- chery to wear down his foe”. Sarkar’s well-considered verdict on the Afzal episode clinches the issue: “The weight of re- corded evidence as well as the probabilities of the case sup- ports the view that Afzal Khan struck the first blow.” Shivaji did not rest on his laurels after sending Afzal Khan to his doom. Scarcely before Bijapur recovered from the confusion and consternation caused by the event, he sent an army into the enemy territory under the command of Annaji Datto who took possession of the important fort of Panhala in the former State of Kolhapur on November 28. Panhala was the capital of the western district of the Adilshahi kingdom and the officer in charge of the region, Rustam-i-Zaman, was loath to surrender valuable territory without a fight. His forces were joined by those of Afzal Khan’s son, Fazl Khan, who missed no opportunity in his attempt to avenge the death of his father. The battle near Panhala, fought on December 28, 1659, gave decisive victory to Shivaji who pursued the flee- ing enemy upto the gates of Bijapur. Collecting a large booty from some of the prosperous towns in the area, he returned to his stronghold, Rajgad, towards the end of January 1660. Young Ali, the unfortunate Sultan, was confused and con- founded by the repeated reverses to his arms and fortunes. He saw the mighty edifice of the royal power, built in the 64 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Deccan for his dynasty by its founder, Yusuf Adilshah, crumbl- ing steadily before his eyes. Its disintegration was indeed inevitable. Like the Bahmani Kingdom, the States that were built on its ashes were entirely wrong as survivals in the same manner as the rise of Hyderabad, Oudh and Bengal as inde- pendent States after the destruction of the Mughul Empire was a political enormity. In the extremity of his despair, which was also a measure of the imbecility of his court and govern- ment, Ali Adilshah readily accepted the offer of a rebellious Abyssinian slave, Siddi Jauhar, to save the situation for him. Jauhar was a competent soldier, but he was both a fool and a traitor, who made grandiose projects to establish an empire for himself ! He had earlier usurped the fief of Kamul in Andhra Pradesh and had fallen from royal favour for his traitorous ambitions and activities. Such a man came forward to salvage the fortunes of the decaying Adilshahi kingdom. He was dignified with the title of Salbat Khan and sent against Shivaji. By a grave error of judgment, Shivaji allowed himself to be blockaded in the fort of Panhala, (March 2, 1660), which was besieged by the Siddi and his allies with great determination. Formidable forces were ranged against Shivaji. Salbat Khan’s own considerable army was reinforced by the troops of the ubiquitous Fazl Khan, and those of another defeated general, Rustam-i-Zaman. Fazl Khan’s chief retainer, Siddi Halal, was also an able soldier. Both he and his master spared no efforts or expenditure in pressing the siege with the utmost vigour. The blood of Afzal Khan cried for vengeance — immediate and terrible ! As if such an array of armed strength was not sufficient, Baji Ghor- pade, about whose well-deserved destruction we have already written, and several other Maratha nobles contributed their levies in order to hasten the surrender of the fort. Shivaji was thus confronted by another major crisis, so soon after overcoming the danger from Afzal Khan’s invasion. The fragile State of Maharashtra was forced to wage an unequal war on two fronts against two formidable Muslim powers, while its architect and mainstay was condemned to enforced the formidable antagonists 65 idleness in a closely invested fortress. The repeated attempts of Netaji Palkar to compel the Bijapur general to raise the siege of Panhala proved abortive. In the north, the premier nobleman of the Moghul court, Shaista Khan, threatened to engulf the entire kingdom of Shivaji by invading his territories with a large and well-equipped army. A shrewd and competent general, the commander of the imperial forces saw in the Maratha prince’s predicament a heaven-sent opportunity for him to deliver a mortal blow at the new State. He occupied Poona in May 1660 and took up his residence in Shivaji’s house, Lai Mahal. Shivaji was confident of dominating the situation if only he could escape from Panhala, but he could not make his exit except by coming to terms with the besiegers — an extremely remote possibility. He pondered deeply over the situation and at last decided to try the weapon of diplomacy against Siddi Jauhar. He knew that the Siddi was a vainglorious man and amenable to flattery. He, therefore, attempted to win the besieging commander’s confidence by judiciously stimulating his personal ambitions. A meeting was arranged between the two men, one a credulous fool and another a subtle and farseeing planner. Shivaji invited the newly ennobled Abyssinian slave to consider whether his status, however much it was elevated, could ever be equal to the position of a sovereign in his own right. The crown was indeed the only fitting reward for his outstanding abilities and enterprise. It would be an affront to his eminence if he were to be content with a lesser position. Shivaji wound up his exhortation by promising his wholehearted assistance to the Siddi in his attempts to win a kingdom for himself. The upstart was jubilant. With a daring and resourceful “friend” like Shivaji, was there anything he could not accomplish? The siege of the fort ceased to interest the Siddi! But Fazal Khan, who had been watching the happenings around him with the unsleeping eyes of Argus, could not be similarly wqn over. His attempts to force the surrender of the fort, how* ever, had cost him dearly and he no longer wished to abandon •66 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT discretion in favour of valour. His tents were accordingly pitched at a respectable distance from the ramparts of Pan- hala — a circumstance that helped Shivaji and his men to clear out of the fort without attracting immediate attention. The night of July 13, 1660 was an ideal one for making the escape. It was a particularly dark and rainy night when the guards of the camp preferred the security and warmth of their tents to a zealous performance of their watch and ward duties. Taking a large body of his men with him, Shivaji stole out of the fort through a rear gate and, after destroying or dispers- ing the Bijapur troops that noticed his escape, he made for Vishalgad, twenty-seven miles to the west, with every possible speed. Fazal Khan, who was soon apprised of this escape, speedily collected his troops and pursued Shivaji, lighting his way through the darkness with blazing torches. The distance between the pursuer and the pursued narrowed dangerously as night was followed by day. Shivaji was in a dilemma. Being outnumbered, it was evidently impossible for him to give battle to die enemy with any hope of success. He, therefore, adopted a more workable plan of action. Detaching a sizable number of troops from his escort, he put them under the command of Baji Prabhu with orders to contest the advance of the pursuers to the bitter end, while he himself continued the journey to Vishalgad with the rest of his party. The scheme worked admirably. Baji Prabhu and his gallant men held Fazal Khan’s troops at bay for five precious hours till their master reached his destination. During the heroic stand Prabhu lost his life — an inspiring episode in Maratha history which will be dealt with in a later chapter. Wiser than his father, Fazal Khan refused to attack Shivaji in a difficult legion and withdrew to Panhala with a heavy heart. Shivaji was now free to make his plans to meet the Moghul menace. From his recent encounters with the Bijapur armies he was able to take the true measure of their strength and weakness. He could see that the proud Adilshahi kingdom was now in the throes of death and could not, therefore, effec- tively challenge his great work. The Moghuls, however, were THE FORMIDABLE ANTAGONISTS 67 of a different mettle. Their resources were infinitely superior to those of Bijapur, while their fighting forces were almost invincible. Besides, the man who sat on the throne at Delhi was a determined and implacable foe, who considered no means unfair in contriving the destruction of those that chal- lenged his policies or paramountcy. By returning Panhala Shivaji secured a patched-up peace with Bijapur in September 1660 so that he could give his undivided attention to the in- vaders from the north. His war with the imperialists and how he eventually overcame their aggression will be described in the chapters that follow. REFERENCES Kincaid, C.

The rulers of ancient and medieval India practised it against one another with a thoroughness that eventually encompassed the ruin of their country. Pax Romana was a frank assertion of the over- whelming military superiority of the Roman conquerors in their far-flung empire. European imperialism, also deriving its strength and sanctions entirely from force, is still a current coin, although it is fast wearing out and may soon cease to be legal tender ! The Moghuls were convinced and enthusiastic practitioners, of imperialism. Babar’s sojourn in India was too short to permit him to conceive ambitious projects of conquest inside the country, while his son, Humayun, spent the best part of his effective life as a fugitive. The aggressive trait of the- Timurids found its full play during the long reign of Akbar. This great and benevolent sovereign, who, like Antoninus* governed his realm like a father, abandoned all the civilized canons of moderation and justice when dealing with other independent States in the country. The massacre of Chitor, the conquest of Gondwana by driving its valiant Queen to com- mit suicide, and the spoliation of Ahmednagar after hastening, the death of the brave, noble and sagacious Sultana Chand Bibi, are irrefutable examples of Akbar’s unprovoked aggressions. The siege of Asirgarh and its occupation in January 1601 through “perfidy and bribery” furnish one more illustration of the great ruler’s indifference to ends and means where his own amour-propre was concerned. Jahangir was also animated by vaulting ambitions, but being heavily addicted to liquor and opium and enslaved by the charms of Nurjahan, this “able degenerate” was incapable of any sustained action. But the forward policy of his son and successor, Shah Jahan, amply compensated for his sloth. Shah Jahan's aggressions culminated in the destruction of the inde- THE IMPEBIAJLtSTS pendent State of Ahmednagar in 1632. Being dedicated Sunnis, both he and his son, Aurangzeb, took “special pleasure in warring with the Sultans of Golkonda and Bijapur, who adhered to the Shia faith, and looked for alliance and protection to the Shah of Persia rather than the Padshah of Hindustan”. Aurangzeb was extremely fond of playing the role of “a great pike in a pond”. He had acquired the title of Alamgir, mean- ing ‘World Compeller’ or ‘Universe Grasper’ with every intention of proving worthy of it. His first Viceroyalty of the Deccan in 1636-37 was brief and uneventful. He had, however, become a maturer man, with his aims and objects well defined, when he was reappointed to the charge in 1653. Aurangzeb possessed qualities of greatness, with which few in his dynasty were endowed in such abundance, but goodness and tolerance were not among them. He was competent, clear- headed and extremely clever. When he reached man’s estate, nothing influenced him more strongly than the belief that the imperial crown belonged to him and to none else in his family, including his father, the reigning monarch! His moves and actions were, therefore, guided by an overpowering desire to seize the prize by any means. The gold of Golkonda and the wealth of Bijapur, amassed by despoiling the rich temples and the fertile regions of the south, were of inestimable value in his contest with his brothers for the peacock throne. Considerations of right and wrong were of no value to this determined and ruthless man. Forcing hostilities on the ruler of Golkonda in February 1656, Aurangzeb instructed his son, Prince Muhammad Sultan, to accomplish the downfall of the Deccan kingdom by brushing aside all principles of decency and fairplay. Commenting on his sermon on' subterfuge and perfidy and the part played by Shah Jahan in the episode, the Oxford History says : “Such was the treachery which Aurang- zeb and his father were not ashamed to employ against a Muslim king whose only offence was his independence.” The Moghul imperialists’ dealings with Bijapur were even more- aggressive. Shah Jahan’s war of 1635-36 against the pre- mier Deccan state was notorious for its frightfulness. The 70 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT holocaust ended only after the Adilshah agreed in May 1636 to render obedience to the throne of Delhi and to make a peace offering of rupees twenty lakhs, besides guaranteeing to respect the frontiers of his neighbour, the Sultan of Golkonda. As a reward for his submission he was given a portion of the territories that had belonged to the annexed State of Ahmed- nagar. The treaty of 1636 gave respite to Bijapur from Moghul aggression for a little over two decades, but, after the death of Mahmud Adilshah on November 4, 1656, the imperialists could not resist the temptation of resuming the war against the un- fortunate state and its people. Prince Aurangzeb discovered an amazing pretext for reviving the hostilities. He challenged the succession of young Ali Adilshah by expressing doubts whether Ali was really his father’s son! Like his father, Aurangzeb was a pitiless conqueror. Burning, massacre and loot were his favourite weapons for striking terror into the hearts of the victims of his aggression. Assisted by an able traitor, Mir Jumla, he penetrated deep into the Bijapur territory and would probably have made a short meal of the Adilshahi kingdom in the war of 1657 if his father had not intervened with directions to end the hostilities. Aurangzeb was now free to turn his attention to the rising power of the Marathas, but, while he was making warlike pre- parations to face the new challenge, the news of his father’s serious illness in September 1657 drove him to concentrate all his energies on the supreme task of snatching the imperial diadem from his rival brothers. The sanguinary war of succession lasted from 1658-59, which gave a welcome respite to Shivaji to strengthen his position against the inevitable and more formidable aggressions from the north at a later, but not very distant, date. It stands to reason that for some time Aurangzeb did not take Shivaji seriously. He dismissed the Maratha, so much his junior, as a mere, if resourceful, adventurer who could be taught the error of his ways without much expenditure of effort or blood. Shivaji heartily welcomed the cunning THE IMPERIALISTS 71 Moghul’s mistake in underestimating his inherent strength, especially in the years of its growth. He offered his services to Aurangzeb when the war with Bijapur was renewed in 1657. The offer, addressed to Multafat Khan, the Moghul Governor of Ahmednagar, elicited no specific reply. The Governor, how- ever, was instructed by Prince Aurangzeb “to keep the path of correspondence with him (Shivaji) open”. The Prince was in fact playing a deep game, without, how- ever, realizing that for the first time he was encountered by a man who was his peer in diplomacy and astuteness. It was Aurangzeb’s aim to secure the adhesion of the Marathas to his cause and make them fight his battles without his having to pay them anything in return. Shivaji was no less adroit when he demanded the recognition of his sovereignty by the Moghul Government. Nothing was more repugnant to the inclinations of Aurangzeb than to concede such a request. He and his father had launched a costly war against the most powerful state in the south in order to vindicate the absolute para- mountcy of the Moghuls over the length and breadth of the country. In doing so they had elected to fight against their own co-religionists. Would it be in accordance with Aurang- zeb’s devout adherence to Islam to countenance the indepen- dent position of an ‘infidel’? It is true that the additional reason for proceeding against Bijapur was to expel the heretical Shia sect from the land, but could there ever exist for the “faithful" a real comparison between the creed of the Adilshahs and the religion of Shivaji ? Nevertheless, being deep in his designs, Aurangzeb made an elaborate pretence of promoting amity between himself and the Maratha ruler who was persuaded to send his demands to the Viceroy. Sonopant, Shivaji’s minister, proceeded to the Moghul camp and asked on behalf of his master for a formal recogni- tion of his right to all the forts and territories of Bijapur already in his possession. Shivaji also announced his intention of taking possession of the port of Dhabol and the region around it. Aurangzeb had little to lose by entertaining such claims, especially when his favourable attitude towards Shivaji 72 shivaji : the portrait of a patriot was likely to intensify the bitterness between the Maratha chief and the Bijapur Government. He accordingly wrote to Shivaji on April 23, 1657, signifying his approval of the latter’s demands and calling upon him to prove his “devotion" to the Moghul cause by rendering armed assistance to the imperial armies in the war against Bijapur. Shivaji was by no means deceived by such blandishments. He could see that the vague and non-committal Moghul promises meant nothing and he would certainly not waste his men and resources in strengthening the hands of the powerful imperialists, the brunt of whose aggressions he would have to bear sooner or later. Commenting on Shivaji’s rejection of Moghul overtures, Sarkar writes : “The vague promises of the Moghul Prince could not satisfy him. Even a less astute man than he must have known that such promises would amount to nothing in practice when the need of the imperialists would be over.” Seeing that the imperial armies in the Deccan were fully occupied with their campaigns against the Bijapur kingdom, Shivaji sent his troops under two able officers with instructions to attack the regions in the vicinity of Ahmednagar, the chief city of Moghul Deccan. The Maratha expedition was most successful and caused such alarm in the city that the com- mander of the Ahmednagar fort was forced to remove much of the valuable property into the stronghold for greater safety. While his men were raiding the Ahmednagar district, Shivaji himself led an attack on Junnar, an important town in the vicinity of Shivneri, his birth-place. In a surprise night attack on April 30, 1657, he captured the town by scaling its walls and dispersing the guards. He secured a large booty, including 300,000 hons, 200 horses and a good deal of costly jewellery and clothing. The bulk of the imperial army was then engaged in the siege of Kalyani, but Aurangzeb, who grew furious at Shivaji’s hostile activities, took prompt and effective mea- sures to prevent similar discomfitures to the Moghul armies. The Viceroy’s letters to his officers, urging them to guard the imperial territories with greater vigilance and zeal, “breath- THE IMPERIALISTS 73 ed fury and revenge” against the Marathas. They were instructed that by way of reprisals unbridled terrorism should be practised against the inhabitants of Shivaji’s possessions. The Marathas should be taught a memorable lesson by invading their land from all sides and by “wasting the villages, slaying the people without pity, and plundering them to the extreme”. Sarkar, who quotes this passage, further describes the anger of Aurangzeb by recalling his ruthless orders for reducing Poona and Chakan, the much-prized possessions of Shivaji, to utter ruin. No lenience or remissness was to be shown in “slaying and enslaving the people”, while the village headmen and peasants in the Moghul territory, who had helped Shivaji and his men, should be destroyed without pity. The tyrant’s orders and their merciless execution sent a wave of horror throughout Maharashtra, but the spirit of resistance to the pitiless invader never weakened. Frightfulness has never suc- ceeded in destroying just and noble causes. Hostilities in the Deccan, however, ended in September 1657 with the conclusion of peace between the Moghuls and the Sultan of Bijapur. Shivaji also called off his offensive against the invaders and asked Aurangzeb for favourable terms. By this time the Viceroy’s interest in his charge had declined considerably. Reports of his father’s serious illness diverted his attention towards the north. The prospect of winning an empire for himself was far more alluring than the painful under- taking of reducing the doughty hillmen of Maharashtra to submission. Nevertheless, he did not abandon his usual craftiness when dealing with Shivaji. The Maratha chief conveyed his wishes to him through his agent, Raghunath Pant, who reached the Moghul camp as the Prince was leaving for the north on January 25, 1658. In a letter, the tone of which was worthy of a vainglorious person, Aurangzeb condescended to comply with all the requests of Shivaji and invited him to strive in return for the greater glory of the Moghul Empire. But Aurangzeb’s gestures of good-will were a mere make-be- lieve. In fact, his real attitude towards Shivaji was revealed to his 74 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT officers on the eve of his departure for the north. He directed them to exercise eternal vigilance in order to protect the Moghul Deccan from the incursions of the redoubtable Marathas. His letter of December 1657 to Mir Jumla reveals both the extent of his anxiety for the security of the Empire in the south and his uncontrollable revulsion for Shivaji. Though a cultivated and elegant product of Moghul education and upbringing, Aurangzeb forgot himself and descended to levels entirely un- worthy of his breeding when dealing with or discussing Shivaji. He had failed to come to terms with the Marathas when he turned his back on the Deccan. The outcome of the strife was, however, most beneficial to Shivaji since he gained a sub- stantial accession of territories, especially in the Konkan. The manner in which he conquered Kalyan and annexed the important hill-forts in its vicinity, has already been described in an earlier chapter. Aurangzeb never forgot that he had left behind a resource- ful enemy in the Deccan. The rise of Shivaji to power, after the cessation of Moghul hostilities was remarkably rapid. He had humbled Bijapur by destroying its formidable general, Afzal Khan, and the army of invasion that had accompanied him. It was, therefore, necessary to send against him armed forces of irresistible strength, commanded by a man of proved ability and experience. Aurangzeb was now able to give his undivided attention to the affairs of the Deccan. He had at last gained the cherished goal of stealing the crown and sceptre from his father and elder .brother by practising the most odious cruelties against his own near and dear ones and by reducing the north into a shambles by the war of succession. Despite his natural inclination towards simple and Spartan life, he used his second coronation in July 1659 as an occasion for the display of Moghul, splendour on a scale unknown even in the annals of that fabulously ostentatious Empire. The task of administering the storm-tossed southern pro- vince was entrusted to Shaista Khan, a senior nobleman who had already won his laurels both as a general and as a governor. He had administered his charge of Malwa with competence THE IMPERIALISTS 75 and knew the Deccan and its affairs intimately. His leader- ship in war was amply demonstrated during Aurangzeb’s inva- sion of Golkonda. A major undertaking of the new Viceroy was to “suppress” Shivaji. and towards this end he was given a large and efficient army. Apart from his own considerable talents and the whole- hearted support of the Emperor, Shaista Khan could count upon the enthusiastic co-operation of the Bijapur Darbcar in his efforts to combat the Maratha resurgence. We saw in the previous chapter how Afzal Khan’s son, Fazl Khan, and a number of other Bijapur officers were making the most stre- nuous efforts to destroy Shivaji and his men and how they had nearly succeeded in their designs by reducing him to a desperate predicament in the fort of Panhala from which he eventually escaped by means of a remarkable ruse. A war on two fronts, dreaded at all times even by highly organized military powers, thus became inevitable for Shivaji who, however, faced it with exemplary courage and resourcefulness. Conscious of his superior military strength, Shaista Khan marched towards the Poona district, leaving Ahmednagar on February 25, 1660. He systematically subdued the strongholds that lay along his route and garrisoned them with his own troops with the object of protecting his line of communications with the Moghul capital in the Deccan from surprise attacks by the Marathas. By April he gained control over the regions around Poona and Baramati and pushed forward towards the south as far as Shirval. Poona itself was occupied on May 9. The Khan was aware of the inestimable advantage and initia- tive derived by him from the fact of Shivaji’s enforced idleness in the fort of Panhala. He, however, found Poona, then a mere hamlet, an inconvenient place for his headquarters, especially in view of the entire surrounding area having been previously denuded of all provisions and human habitation. The rains, followed by swollen streams and floods, aggravated the hardships of the Moghuls who had long been accustomed to the luxuries of life even when on active service. Chakan, a fortified town eighteen miles from Poona, was an obvious 76 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT choice for the encampment of the imperial army. The Khan was confident of overrunning the place without much difficulty since the castle was neither large nor strong. It could certainly not be compared with any of the hill-forts of Maharashtra, the conquest of which had invariably cost the enemy dearly. Situated on a flat ground, the Chakan fort could not be expect- ed to withstand the heavy artillery fire of the Moghuls. Shaista Khan, who began his siege operations in the last week of June 1630, however, failed to realize that it was not the brick and mortar, but the spirit and the sword-arm of the garrison that he had to reckon with. The castle was under the command of Phirangoji Narsala, the veteran soldier who had seen active service under Shahaji and who was among the earliest influential Marathas to join the patriotic movement inaugurated by his master’s young son. From those early days Narsala guarded the fort of Chakan with a devotion that be- came the most outstanding trait of Shivaji’s adherents. Confronted by an enemy that was in possession of the best military engineering skill and material of the time for blowing up his modest stronghold, Narsala had no illusions about the magnitude of his peril. But the thought of surrender never occurred to him even for a fleeting moment. He knew the predicament of Shivaji and could not expect to receive help from any quarter to compel the invaders to raise the siege. Besides, his master had directed him to hold on as long as he could and surrender to the enemy only under a compelling necessity. Meanwhile, the Khan left no known military device untried to hasten the surrender of the heroic garrison. Heavy guns, brought from the Moghul forts in the Deccan, poured incessant fire into the fort from raised platforms, while trenches were laid for blasting its outer walls. But the siege dragged on week after week, with the defenders repulsing the enemy with an unceasing shower of shots, bullets and rockets. Rain and cleverly organized night attacks by the Marathas added to the discomfiture of the Moghuls who were often driven out of their trendies. THE IMPERIALISTS 77 The superior military equipment and the staying power of the besiegers, however, prevailed eventually. On August 14, 1660, that is, fifty-four days after the commencement of the siege, the invaders succeeded in exploding a mine which carried away a bastion and the brave men defending it. When the bastion was blown up, says Khafi Khan, “stones, bricks and men flew into the air like pigeons”. Even so, the invaders did not venture to rush into the breach, but cautiously cut their way through it “placing the shields in front of their faces”. But, in spite of their caution, surprise was in store for them. The indefatigable Narsala and his men had mended the breach over- night by raising an earth-work inside the fort wall. Nevertheless, the end was near. “Invested in the citadel,” say Kincaid and Parasnis, “without supplies and with no hope of reinforcements, while the enemy got them in plenty, Narsala capitulated.” Shaista Khan was filled with admiration for the heroism of Narsala and his men and invited the Maratha com- mander to join the Moghul army. Narsala politely declined the offer, preferring a life of “blood, toil, tears and sweat” to the gauds and glitter of office under the imperialists. Shivaji, who had escaped from Panhala in July, received his loyal comrade with affection and gratitude and made him the com- mandant of Bhupalgad. The Chakan episode convinced the Moghul Viceroy that the conquest of Maharashtra, with its numerous strongholds garrisoned by determined men, .could not be accomplished without an enormous expenditure of time, money and human life. His own inclinations were in favour of accepting the peace offers that had been made earlier by' Shivaji, but the Emperor had forbidden any such understanding. In fact, he had sent Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur from Gujarat to reinforce the armies of Shaista Khan in the Deccan. The war of the imperialists against the Marathas accordingly dragged on wearily, with the Moghuls achieving no spectacular victory •and yet steadily strengthening their hold on the life iof fhe .Deccan. 78 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT The year 1661 began with the Moghuls making concentrated efforts to conquer North Konkan. Many areas of the Kalyan district fell into their hands, but the forts and the chief cities were able to maintain their independence. An army,, sent from Poona in January under the command of an experienced general, Kartalab Khan, to capture Kalyan was attacked by Shivaji and forced to give battle in the difficult terrain of the Western Ghats. Encumbered with heavy baggage and artillery, deprived of all access to the plains and fearing death from thirst in the narrow and rocky paths and jungles of the ghats, the Moghuls fought desperately to escape from their terrible predicament, despite the realization that success in such a situation, especially against an enemy who knew every inch of the ground, was impossible. On February 3, 1661 the Moghul commander surrendered all his equipment to the Marathas in preference to the complete annihilation of his army and in addition paid a large ransom in order to secure a safe retreat for his men. The gains of the Marathas in the engagement were immense, but they were offset in May when they lost Kalyan to the enemy. To compensate for the mounting loss of his territory, Shivaji descended into South Konkan and made easy conquests as far as Goa. But the Moghuls could not be compelled to relax their pressure on his kingdom by such diversionary tactics. The conflict had now developed into a war of attrition and of nerves. Assessing the Moghul campaign in Maharashtra under Shaista Khan’s directions, Sarkar writes: “The net result of the operations of these two years was that the Mughals kept their grip on the extreme north of Konkan, including the city and district of Kalyan— barring occasional raids into that debatable land of the Pen sub-division — while Shivaji remain- ed master of the southern part, namely, the south-eastern comer of the Kolaba district and nearly the whole of ihe Ratnagiri district. ” Such a stalemate was certainly not hi the interests of Shivaji. Only by dislodging the invaders from Maharashtra could he hope to enlarge and strengthen the edifice of independence. THE IMPERIALISTS 79 The armies of the imperialists were incredibly superior to his own. It was evidently impossible to uproot the mighty banyan tree, but it could certainly be pulled down by striking at the trunk. After much deliberation Shivaji decided upon the amazing course of surprising the Gommander-in-Chief of the imperial forces in his own house and killing him. For the sheer audacity of the conception of the plan and its execution, it could not be equalled even by the most daring, adventure of modern commandos. Shivaji knew the house of his childhood as well as he knew his own hand, but the mansion was rendered almost inaccessible to outsiders, being surrounded by the quar- ters of the Khan’s guards besides the band-room and those of his officers. Not far from the place was the camp of the Maharaja of Jodhpur whose contingent consisted of 10,000 men. Shivaji, who had taken up his residence at Sinhgad in order to be close to the imperialists, had carefully studied the dis- position of the enemy camp as well as the arrangements made for the protection of the Viceroy and his harem. He selected four hundred men to accompany him on his adventure and descended from the Lion Fort on the afternoon of April 5, 1663. The Maratha party, which was lightly armed, covered the eleven-mile distance to Poona the same evening and by offering a plausible explanation to the guards entered the imperial camp by nightfall. The night was dark and it being the sixth day of Ramzan the Nawab and his retinue had partaken of a heavy meal and gone to sleep. By midnight complete silence reigned in the house. All but a few in the kitchen had fallen sound asleep. Detach- ing a small body of men from his party, Shivaji softly moved into the house, surprised and noiselessly killed the cooks engaged in preparing the pre-dawn meal of the Khan, and started boring a hole in the wall that blocked his admission to the inner chamber. The silence of the night was broken by the falling mud and bricks and the groans of the dying men In Jhe kitchen. The servants of the Khan woke up in alarm, bat they were sent back to sleep by the irate nobleman with a rebuke for disturbing his repose by their imaginary fears. 80 SHTVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT After allowing time for the awakened inmates to compose themselves to sleep again, Shivaji entered the inner apartment through the hole, followed by his men. The Khan and his attendants were now entirely at the mercy of the intrepid intruders. Shivaji rushed at the Khan and smote the bewildered nobleman with his sword. At this critical moment, a resourceful woman put out the lights, making the task of annihilation extremely difficult for the Marathas. The Khan, whose fingers had been cut off with Shiva- ji's sword, was hastily removed to a place of safety during the ensuing confusion which became worse confounded when two of the Marathas inadvertently fell into a cistern, making a great noise with the splashing water. Meanwhile, the other half of Shivaji’s party pounced upon the guards from outside, slaughter- ing all those who opposed them. The sleeping bandsmen were hauled out of their beds and ordered to play the band. It was an unearthly hour for any music to be played but the protesting bandsmen complied when they were assured that the directive was from the Khan himself ! The beating of the kettle-drums, in unison or other- wise with a plethora of other instruments, the shouts of the invading Marathas, and the surprised wailings of the awakened Moghul soldiery, produced a situation of indescribable confusion and panic. The apartment of the Viceroy was reduced to a shambles, while outside a veritable bedlam prevailed. It was now time for Shivaji and his men to withdraw, which they did as suddenly as they came. They returned to Sinhgad by the direct route, while the Moghuls searched high and low in the camp in their fruitless attempts to apprehend the elusive enemy. The Maratha adventure was a complete success. While Shivaji lost only six men, the Moghul casualties were far more numerous and serious. Abul Fath, Shaista Khan’s son, a captain of the imperial army, forty of the Khan's attendants and six of his wives and slave-girls lost their lives that night. In addition, two other sons of the Khan and eight women were wounded. The casualties among the women Were entirely due to the inability of the Marathas to distinguish them from men THE IMPERIALISTS 81 in the darkness 'that prevailed in the hall after the lights were put out The blow to the prestige of the Moghuls was shattering. The Viceroy, was the maternal uncle of His Imperial Majesty, besides being the amir-ul-umara or premier peer of the Empire. Bitter tears of mortification were shed by his relatives both at the court and in the camp in the Deccan. A mighty Khan, whose merest whisper had reverberated like thunder in the ranks of his subordinates, lay helpless and humiliated. Instead of winning plaudits as a great conqueror, he suddenly became an object of pity and sympathy. On the following morning his officers called on him to console him in his misfortune. The Khan was profoundly dis- concerted when Maharaja Jaswant Singh met him. As if the Rajput was responsible for his humiliation, he cried: “When the enemy fell upon me, I imagined that you had already died fighting against them!” The insinuation that Jaswant Singh connived at the downfall of the Khan was wholly unfounded because, as we shall see in the next chapter, none of the pre- mier Rajput nobles that had chosen to serve Aurangzeb, despite the Emperor’s proved wickedness and perfidy, was capable of subordinating his personal advancement to the wider interests of the country. Shivaji’s own account of his night attack proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the entire credit for planning and' executing it with such consummate skill and daring belongs to him alone and to none else. Soon after the incident the wounded and mortified Khan retreated to Aurangabad for greater safety. The Emperor, far from commiserating with him over his fallen eminence, scolded him for his alleged carelessness in dealing with a “wily” adver- sary. As a mark of imperial displeasure, he was transferred to Bengal, then regarded as a penal province and described by the Emperor himself as “a hell well stocked with bread”. The disgraced nobleman turned his back on the Deccan, the grave- yard of his reputation, in the middle of January 1664. By his exploit Shivaji attained instant fame as a legendary figure. His successful encounter with Afzal Khan, a man of 82 shivaji : ihe portrait of a patriot Herculean strength, earlier had already established his reputa- tion as a leader of outstanding courage and resourcefulness. His latest act confirmed the widely-held belief that no physical might was strong enough to crush this remarkable man. To his own men he became a leader without a peer and could command their most implicit obedience and sacrifice in pursuit of his noble aims. To others, living away from the scene of his exploits, he became a fabulous figure invested with powers not endowed to mere mortals. Contemporary foreign observers noted how popular imagina- tion wove the most fanciful fables about Shivaji’s' abilities. “Re- port hath made him,” recorded an English factor, “an airy body and added wings, or else it was impossible for him to be in so many places as he is said to be all at one time. They ascribe to him to perform more than a Herculean labour that he is become the talk of all conditions of people.” Similar astonishment was expressed by the Portuguese in Goa, Senor da Guarda, for instance, recording his amazement at Shivaji’s celerity of movement and his so-called omnipresence. The well-merited fame of Shivaji was of great value to him in meeting his powerful and unscrupulous adversaries and in frustrating their evil designs against him.

The attack on Shaista Khan, the Moghul Viceroy, and his retirement from the Deccan in dis- grace, besides constituting a great personal triumph for him- self, delivered a serious blow at the prestige of the imperialists. Shivaji considered it necessary to repeat such performances with the object of exposing the myth about the so-called invin- cibility of the Empire until he developed sufficient strength of his own in order to be able to inflict a decisive military defeat on the enemy. The prosperous port of Surat on the west coast was among the prized possessions of the Moghuls and Shivaji’s plunder of the town in January 1664, both to acquire the means for waging the war of independence and to cause further public humiliation to the imperialists, provoked Aurangzeb to take strong measures with the object of annihilating the Maratha power. It now became clear to Aurangzeb that nothing could be more preposterous on his part than to continue to regard Shivaji as little better than a minor refractory chief, inherently incapable of offering an effective challenge to the Empire. The Maratha ruler had humbled and humiliated no less a person than the Emperor’s own uncle, besides neutralising the effec- tiveness of the armies that had been sent against him. Jaswant Singh, the premier Rajput nobleman at the imperial court, had proved himself equally useless in dealing with Shivaji. In the Context of the bitter rivalry that existed be- tween the ruling houses of Jodhpur and Jaipur and of his own insatiable ambition to bask in the sunshine of imperial favour, as none else could ever hope fo do,’ the aspersions cast on his integrity when operating against Shivaji, appear to be wholly unfounded. Indeed, the realization of his own inability to face the Marathas after the discomfiture of Shaista Khan was the only reason why his attempts to retrieve the situation 84 the strategic retreat proved so futile. His recall from the Deccan, like that of Shaista Khan, became inevitable, following the failure of his expedition. Aurangzeb was deeply concerned about the choice of a mili- tary successor to the Maharaja. He saw that Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Jaipur was the only man among his senior generals who could be trusted to grasp the Deccan nettle. With a rare charm of manner, he confided to the Raja his unbounded faith in his integrity and ability to bring the southern issue to a successful conclusion. He further flattered the Rajput by declaring that in the wide Empire there were only two men who could hope to force Shivaji to go down on his knees, they being his own imperial majesty and bis devoted and valiant servant, Mirza Raja Jai Singh! The Raja should, therefore, proceed to the Deccan with all expedition and bring Shivaji to the imperial court “by- any means”. . The new appointment was announced on the occasion , of the Emperor’s birthday celebrations on September 30, 1664. , Aurangzeb’s confidence in Jai 'Singh was not misplaced. The Raja belonged to a state that had become the pillar of the Moghul Empire from the- days of Akbar. Indeed, he was the inheritor of the . traditions of loyalty so ably established .by the valiant Man Singh. Jai Singh ascended the gadi of Amber in 1622 when he was barely thirteen years old. From that year till his death in the south, he knew no rest or respite in his service of the Empire. He was a good Hindu, but his obliga- tion to his ancestral faith did not go beyond his personal devo- tion to it. He did not regard it as part of his responsibility as a premier Hindu nobleman of the realm to protect the venerable dharma from insult and suppression. His capacity for righteous indignation at the growing intolerance in the country had been destroyed by his early apprenticeship to the Moghul service. His own career meant everything to him and in his pursuit of personal success, he allowed no such consi- derations as country or religion to disturb his thoughts. While the loss of the services of such a brilliant and valiant 0}an to the country undoubtedly rendered it the poorer, his THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 85 adhesion to the Moghul cause gave considerable strength and prestige to the imperialists, although they were none too anxious to acknowledge this fact. Jai Singh was endowed with many towering qualities. Making the Moghul cause his own, he had fought in almost every part of the far-flung Empire— from Balkh in Central Asia to Bijapur in the Deccan and from Kandahar in the west to Mungri in the east. His superb courage and resourcefulness, his mastery over military strategy and tactics and his charming address had helped him to win dazzling prizes under the Moghuls which no Hindu could expect to gain after Akbar’s impartial and beneficent regime. In the campaigns abroad Jai Singh was given command of the imperial armies with a status equal to that of the Emperor’s sons. And to his eminence as a warrior he added the lustre of an accomplished diplomat and linguist. Age and experience had brought to his outlook and judg- ment a mellowness which helped him to realize that not infre- quently diplomacy was much superior to mere force. Thus, though beginning his career -as a bluff soldier, he steadily developed into a patient, subtle, soft-spoken and tactful diplo- mat who often used all these artful powers against the adver- saries of the Empire with much success. A high-born Rajput and supremely conscious of his lineage, he had acquired com- plete mastery over the manners and etiquette of the imperial court so that conversation with him was invariably pleasant and instructive. His proficiency in Turki and Persian as well as in Urdu and in his own dialect of Rajasthani gave him great advantage in discussions and negotiations. It was this man, now in his fifty-sixth year and in the plenitude of his mental vigour, that was sent to the Deccan, charged with the responsibility of destroying the great work of Shivaji. He was, as Sarkar observes, “an ideal leader of the composite army of Afghans and' Turks, Rajputs and Hindustanis that followed the crescent banner of the sovereign of Delhi”. ' There was, however, not much significance in the class com- position of the army commanded by Jai Singh against Shivaji. The fighting forces of those times and of the earlier and subse- SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT quent periods were mostly composite in character, but by choosing Dilir Khan, a Pathan officer, as the second in command to the Rajput Commander-in-Chief, Aurangzeb ensured that Jai Singh did not allow the bonds of religion to interfere with his dealings with Shivaji. But such precautions, which merely gave one more illustration of the Emperor’s suspicious nature, were wholly unnecessary since the Raja considered nothing more sacred than implicit obedience to his overlord’s orders. In fact, at a later date, when writing from the Deccan on the Maratha affairs, he greeted Aurangzeb in his letter of June 1665 as the “shadow of God”. Such a man could be trusted to carry put his responsibilities not only loyally but with ruthless thorough- ness. Collecting a large army. and. equipping it with the best of wea- pons and engines of destruction which the times could furnish, Raja Jai Singh left North India and crossed the Narmada on January 9, 1665, arriving at Aurangabad on the tenth day of the following month. During his brief stay of three days in the city he called on Prince Muazzam, who had succeeded Shaista Khan to the Deccan Viceroyalty, and, after fulfilling the forma- lities of the court, proceeded to his destination, Poona, the future capital of the Maratha Empire, reaching that place on March. 3. A veteran of many wars, Jai. Singh was nevertheless over- come by strange misgivings about the outcome of his under- taking. Many commanders, Moghul and Bijapur, had in the past come to grief when measuring their strength with the strange and unpredictable Maratha, although some of them had pos- sessed resdurces nearly as great as his own. He was unable to divine what new forces would be unleashed by Shivaji to accom- plish his defeat and disgrace. He, therefore, decided to make the most comprehensive arrangements with the object of con- vincing the Marathas of the futility of resistance to the in- vaders. Reporting to Aurangzeb .the progress of events in the Deccan, the Raja wrote that he allowed himself no rest or ease but laboured day and night to fulfil the task for which he had been sent. He used both sword and sabotage in his grand THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 87 offensive against Shivaji and politely declined to be deflected from his carefully laid out course of action when advised by the Emperor to attack the Maratha king in the Konkan. He demanded and received supreme powers to plan and direct the campaign according to his own judgment. There was, as we saw in the preceding chapters, a traditional and inveterate enmity between Bijapur and Delhi, the latter missing no opportunity to encompass the ruin of the Deccan Sultanate. Frequent wars were waged against it, the impe- rialists often carrying sword and fire to the very gates of its capital. Jai Singh was not deterred by the embittered rela- tions between the two Governments when he urged the Adil- shah to make common cause with the aggressors. He invited the Sultan to embrace the opportunity now afforded to him to settle his accounts with Shivaji by forgetting the fact that an open antagonist is always preferable to a dissembling ally. * The number of men in Maharashtra who had long been biding their time to destroy the handiwork of Shivaji was by no means negligible. The Mores of Javli were prominent among such disruptionists. They, along with many other disgruntled Ma- ratha sardars, rallied under the imperial banner, determined to fight for the restoration of Muslim rule in Maharashtra! The. country abounded in men of straw upon whom bribes and honours worked like an enchantment. At the same time, the prospect of tasting the sweetness of revenge drew to the Moghul standard men like Fazl Khan, the persevering son of Afzal Khan, and many other defeated and dispossessed Muslim noblemen in the Deccan. The indefatigable Rajput general was still not content with his work of sabotage and disruption. He sent two of his Portuguese emissaries to Goa to instigate their compatriots there to undertake a naval expedition against Shivaji, while the Siddis of Janjira were similarly urged to. capture and ravage his coastal towns. Even Niccolao Manucci, the young artillery chief of Jai Singh’s army, was not exempted from the disagreeable task of fomenting disunity and disaffec- tion among the people of Maharashtra. He was commissioned to incite the local chiefs, in the northern regions of the Maratha 88 SHXVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT country to' repudiate their allegiance to Shivaji. Indeed, Jai Singh spumed no method or technique that promised to streng- then his hands. He attempted to tamper with the loyalty of Shivaji’s own officers by making them tempting offers, but drew a blank from that source. Having thus created a nest of fifth columnists and saboteurs, who could be trusted to stab the valiant fighters for freedom in the back, Jai Singh set about making his military dispositions with equal thoroughness. His aim was two-fold, namely, to draw the Maratha forces into the open and overwhelm them with the aid of his superior equipment and numbers, and to neutralise the value of their hill-forts by stationing strong Moghul outposts in their vicinity. The most prominent. feature of the astute Rajput’s strategy lay in preventing the Marathas from taking advantage of the difficult terrain of their country. His immediate target was the famous fortress of Purandar. He moved his camp to Saswad, six miles south-west of Purandar, in order to give personal attention to the operations against the fort. The task of besieging and attacking it was given to Dilir Khan, his second in command. The establishment of strong outposts at the strategic points around Poona and the garrisoning of the town with 4,000 ca- valry effectively blocked all - assistance to the defenders of Purandar, who were forced to bear the brunt of Moghul attack without any hope of receiving reinforcements or other aid. Large flying columns were regularly detailed to penetrate the countryside and to sack and bum the villages as a deterrent to any help reaching Shivaji and his men from the local population. One such flying column was directed “not to leave any vestige of cultivation or habitation, but make an utter desolation”. But no excesses on the part of the invaders could weaken the determination of the garrison at Purandar to defend it to the last. As we , saw in an earlier chapter, the fort is naturally endowed with considerable strength, and in those days when the siege operations were exasperatingly slow, its capture demanded almost superhuman efforts. Such efforts the Moghuls were now determined to make and the stage for the capture of the THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 89 fortress was set with the arrival of Dilir Khan before it on March 30. The garrison, which consisted of two thousand troops, was commanded by Murar Baji who, from the first day of the siege, realized the impossibility of beating off the aggressors. He knew that Shivaji, then in the Konkan, did not have the means to come to his aid or to compel the enemy to raise the siege by any other strategy. But the idea of surrender never crossed his mind. He was a typical Maratha captain, simple, brave and selfless, who had been taught to do and die for his master. It did not matter if the Moghuls were in overwhelming numbers. That fact did not deprive the garrison of its indestructible superior- ity which it had acquired form the determination of every troop- er to lay down his life in defence of the fort. Dilir Khan con- centrated his artillery fire on Rudramal or Vajragad, an inde- pendent fortified enclosure situated on a ridge running east of Purandar. Possession of this fort was of vital importance to hasten the capture of the main stronghold. Vajragad, in the words of Jai Singh, was “the key that would unlock Purandar”. The efforts of the garrison to repulse the invaders were most ineffective against .the pitiless cannonade of the Moghuls. Vaj- ragad fell into the hands of the. enemy on April 14. The parlous condition of the garrison at Purandar was realized by the Maratha army outside ^nd renewed attempts were made to force the invaders to abandon the siege. Netaji Palkar, the indomitable cavalry leader, made several diversionary attacks on the Moghul outposts, but with no conspicuous success. The fate of Purandar was sealed, but the pressure on the aggressors from the Maratha forces was not relaxed. As Jai Singh him- self ruefully admitted: “Sometimes we have failed to prevent the enemy from accomplishing their hostile designs.” Khafi Khan, quoted by Sarkar, is even more explicit. “The surprises of the enemy,” writes this hostile historian, “their gallant successes, attacks on dark nights, blocking of roads and difficult passes, and burning of jungles, made it very hard for the imperialists to move about. The Moghuls lost many men and beasts.” 90 SHtVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT But such Maratha gains did not deflect the course of events or save Purandar from passing into Moghul control. Murar Baji’s position was truly desperate. With the fall of Vajragad, Dilir Khan moved his camp to the foot of the fort, known as Machi, or ridge. Determined to dislodge him from his vantage position, the Maratha commander, taking seven hundred men with him, delivered a powerful attack on the Khan when the latter was climbing the hill with five thousand Afghans and other Moghul troops. A desperate hand-to-hand fight ensued in which neither side asked for or gave quarter. Murar Baji and his valiant followers slew five hundred Pathans, besides a number of other infantrymen. The intrepid Maratha leader decided not to return to the fort unless he killed the Khan himself. Detaching sixty men from the rapidly thinning ranks of his followers, Murar Baji rushed at Dilir Khan, but, before he could reach his chief opponent, he lost one arm and the protecting shield. Despite the mortal blow, he moved forward, tying the maimed hand with a scarf. The toll of enemy life taken by him and his desperate band of followers was really terrible. Dilir Khan, himself a renowned soldier, was amazed at the courage and impetuosity of the Maratha captain and his men. He pleaded with Murar Baji to stop fighting and to join the Moghuls with the fullest conviction that his interests would be advanced by his new masters far beyond his most optimistic expectations. The Maratha spumed the offer with contempt regarding it as an affront to his patriotism and fell upon the Khan and his men with such vigour as his bleeding body could allow. Apprehending danger to his own life, Dilir Khan shot an arrow which ended the earthly career of the indomitable Murar Baji. His head was severed by the enemy, but the trunk was retrieved by the Marathas who laiter sent it to Shivaji for the final rites. Thus perished a great patriot and soldier and the pb’ce where he fell is known as Ranatemb, meaning the hillock where the battle was fought. The death of its leader did not, however, disspirit the garrison which decided to carry on the struggle to the bitter end. THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 91 With a courage, rare in the military annals of any country, the defenders continued to hurl defiance at the invaders, de- claring that the death of one man made no difference to their determination to fight. “Are we not brave like our beloved leader? Why then should we surrender?” they asked. There has never been any effective answer to the challenge of patriotism. Sbivaji, who had by now returned from the Konkan and stationed himself near Purandar, watched with deep concern the ebbing fortunes of Maharashtra. It was clearly impossible for the new State to sustain unaided the full impact of the might of the Moghul Empire. Many years of assiduous labour, devoted to the building up of new assets on a vastly larger scale, together with the creation of a wider and a more inten- sified national consciousness, was necessary to enable the Marathas to face the imperialists on terms of equality. He watched the plight of Purandar, one of the famous fortresses of swarajya with a heavy heart and the death of its commander, Murar Baji, was a personal blow, to him. The great cause could ill afford to lose such brave and devoted men. Moreover, Raja Jai Singh was most unlike the many men he had dealt with before. There was an inexorable thorough- ness in all that he did so that his adversaries could find no opportunity to turn the tables on him. Appeals to his religious sentiment were worse than useless, since the Raja had trans- formed the worship of power and the service of the Emperor into the best form of religion. Shivaji was faced with two alternatives— either to accept dictated terms from the Moghuls or to carry on the unequal and disastrous struggle with the certain knowledge that very soon nothing would be left to him. Both courses were extremely repugnant to him, but he was a realist and appreciated the manifest imprudence of staking the future in one big gamble. He, therefore, decided to salvage as much of his kingdom as possible through a negotiated settle- ment, but if the Moghuls, riding on the .crest of victory, spum- ed his offer of friendship and attempted to swallow everything he had won in the past, he would then review the position. 92 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT From the first, he made up his mind never to become a vassal of the Emperor; at the most, he would agree to hold a position analogous to the one held by Mewar in relation to the Moghuls. Should the imperialists, in their arrogance, demand a heavier sacrifice from him, he would not hesitate to make common cause with Bijapur and carry on the war against the invaders for an indefinite period. It is possible that similar thoughts must have occurred to Jai Singh when he received Shivaji’s overtures for peace. But for some time he showed no outward signs of willingness to consider them. He wished to assure himself beyond a shadow of doubt that Shivaji’s offer of friendship was not a snare and a delusion. Besides, the agreement shftuld be such as to win the wholehearted endorsement of the Emperor when alone his expedition to the south would be hailed as successful. Raghu- nath Ballal Atre, the astute minister of Shivaji, who had been deputed to ascertain the Moghul terms; eventually persuaded Jai Singh to receive his master and negotiate a mutually accept- able peace treaty through personal discussions. On June 11, 1665 the Maratha. king visited the Rajput Commander in his camp near Saswad. He went on a peace mission and neither he nor the small group of men that accompanied him were armed. The Raja welcomed his distinguished guest cordially, but omitted no precaution to protect himself from a sudden attack! The fact that Shivaji was wholly, unarmed did not abate the apprehensions of the celebrated general of the Moghuls for his personal safety. Armed Rajputs were station- ed around the Raja to guard his life. Jai Singh had made careful plans to impress upon Shivaji during his visit to the Moghul camp the futility of resistance to the imperialists. The citadel of Purandar was still in Maratha hands, but the Moghuls could now capture it at will- The final assault was deliberately delayed till Shivaji’s arrival in Jai Singh's tent. At a signal from the Raja, the Moghuls re- newed the offensive against the garrison, taking a toll of eighty .Maratha- lives. Shivaji could not bear- to see the useless slaughter of his brave men and entreated his host to end the THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 93 unequal fighting. At the same time, he issued orders to the valiant garrison to evacuate the fort. Thus ended the saga of the Battle of Purandar. The terms of the peace treaty were onerous in the extreme. Twenty-three forts and the lands adjoining them, yielding an annual revenue of four lakh hons, were surrendered to the Moghuls, while Shivaji retained twelve forts including Rajgad, fetching an income of one lakh harts annually. Some of the strongholds made over to the enemy, Sinhgad, for example, had been among his most cherished possessions and had brought him power and prestige in his campaign for independence. The provisions of the agreement were indeed a bitter drench for him to swallow, but he took comfort from the knowledge that, after all, the Moghuls could not carry away the hill-forts of Maharashtra to distant Delhi. One day they would be his again. There were not many men of' Jai Singh’s calibre in the imperial service and, should there be a rupture in the Maratha- Moghul relations, who could prevent Shivaji from wresting back his favourite forts from the hands of the enemy? Chief among his other commitments was his promise to render military assistance to the Moghuls in their war against Bijapur. Jai Singh did not wait long to declare war on that State, conveniently forgetting that only a little earlier he had earnestly solicited the Sultan’s help to subjugate Shivaji. For his part, Shivaji fulfilled his obligations under the Treaty of Purandar by participating in the campaigns against his neighbour and long-standing enemy. It was during this period that an unfortunate estrangement occurred between him and his able and resourceful cavalry officer, Netaji Palkar, whose overbearing attitude towards -his master, so unusual among Shivaji’s followers, led to his dismissal. At first Netaji joined the Bijapur army and was later persuaded by Jai Singh,, March, 1666, to enter the Moghul service as “commander of five thousand”. The provisions of the treaty with Shivaji were endorsed by Aurangzeb, but the transaction was most distasteful to Dilir Khan, who, true to the traditions of the Moghul nobility, could 34 SHXVAJI ; THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT brook no equal or superior, especially when he happened to be a non-Muslim. Knowing the Khan’s envious disposition, Jai Singh had persuaded Shivaji to pay a courtesy call on the Pathan leader who, for all appearances, received the visitor with the utmost warmth and cordiality. Essentially a man of the sword, he could not believe that any great cause could be won except through violence and bloodshed. He was unhappy about the peaceful ending of the Purandar siege, nor did he consider it an act of prudence to let Shivaji, the mortal enemy of the Em- peror, go alive from the Moghul camp. We have the testimony of Manucci, Jai Singh’s European artillery commander, that on many occasions Dilir Khan urged the Raja “to take Shivaji’s life, or at least to give him (Dilir Khan) leave to do so. He would assume all responsibility and see that the Raja was held blameless.” The Khan got his opportunity to work for the downfall of his superior later when the Moghul armies failed to win spectacular victories against Bijapur and when Shivaji made his sensational escape from Agra. It is strange that Shivaji, noted for his shrewdness and cir- cumspection, allowed himself to be persuaded by Jai Singh to pay a visit to Aurangzeb at Agra. The cruelty and the trea- cherous character of the Emperor had become a bye-word over the length and breadth of the country. Indeed, he regarded duplicity as an axiom of state policy. He himself wrote: “One cannot rule without deception. A government depending on cunning will last for ever.”' It is true that Jai Singh had given Shivaji a solemn assurance that no harm would befall him during his stay in the Moghul capital, but what sanctions could the Rajput chief forge against his overlord whom, as we saw, he worshipped as God on earth, if Aurangzab decided either to kill his enemy or to imprison him for life in an impregnable fortress like Gwalior? Indeed, both these diabolical plans were actually considered when the Maratha ruler went to Agra and one of them would certainly have been adopted if Shivaji had not made his bold escape betimes. It was impossible for the Emperor to forget Shivaji’s attack on his uncle, Shaista Khari, and the sack of Surat. THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 95 Overwhelming reasons, transcending even considerations of personal safety, must have prevailed with Shivaji when he decided to undertake the journey to the north. What those reasons were cannot now be explained with any degree of cer- tainty. A desire to study the strength and the weakness of the Moghul Government at its source and to understand the reactions of the people in the north to the oppressive regime could perhaps have been one of the reasons for his decision, but it would be straining one’s credulity too much if it is urged that that consideration alone impelled him to absent himself from Maharashtra at a critical time. Nor was there any stipu- lation in the treaty with Jai Singh that he should meet the Em- peror in person. There is, however, no doubt that Shivaji regarded his visit to the imperial capital as one of the most fateful episodes in his career. He fully appreciated the magnitude of the risk he was taking and made arrangements for the administration of his affairs during his absence with a thoroughness that has rightly been characterized as a “masterpiece of forethought and organization.” His sagacious mother, Jijabai, was appointed Regent, with Moropant Peshwa, Nilopant Muzumdar and Pra- taprao Gujar, the Senapati or commander-in-chief, as her coun- sellors in administering the realm. To ensure that the effici- ency of his Government was maintained, he toured his king- dom extensively, sometimes paying surprise visits, and exhorted his officers to carry on during his absence with their customary zeal and devotion to duty. Perhaps, no better tribute can be rendered to his personality and leadership than by recalling the fact that, in spite of the grave risks and uncertainties that at- tended his visit to the north, the government of his territories was conducted with amazing smoothness and efficiency as though he had never been away from his kingdom On March 5th 1666 Shivaji started on his journey to Agra from Rajgad, taking a small but efficiently equipped escort with him. .He was accompanied by some of his intimate friends, including Tanaji Malusare, Yesaji Rank, Baji Sarjerao Jedhe, Hiroji Farzand, Balaji Avji, Niraji Raoji, Raghunath Ballal 96 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OP A PATRIOT Korde, Trimbak Sondev Dabir and Madari Mehtar. En route he visited Aurangabad where he was given an enthusiastic re- ception by the citizens, much to the chagrin of the Moghul Gov- ernor. That official, who had at first insolently refused to ex- tend to Shivaji the courtesies due to a distinguished visitor, soon discovered his mistake and made appropriate amends so' that cordiality was restored between the two before the Mara- tha party left the city. During his journey Shivaji received a letter dated April 5 from Aurangzeb promising him a warm reception at his court. Shivaji and his escort reached the out- skirts of Agra on May 11. The following day, May 12, was an eventful' day for Aurang- zeb. Since the incarceration of his father in 1658 and his death on January 22, 1666, the Emperor had not ventured to visit the city. He had, therefore, decided to make his first entry after so many years memorable by holding a magnificent Darbar in the Agra palace on May 12 in celebration of his fiftieth lunar birthday. The resplendent peacock throne had been refur- bished for the occasion, while one thousand four hundred carts had been employed to transport the treasures of the imperial household from Delhi. The Governors and the feudatories of the realm had been directed to attend the ceremonial and to rejoice at the might and majesty of their paramount lord. It was the special wish of Aurangzeb that Shivaji should witness the imperial splendour so that he might realize, if he were- so faint-hearted, his own “smallness”. But the stars in their courses ordained otherwise. Kumar Ram Singh, the son of Mirza Raja Jai Singh and his agent at the court, who was in charge of the arrangements for Shivaji’s stay at Agra, was, through a series of mishaps, unable to con- duct the Maratha king to the imperial palace till late in the afternoon of the Darbar day, although he had arrived near the city the previous day. Without any rest or relaxation, without any opportunity to collect his thoughts or to adjust himself to the new surroundings, and oppressed by the midday heat of the Agra sun, Shivaji was virtually hustled into Aurangzeb's presence at diwani-i-khas or the “hall of select audience” THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 97 Nevertheless, Shivaji showed no vexation or resentment at the treatment meted out to him and extended to the Emperor all the honours and courtesies due from one sovereign to an- other, offering him the presents he had brought from the Deccan. Aurangzeb, who had shown such eagerness to meet the Maratha hero and who had promised to give him a recep- tion worthy of his eminence, did not condescend even to make a gesture of recognition. Shivaji waited in vain for a word of goodwill and friendship. To add insult to injury, he was con- ducted to an inconspicuous place in the hall and asked to stand in the row of second-rate nobles of the Empire. The pride of Shivaji was deeply wounded. In front of him he saw the backs of many Sardars, some of whom had been worsted by him on the field of battle. If Aurangzeb had orga- nised the Darbar to “dazzle the eyes of the world with his grandeur and wealth”, it is evident that the particular kind of reception he had arranged for Shivaji was intended to humiliate him in public. Both by his upbringing and in his outlook Shivaji did not attach much importance to the gradations and hierarchies in the society. He had lived and moved with the simple-minded hillmen of Maharashtra, heartily sharing their frugal fare and enjoying their humble but generous hospitality. No change in his position or fortunes could deflect him from that democratic and fraternal attitude. But humility, derived from an innate nobility of the mind, is as different from servile submission to insult as heaven is from earth. The great avenger of injustice could, on no account, acquiesce in any affront to his dignity and honour. He was roused to anger and, summoning Ram Singh to his presence, called his attention to the undeserved treatment that had been meted out to him, despite the fact that both his father and the Emperor knew well his status and standing as an independent sovereign. Anxious to avoid further insults to his person, he walked out of the hall of audience, at the same time leaving no doubt in the minds of the assembled nobles and others how deeply he resented the Emperor’s calculated act of discourtesy. Aurangzeb, who had been watching the scene created by his 98 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Deccan adversary with an observant eye, welcomed it, as it gave him one more pretext for planning Shivaji’s destruction. The fact that his trusted lieutenant, Jai Singh, had given Shivaji the most solemn guarantees concerning his personal safety while at Agra, did not in the least affect Aurangzeb’s designs. In the estimation of this cruel man, who had won the throne through violence and treachery, what was an obligation to an opportunity? Apart from Aurangzeb’s own wicked disposition, powerful forces had long been at work to poison his mind against Shivaji. Maharaja Jaswant Singh believed that he had sound reasons for persuading the Emperor to destroy Shivaji. The failure of his expedition in the Deccan and Shivaji’s openly-expressed deri- sion at his military incompetence had deeply offended the Maharaja’s amour-propre. Perhaps, even more galling to his pride was the outstanding success of Mirza Raja Jai Singh in the south which contrasted sharply with his own dismal record. The enmity between the ruling houses of Jodhpur and Jaipur was long-standing, bitter and irreconcilable. It is a melancholy fact of history that the inter-Rajput rivalry played no small part in strengthening the Muslim power in the north. Distinguished for their valour and chivalry, the Rajput princes could achieve anything but unity amongst them- selves. The reasons, if there had really been any, for the sus- tained antagonism between the ruling dynasties of Jaipur and Jodhpur could on no account have been of such overwhelming importance as to warrant their permanent estrangement. Students of Maratha history are well aware of the utter pueri- lity of the differences that divided the House of Scindia and Holkar in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thus causing them to default criminally in the fulfilment of their obligations and responsibilities to the Maratha Empire. The Rajputs under the Moghuls, like the Marathas under the Deccan Sultans, considered no pursuit worthier than the service of their pasters whose smiles and favours they courted and wel- comed like manna from heaven, THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 99 Shivaji’s second adversary was Jafar Khan, the Prime Minis- ter, whose wife was the sister of Shaista Khan, the man who had lost his fingers, wives and sons in his encounter with the Maratha king at Poona. The infuriated woman never allowed a moment to be lost in persuading her husband to intrigue for Shivaji’s downfall, while another influential lady in the imperial palace made unceasing efforts to achieve the same results. Jahanara, the powerful sister of the Emperor, was deeply offended at the sack of Surat which had deprived her of her normal customs revenue from that port. The opportunity was too good to be lost for wreaking a terrible vengeance upon Shivaji. Shivaji knew the gravity of his peril and was left in no doubt about his future when armed guards were posted around his residence.. But, however desperate the situation, he flatly re- fused to see the Emperor again. Indeed, he had an uncon- querable aversion for bowing his head before any temporal authority, although he was ever so willing to prostrate himself before pious men. The utmost concession he made during the period of his duress at Agra was to allow his little son, Sam- bhaji, who had accompanied him, to visit the palace and wait upon the Emperor. But he abated no efforts to secure his early release from Moghul surveillance. He addressed . frequent requests to Aurangzeb to permit him to return to the Deccan so that he might advance the cause of the imperialists by co-operating in their campaigns against Bijapur. He tried various other methods towards this end, including his plea to the high digni- taries to intercede on his behalf. But on every occasion he drew a blank. He tried one more expedient. He asked the Emperor to allow him to go to holy Banaras and to spend the rest of his life there like a recluse. With a cynicism worthy of his sinister nature, Aurangzeb replied: “Let him turn a fakir and live in the fort of Allahabad where my officers will take good care of hipi!” In those days the fortress of Allahabad, like the forts of Gwalior, Asirgarh and Daulatabad, had won notoriety as a place of life-long detention for state prisoners, 100 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT In dealing with a pitiless and unscrupulous tyrant Shivaji soon realized the futility of prayer and petition. He must devise his own plans to secure his emancipation from the Moghul duress. It was characteristic of this dauntless and re- sourceful man that adversity invariably stimulated his mind, with brilliant successes following closely his gravest disasters. During the period he was not making plans for his escape he employed his enforced idleness in studying the Moghul system closely so that, on his return to the Deccan, he might give it a vigorous push towards dissolution. Shivaji saw that the Government of Aurangzeb rested on in- justice and iniquity. We have already discussed at length the religious bigotry of the Emperor. No religion claimed his res- pect, not even Islam as practised by sects other than his own. The Bohras, according to Sarkar, “have a tradition that their spiritual guide, Sayyid Qutb-ud-din of Ahmedabad, was killed with 700 of his followers by order of Aurangzeb”. The in- veterate hostility of Aurangzeb and his father to the Sultanates of Bijapur and Golkonda was largely due to the profession of the Shia faith by their rulers. The Sufi philosophers, with their broad-minded outlook, were equally stigmatized and persecut- ed by the gladiatorial Emperor as the heretics of Islam. Even the simple and eclectic faith of the Sikhs, founded by the great pacifist, Baba Nanak, was not spared the hammer-blows, of Aurangzeb whose truculence played no small part in trans- forming the Sikhs into a militant fraternity. Thus, an over- whelming majority of the population, comprising the entire Hindu, Sikh and Christian communities, and a sizeable section of the followers of Islam, outside the narrow circle of the Sunni sect, were victims of unbridled religious oppression. To belong to the creed of the Emperor, therefore, came to be re- garded as an especial privilege, its adherents behaving as if they were heaven-born. The religious policy of the Government was thus grossly un- just and the injustice was vastly aggravated by the imposition of the hateful jaziya tax on the Hindus in 1679 in order, it was asserted, to “spread Islam and put down the practice of infi- THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 101 delity”, Shivaji, who had by this period acquired sufficient strength to face the Moghul aggression without flinching, took the lead in addressing a letter of remonstrance to the Emperor. Drafted by Nila Prabhu, his Persian Secretary, the protest read: “It has recently come to my ears that, on the ground of the war with me having exhausted your wealth and emptied your trea- sury, your Majesty has ordered that money under the name of jaziya should be collected from the Hindus and the imperial needs supplied with it.” Recalling the growing impoverishment of the country, the letter declared: “Your peasants are downtrodden; the yield of every village has declined— in the place of one lakh of rupees only one thousand, and in the place of one thousand only ten are collected, and that too with difficulty.... It is a reign in which the army is in a ferment, the merchants complain, the Muslims cry, the Hindus are grilled; most men lack bread at night.... How can royal spirit permit you to add the hardship of the jaziya to this grievous state of things? The infamy will quickly spread from west to east and become recorded in books of history that the Emperor of Hindusthan, coveting the beg- gars’ bowls, takes the jaziya from Brahmins and the Jain monks, yogis, sanyasis, paupers, mendicants, ruined wretches, and the famine-stricken — that his valour is shown by attacking the wallets of beggars — that he dashes down to the ground the name and honour of the Timurids!” Reminding the bigot that all great religions are one, Shivaji goes on to say: “If you believe in the true Divine Book and word of God (i.e. the Quran), you will find there that God is styled as the Lord of all men and not as the Lord of the Mu- hammedans only....To show bigotry for any man’s own creed and practices is equivalent to altering the words of the Holy Book. To draw new lines on a picture is to find fault with the painter: In strict justice, the jaziya is not at all lawful.... But to oppress ants and flies is far from displaying valour and spirit.” The spirited protest concludes: “I wonder at the strange fidelity of your officers that they neglect to tell you of the true state of things, but cover a blazing fire with straw!” (Sir Jadu- 102 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT nath Sarkar's translation.) It is not known what effect the letter produced on the Emperor, but it certainly yielded no results. Aurangzeb’s mind had long been sealed against consi- derations of prudence and humanity. The second most egregious blunder of Aurangzeb was his in- accessibility to all counsels of moderation and fairplay. Akbar was a despot, but he deferred to the advice of wise men whom he encouraged to influence his ideas and ideals and to guide the policies of his government. But Aurangzeb was cast in a dif- ferent mould and was congenitally incapable of sharing his con- fidence with others. He was intensely suspicious and never knew the quality of gratitude. All despotisms are hateful because they are a potent instrument for the debasement of man. But autocracy under Aurangzeb was utterly insuffer- able. In the Moghul polity, kissing the feet of the Emperor was regarded as a unique privilege! Aurangzeb demanded that the entire country should crawl before him in abject ser- vility. Besides, Aurangzeb’s absurd idealism gave rise to a good deal of sanctimonious humbug. He hated music and drinking and tried to banish both from his realm. He made futile attempts to promote chastity through legislation, failing to realize that re- form can succeed only when it becomes an organic part of the society’s outlook and adaptability. “All the cultural develop- ment of Islam,” says a writer, “all its philosophy and gaiety and grandeur of soul, meant nothing to him.” The kill-joy Emperor thus became an unwitting instigator of dishonesty and dissimulation. Manucci records that there were few persons who did not drink secretly and that “even the ministers and Qazis loved to get drunk at home. Gambling con- tinued to be practised in his camp, and his order to all the courtesans and dancing girls to marry or leave the realm re- mained a dead letter”. Thus, from the year of his usurpation of the throne till his unlamented death in 1707, this suicidal man drove the country remorselessly to the brink of ruin by adopting bigotry, oppression and impractical idealism as the triple principles of his statecraft. During his stay at Agra THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 103 Shivaji saw and heard sufficiently to confirm his belief in the vulnerability of the Moghul system. Great courage, imagination and planning were necessary to ensure Shivaji’s escape from the clutches of the imperialists. As weeks melted into months, the restriction on his movements became far more rigorous than those of a mere house arrest. Perhaps, he could manage to leave the house unnoticed, but a vast sub-continent, policed by a hostile government, stretched between him and the place of safety. His retinue was not large, but as a party in flight it was too big to escape detection. Moreover, it was dangerous for him to share the secret of his intentions with many. He, therefore, secured permission to send the bulk of his escort back home— a course of action that was heartily welcomed at the court which believed that by de- pleting the number of his adherents, Shivaji had unwittingly made himself even more helpless. Shivaji’s plan of action was bold and simple and it succeeded admirably precisely for the same reason. For some weeks he had confined himself to bed announcing indisposition. Pro- longed treatment, rest and prayers for his early recovery were considered necessary to ensure his return to good health. Large baskets containing sweetmeats were sent out of his house daily for distribution among Brahmins, mendicants and courtiers. The number of such baskets, slung on poles and carried by porters, increased with each day. The guards’ devotion to duty by searching every container did not long survive the tedium of the task. Little did they imagine that the baskets could become an excellent receptacle for conveying the great state prisoner from thraldom to freedom. In blissful ignorance of the fateful' consequences of their carelessness and not realizing that, with Shivaji at large, there would be a most significant change in the course of Indian history, the easy-going guards allowed the baskets to move out freely without inspection. On 1 the afternoon of August 19, 1666,* Shivaji and his son, Sambhaji, entered a pair of baskets and were promptly con- veyed to a place of safety outside the city. There, on a lonely Sardesai gives a different date. 104 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT spot, he was greeted by his faithful followers who had made perfect arrangements for his onward journey to Maharashtra. The small party split into two, the king being accompanied by his young son, Niraji Raoji, Datta Trimbak and Raghu Mitra. Shivaji, who had acquired consummate skill in putting on an infinite variety of guises, concealed his identity and that of his party by donning the robes of wandering mendicants and pro- ceeded to the great pilgrim centre, Mathura. At Agra his trusted officer, Hiroji Farzand, who had taken his place in the house, never left the “sick-bed” the whole of that day. He somewhat resembled Shivaji whose signet ring he wore to complete the deception about his real identity. The guards, who had been instructed not to disturb the “patient” on any account, left him in peace with no doubt or suspicion crossing their minds, especially when they saw the familiar ring on his finger. Hiroji left the bed on the following morning and, admonishing the watchmen to be considerate towards his “ail- ing” chief, made his exit from the house never to return. A strange silence fell over the house, which, only a few days earlier, had been humming with activity. The guards became suspicious and their worst fears were soon confirmed when they failed to see the prisoner in his place. Their frantic search for Shivaji proying abortive, they rushed to the police chief, Siddi Fulad, who had been commissioned by the Emperor to be in charge of the Maratha king’s detention, and broke the astound- ing news to him. Bewildered and shaking with fear, the unfor- tunate officer promptly reported the incident to Aurangzeb, asserting that Shivaji had made his escape with the aid of occult powers. The astute Emperor did not, of course, allow himself to be taken in by any such absurd explanations and ordered an immediate, despatch of search parties in all direc- tions. By then Shivaji had gained a lead of fourteen hours. Shivaji made his escape not a day too soon. More than three months had elapsed since his arrival at Agra. Aurangzeb had by now made up his mind to seal the fate of his adversary. He abandoned the original project of sentencing Shivaji to life- imprisonment in the dungeon of a fortress because he knew that THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 105 so long as his enemy lived he would continue to torment his thoughts. Death was the only fitting reward to the Maratha for his temerity in unfurling the flag of independence. But Aurangzeb must commit this diabolical crime without risking popular odium. The north-west frontier was in a fer- ment. It was decided that Shivaji and Jai Singh’s son, Ram Singh, should accompany the punitive expedition against the tribesmen. A Muslim officer, called Radandaz Khan was direct- ed to join them with secret instructions that the Maratha king should be killed at a convenient time and place on the way to the north-west frontier. The man was a specialist in perpetrat- ing such atrocities. Pending preparations for the distant expe- dition, Shivaji was to be removed soon to another house from where escape would have been impossible. This carefully nur- tured plan, however, went hopelessly awry by his timely flight. Providence could not have dealt a more staggering blow to the evil-minded plotters. In planning the route of his journey from Agra to Mahara- shtra Shivaji showed the same depth of perception as marked his escape from the city. He threw the Moghul hordes in his pursuit off their scent by proceeding to the north instead of the south. Mathura was his immediate destination, which he reach- ed safely with his son and followers within six hours. Both on account of his tender age and the greater risk of detection with him as a companion of the fugitives, Sambhaji was left behind in the holy city in charge of a Brahmin family from Mahara- shtra. The boy was later restored to his parents after the commotion caused by the escape had died down. Shivaji shav- ed off his beard and moustache to complete his disguise and, taking his trusted men with him, proceeded eastwards to Alla- habad. From there the route of his journey lay through Bun- delkhand, Gondwana and Golkonda. On September 12, 1666 he reached Rajgad where his mother was in residence. Shivaji’s home-coming, after an absence of mote than six months, was an event of historic importance and of great re- joicing throughout the Deccan. Fervent thanksgiving prayers were offered from thousands of temples and from the taber- 106 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT nacle of millions of hearts on his safe return. In the eyes of his mother, whom he pleasantly surprised by appearing before her in the garb of a sanyasin, it was a virtual rebirth. His unique exploit increased the respect and admiration of his people for him tenfold. Only he and none else, they rightly believed, could have won his deliverance from the stranglehold of the wily Emperor and eluded the vigilance of his alerted minions. Shivaji noted with supreme satisfaction that the high standard of his administration had been maintained during his long absence from his realm. Not a single Maratha officer had succumbed to the seductions of the Moghul service, thus demonstrating to the misguided careerists in the country that it was impos- sible to set any price on patriotism. Aurangzeb never forgave himself over Shivaji’s escape. The episode haunted his dreams till the end of his life in 1707. Re- flecting on it philosophically, he expatiated on the need for a government to keep itself fully informed about the happenings in its realm, since failure to do so would be suicidal. Shivaji’s escape, he lamented, would involve him in wars and vexations till the end of his life. His immediate reaction was, however, to seek a scapegoat. He found one in the unfortunate Ram Singh, an innocent man, whom he denounced as a traitor, stripped him of all his honours and estates and forbade his attendance at the court. In the extremity of his despair and anger, he failed to realize that no son of Mirza Raja Jai Singh would venture to deviate from the path of loyalty to his person and throne. The plight of Jai Singh in the Deccan was even more pitiable. With an astonishing disregard for the solemn promise he had given to Shivaji, he refused to rejoice at the Maratha king's emancipation from the clutches of his unscrupulous master. No- thing mattered to him more than his own prestige and influence at the court, despite his knowledge of the faithlessness of the Emperor. Shivaji’s escape, the disgrace of his son and his own failure in the campaign against Bijapur presaged the end of his career as, to quote his own words, the “slave of the court.” One cannot write about this man without a heavy heart. By THE STRATEGIC RETREAT 107 virtue of his eminent qualities and the opportunities that came his way, he should have striven for a place with patriots like Shivaji and Rana Raj Singh of Mewar, but he chose the easier path of service and personal advancement under a government and a master both of whom were dominated by narrow-mind- ed bigotry. ' Jai Singh’s letter to Jafar Khan, the Moghul Prime Minister, reveals how even an honourable man can sink to incredible depths of degradation by taking a distorted view of his respon- sibilities and obligations. It was, of course, impossible for him to apprehend Shivaji by any means, but, at the behest of his lord and master, he captured Netaji Palkar, who had already joined the Moghuls, and sent him a prisoner to Delhi. The misguided and impetuous Maratha was converted to Islam, circumcised and called Muhammed Kuli. He was used as a mercenary and served in Afghanistan for ten years till his escape from Moghul thraldom and return to his former master, Shivaji, in May 1676. The sad man, who had perhaps grown wiser after his experi- ence in the north; was soon reclaimed to his ancestral faith. Jai Singh did not long survive his humiliation. A lone and tragic figure, he found escape from his grief and misery in death which overtook him at Burhanpur on August 28, 1667 while on his way to Delhi, posing a problem to the historian in determining his place in history. His exit was, however, of much value to Shivaji who knew that it was impossible even for the Moghul Empire to nurse more than one man of Jai Singh’s calibre. REFERENCES 1.

CHAPTER 6 THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT Shivaji’s escape from Agra in September 1666 marked the be- ginning of a new era in Maharashtra and indeed in the whole of India. His safe home-coming gladdened and galvanized his people to an extent that no other event could have done. The great deliverer was back in their midst to lead them to victory against misrule, oppression and intolerance. His sensational escape thrilled millions of his countrymen in other provinces, and those that had banded themselves together to overthrow the imperial yoke watched his subsequent activities with deep interest and expectation. Shivaji had, however, to act with great caution. Some of the important strongholds of Maha- rashtra were in the hands of the enemy and were being guarded by competent and vigilant commanders, although no fortress could long remain in hostile possession so long as the inhabi- tants in the surrounding regions were animated by sentiments of patriotism and by a willingness to make any sacrifice for the common cause. Shivaji, therefore, prudently avoided an open conflict with the Moghuls soon after his return from Agra. Following his arduous and nerve-shattering journey, he was in dire need of rest Besides, after his long absence from his people, it was necessary for him to understand their temper and their pre- paredness for another trial of strength with the imperialists, which was likely to be more bitter and prolonged than the pre- vious struggle. The next campaign would necessarily have to be directed towards winning back the ceded hill-forts, which certainly was not a small undertaking. Time was also requir- ed to repair the damage done to his realm by Jai Singh’s vic- tories which had greatly contracted his territories and re- sources. Every consideration of prudence thus demanded that he should remain at peace both with the Moghuls and the Bijapur Government till the right time for action came. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 109 Shivaji could afford to bide his own time, especially after Jai Singh’s death. Under Prince Muazzam’s viceroyalty of the Deccan, there was a manifest disinclination on the parr of the Moghuls to renew the hostilities against the Marathas. With his customary astuteness Shivaji wrote a conciliatory letter to Aurangzeb, explaining that his precipitate departure from Agra was prompted solely by his fear for personal safety and not out of any desire on his part to provoke a conflict with the Emperor. Whether Aurangzeb, a consummate practitioner of the art of cunning and duplicity, was mollified by such gestures from his mortal foe is doubtful, but he made a virtue out of necessity by outwardly accepting Shivaji’s offer of friendship and co-operation. In the administration of his charge Prince Muazzam was assisted by Maharaja )aswant Singh, who shared his master’s partiality for the seductions of sloth and self-indulgence. Both were fond of the chase and organized frequent shikar expedi- tions. They certainly did not subscribe to the Emperor’s en- thusiasm for renewing hostilities against the elusive and in- domitable Marathas. And when Shivaji made his peace offer, they eagerly grasped his hand of friendship, eventually persuad- ing a reluctant Emperor to endorse their action. Peace thus prevailed between the Marathas and the Moghuls from 1667-69, although discerning men on both sides could see that no dur- able understanding was possible so long as the most vital region of Maharashtra remained under alien control. Shivaji, who had observed the weakness of the Empire at the source, now found his conclusions confirmed by the squab- bles among the Moghul imperialists in the Deccan. Dilir Khan, who had accompanied Jai Singh to the south as his second in command and who survived him, was not endowed with any estimable accomplishments except the lone virtue of courage as a soldier. He was ambitious, jealous, truculent and treacherous and was indeed a typical representative of the 110 SHIYAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Rohilla clan which continued to figure in Indian history even after the dissolution of the Moghul Empire.* Dilir Khan had won the confidence of the Emperor by prov- ing false to his superior, Jai Singh, which policy he practised even against Prince Muazzam. He wrote to Aurangzeb de- nouncing his son as a traitor. Deliberately misconstruing the relations between the Prince and the Marathas, he complained that Muazzam was in collusion with Shivaji with the wicked object of usurping the imperial throne. The Emperor did not dismiss the charge as the fabrication of a spiteful man since his own conscience never forgave him for a similar crime. The Khan’s estrangement from Jaswant Singh was complete and no- thing could bring the two men together. The Emperor was in a quandary since both his son and his Rajput lieutenant repeatedly accused Dilir Khan of insubordi- nation and of arrogant behaviour. To ascertain the truth, which had been obscured by the recriminations of his quar- relling oflicers, Aurangzeb sent his own Chamberlain to the Deccan with directions to find our whether it was really the Khan or the Prince who was contemplating a rebellion against the Government. The investigator was a wise Galileo who fully understood the dangers and the thanklessness of his * The Rohillas made common cause with the Afghan invader.

Their treacherous behaviour was never forgiven by the southern highlanders who lost no oppor- tunity of invading their territory that lay in the tract that runs along the base of the Himalayas from the river Ganga eastward upto the confines of Oudh. The foreigners had succeeded in im- posing their sway over the local population whom they exploited with ruthless thoroughness for their own glory and gratification. They were, to quote an authority, “naturally turbulent, treacher- ous, cruel and warlike” and it was said of them that “they pray with one hand and rob with the other”. (Selections from the State Papers of the Governor-General of India: Warren Hastings, edrted by G W Forrest, Vol. I (1910), page 67). In April 1774, then leader Rahmat Khan, was defeated and killed in battle by flie combined armies of the Nawab of Oudh and the East India Company. , The surviving Rohilla State of Rampur was absorbed into India s wider unity after independence, THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 111 undertaking. He, therefore, hummed and hawed, prevaricated and reported nothing worthwhile to his master. At the same time, in an attempt to please both the factions, he only suc- ceeded in deepening their mutual enmity! As a contemporary English observer wrote: “He played the Jack on both sides, and told the Prince that Dilir Khan was his enemy, and went to Dilir Khan and told him that the Prince would seize on him if he came to Aurangabad.” Sarkar, who quotes this passage, adds: “His unfortunate advice to Dilir only prolonged the tension.” Muazzam’s persistent attempts to prejudice the Emperor’s mind against Dilir Khan at last succeeded. An order was sent to the Viceroy to arrest the contumacious Khan and “bring him back to the path of obedience”. Forestalling the imperial directive, Dilir fled in panic northwards to Malwa. It was a suicidal move of which his enemies took full advantage. The Prince and Jaswant Singh went in pursuit of him, at the same time inviting Shivaji to come to their aid. This sordid episode furnished the most convincing proof of the growing imbecility of the Moghul counsels in the Deccan. Thinking men began to wonder whether the feud among the imperialists was not in fact a prelude and a dress-rehearsal for a full-scale civil war. The Emperor’s timely intervention, however, saved the situa- tion, though only temporarily. The trouble with the Moghuls, as all who had eyes to see could observe, was that their Empire was rapidly heading for its dissolution. It had long passed the pinnacle of its glorious achievements. Neither its vast armies, representing a museum of diverse nationalities, nor the wealth of its grandees, nor the splendid palaces and mausoleums of the Emperors, could con- ceal the mortal disease that had seized the Moghul body politic. The decline in the moral and spiritual power of the realm was noticed by contemporary observers even during the reign of Jahangir. The demoralization was far more pronounced under the government of Aurangzeb whose morbid fanaticism and amazing ignorance of the economic consequences of bis 112 SIIXVAJX : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT interminable and costly wars, hastened the process of disinte- gration. A rupture in the relations between the Moghuls and the Marathas was inevitable. The Emperor’s disrespect for the religion of the land angered the Hindus all over the country. Jijabai, the pious and spirited mother of Shivaji, considered the destruction of the Vishweshwar temple at Banaras as a wanton affront to Hindu manhood. Sardesai holds that she played no small part in influencing her son’s decision to renew hostilities against the Moghul bigot and tyrant. Shivaji’s dignified re- buke to the Emperor, composed in a language worthy of his high purpose, provides one more example of how all thinking sections in the country felt revolted by Aurangzeb’s excesses and cruelties. Apart from these religious considerations, Shivaji could clearly see the growing distractions of the Empire. Soon after his departure from Agra, the Moghul troops were deployed to the Punjab to guard the province against an apprehended invasion by the Shah of Persia. Indeed, the unhappy Aurangzeb had little respite from trouble and vexation. The chronically agitated North-West Frontier erupted in March 1667, compel- ling the Moghuls to rush their troops to Peshawar. The fact that the turbulent tribesmen refused to bow their head before the monarch of their own faith bore no lesson to the bigoted Emperor. It is a measure of the embarrassed state of the imperial treasury that Aurangzeb ordered the recovery of the trifling sum of one lakh of rupees that had been advanced to Shivaji for financing his journey to Agra I The bare thought that, in compliance with the agreement concluded with Muazzam, a Maratha contingent had to be maintained at the expense of the Moghuls even in the distracted condition of their finances, caused deeper anguish to the Emperor. As a Maratha chroni- cler records with disarming candour, jagirs had been assigned to the Marathas in the Moghul territories so that their troops could “feed themselves at the expense of the Moghul dominion”. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 113 It was characteristic of Aurangzeb that he attempted to end the embarrassing commitment by having recourse to his favourite device of treachery. He issued secret instructions to his son to secure Shivaji’s arrest — a tall order indeed ! Since that was impossible, he directed that Shivaji’s son and his gene- rals should be held and used as hostages. The Prince was repelled by the want of scruples in his parent and, being ap- prised of the Emperor’s intentions in advance, he advised the Maratha commanders, Prataprao Gujar and Niraji Raoji, then in his camp at Aurangabad, to leave in haste for their homes. The miscarriage of his plan caused deep disappointment to the Emperor who, however, took such comfort as he could from the fact that the jagirs in the imperial territory were no longer available to the Marathas for nourishing their armies of independence. The uneasy peace of 1667-69 gave place to an open war in early January 1670 or a fortnight earlier. The Marathas were now eager and poised for action. The fact that such strong hill-forts as Sinhgad and Purandar, were under enemy occupa- tion, far from dispiriting them, gave an impetus to their zeal for winning back the famous strongholds from the Moghuls. The Queen-Mother, Jijabai, strongly desired to see her favourite land cleared of the invaders, and her merest wish was a com- mand to her devoted son. The loss of the Lion Fort, in particular, had caused her much anguish and the mettlesome lady, who had now grown old, considered no sacrifice too great in order to recapture it for the national cause. The story of the reconquest of Sinhgad is one of the most stirring episodes in the history of the Marathas and will be narrated in greater detail in another chapter. The fort was guarded by a famous Rajput warrior, Uday Bhan, who could be dislodged from his strong position only by a superior dis- play of skill and courage. Both these .qualities were shown in an abundant measure by Tanaji Malusare and his loyal Maratha troops who captured the fort on February 4, 1670. In the battle that was fought inside the fortress, both the Maratha and Moghul captains lost their lives. 114 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT The next major target of the Maratha offensive was the equally famous fort of Purandar, which had stubbornly defied the concentrated artillery strength of the Moghuls during the previous war. The valiant garrison, led by the indomitable Murar Baji Prabhu, had demonstrated to the enemy that, despite the disadvantages of limited resources and poor weapons, the Deccan highlanders were capable of rising to great heights of military skill and enterprise. The manner of Murar Baji’s death was, as we saw, as inspiring as it was grand. The fort was now guarded by a Moghul commander, called Raziuddin Khan, who was unable to resist the great Maratha offensive of 1670. The resourceful Nilopant and his men* captured both the fort and its commander on March 8, thus burying the’ unwanted Treaty of Purandar many fathoms deep. Confident of the justice of their cause, aware of the growing infirmity of their adversaries, and recognising the salutariness of the military doctrine that attack is the best form of defence, the Marathas decided to strike at the enemy in his own terri- tory. In a raid on Chandwad near Nasik, they captured a sizeable amount of imperial treasure which was of great value in financing their war against the invaders. The attack on Mahuli in north Konkan, fifty miles from Bombay, was less successful at the outset, but the courageous Rajput keeper of the fort, Manohar Das Gaur, surrendered his charge on June 16, realising that no help could be expected from his Govern- ment. The Marathas won a resounding victory against the Moghuls in the first week of March when they recaptured the important towns of Kalyan and Bhiwandi, both near Bombay, after putting the Governor, a Khan from the north, to the sword. Thus, within a few months of commencing the hosti- lities, Shivaji succeeded in removing all traces of Moghul occupation of north Konkan. By the end of April, his armies penetrated deep into the imperial territories, levying heavy contributions from such large towns as Junnar, Ahmednagar and Parenda. The Marathas attacked Surat for the second time, October 3, 1670, and carried away property worth sixtysix lakhs of rupees. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 115 Reports of the sack deeply wounded Aurangzeb’s pride. He often toyed with the idea of descending upon the Deccan in person, but did not leave the north for many years, either on account of his growing distractions there or, as the historian of the Marathas suggests, as a result of the realisation of his own inadequacy in meeting a resourceful and determined antagonist. He was able to invade Maharashtra only after Shivaji’s death. He, however, sent some of his ablest generals, Muslim and Rajput, against his enemy, empowering them to draw freely upon the resources of his Empire to ensure the success of their undertaking. Prince Muazzam shared his father’s fury and humiliation at the sack of Surat and sent urgent orders to Daud Khan Qureshi, a veteran officer, to intercept the Marathas on their return journey. The Marathas had a numerically superior force and were led by such renowned captains as Prataprao Gujar, Vyankoji Datto and Makaji Anandrao. Daud Khan fell upon them near Dindori in the Nasik district. The advantage derived by the Marathas from their numbers was almost neutralised by their responsibility for the safe transit of the large treasure taken from Surat. Shivaji, however, rose to the occasion. Dividing his force into several columns, each under the command of an experienced officer, he engaged the enemy in an elusive warfare, while a strong detachment escort- ed the wealth to safety through a secret pass. After making these arrangements, Shivaji led the charge in person against the Moghuls, inflicting heavy casualties on them, the number slain being estimated at three thousand. Four thousand horses were captured, together with many important Moghul officers. The latter were, however, later sent home with presents. Siddi Hilal, the Moghul Governor of Dindori, transferred his services to the Maratha Government. The Battle of Dindori, October 17, 1670, paralysed the power of the Moghuls in the Deccan for some time — a situation of which the Marathas took full advantage. Like Bismarck, the great German Chancellor of the 19th century, Shivaji was by temperament one whom life consumed 116 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT but rest killed. Action was his forte, of which he gave repeated proofs to his opponents. He struck another blow at the imperialists in December by personally leading an army into the rich province of Khandesh. His troops sacked Bahadur- pura, a suburb of Burhanpur, the capital of Khandesh, and suddenly fell upon the wealthy city of'Karanja, which yielded to the Marathas property worth one crore of rupees. Thence- forward Khandesh became one of the principal sources of revenue to the Government of Maharashtra for financing the maintenance and expansion of its army. It was at this time that chouth, the famous system of collecting one-fourth of the revenue, was levied by Shivaji. The Maratha incursions into the Moghul territories went almost unchallenged, the local commanders finding it increas- ingly difficult to stem the tide of the invasion. The Emperor, however, accepted no such defeat and appointed Mahabat Khan to the southern command, with emphatic directions to wage a pitiless war against the enemy with the one and only intention of destroying them. Mahabat Khan, who arrived in Auranga- bad in January 1671, was given Daud Khan as his second in command, while other famous military leaders like Maharaja Jaswant Singh and Dilir Khan, were ordered to co-operate with the new chief. But the concept of concerted action among the Moghuls had long before dissolved into an unrealisable dream. The nobles of the Empire were so pre-occupied with their own prestige and personal ambitions that they had become totally incapable of rising above that sordid level. Daud Khan, for instance, regarded his position under the new commander as derogatory to his dignity and military prowess and appealed to Aurangzeb to recall him! Despite his personal distinction as a soldier, Mahabat Khan was not a large-hearted man. He burned with jealousy when the honours of an engagement with the Marathas were annexed by Daud Khan, whom he despised as the commander of a mere “five thousand”. The rains were exceptionally heavy in 1671 and the Moghul camp at Pamera was struck by a virulent pesti- lence which took an enormous toll of life. But Mahabat Khan THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 117 was totally unmoved by the catastrophe. The fact that large numbers of his troops and cattle perished from disease, thus seriously weakening his military strength, neither ruffled the equanimity of this strange man nor abated his appetite for carnal pleasures. “While his troops were dying,” says Sarkar, “Mahabat Khan attended daily entertainments in the houses of the nobles by turns. There were four hundred dancing girls of Afghanistan and the Punjab in his camp, and they were patronised by his officers. Such callous indifference to human suffering, such excessive addiction of the leading men of the Government to ignoble pursuits, and such criminal dereliction of duty on their part inevitably led to the eventual dissolution of the Empire. Some of the Moghul commanders added cruelty to the catalogue of their misdeeds. Dilir Khan’s massacre of all the citizens of Poona above the age of nine in December 1671, as if such insensate atrocity was a substitute for victory on the field of battle, furnished one more example of the growing demoralisation of the Moghuls. The great and, for the Marathas, the epoch-making action before Salher in the first week of February 1672 proved beyond a shadow of doubt that the halcyon days of uninterrupted victories for the imperialists in their wars against their opponents were now over. The Battle of Salher was a major trial of strength between the Marathas and the Moghuls, with some of the most famous generals ranged against each other as belligerents. Prataprao Gujar, Moropant Pingle, the Peshwa and Anandrao Makaji were among the well-known captains that led the Maratha army. Both sides fought with reckless courage, unmindful of casualties, and determined to win or die on the battlefield. After an obstinate struggle, the imperialists were decisively defeated, many of their senior officers falling into the hands of the Marathas. Commenting on the battle, Sarkar writes : “Ikhlas Khan and Muhakam Singh (the son of Rao Amar Singh Chanda- wat) were wounded and captured with thirty of their principal officers, while Rao Amar Singh and many other commanders 118 SHIVAJI: THE rOETRAXT OF A PATRIOT as well as several thousand common soldiers were slain, and their entire siege-camp was taken by the enemy”. The Peshwa, who played an outstanding part in the battle, soon recaptured both Salher and Mulher and, after providing for their defence, hastened to his master to report the resound- , ing victory of the Marathas over the enemy. Sardesai quotes at some length, Sabhasad’s enthusiastic account of the famous action. The success of the Marathas, says the chronicler, was mainly due to the strategy and valour of Shivaji’s Peshwa, of whom a contemporary poet sang : “The valleys of Poona echo the name of Shivaji, There roams his dauntless Peshwa, He slaughtered the Mughals of Salher Just as Arjun slaughtered the Kauravas of yore.” Sabhasad further writes : “The Maratha captains and the Mavla troops overcame the most renowned Mughal com- manders. The news rejoiced Shivaji’s heart. He rewarded the messengers of the glad tidings with gold bracelets and wristlets. Sweets were widely distributed. Dilir Khan saved his life by flight. A large number of the wounded Mughals fell into Shivaji's hands. They were properly nursed and released with presents after recovery. Some willingly accepted Shivaji’s service”. The impression made by the Maratha victory at Salher on contemporary foreign observers was equally profound. Accord- ing to the English records of that period, Shivaji “forced the two generals (that is, Bahadur Khan and Dilir Khan), who with their armies had entered into his country, to retreat with shame and loss”. Grant Duff, who describes the battle in some detail, observes: “This victory was the most complete ever achieved by Shivaji’s troops in a fairly fought action with the Moghuls and contri- buted greatly to the renown of the Marathas. Its immediate consequence was the abandonment of the siege of Salher and a precipitate retreat of the army to Aurangabad.” The British historian also mentions the nobility and the generous attitude THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 119 of Shivaji towards the captives and says that he “treated the prisoners of rank, who were sent to Raigad, with distinction, and, when their wounds were healed he dismissed them in an honourable manner. Such prisoners as chose to remain were admitted into his service; and deserters, both from the Bijapur and the Moghul armies, began to join the Maratha standard in considerable numbers.” 1 It was characteristic of Aurangzeb that he failed to see the signs of the times by attributing Maratha success to the treachery of his own trusted and highly-placed officers. His bigoted mind and warped outlook exempted none from his all- embracing suspicion. He mistook Mahabat Khan’s ineffective- ness for collusion with Shivaji, which was an entirely baseless assumption. The unfortunate commander-in-chief, who was recalled, left the Deccan for the north in May 1672, leaving the vacant office to be held by Bahadur Khan. The conquest of the Koli territory by Moropant Pingle in the same year gave the Marathas “a short, safe and easy route from Kalyan upto Northern Konkan to Surat and laid that port helplessly open to invasion from the south”. Bahadur Khan’s combined office of viceroy and commander-in-chief, held by him till August 1677, produced no outstanding results in favour of his Govem- 1 Dennis Kincaid writes: “Mahabat Khan, the Moghul Commander, was sent to reduce Shivaji to submission. Early in 1672, in a long, confused battle outside Salher town, the Moghuls were first held and then broken by a brilliant cavalry charge. Only two thousand men from the Moghul army escaped. Twenty thousand fell in battle or surrendered.” {The Grand Rebel, by Dennis Kin- caid, 1937, p. 268). Kincaid and Parasnis write that a last vigorous charge by the Marathas completed the Moghul defeat and that only 2,000 men escaped from the rout. “6,000 horses, 125 elephants and a vast spoil of jewels and treasure became the prize of the conquerors. But the gain in prestige was greater still. For the first time the Marathas had won a pitched battle against a disciplined Moghul army, led by a soldier trained in the school of Akbar and Shah- jahan”; (A History of the Maratha People by C. A. Kincaid and D. B. Parasnis, Vol. I 1918, p. 235). 120 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT ment, both he and Dilir Khan, the latter in charge of Gujarat, being constantly under pressure from the exultant Marathas. Bijapur, like its counterpart in the north, was on its last legs. The death of its penultimate ruler, Ali Adilshah, on November 24, 1672 gave his self-seeking nobles a great opportunity to advance their own interests, to the detriment of the kingdom. Sikandar, who succeeded Ali, was only four years old and became the plaything of a coterie of ambitious and faction-ridden sardars. 1 In the manoeuvre for power an Abyssinian general called Khawas Khan double-crossed his other accomplices and became the regent of the boy king. The State, the internal cohesion of which had already been seriously undermined by the implacable hostility between indigenous and imported Muslims and by the sullen resentment of the majority com- munity over its fallen condition, was no longer able to with- stand the attacks of the Marathas and the invaders from the north. Shivaji certainly did not let go the great opportunity of bene- fiting his new kingdom from Bijapur’s growing distractions. Panhala was among his favourite forts and was ideally situated for the protection of his southern province. Its restoration to the Bijapur Government in 1660 to avoid war on two fronts 1 was a hateful transaction to which he had never reconciled himself. His preoccupations with the imperialists had given him no opportunity to recover it. The time was now propitious for restoring Panhala to the galaxy of Maharashtra’s famous fortresses. He put Annaji Datto in command of a small army consisting of men well- 1 Aurangzeb’s pitiless war against Bijapur ended its separate exist- ence in 1686. In October of that year his army stormed and captured the capital, the Emperor entering the city in triumph. Sikandar was caught and detained in his former capital after being stripped of all the insignia and dignity of royalty. The Emperor granted him an annual allowance of one lakh of rupees. The deposed ruler did not long survive his humiliation and died some years later “not, as reported, without suspicion of having been poisoned by order of the Emperor”. (Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency—Bijapur, Vol. XXIII, 1884, pp. 435-36). THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 121 versed in the scaling of fort walls. Annaji requisitioned the services of a courageous and resourceful man called Kondaji Ravlekar whose plan of action for the capture of the fort was as ingenious as it was bold. He sent inside the fort a small group of Marathas in disguise, with instructions to win over the garrison secretly to Shivaji’s cause and took upon himself the most perilous and daring task of entering the stronghold by climbing its walls from the steep hill-side with the aid of rope- ladders. Sixty adventurous Marathas shared the glory in per- forming this memorable exploit. Kondaji’s feat at Panhala re- minds us of a similar brilliant episode in the eighteenth century when Colonel Popham of the East India Company covered him- self with glory by his escalade of the impregnable fortress of Gwalior, which unnerved even such a great soldier as Mahadji Scindia. Panhala is a big fort and on the day of its capture, March 6, 1673, it was garrisoned by a large force under the command of Babu Khan. To create the illusion that a large number of Marathas had entered it, Kondaji and his men produced a mighty commotion inside the fort by blowing trumpets and other noisy instruments and by shouting at the top of their voices, in which diversionary strategy they were heartily joined by the party that had entered the fort earlier in various dis- guises. Before the bewildered garrison could recover from the surprise, the main gates of the fort were thrown open so that the Maratha troops that had been waiting outside rushed into the fort, shouting the famous war-cry Har Har Mahadev, and put to the sword all men that opposed them. The keeper of Panhala, Babu Khan, was killed and his deputy put to flight A vast treasure fell into the hands of the victors. It was a great.day for Shivaji’and his cause. The ease with which the stronghold wass captured confirmed the widely held belief that the Marathas were indeed unique in this mode of warfare. Shivaji promptly visited Panhala to congratulate and reward his valiant comrades and to make permanent arrangements for its administration. Soon afterwards, Satara and Parli were wrested from the Bijapur Government. The fort of Parli was donated 122 SHTVAJX : THE POETKAXT OF A PATRIOT to Ramdas Swami and was renamed Sajjangad, meaning the Fort of the Pious. Despite its intestinal quarrels and the indolence and dissipa- tion of its members, the ruling class of Bijapur was stung to the quick when Panhala, the pride of the kingdom, fell into Shivaji’s hands. Fearing dismissal from his office if he failed to retrieve the situation, the regent ordered Bahlol Khan and three other experienced officers to proceed against the Mara- thas. Before the Bijapur generals could combine, Shivaji, with his customary alacrity, struck the first blow, thus totally up- setting the enemy’s carefully-prepared plan of action. He sent an army of 15,000 strong under the command of Prataprao Gujar, Anandrao and other competent captains, with direc- tions to attack Bahlol Khan before his troops had made much progress from the capital. The Marathas barred the advance of the Bijapur army at a place called Umrani, thirty-six miles west of the Adilshahi capital, and made a lightning attack on the enemy, at the same time cutting off his water sppply. The battle raged fiercely the whole day on April 15, 1673, when a large number of the Afghan troops were killed. Defeat stared the Bijapur commander in the face, but he was saved from a terrible fate by the intervention of darkness. The Marathas were never in doubt about the outcome of the issue, but when they woke up the following morning, they were astonished at the spectacle presented by the battlefield. The enemy had vacated it under cover of darkness, with the appro- val of the Maratha general, Prataprao. He was misguided by Bahlol Khan’s simulated entreaty for generous treatment. The Khan revealed his real intention by renewing the hostilities soon after his strategem had freed him from a dangerous situa- tion. Shivaji was furious when he heard of his commander-in- chief's ill-judged generosity and, besides severely rebuking him, directed that he should not return to his master unless he made amends by seeking out the Bijapur commander and defeating him. Stung to the quick by the unwonted severity of Shivaji, Prataprao went in pursuit of the Khan and, overtaking him at THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 123 the pass of Nesari near the Ghataprabha river, fell upon the Bijapur army, not with his entire force, but with only six or seven men! Even the most merciful Providence could not have condoned such wanton recklessness. The great general, the victor of many battles and a distinguished comrade of Shivaji, was cut to pieces, with all the men that had accompa- nied him (February 24, 1674). The disheartened Maratha army was, however, promptly rallied under the command of the fallen general's lieutenant, Anandrao Makaji. Shivaji was amazed and stricken with grief when he heard of Prataprao’s death and reproached himself for causing the tragedy by exhibiting hasty temper against such a mettlesome warrior. At a grand review of his troops, held at Chiplun on April 8, he appointed Hansaji Mohite to the vacant office of Commander-in-Chief, in- vesting him with the title of Hambirrao. Dilir Khan, the Rohilla general of the Moghul Government, was, like his master, incapable of seeing the writing on the wall. He still cherished the illusion that Maharashtra could be reduc- ed to submission with the same success and thoroughness as had distinguished Jai Singh’s campaigns in the Deccan. The proud Pathan was unwilling to descend from his dreamland and face the realities of the changed situation. He timed his in- vasion of the Konkan at the same time as the Bijapur generals launched an attack on Shivaji for the recovery of Panhala. Dilir Khan’s foolhardy adventure ended in his defeat and humi- liation. A contemporary letter by English merchants, written at the end of January 1674, presumably refers to this discomfi- ture of the Khan in the Konkan. “Dilir Khan,” it reads, “hath lately received a rout by Shivaji and lost 1,000 of his Pathans, and Shivaji about five hundred or six hundred men.” Not long after this episode, the Khan’s career in the Deccan came to an end. He was recalled by the Emperor and posted to the north-west to fight the insurgents of the Khyber region. Baha- dur Khan, who held a rapidly disintegrating viceroyalty, was left to fend for himself in the Deccan. Shivaji was now at the height of his glory. For years, countless legions and famous commanders had been sent in 124 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OP A PATRIOT vain by the Moghuls and by the Sultans of Bijapur to defeat him. His fame as an unconquerable hero and as a chivalrous foe had spread far and wide. His justness and benignity in the administration of his State and his devotion to sacred causes and to holy men had won him a reputation as an ideal ruler. To the valiant men in the rest of the country, struggling for emanci- pation from tyranny and misrule, he became, as we shall see in the appropriate place, a source of inspiration and an exem- plar. The time had, therefore, come that he should be appoint- ed as the sovereign of Maharashtra. Both by upbringing and by outlook, Shivaji believed in the substance of power and not in the gauds and glitter that sur- round it. He loved to live as his comrades from the hills and the Konkan did, without any pomp and luxury, simply, vitally and purposefully. Indeed, as the historian Orme, points out, “his life was simple even to parsimony; his manners void of insolence or ostentation”. But his own predilections were not of much importance when weighed against considerations of policy and propriety. On the issue of his coronation, he anti- cipated that unique Corsican, Napolean, who became the Emperor of France, assuming the attributes of sovereignty more out of policy than from his own volition. “What is a throne?” asked Napolean, and answered, “a piece of wood covered with satin!” And yet he chose this piece of little used but costly furniture to sustain the majesty of his power. Commenting on Napolean’s decision to crown himself, his biographer, Emil Ludwig, says: “Indeed, the glamour of the throne is stronger, and therefore he will take the establishment of his throne more seriously than he took the foundation of the Legion of Honour. It is an instrument of policy, a means for the management of men. In the real world, where no one can call familiar spirits to his aid, the private person, the poet or the philosopher, can raise his head heavenward without bearing the burden of a crown; but the statesman needs the insignia of power, for the f p°p T u J ace caimot beIieve in reality of power unless he wno wields power wears the insignia.” If a nineteenth century France, which had earlier boldly and THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 125 decisively proclaimed the paramountcy of liberty, fraternity and equality as the basis for the government of human affairs, thus causing mortal terror to the crowned heads of Europe, found it necessary to invest one of its citizens with the insignia of sovereignty after deliberately destroying the previous occupant of the throne, it was far more essential that the new realm of Maharashtra in India should have a king. Obviously, the ano- maly of a kingdom without a duly anointed ruler to govern could not be allowed to persist. Besides, in India, as in many other countries, the institution of kingship was nearly as old as her civilization. Most of the old treatises on statecraft insisted on government by king as the only system most conducive to the stability of society. The dread of anarchy had played a prominent part in investing the occupant of the throne with divine rights and honours. A manual on government insisted that the first choice of a man should be his king and then his wife, for “without a king in the world where would wife and property be?” It is true that the same law-givers laid down that, since the main purpose of government was to establish order, the king, as the head of the administration, should regard himself as the first social servant. But to the common people, who could not be expected to understand the abstract principles of political philosophy, the king became an object of profound respect and veneration, since' he was a pre-eminent symbol of stability and protection. Indeed, the concept of kingship had been so firmly woven into the very texture of the people’s beliefs that it ^often warped the judgment of even the most enlightened and sagaci- ous men. But no king had the right to obedience if he was a tyrant and an oppressor. It was in fact the duty of responsible citi- zens to ensure the removal of a bad ruler, but this right was seldom exercised and fell into disuse under Muslim rule. Government by a minority was an insufferable affront to the dignity, the honour and the interests of the majority, but, be- sides the political and military weakness of the Hindus, the spectacle of the ruler being a crowned personage played no 126 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT small part in their acquiscence in Muslim rule. It is for this reason that Mirza Raja Jai Singh, an outstanding Rajput of his time, did not regard it as a personal debasement when he sup- plicated himself before Aurangzeb as “the slave of the court”. Shivaji was both shrewd and sagacious in realizing the poli- tical and psychological value of the glittering and expensive headgear. The territory he had won was still small, but the value of his conquest was incalculable. It was necessary to carry on his great work, and continuity of succession, with the consent of the people, could best be ensured by his becoming a king. His successors would inherit a sovereignty which in capable hands could perhaps eventually extend to the whole country. Even if some of them proved ineffective, they could always be guided by competent men, once the line of succes- sion was firmly established. The sovereignty of the House of Shivaji thus offered the best guarantee of stability to the admi- nistration of Maharashtra. Besides, the crowning of Shivaji would strike the imagina- tion of the Hindus throughout the country. It would herald the coming of an age when they could confidently hope to re- gain their heritage, not for their exclusive enjoyment or gratification, but in order to share it in full measure with the rest of their countrymen. His coronation would mark the end of the dismal and defeatist belief that the Hindus could never be independent rulers of their land and thus pave the way for the establishment of more normal and harmonious relations be- tween the two great communities. At the same time, it would fill the enemies of the new State with despair that it was no longer possible to supplant it. Finally, Shivaji’s assumption of the insignia of royalty would thoroughly expose the hollowness of the pretensions of the Maratha mankaris or nobles, some of whom, like the Mores, disdained to regard him as their equal, despite the fact of their unqualified subordination to the Muslim rulers. All their attitude of arrogance and effrontery and all their supercilious behaviour towards him would end once he became both the de facto and de jure monarch of his realm. At least, the more THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 127 discerning ones among them would realize, though belatedly, that the kingdom of Shivaji was a source of inspiration and a rallying-point to the Hindus all over the country, symbolizing the revival of India’s great and glorious traditions of the past. After the Rayas of the Vijayanagar Empire, no Hindu ruler had chosen to ascend the throne with all the solemn cere- mony and circumstance that had marked the accession of the great sovereigns of old. To Shivaji belonged this distinction. The historic ceremony was held at Raigad, the new capi- tal of Shivaji. Originally called Rairi, it was conquered from Chandrarao More in 1656 when it was without any forti- fications. Situated on a lofty and an almost inaccessible plateau, Raigad, with its spaciousness and strategic position, was in every way qualified to become the capital of the new State — a distinction which had long been enjoyed by Rajgad near Poona. In his description of Raigad Dr. Fryer says: “It is fortified by nature rather than art, there being one avenue to it, which is guarded by two narrow gates, and fortified by a strong wall exceeding high and bastions thereto. On the mountain are many strong buildings, as the Raja’s court and the houses of other ministers.” It was in this place that Shivaji ascended the throne on Saturday, June 5, 1674. It was a great and glorious day for Maharashtra and, in the eyes of all discerning persons, for the whole of India. At Raigad elaborate preparations had been made for months to celebrate the . event with splendour and solemnity. Cool, clean and beautiful, the hill-city, with its stately palaces and mansions, glowed with festive gaiety. It played host to thousands of persons, consisting of men, women and children drawn from different parts of Maharashtra and from outside. Men known for their learning and piety mustered strong to bless the new monarch. The great Ramdas Swami, that uncompromising apostle of Hindu revival, was present to wit- ness the realization of his dream for the establishment of righteousness in this ancient land. The Queen-Mother, Jijabai, was overwhelmed with joy at the crowning of her beloved 128 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT son. Dignitaries from various parts of the country had assem- bled in the capital to witness a spectacle, the like of which had not been seen for centuries. Among the guests was Henry Oxenden, a relative of the chief of the East India Com- pany’s factory at Surat, who has left behind a vivid eye- witness account of the coronation ceremony. Shivaji exercised great judgment in the choice of the offi- ciating priest. Visweshwar or Gaga Bhat of Banaras, whose ancestors originally belonged to Paithan in Maharashtra, was a distinguished scholar and had made a profound study of the Vedas and other sacred texts of the Hindus. He effective- ly silenced all orthodox opposition to Shivaji’s enthronement by quoting chapter and verse from ancient authorities in its support. The assumption that only the so-called Kshatriyas were entitled to anointment as sovereigns was as absurd as insistence on the primacy of caste. Long before the birth of Shivaji it had been conclusively proved by history that not all the great monarchs of ancient or mediaeval India belonged to the Kshatriya or Rajput race. The Sungas and Kanvas were Brahmins, as were many other dynasties. We have the testi- mony of Hiuen Tsang that the great Harsha was a Vaishya, while the Nandas, and perhaps even the Mauryas, sprang from castes other than the first three. Indeed, the rational aphor- ism “whoever bears rule is a Kshatriya” was applied and, after the lapse of some generations, royal families from the so-called non-dvrija castes were quietly assimilated into the Kshatriya or warrior class. Armed with such incontrovertible facts, the scholarly priest from Banaras duly installed Shivaji on the throne with all the ceremonial appropriate to the occasion. Gaga Bhat enjoyed unrivalled prestige as “the greatest Sanskrit theologian and controvertialist then alive, a master of the four Vedas, the six philosophies, and all the scriptures of the Hindus” and was in fact acclaimed as the most learned man of the age. With such an outstanding authority presiding over the Raigad ceremonies, Shivaji’s assumption of the insignia of royalty was assured of wide acceptance. THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 128 Enormous sums of money were spent during the festivities that began many weeks before the main event. Thousands of guests, Brahmins and others, were fed daily with sumptuous fare. Gifts were given freely to learned and holy men and to thousands of others. Shivaji was weighed in gold, totalling 16,000 hons or one hundred and forty pounds, and the entire money was given away in charity. The throne, variously described as “magnificent” and “rich and stately”, cost the exchequer fourteen lakhs of rupees. Estimates of the total expenditure differ, but according to one calculation, as much as fifty lakhs of rupees was spent on the occasion. Orthodoxy forced on Shivaji a second coronation, though on a minor scale, the date of the superfluous ceremony being September 24, 1674. The enthronement of her son marked the fulfilment of the most cherished ambition of Jijabai, who died on June 18, 1674, thirteen days after his coronation, full of happiness at her great good fortune. 1 Shivaji was stricken with grief at the death of his mother and the fact of her advanced age did not mitigate the anguish of his bereavement. Jijabai was not an ordinary mother; she was his guardian angel, a wise counsellor and an unfailing source of inspiration. This remarkable lady, who had all the grace and temper of a lioness, brooked insult from none, whether the offender was her own father or husband. And yet her devotion to her family was profound and un- shakable. Jijabai was indeed a woman who was many steps ahead of her times. She had the vision, the patriotism and the per- tinacity in training her son for the exalted mission of liberat- ing the country from misgovemment and thus won the ad- miration of posterity as the woman who influenced the course of history. She was an emancipated woman and her progres- sive outlook played no small part in reclaiming some of the 1 Shahaji, her husband, had died earlier, on January 23, 1664 at Basavapattana in Mysore State. 130 SHIVAJX: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT prominent Maratha converts to Hinduism. 1 By her master- ful personality and zeal for noble causes, she became a model of Maratha womanhood. Her example in courage and forti- tude was followed in her own family by the widow of her grandson, the celebrated Tarabai, who, after the death of Raja- ram, took up the cause of Maratha independence against the Moghul armies, with astonishing tenacity and resourcefulness. In the death of his mother, Shivaji lost the mainstay of his life. While die Marathas were preoccupied with the festivities connected with the coronation, the Moghul Viceroy, Bahadur Khan, attempted to encroach upon their territories in the hope that his aggressions would go unnoticed. The immin- ence of the monsoon had further persuaded him that the Marathas would not be able to adopt any prompt retaliatory measures. In this, as in many other things when dealing with his Deccan enemies, he was thoroughly mistaken. Shivaji had not sheathed his sword by merely putting the crown on his head. The throne was for him not a soft cushion of indul- gence but a stem seat of duty. Once he was free from the ceremonies at Raigad, he renewed the campaign against the Moghuls. At the height of the monsoon he made, in the middle of July 1674, a feigned attack on the Moghul camp Sat Pedgaon on the banks of the river Bhima and lured away Bahadur Khan some distance from his base. His ill-defended cantonment was promptly attacked by another Maratha force, seven thousand strong, and the entire treasure and equipment of the enemy were captured. The victorious Marathas carried 1 Netaji Palkar, who had been converted to Islam and remained a Muslim for many years, was readily taken back into the Hindu fold after the performance of a purificatory rite on June 19, 1676. Shivaji, who re-admitted him to his confidence, would perhaps not have countenanced such a significant social reform if he had not learnt to appreciate and admire his mother’s catholic outlook. Many years earlier, Bajaji Naik Nimbalkar of Phaltan, who had been forced to embrace Islam, was reclaimed for his ancestral re- ligion at the instance of Shivaji and his mother. (New History of the Marathas, by G. S. Sardesai, Vol. I, 1957, p. 131) THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT 131 away one crore of rupees, besides two hundred excellent horses, collected specially for the imperial stable at Delhi. The discomfiture of the ill-starred Moghul commander did not, however, end there. Shivaji knew the Khan’s frame of mind. In order to save his face, he would grasp any oppor- tunity to come to terms with his adversary so long as they did not smack of abject surrender on his part. The Maratha king deliberately threw out peace feelers and entered into long drawn out negotiations with the Khan who once again fell to the bait. He succeeded in securing the Emperor's farman endorsing the so-called peace terms when Shivaji had no inten- tion whatsoever of making any concessions to the enemy. When it was no longer necessary to continue the futile nego- tiations, he dismissed the Moghul envoys by reminding them that the very ineffectiveness of their master ruled out the possibility of any accommodating gesture from the Marathas. The unfortunate Bahadur Khan made many abortive attempts to forge a military alliance with Bijapur for chastising their common enemy, but the vitality of that state was fast ebbing away. In November 1675 the regent, Khawas Khan, was dislodged from his position by Bahlol Khan, who was far too pre-occupied with his own distractions to be able to take any effective action against the Marathas. Aurangzeb, whose hatred for Bijapur was nearly as great as his hostility to the Marathas, ordered his viceroy to attack the tottering Adil- shahi State. On May 31, 1676 Bahadur Khan launched a vigorous offensive against Bijapur — an act of aggression which forced the new regent to implore Shivaji’s assistance against the imperialists. That was precisely what Shivaji had been waiting for. He would certainly help Bijapur — but at a price. The negotia- tions between the two states were conducted through the good offices of the Golkonda minister, Madanna. The treaty pro- vided for the payment of an annual subsidy of one lakh hons to the Maratha Government by Bijapur in return for military assistance against the imperialists. The agreement also stipulated that the Adilshahi Government should pay an addi- 132 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT tional sum of three lakhs of rupees to the Maratha King at the time of its signature. The fact that Bijapur’s “subsidiary alliance” with Shivaji did not long survive the vicissitudes of its politics does not alter the significance of the compact. Both in its historical perspective and in the eyes of his contemporaries, Shivaji’s success in exacting a tribute from the proud masters of his father gave a true indication of his greatness. The rupture that soon took place in the relations between the two states caused him no regret. His mind was now set on a great adventure and he refused to be deflected from his new goal by the imbecilities or the caprices of the Bij'apur Government. He had undertaken the invasion of the South, described as the “greatest expedition of his life”. REFERENCES Sarkar, Sir Jadunath, Shivaji And His Times, M. C. Sarkar & Co., 1948. Sardesai, G.

CHAPTER 7 THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS (i) SURAT In a detailed analysis of the factors that favoured the esta- blishment of British dominion in India, The Oxford History of India gives great prominence to the possession of enormous re- sources by the East India Company. The British had certainly many other advantages over their Indian adversaries. They enjoyed an unchallenged naval supremacy which gave them an unrestricted access to the Indian shores; their armies were dis- ciplined, better equipped and competently led; and their policy- makers and empire-builders in India were gifted not only with a wide-ranging vision, but also with a high sense of purpose. Even so, great as these assets were, they would not have been of much avail in winning an empire for the British in India unless they enjoyed the decisive advantage that accrues from the ownership of large and assured sources of income. The armies of the Company Sarkar did not consist of super- men and yet the legend of their invincibility gained the widest currency in the country. A palpable myth was accepted as a fact, essentially because the Company Government had an almost unlimited capacity to replace losses and to pay and maintain troops regularly. None of the Indian powers that were ranged against it was capable of such a financial feat. The revenues of even the Great Moghuls were not large enough to match the resources of the British in India. Reference has already been made to the grave financial embarrassment of Aurangzeb which compelled him to adopt a policy of retrench- ment and retraction in the Deccan. The East India Company was the beneficiary of its country’s expanding economy based on a developing trade. Later, England attained phenomenal pros- perity as she began to realize the abounding fruits of the in- dustrial revolution. It is a fact of great historical significance 134 SHIVAJl: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT that, while the annual revenues of Akbar during whose reign the Moghul Empire rose to the pinnacle of its glory, amounted to about 17£ million pounds, the realizations of the East India Company in 1792 from a much smaller and war-ravaged terri- tory were well over 8 million pounds a year. The Oxford His- tory clinches the issue when it says: “Britain, for all her paucity of numbers, was in fact stronger in resources than any one Indian power and equal to all of them put together. When it is remembered that the Indian powers never were united, the success of the British ceases to seem either extraordinary or un- accountable.” These preliminary observations are necessary in order to help us appreciate the raison d’etre of Shivaji’s ceaseless quest for money without which the success of. his great undertaking could not have been assured. As we saw in an earlier chapter, he set out on his mission with no worthwhile means at his dis- posal. In fact, the revenues from the impoverished and devas- tated Poona district, his mainstay for many years, amounted to the meagre sum of 40,000 hons a year. His raids into the enemy territories were thus prompted by the compelling neces- sity of acquiring sufficient means for sustaining and strengthen- ing his war of independence. His first major incursion into the Moghul dominion with this well-defined object was made in January 1664 when the city of Surat was sacked. Surat was, as it still is, a large, populous and prosperous city in Gujarat. It was the premier emporium of the East and a prized possession of the Moghuls. In 1608, when the English began to trade with that city, it was of “considerable size, with many good houses belonging to merchants”. The fortunes of Surat bore a striking resemblance to the rise and fall of the Moghul dynasty. It enjoyed uninterrupted prosperity for about eighty-five years during the reigns of Emperors Akbar, Jehangir and Shah Jahan, winning praise as a bright jewel in the diadem of the Moghuls. Noted for the industry and enterprise of its population, it rode on the crest of prosperity, gathering im- mense wealth within its precincts through its wide-ranging commercial interests. THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 135 It was a beautiful city, with extensive gardens and orchards spreading for miles around it, yielding a rich harvest of flower and fruit. The gardens, it has been recorded, were “continual- ly refreshed with curious springs and fountains of fresh water”, evidently drawn from the river Tapti. Apart from its pre- eminence as a port of international importance, Surat had ac- quired added importance as the “gateway” to the Muslim holy places in Arabia. Indeed, it was a city where every prospect pleased, but only man was vile, that man being not the com- mon man. Its decline set in with the commencement of the disastrous rule of Aurangzeb whose bigotry and misgovemment hastened the general impoverishment of the country. Stagna- tion gradually gained ascendancy over its commercial and civic life, eventually relegating its glory to the pages of history. At the time of Shivaji’s raid Surat presented the spectacle of a city bristling with striking contrasts. The wealthy members of the business community, some of whom were reputed to be among the richest in the world, lived in large and well-appoint- ed mansions near the river, maintaining a rigid social and phy- sical distance from the noise, the squalor and the wretchedness of the town where the majority of the population lived, labour- ed and died. The fort of Surat was strongly built and was situated on the southern bank of the river, twelve miles from the sea. The city, which lay close to the fort, had no natural or artificial fortifications to assist in the defence of its imihense wealth. The city and the fort were' under the control of two separate and mutually exclusive authorities. It was a measure of the growing feebleness of the Moghul Government that, although Surat was regarded as a prized pos- session, little care was exercised in the choice of officers for governing it. At the time of Shivaji’s invasion, the city was under the governorship of an irresponsible and cowardly man called Inayat Khan. His capacity for self-aggrandizement was unlimited. He regularly drew from the imperial treasury the money sanctioned for maintaining an armed force of five hun- dred men, but appropriated the entire or the bulk of the 136 SmVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT amount for his own use! The Government was too remote, too corrupt and too disorganized to chastise such dishonesty. Presumably because of its immense, undefended wealth, the curse of Gain sat heavily upon the city. The corruption, the venality and the inefficiency of the Government put a premium on lawlessness. The irreconcilable rivalry among the European traders, having commercial interests in the city, added to its civic distractions. The special trading facilities received by the English from Emperor Jehangir in 1612 had deeply offended the Portuguese and their other European rivals. “In 1630,” says a writer, “the English and Portuguese fleets fought a res- pectable battle in that roadstead (namely, Surat), without pre- judice to international relations at home.” Indeed, the Euro- pean settlers in Surat were not obsessed with excessive scruples when it came to the question of exploiting the helplessness of the city. Nothing that happened in it, however, served as an eye-opener either to the Moghul Government or to the opulent business community, neither of whom took adequate steps for its defence. Shivaji knew these facts intimately. His secret agents, by whom he was served with admirable thoroughness and fidelity, had brought him detailed and accurate information about Surat and its exposed condition. He had no intention of annexing the city or of storming the stronghold. Nor did he propose to attack the European factors in the city, for, apart from other reasons, their warehouses could not obviously yield much port- able wealth. He bore no ill-will towards them and certainly did not despise their friendship. Besides, at that early period, there was no reason for him to apprehend any serious compe- tition from them for political power in the country. The sack of Surat was thus intended by him primarily to gain larger re- sources for the war of independence and secondarily to raise an inferno in the breast of Aurangzeb by staging such a daring defiance of his authority. From the intelligence that was brought to him Shivaji was convinced that he would be able to realize the maximum re- ward if he surprised Surat by suddenly appearing before it THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 137 Towards this end he made careful preparations with the utmost secrecy. He chose 4,000 men and mounting them on fleet-footed horses started on the momentous expedition from Nasik on January 1, 1664. His cavalry sped past Mahuli, Kohaj, Jawahar and Ramnagar and the entire army of invasion reached Gandevi, 28 miles from Surat, on the fifth day of the month. The surprise was complete and the news of Shivaji’s proximity to the city caused much consternation to its inha- bitants. On the same night he sent word to the Governor, Inayat Khan, asking that he should call on him with three in- fluential merchants of Surat to settle the amount of the ransom to be paid to him. Taking into account his need and the nobility of the cause he had set out to defend, Shivaji’s demand on the city was quite moderate and reasonable. He asked that a sum of fifty lakhs of rupees should be paid to him and promised to hurt none if the stipulated levy was delivered promptly. Surat teemed with affluent men some of whom were incredibly wealthy. Had they cared to make a collective contribution, the resulting sacrifice would certainly not have been heavy. The city was unfortunately bereft of men capable of giving right advice and the Governor, who should have set an example in statesmanship, happened to be cowardly and treacherous. Having received no response to his summons to the city’s representatives, Shivaji marched towards its vicinity on the morning of January 6, pitching his tent in a garden close to the eastern gate. By then the Governor had fled to the nearby fort, leaving the frightened inhabitants of Surat leader- less. With a drawn sword in hand, Shivaji entered the city on January 6, being compelled by the ill-judged non-co-operation of its leading men to take from its inhabitants by the only means now open to him what he had offered to accept as a voluntary contribution from them. His instructions to his men were strict—they should on no account resort to avoidable violence. Cosme da Guarda, a contemporary of Shivaji, who lived at Marmagoa and wrote about the Maratha King in 1695, 138 SH1VAJI ; THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT records that nobody’s life was in peril because “it was the strict order of Shivaji that unless resistance was offered no one should be killed” and adds that since none resisted, none perished. The city, however, suffered terribly mostly on account of the foolish behaviour of the commandant of the fort, who believed that the Marathas could be scared away by indiscriminately opening artillery fire on the crowded town. Here is a contem- porary account of the consequences of the garrison’s thought- less and precipitate action, given by Barthelemy Carre, a Frenchman, who arrived in Surat in 1668: “The two governors could not but be pensive in their despair, their only care being how to hide themselves and the more valuable things they possessed. They were swayed by their interest and avarice which made them override the dictates of duty. At last the governor of the castle opened artillery fire upon the town. He shot at random and if it was to a certain extent fraught with danger to Shivaji’s soldiers, it rendered the destruction of the people of Surat most certain. The cannon demolished their houses and set them ablaze at the same time that the enemy despoiled them of their furniture and emptied their stores." The Marathas did not, of course, carry away unwieldy and cheaper goods. The thoughtless firing from the fort took a heavy toll of life and property as most of the streets of Surat were narrow and crowded and as the majority of the houses were built of inflammable material. The sack of the city lasted for four days. Except for the misery and suffering which such proceedings inevitably inflict- ed upon the inhabitants, Shivaji and his men were not guilty of excessive cruelty or vandalism. His innate nobility and ge- nuine feeling for his fellow-men were too strong to give place to unbridled oppression or avarice. As Thevenot, the French- man who visited Surat exactly two years after its sack, records, Shivaji showed the utmost consideration to the Christian popu- lation and willingly granted it immunity from harm at the soli- citation of Father Ambrose for whom he bore the greatest respect. Bernier, another impartial contemporary chronicler, THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 139 corroborates this tribute to the Maratha King's catholicity of outlook. “The Frankish padries,” Shivaji is recorded to have declared, “are good men and shall not be molested.” Indeed, the general attitude of Shivaji towards the Europeans in India was one of friendliness so long as they did not pre- sume to interfere in his affairs. He himself set an example in non-interference by maintaining an attitude of benevolent neu- trality in their chronic rivalries. It is not, therefore, surpris- ing that during his raid on Surat he did not, as Cosme da Guarda has observed, “look at the English and the Dutch fac- tories”. Some rather fantastic fables have been adroitly passed off as facts of history by extolling the so-called heroic stand supposed to have been taken by the English factors against the Maratha troops. Nothing can be more absurd than the suggestion that Shivaji was afraid of attacking the East India Company’s fac- tories at Surat out of a wholesome respect for their prowess. As contemporary evidence so decisively proves, he was not in- terested in any such proceedings for the* simple reason that the European warehouses were not and could not be the reposito- ries of much wealth. It was impossible for a man who had drawn his sword against the Moghuls to be frightened by the bellicosity of a handful of foreign traders who had still not ven- tured to abandon their stores in favour of the sceptre. Of the Maratha King’s warlike abilities, the Surat factors themselves wrote: “Shivaji has forced most generals who with their armies had entered into his country to retreat with shame.” The sack of Surat proceeded leisurely and thoroughly. The fugitive commandants took no military measures to stop it. On the second day of the raid, however, Inayat Khan decided on the dastardly plan of assassinating Shivaji. He sent a young man to the Maratha King under the pretext of negotiating a settlement. The very nature of the terms offered was conclu- sive evidence of the Governor’s insincerity and of his perfidious intentions. Shivaji was naturally put out when the impossible stipulations were read out to him. He scornfully asked the Governor’s envoy why his master had sought the safety of the 140 SHIVAJl: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT fort like a woman and whether he expected the Maratha King to become guilty of similar cowardice by accepting his absurd offer. At this, the desperado rushed at Shivaji with a drawn dagger, aiming the lethal weapon at his breast. Providentially, and with great presence of mind, a Maratha guard who was in attendance, cut off the hancl of the would-be assassin in time and later smashed his skull with another blow. But the man had rushed at Shivaji with such impetuosity that it was impos- sible to prevent his bleeding body from falling upon his in- tended victim. Besides being thrown out of his seat, Shivaji found his clothes soaked with the blood of the dying hireling. Seeing blood on Shivaji’s dress, all but those that were clos- est to him when the grim drama was being enacted believed that he had fallen a victim to the assassin’s dagger. His follow- ers became furious and decided on a general massacre, but they were promptly stopped by their master, with the assurance that he was not at all hurt. With a strange lack of consistency and by a complete disregard for his record as a man of great kindliness and generosity, Shivaji has been accused of having ordered the killing of four persons and the maiming of twenty- four others by chopping off their hands as an act of reprisal. In the Surat episode, this is one more instance of a canard being presented as a sober fact. The story of Shivaji’s alleged pitilessness has been picked up from the observations of an aggrieved foreigner, known for his dubious character. Anthony Smith, an English factor, fell into the hands of the Marathas and was detained in their camp for three days. This man, who was persona non grata with his own countrymen and the cata- logue of whose misdemeanours was considered too long and too tedious to be recorded in full by his colleagues, was probably the sole contemporary who claimed to have witnessed Shivaji’s alleged excesses at Surat. There is, however, no decisive supporting evidence of the time to substantiate Smith’s charge. Bernier, Manucci, Theve- not and Carre, to mention only a few names, were capable and observant chroniclers, but none of them has referred to the grim tragedy. Nor did the Dutch factors of Surat notice the THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 141 butchery which, if it had ever taken place, would not have escaped their attention or comment. Indeed, like the unscru- pulous Holwell, who contributed to the Indian history the “Black Hole tragedy” of Calcutta from his fertile but warped imagination, Smith is likely to have invented the myth about the cutting off of heads and hands at Surat, in resentment for his own imprisonment in the Maratha camp. Apart from the tenability or otherwise of the allegation, it would be the height of absurdity to impugn the character or the greatness of a man solely on the basis of isolated happen- ings of extremely doubtful authenticity. Nor would it be fair or correct to ignore the fact that war is essentially wicked, how- ever humane some of its practitioners may be. This has been so throughout history. There is thus manifest injustice in seeking to moralize on the so-called undesirable doings of Shivaji, real or imaginary, in Surat or elsewhere. Shivaji’s takings from Surat were large and are variously esti- mated at one crore to two crores of rupees. He employed the new resources to the best advantage. He strengthened the fortifications of Raigad, beautified it and otherwise made it worthy as the new capital of his realm. The fortress of Sindhudurg at Malwan was built with the same money for augmenting his naval strength. The Governor and his shiver- ing retinue returned to the town after the withdrawal of the Marathas, to be greeted with derision by an angry populace which showered dirt on them as a proper reward for their cowardice and dereliction of duty. The valiant son of the Governor wreaked his revenge upon his tormentors by shoot- ing “a poor innocent Hindu trader dead”! Six years after the first raid, Shivaji returned to Surat and sacked it for the second time (October 3, 1670). The valour of the English, which was claimed to have saved the European factories during the raid of 1664, was conspicuous by its absence on this occasion. Foreseeing the coming danger, they took “a convenient time” to empty all their warehouses and sent down the goods to Swally for safety. The President, Gerald Aungier, and his Councillors shook the dust of Surat off their feet and 142 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT sailed deep into the sea so that neither their lives nor their limbs would be in jeopardy! So great was the alarm felt by them at the coming of the Marathas that “they removed their trea- sure from the shore to one of their ships and the next day (October 4) loaded all their broadcloth, quicksilver, currall (coral?) etc. on board ship, ‘to secure them against any attempts of Shivaji’ The panic of the English was wholly unjustified, because, when their representatives waited upon Shivaji, he “received them in a very kind manner, telling them that the English and he were good friends, and putting his hand into their hands he told them that he would do the English no wrong”. The second raid on Surat yielded Shivaji valuables worth sixty-six lakhs of rupees. Before leaving for Maharahstra, he called upon the administrators of the city to pay him an annual tribute of twelve lakhs of rupees in order to secure immunity from further invasions. As soon as he turned his back on the city, it was taken over by a mob of destitute persons who thoroughly pillaged it. In this rewarding, if dishonest, pastime lie English sailors took their full share under the leadership of Streynsham Master. If all that was claimed on behalf of the English as the stout-hearted defenders of Surat and its civic life and property could be true, the unhappy Governor might well have exclaimed over the behaviour of Master and his men: Et tu Brute! Notwithstanding the Maratha incursions, Surat remained an important and prosperous city. It is true that it did not retain its pristine affluence as the greatest emporium of the East, but its decline was essentially due to a significant diversion of the country’s trade to new commercial centres. The potential value of the little known island of Bombay as India’s commer- cial and industrial capital was discerned by far-seeing English- men when it came into their possession. They spared no efforts in raising it to such pre-eminence. Unlike the Portu- guese, they adopted a tolerant attitude towards the religion of the Indians and gave them ample facilities to settle down on the island and to start new commercial and industrial enter- THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 143 prises. The excellent natural harbour gave Bombay a well- deserved distinction as the gateway of India and the vast hin- terland adjoining it was of inestimable value in developing an obscure and inhospitable island into the urbs prima in Indis. It was, therefore, the growth of Bombay that halted the pro- gress of Surat. But the fact that it continued to be a leading city long after the Maratha expeditions cannot be doubted. It was indeed impossible to deprive it of the great historical traditions with which its name was associated as the first per- manent settlement of the English Company on the mainland of India. Besides, it remained the chief town of the Company down to 1687. Its importance had not greatly diminished even in 1799 when its administration was transferred to the direct jurisdiction of the Company Government. Surat at that time was known as “the greatest centre of maritime commerce in India, with all the signs of vast trading operations—great wealth, large population and exceptional jurisdictions”. The sacrifices made by Surat for Shivaji did not go in vain. Whatever might have been its trials and tribulations at the time they were made, they were undoubtedly fruitful in strengthening the cause of independence. A popular saying in Hindi, acclaiming Shivaji as an indomitable defender of the faith and the culture of the land, fully testifies to the value of such sacrifices.

The greatness of this land of shrines and scholarship had suffered a severe setback following Muslim invasion from the north which began in the thirteenth century, culminating in the destruction of the ancient kingdoms of the Yadavas, the Hoysalas and the Pandyas. As pointed out in an earlier chapter, it was indeed a fitting retribution to the suicidal rulers of the Deccan and the south that the des- truction of their greatness and glory was accomplished by a converted Hindu eunuch, Malik Kafur, who carried his victo- rious arms as far as Rameshvaram, destroying or desecrating some of the greatest temples on his march. Such acts of van- dalism and spoliation continued unabated till the rise and ex- pansion of the Vijayanagar Empire which, for more than two centuries, stood as an impregnable bastion against the on- slaughts of bigotry and idol-smashing frenzy. “The great commentary,” writes Professor K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, “on the Vedas composed by a syndicate of scholars with Sayana at their head, and the impressive additions made to the structure of almost all important temples in the country by the rulers of Vijayanagar, form the most typical monuments of the work of the great Hindu empire.” All the grim conditions of lawlessness and anarchy that had accompanied the Muslim conquest reasserted themselves soon after the dissolution of the great Empire. The efforts of the discomfited members of the royal family to repel the invaders and to re-establish stable conditions in the south were defeated y the. treachery and the imbecility of their own subordinate chieftains. The attitude of the Hindus in other parts of the country was no less suicidal. They actively assisted the Deccan THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 145 Sultanates in overrunning the south and in despoiling it of its great riches. The valiant efforts of Sriranga Raya to stop Muslim expansion were rendered abortive, not only on account of the inadequacy of the means at his disposal, but also because of the disruptive activities of his own nobles and their intrigues with the enemy. The fallen condition of the Hindus in general is best illustrated by the fact that the rich temple of Narasimha at Ahobalam was plundered in 1579 by a chieftain from Maha- rashtra in the service of Golkonda, who rendered further dis- service to his country and religion by ravaging the territories of his conquest. Thus, South India became a happy hunting-ground for the Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda, whose pomp and splendour were derived in no small measure from the riches taken from an industrious but disunited people. Watered by large and peren- nial rivers, the lands of the Tamilnad, miscalled Kamatak or Carnatic by certain early historians, were fertile and yielded abundant crops. Frugal, hard-working and enterprising, the inhabitants of the south produced abounding wealth which they liberally gave away to enrich their numerous temples. But none of these estimable qualities conduced to the promotion of their peace and happiness since they, like the rest of their country- men, were totally destitute of the ability to defend their pros- perity. The southern peninsula had degenerated into a congeries of petty principalities, governed by ambitious Poliagars and Naiks, many of whom were the descendants of the feudatories of the dismembered Vijayanagar Empire. All of them shared the pas- sion of seeking to destroy one another in the name of bringing the south under a single sovereignty. The beneficiaries of such intestinal quarrels were the Muslims, who, by taking and chang- ing sides with the warring chiefs, eventually succeeded in plant- ing their own hegemony in the region. As a Jesuit missionary wrote from Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) in 1659: “The old kings of this country appear by their jealousies and imprudent action to invite the conquest of entire India by the Muslims." The Muslim Governors that held sway over the south under 146 SHTVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT the overlordship of the kings of Bijapur and Golkonda were no less self-seeking and disunited. Their personal ambitions grew in proportion to the weakening of the central authority, which gave rise to chronic feuds amongst themselves. It was only the docility and the fatalistic resignation of the Hindu multi- tudes that had made the continuance of the Muslim rule pos- sible. The vaulting ambitions of Sher Khan Lodi, the Afghan Governor of the Bijapur Government, who held charge of large regions in the south, with Valigandapuram as his capital, furnish a glaring example of how self-aggrandizement had become a notable feature of the political life of South India at the time of Shivaji’s invasion. Taking the military assistance of the French at Pondicherry, he waged a relentless war against Nasir Muhammad, another Bijapur Governor, whose jurisdiction ex- tended upto the French settlement, with Jinji as the seat of his government. The political goal of Sher Khan is best described in Sarkar’s words: “Sher Khan was bent on annexing the terri- tory of Jinji with the armed help of the French traders of Pon- dicherry. Nor was this the limit of his dream. He would, after thus removing his only rival in these parts and doubling his strength, hire more French soldiers, despoil the Hindu Nayaks beyond the Kaveri of their fabulous riches, and employ these resources in conquering the kingdom of Golkonda for himself!” The States of Bijapur and Golkonda had advanced far on their journey towards extinction and were, therefore, utterly incapable of reducing their recalcitrant subordinates in the south to submission and obedience. The time was thus most propitious for the Hindu chiefs to unite and overthrow the feeble government of the Muslims in the south, but their own petty quarrels and ambitions prevent- ed them from adopting any such patriotic course of action. However disunited amongst themselves, the Muslim rulers conitnued to play with impunity the role of a pike in a pond of small fish. The rivalries between the Naiks of Madura and Tanjore were bitter and irreconcilable. Vyankoji or Ekoji Bhosle, the step-brother of Shivaji, who had secured a firm foothold in the south by inheriting the jagirs of his father in THE HISTORIC EXPEDITION’S 147 Mysore and elsewhere, took full advantage of the antagonism between the two Naiks and eventually succeeded in winning the gadi of Tanjore for himself in January 1676. Two months later, in March, he crowned himself and began to govern his territories in a state of semi-independent regality. Though of a vacillating disposition, Ekoji, as we shall see presently, was a competent man. Being a product of the times in which he lived, he was, however, not gifted with the vision or the patriot- ism of his illustrious brother. The enforced idleness of Shivaji during the earlier months of 1676, occasioned by his prolonged illness, gave him ample time to reflect on the state of the country. In the brief period since he had set out on his career of conquest and liberation, his achievements had undoubtedly been both massive and to- wering. But much still remained to be done if justice and righteousness were to be established over the length and breadth of the land. He had passed the peak of his youthful vigour and how long he would be spared to guide the noble cause, none could predict. It was, therefore, the path of pru- dence to consolidate the present gains and to prepare the ground for further expansion. There should be a second line of defence in the event of the Government of Maharashtra fall- ing into feeble hands after him. The peace with the Moghuls and Bijapur was a mere make-believe and, from the point of view of the imperialists, it was dictated entirely by considera- tions of political and military prudence. Shivaji’s gaze was thus turned towards the south, the instabi- lity and the vast resources of which offered him opportunities for a relatively easy and profitable conquest. Some of the southern strongholds, such as Jinji and Vellore, were perhaps comparable with Sinhgad and Purandar in their natural strength and their possession by the Marathas would indubit- ably advance the national cause, especially in periods of diffi- culty and danger. In addition, the teeming wealth of the south could best be converted into sinews of war of which the Mara- thas were in dire need. Shivaji's military and political pre- science as well as the need for him to acquire more resources 148 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT thus decided him to embark on his historic expedition to the south. Ekoji’s reluctance to share his patrimony with his bro- ther gave him one more reason for launching the invasion. Shivaji’s project received the enthusiastic support of two eminent Brahmins, Raghunathpant Hanumante, a trusted and accomplished servant of Maharashtra, and Madanna or Madan- pant, the Prime Minister of the Shah of Golkonda. Like Dadaji Kond Dev, the father of Raghunathpant, Naro Trimal Hanu- mante, was a distinguished and loyal comrade of Shahaji whom he had accompanied to the south. After his death, his two sons were detailed for service under the Bhosles, Janardanpant electing to assist Shivaji. Raghunathpant was left in the south to act as guide, philosopher and friend to Ekoji. The Pant was an accomplished scholar, besides being endowed with a brilliant mind. He was gifted with a wide-ranging vision and, with the clarity of a statesman, saw how immense was the scope for the reassertion of Hindu dominion in the south. It is possible that a man of Raghunathpant’s patriotic fer- vour could not easily reconcile himself to Ekoji’s inflexible ad- herence to the Bijapur Government. Perhaps, the large mea- sure of autonomy which Ekoji enjoyed made the yoke of Mus- lim paramountcy bearable to him, but his mettlesome minister desired an entirely different political disposition. In any case, the master and the servant could not see eye to eye on many vital issues and they prudently parted company. The precise reasons for the rupture in their relations have not been record- ed, but there is no doubt that a certain incompatibility of tem- perament prevented the two from coming together closer. Shivaji, however, held the Pant in the highest esteem for his commanding abilities as a diplomat. In fact, as Sardesai rightly remarks, full credit should be given to the talented Hanumante family for the achievements of Shahaji and Ekoji in the south. In a heart-warming letter, written at a later date to Raghunathpant, Shivaji declared: “I have endeavoured to train a body of men as my co-workers in the national cause, but your position is unique. You have served my father and, like him, have acquired the right to guide me whenever I can- THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 149 not see my way. Indeed, I esteem you as highly as I respected my father. Your services to the noble cause entitle you to that exalted status.” Raghunathpant first proceeded from Tanjore to Bijapur in order to make a close personal study of both its strength and weakness. He saw that the Adilshahi dynasty was on its last legs, its doom being hastened by the civil war that was current- ly raging between the Afghan and the Deccani Muslims. He then went to Bhagnagar or Hyderabad to confer with Madan- pant, the Prime Minister of Golkonda State, on the plan for the revival of Hindu supremacy in the south. Madanpant was a shrewd and competent man who was deeply devoted to his religion, but his ardent adhesion to his own faith did not breed any intolerance in him. In fact, he desired that the fol- lowers of all religions in the country should have untrammelled freedom to worship God according to their own lights. Such a goal, he was convinced, could be realized only by recovering the sovereignty the Hindus had lost. Madanpant’s views coincided completely with those of both Shivaji and Raghunathpant. The latter had little difficulty in convincing the Minister that the king of Maharashtra alone could accomplish this supreme task. Their plan of action was simple; Shivaji should be invited to undertake a military expe- dition to the south and establish a firm government there after eliminating the warring rulers and their petty, intervening prin- cipalities. The resources of Golkonda and the co-operation of its ruler should be secured towards this end. Nothing would be lost by conceding the nominal sovereignty of the Shah over such recovered territories as had originally belonged to his state, so long as the substance of power lay in the hands of Shivaji and his officers. In the following century similar plans were discussed by some of the forward-looking Indians with the object of enabling the Marathas to assume the responsibi- lities of continental sovereignty, but they came to nothing. The plan of the two Brahmin statesmen did not, however, prove abortive. Madanpant, who had rendered signal service to the State in a period of grave crisis, enjoyed the boundless 150 shivaji: the portrait of a patriot confidence of his sovereign, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, who in- variably accepted and acted on the advice of his minister with- out doubt or demur. There was no love lost between him and the imperialists who were merely biding their time to annex his realm. It was necessary to prevent such a catastrophe by making common cause with the Marathas whose military power, as he could see, was fast waxing to formidable proportions. Besides, which autocrat does not desire the extension of his dominion, especially when such gains can be made with the expenditure of somebody else’s blood? Golkonda’s participa- tion in Shivaji’s scheme for organizing an expedition to the south thus fulfilled both the interests and the foibles of its ruler. Abul Hasan readily agreed to write to Shivaji personal- ly, inviting him to the capital to discuss the terms and details of the expedition. Shivaji readily responded to the invitation which suited his plans admirably. He had spent many months in preparing for the southern march. To secure his rear, he sent a strong mili- tary force against Kopbaldurg, which was under the command of two Afghan captains in the pay of the Bijapur Government. The Khans, whose oppressive regime had caused deep discon- tent among the local population, were soundly beaten by the Marathas in a fiercely-contested engagement. One of the bro- thers was killed in action, while another was taken prisoner. The victorious Marathas, who were led by Hambirrao Mohite and Dhanaji Jadhav, joined Shivaji’s main army at Hyderabad after gaining possession of the fort and the surrounding district Shivaji started on his historic journey from Raigad, his capi- tal, towards the end of January 1677. He marched to Hydera- bad with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. With his custom- ary foresight, he made careful arrangements for the government of his realm during his absence which he anticipated would be long, as indeed it proved to be. At this time Aurangzeb was too deeply involved in his operations against the turbulent hill- men of the North-West Frontier to be able to give much atten- tion to the happenings in the distant Deccan. Bahadur Khan, his deputy, had by now become heartily sick of his futile cam- THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 151 paigns against the Marathas so that any pretext was good enough for him to remain inactive. Flattery and gold played an effective part in ensuring his inaction during Shivaji’s absence from Maharashtra. No danger was apprehended from Bijapur which was itself in imminent peril of dissolution. The remain- ing Muslim power in the Deccan, Golkonda, had agreed to be- come an active partner in Shivaji’s southern expedition, being anxious to secure his friendship as an insurance against the aggressions of the imperialists and to take its share in the fruits of his victories. Moro Trimbak Pingle, the great Peshwa, and Annaji Datto were left behind to guard and administer the state during his absence. The large Maratha army was disciplined and its behaviour during its march to Hyderabad was exemplary. A great wel- come awaited the renowned leader and his men in the capital of the Kutubshahi Kingdom. Shivaji, who had a natural revul- sion for gaudy and glittering displays, for once ignored his pre- dilection for simplicity and clothed and equipped his men in a splendid array. Hyderabad, which the Marathas reached in February 1677, wore a festive appearance. Houses and streets had been cleaned up and decorated to accord a fitting reception to “the great friend and protector” of the Shah. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children, clad in their best, thronged the streets and the roofs and balconies of their houses to gain a vivid glimpse of the celebrated hero and his devoted followers. The Shah offered to receive his guest outside the city, but Shivaji assured him that the proprieties of hospitality would be amply fulfilled if he could be welcomed in die king’s palace itself. The manly bearing of the seventy thousand Maratha troops and their orderliness and discipline made a profound impression on the minds of the citizens of Hyderabad. They beheld for the first time the famous soldiers and statesmen and their re- nowned leader who, by their prowess and diplomacy, had given shape and substance to the long-cherished desire of millions of their countrymen for the revival of the traditions of tolerance and justice in the land. The heroes of many wars, such as the 152 CTTTVAJT : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT celebrated Hambirrao Mohite, Anandrao and Manaji More, Suryaji Malusare and Yesaji Kank, were there, figuring promi- nently among the marching troops. No less conspicuous were the Brahmin advisers and ambassa- dors of Shivaji, with their painted foreheads and bright-colour- ed headgears, some of whom were as skilled in wielding the sword as in using their rapier-keen intellect in the service of their master. The erudite Raghunathpant and his brother Janardan Hanumante, the brilliant Prahlad Niraji, the resident ambassador of Shivaji at Hyderabad, the chronicler Dattaji Trimbak, and many other high Brahmin dignitaries of state, including Nilo Moreshwar and Gangadharpant, were present on that memorable occasion. Also marching with the army was the cultivated flower of Maharashtra’s intelligence, Nila Prabhu, who has won an honoured place in the kingdom of letters by his superb penman- ship, as exemplified by Shivaji’s famous epistle to Aurangzeb protesting against the Emperor’s morbid bigotry and malevol- ence. Balaji Avji, the inimitable secretary of Shivaji and his master’s conscience-keeper, together with Shamji Naik, the Keeper of the Seal, completed the concourse of distinguished men that accompanied Shivaji on that day. In that mighty throng of armed men Shivaji was, of course, the central figure and the cynosure of all eyes. Short, lean and graceful, he had justly become famous for the gifts of his per- sonal magnetism. A pleasing radiance suffused his personality so that none that beheld him could resist the overwhelming im- pression that they were in the presence of a really great man. By now Shivaji’s fame had travelled far and wide and his matchless deeds of valour, piety and statesmanship filled his countrymen with deep admiration and affection for him. It was for this reason that the reception accorded to him by the citizens of Hyderabad on that day in February 1677 was so spontaneous and memorable. Thousands of voices were raised in chorus to greet the distinguished guest, while groups of ladies, young and old, stopped the procession from time to time to ply lighted lamps before Shivaji—a pleasing ceremony re- THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 153 garded as most auspicious by the Hindus. The Maratha King smilingly acknowledged such manifestations of affection and re- gard for him and liberally distributed gold and silver among the crowds around him. King Abul Hasan received Shivaji in his palace with the courtesy and cordiality due to a distinguished and invited guest. The two monarchs held long discussions on matters of mutual interest and came to understand each other intimately. Shivaji’s frankness and modesty as well as his towering abilities deeply impressed the Shah whose own uneventful existence pre- sented a marked contrast to the brilliant achievements of his guest. Madanpant, the Minister, played a leading part in pro- moting greater amity between them and in settling the terms of their alliance. Shivaji’s military expedition to the south figured prominently in the compact which laid down that the Government of Gol- konda should pay the Marathas a sum of Rs. 4£ lakhs a month towards the cost of the invasion, besides detailing five thousand troops to accompany the Maratha army. It was further stipu- lated that Golkonda should supply a train of artillery to the in- vading force. In return Shivaji promised to make over to his ally such of the southern territories to be conquered by him as did not originally belong to his father, Shahaji. The treaty re- iterated the need for strengthening the defensive alliance be- tween the two governments as a safeguard against the expan- sionist designs of the Moghuls and laid down that the Sultan should ensure a regular payment of one lakh hons annually as tribute to Shivaji. He should also entertain at his court a permanent ambassador from the Maratha Government. Shivaji’s stay in his ally’s capital for several weeks was both pleasant and profitable to him. He fulfilled his social obliga- tions with grace and cheerfulness, attending receptions and dinners given in his' honour. With closer acquaintance, the Shah's admiration for him grew and this was reflected in a liberal presentation of costly gifts to the guest. Shivaji left Hyderabad early in March 1677, carrying with him the goodwill and the best wishes of the people and the ruler of the state. 154 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT He proceeded to Kamool, a large town in Andhra, and collected five lakh hons from it. After bathing in the confluence of the Krishna and the Bhavanashi near Kamool, he went to the fam- ous Shrishailam shrine, forty-four miles east of the same town. Situated on a spot of striking beauty and seclusion, the tem- ple exercises an irresistible fascination on the minds of the de- vout. A deeply religious man, Shivaji was overwhelmed by the sanctity of the place and the time-honoured solemnities of the shrine. He experienced a great serenity of mind and developed a marked distaste for returning to the sordid world of strife and hatred. He spent ten days in the temple in such spiritual ecstasy that it required all the eloquence and pressure of his followers to persuade him to rejoin his army which was then in camp at Anantapur, also in Andhra. Shivaji’s aim was to take into possession most of the im- portant strongholds in the south so that in times of stress and difficulty, the Government of Maharashtra could move into them. Jinji, Gingee or Chenjee, in South Arcot, was one such powerful fort. An old Gazetteer describes the place thus: “There are three lofty rocky hills in the form of a triangle en- closed by a strong wall flanked with towers and the circuit of which is three miles; besides this there were fortified enclo- sures, double round the eastern, and treble round the western- most hill (the highest), on the summit of which was a small fort, now in ruins, which could be held by a very few men against any force. There is always water to be found in a natural hollow of the rock It was considered the strongest fortress in the Carnatic.” Shivaji detached a strong contingent of five thousand horse from his main army for the capture of Jinji which, as stated earlier, was then under the command of Nasir Muhammad Khan, a general of the Bijapur Government. The Khan was a wise Galileo. Apart from the superior military strength of the Marathas, he knew that he could secure little assistance from die disintegrating administration of Bijapur. Moreover, the relentless aggression of Sher Khan Lodi was a constant menace to his possessions. He, therefore, decided to surrender the fort THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 155 of Jinji to the Marathas peacefully in return for a liberal cash payment, besides a jagir fetching an annual revenue of Rs. 50,000. It was a welcome windfall for Shivaji who hastened to the fort to inspect its fortifications and to make arrangements for its defence. He pulled down the old fortifications and built new and stronger ones in their place. The strategic importance of the stronghold decided him to develop Jinji into the principal seat of his government in the south. Towards this end he built new offices and residential quarters for his civil and mili- tary subordinates. Rayaji Nalge was assigned the important task of commanding the fort, while Vithal Pildev Atre was ap- pointed to administer the revenue affairs of the district. Shivaji’s prescience in building a second Maratha capital deep in the south was of inestimable value to the national cause after his death. The capture and murder of his eldest son, Sambhaji, by Aurangzeb in March 1689 and the defeat of the Maratha forces in all theatres of war, in contrast to their resounding successes against their enemies during his lifetime, threatened to annihilate his hard-won realm. But the fugitive Rajaram, his second son, saved it from falling into tearful ruins by seeking the asylum of Jinji, from where he held aloft the standard of independence and eventually succeeded in defeat- ing and destroying the military might of the imperialists. The acquisition of Jinji by the Marathas set the stage for the conquest of Vellore, another strong fortress, situated eighty- four miles from Madras. It was held by an Abyssinian officer called Abdulla Khan who refused to surrender it for any con- sideration. It was a powerfully-built fortress and was indeed among the strongest in the south. The fort is situated three- quarters of a mile from the foot of a high range of bare, rough and rocky hills and is equipped with high and broad ramparts over which two carts can be driven abreast. It abounds in bastions and towers and is separated by a broad and deep moat which, in the time of Shivaji and in later centuries, was infest- ed with alligators of a monstrous size. 156 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Shivaji was not adequately equipped to capture such an im- pregnable stronghold within a short period and was certainly not prepared to waste time by sitting indefinitely before it. He detailed Narhari Rudra to continue the siege and, taking a sizable army with himself, proceeded against Sher Khan Lodi, the only Muslim governor of note that had elected to dispute openly his career of conquest in the south. Vellore held on for many months longer and did not surrender to the Marathas till the third week of August 1678 by which time Shivaji had re- turned to Maharashtra. Sher Khan’s enthusiasm for trying conclusions with Shivaji outstripped his prudence. He encamped at Tiruvadi, thirteen miles west of Cuddalore on June 10, 1677, determined to give battle to the Marathas when they arrived. Sixteen days later, Shivaji appeared in the neighbourhood with six thousand cavalry. The rest of the story may well be narrated from the contempo- rary chronicle of Francis Martin, the Governor of the French Settlement of Pondicherry: “Chircam (Sher Khan) at once caused his men to be put into fighting order and advanced against his enemies; it is not known whether he still had the foolishness with which the Bramens (Brahmins) had inspired him, to believe that his enemies would disappear when he ap- proached them, but it is certain that his march had something of a martial character. This intrepidity did not, however, last long. Sivagy’s (Shivaji’s) army did not swerve in the least; it awaited the shock. Chircam recognized thereby that he had taken a false step; the posture of his enemies astounded him; he decided to make a retreat. Sivagy, who understood the science of war, perceived his (Chircam’s) surprise; he made his troops march; the retreat was precipitate and was converted into , a kind of flight; the enemies pushed on and then all were scattered. Chircam fled with his son and with some of his principal officers at full speed.” . Such was the prowess of the man who had conceived the grand project of sitting on the throne of Golkonda! The victo- rious Marathas pushed forward - making new conquests and eventually forced the rash Pathan to sue for peace. He visited THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 157 Shivaji on July 5, 1677 and agreed to cede the entire territory that had been held by him. He also paid a large ransom and bound himself to contribute more. To prove his bom fides, he left his son behind with the Marathas as a hostage and ended his misadventure by eventually retiring to the court of the Naik of Madura. For his part, the Naik secured immunity from the invasion of his territory by the Marathas by agreeing to pay them six lakh hons. The way was now clear for Shivaji to at- tempt a negotiated settlement of his dispute with his step- brother, Ekoji. Shivaji and Ekoji had been cast in two different moulds. They had the same father, but their mothers were different. It is a fact of supreme importance that Shivaji was twice blessed in his mother, Jijabai, like whom it was impossible to find an- other woman. She was, as we saw, a lady gifted with a wide- ranging vision and patriotism, both of which insured against her son sinking into ignoble obscurity by pursuing the familiar career open to persons of his class in those times. She had made heavy sacrifices and run grave N risks for the single purpose of training Shivaji for his exalted mission. Indeed, on many critical occasions, like the one that led to his encounter With Afzal Khan, she played a decisive part in influencing his manly decisions. What with his natural greatness, Shivaji had thus the additional advantage of a careful and disciplined up- bringing during the formative years of his life. It was not Ekoji’s fault that his career and outlook were not similarly moulded. He was perhaps taught to believe that the status quo, with all its iniquities and injustices, was the best since it was not within his means to change it. Like that of many other Maratha sardars of his time, the service of the Sul- tans and a successful personal career under their patronage be- came the summum bonum of his life. Ekoji was brave and cap- able and employed these assets in the service of his masters with an obsessional thoroughness. He was, therefore, unable to appreciate the true significance or the grandeur of his bro- ther’s undertaking and gave repeated proofs of such insensibi- 158 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT lity by ranging himself on the side of Bijapur in its campaigns against Shivaji. The estrangement between the brothers was thus fundament- al. It would have been futile for Shivaji to rely merely on appeals to reason and sentiment in order to convert Ekoji to his own point of view. The cause of independence in the Deccan and the south would have acquired greater strength if only the younger man could unite his resources and talents with those of the great deliverer, but since no such lofty sentiment animated him, the only other practical course by which the goal could be realized was for Shivaji to demand his share of the patrimony. Ekoji had long enjoyed the revenues of his father’s extensive jagirs in Mysore State and elsewhere in the south without sharing them with his elder brother. This preview of the relations between the two brothers is essential in order to understand the subsequent story of Ekoji’s intransigence and his failure to appreciate Shivaji’s stand. After much persuasion Ekoji agreed to call on his brother and the two men met in the middle of July 1677 at Tirumalavadi, near Tanjore. They spent some days in entertaining each other and later addressed themselves to the task of regulating their mutual relations. From first to last, the attitude of Ekoji was unhelpful. This fact has been recorded by Francois Martin who writes: “The first conversation gave evidence of amity and tenderness; then it came to negotiation when Ecugy (Ekoji) discovered that his brother would not let him go unless he had satisfied him about his claims. He (Ekoji). also used his cun- ning and while he offered friendly words he sought some means of withdrawing himself from such a bad strait; he succeeded therein one night; he had a cattamaron (catamaran) kept ready for him on the banks of the Couleron; under pretext of neces- sity, for he was watched, he approached the banks of the river, threw himself into the cattamaron and crossed to the other side which was his country and where he had some troops.” Shivaji was naturally furious over his brother’s precipitate de- parture from his camp, since it gave an entirely false impression that he had kept Ekoji in duress with the object of extorting THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS unreasonable concessions from him. There was in fact no need for him to adopt any such measure, since he was strong enough to annex any of his brother’s territories or the whole of them. Ekoji’s misbehaviour called for a certain sternness on the part of Shivaji who ordered the detention of the trusted counsellors of his brother in his camp. Since this step failed to teach the younger man the error of his ways, Shivaji sent them back to him, with appropriate gifts. The Maratha King was deeply offended by the obstinate re- fusal of Ekoji to give up his service under the Bijapur Govern- ment. His personal negotiations having proved infructuous, he wrote a spirited letter on March 1, 1678, appealing to his bro- ther to listen to his counsels of wisdom. He pointed out to Ekoji how wrong it was on his part to insist on serving the Turks and the Pathans when Providence had ordained that he, Shivaji, should reconquer the heritage of the land from them. He appealed to him to abandon the suicidal course of widening domestic dissensions and promised to give him a jagir in the region between the river Tungabhadra and the fort of Panhala, yielding a revenue of three lakhs annually. It is to the lasting credit of Dipabai, Ekoji’s sagacious wife, that the rupture in the relations between the two brothers was eventually healed, although the younger man could never bear true affection for his senior. She succeeded in weaning her husband from the influence of his evil-minded advisers and persuaded him to recall Raghunathpant and allow himself to be guided by that eminent and scholarly Brahmin. Shivaji was happy at the welcome change in his brother’s attitude and wrote a cordial letter to Raghunathpant eulogizing the wisdom and the patriotism of his sister-in-law. In appreciation of her good offices, he specifically laid down in the agreement that was concluded with his brother that the revenues from the dis- tricts of Bangalore, Hoskote and Shiralkot in Mysore State should be settled on her. “After Dipabai,” the provision read, “they will continue to her daughter or to any one else named by her.” The terms of the agreement make it abundantly clear that 160 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Shivaji’s dispute with his brother was not so much over the division of the property as over the obstinate and unpatriotic adhesion of Ekoji to the Bijapur Government. Article sixteen of the compact proves this beyond a shadow of doubt because it says: “We have conquered Tanjore and the adjoining districts of Ekoji worth about seven lakh hons. We hand them back to him as his own separate possession." Some of the other pro- visions deal with vital political issues, differences over which had played no small part in intensifying the estrangement be- tween the two brothers. Article six bound Ekoji to ensure that no man was entertained in his state if he proved to be the enemy of the Hindu religion. Article twelve recalled Shivaji’s treaty of 1662 with Bijapur, which forbade both him and his brother from accepting service in that state. It was agreed that this stipulation should now be scrupulously honoured by Ekoji. Ekoji’s acceptance of the new settlement was, however, neither cordial nor wholehearted. He drifted into suicidal des- pondency, turning his back on the responsibilities of his office. Shivaji’s repeated exhortations to him to return to active life and zealously fulfil his obligations to his realm and the coun- try fell on deaf ears. His last appeal was written in January 1680 and before he could know of its effect on his brother, his own earthly career came to an end. Shivaji could not stay in the south indefinitely. His return journey began in the last week of July, following his abortive talks with Ekoji. On his way back, he worshipped at some of the famous shrines, while his armies made new conquests, in- cluding the capture of the district of Ami, Kolar, Hoskote, Ban- galore and some other places in Mysore State. He marched across the districts of Bellary and Dharwar, both now within the administrative jurisdiction of the same State, and reached Panhala early in April 1678. Shivaji’s conquests in the south in terms of territory and revenue have been variously estimated. According to Sabha- sad, quoted by Sarkar, the new territorial gains of Shivaji in the south yielded him an annual revenue of twenty lakh THE HISTORIC EXPEDITIONS 161 hons. The conquered region contained as many as 100 forts, either captured or built by him. A European wrote from Madras in August 1678 thus : “Shivaji by his depu- ties has a full and quiet possession of all these countries about those two strong castles of Jinji and Vellore, which are worth 22 lakhs of pardoes or 550 thousand pounds sterling per annum, at five shillings the pardoe, in which he has a considerable force of men and horse, 72 strong hills and 14 forts (in the plain), being 60 leagues long and 40 broad.” The volume of wealth taken away by him to equip and en- large his armies was considerable. A large number of men were imported from Maharashtra to administer the new charge. The region, comprising the Kamatak plains, was placed under the viceroyalty of Santaji Bhosle, with Jinji as his headquarters. He was assisted in his new responsibilities by Raghunathpant Hanumante who possessed unrivalled knowledge of the south. Hambirrao Mohite, the Senapati, was entrusted with the task of defending the new acquisitions. Rango Narayan was ap- pointed to govern the Mysore tableland under the general super- vision of the Viceroy of Jinji. Many graphic accounts have been left behind about Shivaji’s historic expedition to South India. Abounding in ancient and splendid shrines, it gave him ample opportunities to give free rein to his devotional fervour. The wealth collected from the south was considerable and it certainly stood the Maratha State in good stead both then and in later years when its stability was, sorely tried by Moghul aggressions. It was Shivaji’s dis- tinctive trait to cultivate and to win the esteem and confi- dence of the people visited by him rather than incur their ran- cour and antagonism. Abbe Carre rightly remarks: ‘To the quickness of movement, he added, like Julius Caesar, a cle- mency and bounty that won him the hearts of those his arms had worsted.” His simplicity was equally remarkable, thus offering one more proof that his expeditions for raising money were intended essentially to advance the common cause and not to promote his own interests or to gratify his vanity. A Wes- tern observer wrote from the south thus: “The camp of Shivaji 162 SHIVAJI ; THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT was without pomp and without women; there was no baggage and there were only two tents made of cloth, coarse and very scanty, one for himself and another for his prime minister.” It is an unfortunate accident of history that Shivaji did not live long enough to be able to make enduring administrative and military dispositions in his new dominion. The regime set up by him required long years of effective control and guid- ance by a central authority enjoying commanding influence and prestige. Such unique direction could be supplied only by Shivaji, but he lived for only two more years after his southern invasion. What course history would have taken if he had been spared a decade longer, certainly presents an interesting theme for speculation, but guesses, however rewarding to one’s powers of imagination, are singularly futile.

CHAPTER 9 EUROPEANS IN INDIA Shivaji’s dealings with the European traders in India were marked by caution and kindliness and at the same time by a determination not to allow them to encroach upon his rights. It was impossible for him or for any of his contemporaries to foresee that one of the nations of these trading communities was destined to impose its sway eventually over the length and breadth of the country. In his time, the Portuguese, the Dutch, the English and thg French were all content to pursue their commercial interests undistracted by territorial ambitions. They fought amongst themselves bitterly to seize the monopoly of the abounding trade and, being largely preoccupied with con- siderations of profits and dividends, their activities, mostly con- fined to their coastal settlements, aroused neither jealousy nor fear. The days of Warren Hastings, the first outstanding Bri- tish statesman in India, and of men like him whose nobility and vision elevated them far above the passions, the greed and the cruelties of the time, were still far off. Nevertheless, Shivaji, with his natural inquisitiveness and his desire to gain a wider understanding of the world around him, missed no opportunity to study the calibre and the outlook of the fair-skinned foreigners. He admired their spirit of adven- ture, took note of the advance made by their nations in the weapons and modes of warfare, and appreciated the tenacity of purpose that generally governed their activities. His long and animated conversation with Manucci, the Italian artillery officer in Raja Jai Singh’s army, in 1665, on a wide variety of subjects, testifies to a mind that was at once alert and awake. The coming of the Europeans to India was an event of great international significance. It not only broke the isolation of the East, but also paved the way for a closer integration of the world. Much of the credit for this historic achievement be- longs to Portugal whose atrocious behaviour and misdeeds dur- 164 SHIVAJX: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT ing the period of her decline and in our own time do not pro- vide a true measure of her contribution in the past to the pro- motion of a better understanding of the vastness, the variety and the splendour of the world. The Portuguese sailors were men of great intrepidity, who roamed the high seas in their swift caravels, braving the perils of the uncharted oceans. The fifteenth century, in particular, was a period of unceasing activity for Portugal whose discovery of the sea route to fyriiaj gave her access to the fabulous wealth of the East in addition to the unexploited riches of Brazil in the new world. In fact, Portugal held the so-called “gorgeous East” in fee for a century, claiming proprietary rights over that vast region. But this small country, with its severely limited man-power resources and its unbridled religious bigotry, could not long re- tain its far-flung empire. The Dutch waged a relentless wai against the Portuguese and, with the aid of their superior orga- nization and seamanship, dislodged them from most of their possessions in the East. The Dutch had, however, no heart in India. The Archipelago was the pride of their possessions and was in fact their main economic, strategic and administrative centre in the East. The stage was thus set for the English to secure a firm foothold in this country, although singly they were no match either for the Portuguese or the Dutch. The French, whose chances of founding an empire in India were as good as those of their traditional rivals, missed the great opportunity on account of the imbecility of their Government. By such a for- tunate process of elimination the English eventually succeeded in establishing their hegemony in this country, although nothing was more remote from their thoughts than the idea of empire in the days of Shivaji. Shivaji’s normally good relations with the English were exacerbated by three episodes which will be explained present- ly. He was one of the few Indians who realized the value of naval power to defend the integrity of the country and to pro- mote its material prosperity. The Moghuls were singularly de- ficient in such a statesmanlike vision. They owned no gun- boats to protect the long coastline, but specialized in erecting EUROPEANS IN INDIA 165 gibbets and guillotines instead to destroy their opponents inside the country! For such folly they paid heavily by forfeiting their sovereignty over the Indian waters and depending help- lessly on the forbearance of the European trading companies in India for the unmolested movement of their vessels. Even the great Akbar tacitly acknowledged Portuguese paramountcy over the Indian coast by “taking out licenses for ships sent by him to the Red Sea, and the Moghuls made no attempt either to free or to command the waters”. Even after the decline of their power the Portuguese refused to give up their pretensions to be recognized as masters of the Indian seas. Such an arrogation of sovereign rights by a distant country over the home waters of India was an intolerable affront to her dignity and pride. Shivaji was determined not to permit it. He had neither the resources nor the time for building up a mighty armada and employing it against the foreign intruders in order to win pre-eminence for India as a naval power. But to secure the freedom of the seas along the country’s western coast-line was well within his scope and he strove towards this goal with all his might and resources till the end of his life. It was evident to him that neither the security of his realm nor its progress and prosperity could be ensured unless he built up a navy of his own. The west coast, dotted with a number of large and wealthy towns, was extremely prosperous and transacted an enormous volume of import and export business. The island of Bombay was still a little-known and unhealthy place, although the wise policy of the English and the excellence of the harbour had begun to attract to it entrepreneurs and others in steadily in- creasing numbers, thus guaranteeing its eventual growth as the foremost commercial centre of India. The imprudence and the bigotry of the Portuguese virtually barred the progress of Goa as an important commercial and industrial city and whatever pre-eminence it had acquired in the past centuries disappeared with the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire. Port towns like Dabhol, Rajapur, Karwar, Bhatkal and Vengurla, lying between Bombay and Cochin, acquired con- 166 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT siderable importance and affluence by exporting a wide variety of goods of which spices and textiles were most conspicuous. The pepper of Sonda was highly-prized and its excellence was described in rapturous terms by calling it “the best and the dearest in the world”. The local Raja’s “pepper-country” yielded an enormous revenue, his annual collections being esti- mated at thirty lakh pagodas. Karwar became a leading exporting centre for the celebrated muslin and other fabrics, and the English factory in the town alone transacted a prodigious volume of business in this com- modity by engaging inland an army of weavers to maintain a steady flow of exports. “The chief merit of Karwar,” says the authority just quoted, “is its spacious harbour, the only first- rate harbour on the west coast between Bombay and Colombo. It offers every convenience for shipping at all times of the year.” The capture of Kalyan and Bhiwandi by Shivaji in 1657 gave him a firm foothold in the Konkan. Thenceforward, he started ship-building in the well-sheltered creeks in the region and in- creased the tempo of his naval activities as he acquired greater control over the coastline. His ships were as good as any that could be built in India in those times and certainly compared well with those of Portugal. His crew consisted of men with long seafearing traditions, inhabiting the coastal districts, and his choice—-a fact of supreme importance—was inhibited by no considerations of caste or religion. The Muslims of the Kon- kan, known for their courage and skill on the seas, formed a considerable element in Shivaji’s navy, one of his Commanders- in-Chief being an adherent of Islam. Shivaji also built a chain of strongholds on a wide stretch of the west coast to serve as convenient bases for his navy. The construction of the first fort of this kind, Vijayadurg, described as the “most perfect example of a great coastal fortress”, was begun in 1653, some four years before he had gained possession of the Konkan town of Kalyan. The second large fort was Suvamdurg which was completed in 1660. Sindhudurg off Malvan was the most formidable of Shivaji’s strongholds on the sea coast, on which he spent enormous labour and sums of EUROPEANS IN INDIA 167 money, a part of which was derived from the wealth secured from Surat. So great was the importance attached to this for- tress that Shivaji is stated to have laboured with his own hands to strengthen its defences. The work of fortification was begun with solemn rites on November 25, 1664. The last important naval post to be constructed during his reign was Kolaba which was completed on the eve of his death in 1680. Shivaji’s policy in the Konkan was clear and well-defined. He was determined to secure his unchallenged supremacy over it by defeating and expelling the agents of Bijapur and of the Moghuls from the region. He desired that the coastal trade should prosper and entertained no thought of excluding any of the European traders from participating in it so long as they did not seek to thrust their oars into the country’s troubled political waters. He resolutely fought piracy on the seas and lawlessness on the coast and played no small part in establish- ing stable conditions in the districts. The Gazetteer of Kolaba and Janjira says: “Besides, by enriching it with the spoils of Gujarat, the Deccan and the Karnatak, Shivaji did much to improve the Konkan by giving highly paid employment in his army and in building and guarding his hill forts. He also in- troduced a more uniform and lighter land tax, suppressed ir- regular exactions, and- fostered trade.” It is in this context of the Maratha King’s determination to extend his sway over the Konkan and to enhance its resources that we should understand his strained relations with the English. It will be recalled that after the destruction of his foe, Afzal Khan, in November 1659, Shivaji won a re- sounding victory over the Bijapur army and captured the strong fortress of Panhala in the last week of the same month. Before the enemy could recover from the blow he suddenly appeared in Ratnagiri district in the Konkan and conquered a number of important inland towns and ports. Dabhol fell and Rajapur would have followed suit, but Shivaji stayed his hand in order to oblige the Bijapur Governor, Rustam-i-Zaman, who was favourably disposed towards him. An unfair advantage was taken of this leniency by-the defeat- 168 SIIIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT ed Governor of Dabhol, Muhammad Sharif, who, responding to the importunities of Afzal Khan’s son, despatched the latter’s three loaded junks to Rajapur for safe custody. The Marathas, who were at war with Bijapur, demanded the surrender of the three vessels which had been taken over by the English factors at the port. The chief factor, who falsely claimed that the junks belonged to his Company, fled from Rajapur and sought asylum of the sea when he discovered that his deceitful conduct would be severely punished by the Marathas. The cargo was seized and in order to teach the factors a lesson that strategems and subterfuges and interference in other people’s affairs, especially when practised against a friendly power, deserved punishment, the second officer in charge of the English factory, called Gifford, was arrested and held in duress for some time. He was, however, released later. Evidently, such a mild retribution made no salutary impres- sion on the English. In 1660 they once again flagrantly viola- ted the principles of neutrality by co-operating with the Bijapur Darbar in its attempts to reduce the fort of Panhala. In May of that year the fort, in which Shivaji had taken refuge, was closely invested by Siddi jauhar and the Maratha chief would in all probability have fallen a prisoner into the hands of the enemy, had he not risen to the occasion' and made his escape from the stronghold. It was on this occasipn, when he was exposed to grave danger, that the English factors from, Rajapur not only supplied arms and ammunition to the Bijapur Govern- ment, but actually participated in the campaign by opening des- tructive fire on the fort and by hurling grenades at the belea- guered garrison. These acts of aggression were committed openly, with the English Company’s flag flying during the opera- tions. Shivaji considered it misplaced generosity if he condoned or treated lightly the second deliberate act of unfriendliness on the part of the foreigners. The reprisals in the circumstances could only be severe. On March 3, 1661 he suddenly appeared before Rajapur, causing mortal terror to the guilty factors. He thoroughly pillaged their warehouses and in addition took a . EUROPEANS IN INDIA 169 few Englishmen into custody and sent them to a distant part of his realm for detention. They prayed and petitioned and fell upon their knees before him to be set free, but he was ada- mant. He, however, promised to release them if they paid a large indemnity—an appropriate punishment to the coin-spinn- ing fraternity! The captives hummed and hawed and wrote copiously to their principals at Surat pleading, sometimes angrily but often piteously, for their good offices in securing their early deliverance. Unfortunately for them, the reply from Surat (March 10, 1662) was devastating. “How you came in prison,” wrote the President with remorseless finality, “you know very well. It was not for defending the Company’s goods; it was for going to the siege of Panhala and tossing balls with a flag that was known to be the English’s. None but what is re- hearsed is the cause of your imprisonment.” Shivaji, however, relented and set them free in due course on his own initiative. Shivaji’s armed incursions into the Konkan and the Karwar districts were frequent. They were prompted by the considera- tion to establish Maratha supremacy in the region on firm foundations and to teach useful lessons to the local chiefs that attempted to defy him at the instigation of Bijapur. At one time or another, the Naiks of Bednur and the Rajas of Sonda, among others, felt the weight of Maratha arms. Besides, it was necessary for Shivaji to supplement his revenues with the riches that could be collected from the Konkan and Karwar ports. But his levies were not ruinous, since, as we saw earlier in this chapter, his basic aim was to promote the prosperity of those districts. For instance, during his raid on Vengurla in May 1663, he liberally distributed documents among the civilian population guaranteeing immunity from harm. In the following year 1664 he, however, carried away “vast riches” from that place and in December the flourishing town of Hubli was thoroughly sacked, besides a number of other rich towns in the neighbourhood. Karwar escaped lightly in 1665. After making a raid by sea on Barkalur in South Canara, he dismissed the greater part of his fleet at Gokarn where he had earlier worshipped at the famous shrine of Mahabaleshwar, 170 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT scoured the region, and levied a contribution from Karwar. The English factors in the town paid him £712 as their share. It was not till ten years later that a major effort was made to capture the great fort of Phonda and to annex the Kanara coast. In that year Shivaji descended upon these districts with an army of 15,000 cavalry, 14,000 infantry and 10,000 pioneers. He detached a large body of forces to besiege Phonda which, in spite of its strong defences and the help secretly rendered to the garrison by the Portuguese, fell in May 1675. The treache- rous behaviour of the foreigners was attributed to their extreme terror at the proximity of the formidable Shivaji to their chief town, Goa. Karwar also surrendered so that by May 25 “the country as far south as the Gangavali river had passed out of Bijapuri possession into his hands”. It was, however, impossible for Shivaji to establish settled conditions in the Konkan unless he overcame the lawless acti- vities of the Siddis of Janjira. Janjira is a rocky island, forty- five miles south of Bombay, whose rulers, the Siddis, constituted the most disturbing element on the west coast. The town of Rajpuri and the fort of Danda, situated in its vicinity and both regarded as one place, were of considerable strategic impor- tance. Guarding the mouth of the Rajpuri creek and standing on the mainland, the place became a perpetual bone of conten- tion between the Marathas and the Siddis in the same manner as the Doab of Raichur, now in Mysore State, had provoked prolonged and implacable wars between the kings of Vijaya- nagar and the Sultans of Bijapur. The forbears of the Siddis had established a colony of fellow-Abyssinians at Janjira as far back as the fifteenth century. Since that period they held sway over the local population whom they oppressed in order to sustain their aggression. Waring describes the Siddis as brave, active and staunch Muslims, “hostile by religion and by interest to the rise of a Hindu Power”. The smallness of their dominion and its barrenness compelled the rulers of Janjira to seek a permanent possession of Danda- Rajpuri from where they could launch their plundering expedi- tions in Kolaba and Ratnagiri districts in order to fertilize EUROPEANS IN INDIA 171 their sterile economy. Since it was impossible for them to challenge with impunity a well-entrenched government in the region, they sold their services and loyalties to whichever. Mus- lim power that was strong for the time being, readily changing sides if the exigencies of the situation so demanded. They rea- lized the dangerous implications of the rise of the Marathas as a naval power to their own continued existence. Shivaji, whose acumen and wide-ranging vision missed nothing, saw that by capturing Danda-Rajpuri it would be possible to stop the heart-beats of Janjira. The struggle between the Marathas and the Siddis of Janjira was long-drawn-out and bloody. Fath Khan, the Siddi chief, was a brave, resourceful and indomitable fighter. He knew that the military strength of the Marathas was infinitely superior to his own and dexterously overcame his deficiency by taking full advantage of Shivaji’s distractions and misfortunes. He was no less agile in retreating to his island fortress when he realized that only thus could he save himself from the terrible vengeance of the Marathas. There is much aptness in the observation of a chronicler that the Siddis were like mice in a house! In 1659, when Afzal Khan proceeded against Shivaji, armed with a mandate from the Bijapur Government to des- troy the nascent Maratha kingdom, Fath Khan fell upon the mainland in an attempt to benefit from his adversary’s pre- occupation, but when Afzal Khan met his doom at the foot of Pratapgad, the Siddi beat a precipitate retreat to Janjira to escape Maratha reprisals. He adopted this strategy on many other occasions. In 1661 Shivaji concentrated his efforts and resources on the capture of Danda-Rajpuri and the' onset of the monsoon in all its fury did not relax his determination to conquer the town. His pertinacity bore fruit and the much-prized place at last fell into Maratha hands. It remained in their possession for nine years, during which period Shivaji made repeated attempts from his vantage position to force Janjira’s surrender. Year after year, his artillery was directed against the island, but since his guns were weak, both in their range and firing power, no great 172 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT damage was done to the stronghold. Shivaji organized his con- quests in Kolaba district into a new province, rebuilt the defences of Danda-Rajpuri, constructed a chain of forts to strengthen his hold on the region, and placed the charge under a competent officer, Vyankoji Datto, with a permanent contin- gent of 5,000 to 7,000 men to protect it. These dispositions distressed and alarmed the Siddi who was now forced to launch his depredations further south, in Ratnagiri district. In 1669 Shivaji renewed his attack on Janjira with far greater vigour and, although he could not actually capture the island, he succeeded in reducing Fath Khan to extreme despair. Realizing the futility of waging a losing war against the Mara- thas, the Siddi agreed to surrender Janjira in consideration for a rich jagir and a large cash present. His decision to end the hostilities was, however, resented by three resolute men, Siddis Sambal, Kasim and Khairiyat, the last two being brothers. They imprisoned Fath Khan and applied to Aurangzeb to be taken under his protective wing, at the same time continuing the war against the Marathas. The Emperor was delighted and readily invested Siddi Sambal with the office of admiral of the Imperial Navy, besides conferring on him the title of Yakut Khan. To sustain his newly-acquired eminence, he received as. his share three lakhs of rupees from the annual revenue of Surat. Kasim and his brother were similarly raised to dignity, with directions to remain in command of Janjira and the town of Danda-Raj- purj, although the latter was in Maratha hands. Siddi Kasim, who had never accepted the loss of the town as a fait accompli, patiently bided his time, with the object of wresting it from the Marathas. Such an opportunity came to him during the holi holidays in 1671 when the Maratha garri- son at Danda-Rajpuri, relaxing their vigilance, gave themselves up to revelry. The two Siddi brothers made a surprise attack on both the town and the fort and mercilessly cut down the defenders. To add to the misfortune of the garrison, a powder- magazine blew up, flooding the landscape with dense smoke and lurid light. Shivaji, who was then at Raigad, was awaken- ed from his sleep by the loud report of the explosion and is EUROPEANS TN INDIA 173 stated to have exclaimed: “Something has gone wrong at Danda- Rajpuri”. The victorious Siddis refused to unsheath their sword even after their great victory. “Kasim’s revolting acts of cruelty,” says the District Gazetteer of Kolaba and Janjira, “to men and women deepened the animosity between the Mara- thas and the Siddis.” The loss of Danda-Rajpuri was a bitter disappointment to Shivaji who was never able to retrieve it, although he counted no cost in his attempts to regain its possession. He reluctantly cast about for an alternative naval base from where he could effectively curb the Siddi’s piratical activities. Khanderi or Kenery was the obvious choice. It is a small island near the entrance to the Bombay harbour, eleven miles south of Bombay and six miles north-west of Alibag. It is situated two and a half miles from the Kolaba mainland one and a half miles from another small island called Underi or Henery. For no valid reason, the English in Bombay objected to the fortification of the island by the Marathas. Khanderi had never before been inhabited and its only produce was fuel. The cons- truction of breast-works and other defences in the place was begun by the Marathas in August 1679; the English had gained possession of the island of Bombay more than one and a half decades earlier. Had they discovered that they could not live in peace and security in Bombay without gaining possession of Khanderi, they ought to have instituted appropriate proceedings in that direction much earlier and not attempted to thwart Shivaji’s plans after they had been completed. Resides, Khanderi was well within his jurisdiction. On September 19, 1679. an attempt was made by the English to force a landing on the Khanderi island, but they gave it up after suffering serious reverses at the hands of the Marathas. Renewed efforts in that direction only ended in worse defeats, compelling the discomfited foreigners to admit ruefully that they were not strong enough to dislodge Shivaji from his new acqui- sition. They came to this conclusion after realizing the ineffec- tiveness of their naval operations even with the whole-hearted support of the Siddis of Janjira. Not to be outdone by the 174 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Marathas, Siddi Kasim promptly fortified Underi in January 1680 despite, this time, the combined protests of Shivaji and the English. A striking feature of the behaviour of the English factors of this period, both in Bombay and Surat, was their great capacity for prevarication. It would be impossible to explain their vari- ous acts of inconsistency if they could not be traced to the inherent instability of their position both on land and at sea. Writing in January 1677 about the helpless condition of his Company in Bombay, an official lamented that the Portuguese were “ever exquisite seekers of all ways imaginable to do us mischief”. During the years 1676-1680, we are told, the chief foreign sources of trouble at Bombay were the Portuguese, “the haughty neighbours”, the “Malabars” or the pirates from the Malabar coast, and the Siddis of Janjira. The Siddis in fact showed scant respect for the sovereignty of the English in Bombay and entered and left the harbour at will, using the amenities provided by it with complete freedom as if the island was their own. The English naturally resented such aggressive proceedings, but protest was dangerous. Writing to the Bombay factor on April 14, 1676, the President of Surat observed: “We are sorry the Siddi’s fleet is come again to trouble your port. If he talks of staying at Bombay or at Mazgaon, you must tell him that it shall never be permitted”. The President, however, suddenly became panicky at his own boldness and hastily added in the same letter an admonition to his colleague that he should be very civil in his “discourses and arguments” with the Siddi. Be- sides, he should not fail to supply the intruder and his men “what they may want—wood, water and provisions”. We read a number of similar letters; here is an extract from President Aungier’s extraordinary letter dated May 7, 1677: “Now we understand that Siddi Sambal resides at the East India House where like the hedge-hog he hath nestled himself and, liking his lodging, intends to stay there whether we will or no.” Such was the position of the English during this period and the brave words that have been handed down to us about their EUROPEANS IN INDIA 175 prowess did not, as we have seen, have their counterpart in deeds. We may conclude this chapter by recalling the observations of a few contemporary Europeans in India on the character and achievements of Shivaji. Some of them were his ardent admir- ers, while others were not, but all were agreed that he was an Olympian figure. In his History of Shivaji Abbe Carre says that the Maratha King encouraged Europeans as a deliberate policy of his government in order to promote the commerce of his realm. His ports were hospitable to their ships. “I pas- sed,” says this foreigner, “that way in 1668 with two ships of the Company and we were treated in a manner which was be- yond our expectation.” The same authority points out that Shivaji was equally popu- lar with “tradesmen and toiling merchants’' whose praise he won by “his method of governing and making men's minds yield to it”. We are further told that, although he possessed outstanding military abilities, he did not always draw the sword because he knew “more than one way of reaching his goal”. He was in fact one who could rightly be placed among the grea- test men in the world. Cosme da Guarda, another contem- porary, was a sincere admirer of Shivaji whose sense of justice and fairplay he recorded with great enthusiasm. Shivaji administered justice to high and low alike with scrupulous impartiality so that his uprightness “made his subjects ever happy and his fame rose to such a height throughout Hindustan that it became as dreaded as it was cherished".

CHAPTER 10 THE STATE Shivaji’s dominion was not large, but it was administered with great efficiency, imagination and benevolence. In the troubled conditions of his times, with the Moghuls constantly knocking at his door, the boundaries of his realm could not be firmly or finally fixed, but, according to Ramchandra Nilkanth, his Accountant General for ten years, the area of swarajya or the kingdom outside Muslim jurisdiction, extended from Salher and Ahiwant in West Khandesh in the modern State of Maha- rashtra to Tanjore deep in the south. Sarkar gives a more pre- cise version of the extent of Shivaji’s kingdom at the time of his death. It included all the country (except the Portuguese pos- sessions) stretching from Ramnagar in Gujarat in the north, to Karwar or the Gangavali river in the Mysore district of Kanara in the south. The eastern boundary covered Baglana in the north and, running southwards along a fluctuating line through Nasik and Poona districts, embraced the entire Satara dis- trict, besides large portions of the Kolhapur region. A third territory comprised western Kamatak, extending from Belgaum and reaching the banks of the Tungabhadra in the present administrative district of Bellary in Mysore State. In addition, his conquests in the south covered a considerable area yielding, according to Sabhasad, an annual revenue of twenty lakh horn, but his premature death and the descent of Emperor Aurangzeb on the Deccan in person in less than two years after this tragic event, gave no opportunity to the Maratha Government to con- solidate Shivaji’s gains in the south. It is difficult to assess the actual revenues that were derived by the new state, but they are estimated to have amounted to seven crores of rupees annually, although the actual realiza- tions in some years were likely to have been less. For the convenience of administration and taxation the kingdom was divided into provinces and placed in charge of able and ex- perienced governors. To draw again upon Sarkar’s study, the 178 SHIYAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT northern province consisted of the Dangs and Baglana, the Koli country south of Surat, the Konkan north of Bombay, and the Deccan plateau south of Poona. This vital region was placed ia charge of Moro Trimbak Pingle. The Konkan region south of Bombay, Savantwadi and the coastal territory of north Kanara, formed the southern satraphy and was administered by Annaji Datto, another sagacious lieute- nant of Shivaji. The third division consisted of the districts of Satara and Kolhapur, besides the large and fertile territory extending from Belgaum to the banks of the river Tungabhadra, including Dharwar district. The government of this pro- vince was entrusted to Dattajipant Kaknis. The unsettled southern province of Tanjore was placed in charge of the king’s son-in-law, Harji Mahadik. The far-flung realm of Shivaji was effectively guarded by 240 forts of which as many as 111 were built in his lifetime. Seventynine of the strongholds under his jurisdiction were situated in the southern province of Madras, Shivaji looked upon his forts almost with reverence and propagated their value among his followers by elevating them to the status of a mother. His respect and affection for them were indeed well founded since his historic career was heralded by the capture of the fort of Toma in 1647. Sheltered by the massive Sahyadri mountains, a considerable length of whose ranges was ideally suited for the construction of defensive for- tresses, Maharashtra offered no easy access to the invaders. An eighteenth century foreign observer says that the govern- ment of the Peshwas extended over “a country of great natural strength, interspersed with mountains and defiles, all of which are defended by fortresses that are reserved as depots for trea- sure, or as retreats in the event of ill success or defeat”. The writer holds that “perhaps no country on earth is better calcu- lated for the purposes of defensive war”. Generation after generation of soldiers and strategists had watched with unseeing eyes the inestimable value of this ter- rain for unfurling the flag of freedom. It was, however, left to the genius of Shivaji to take full advantage of the natural strength of the country around him and to train his followers THE STATE 179 in a mode of warfare, in which skill, resourcefulness and initia- tive could be far more effective than mere physical strength or superiority of numbers. The forts held a vital place in these Parthian methods of engaging the enemy. They provided much more than mere shelter from the pressure of the invading armies and served as a dependable shield against total defeat and annihilation. In- deed, during the early years of Maratha uprising the usefulness of the forts was inestimable. The scaling of forts with agility in order to recover them speedily in the event of their falling into enemy hands, became a necessary qualification for the pro- fession of arms in Shivaji’s army. As we shall see in the next chapter, even the most impregnable fortresses were captured by his men with comparative ease, so that the Marathas became justly famous in this mode of warfare. Shivaji was endowed with an uncommonly keen perception in assessing the strategic value of a place. Both the situation and the structure of the new forts built by him amply bear this out. Many of his famous fortresses were built on hilltops, flat and rain-drenched, so that, besides providing the means for the maintenance of a large garrison, they could hurl defiance at the invaders for an almost indefinite length of time. Shivaji was well served by his engineers in making such lofty expanses really impregnable. Moro Trimbak Pingle, his Peshwa, was a man endowed with versatile talents; he was an accomplished soldier, a shrewd diplomatist and a competent administrator. To these inestimable abilities he joined the skill of a military engineer. Soon after the capture of Torna he built in its vici- nity the hill-fortress of Rajgad which for long years remained the premier town of Maharashtra till the capital was shifted to Raigad. The same talented man was commissioned to build Pratapgad soon after the annexation of Javli from the Mores. The new capital of Shivaji, Raigad, soon won distinction as the Gibraltar of the East Another observer, also a foreigner, is even more enthusiastic in his appreciation of its strength. He says that Raigad was “the most completely impregnable place in the universe, for the enclosure of it is large enough, 180 SHIVAJX : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT independent of the stores accumulated there, to grow grain sufficient for the maintenance of its garrison, which, were it but a handful of men, could with pleasure defend it against the greatest armies that could be brought to take it”. Every care was taken to ensure that the fortifications fulfilled the most exacting requirements of defence. The skill of the engineer was not always accepted as final. Khafi Khan narrates an interesting story as to how Shivaji tested the strength of the ramparts of his capital. When his engineers announced the completion of their work, he invited his followers to win a gold bracelet by scaling the hill-fort without the aid of a rope. An intrepid Maratha won the reward as well as royal appreciation by accomplishing the feat. The route followed by him was promptly sealed off with appropriate defensive walls. Another resourceful person, this time a woman, exposed a similar weakness in the fortification by scrambling down the precipice in order to reach her home at the foot of the fort after its massive doors had been closed for the night. The exploits of the lady, who was a milk-woman, were duly reported to Shivaji who showed his admiration for her by kindly words and generous presents. The discovered loophole was also duly blocked. The result of such labour and vigilance in ensuring the soundness of the defences was most satisfying. Foreign observers were impressed with the skill and ingenuity of Maratha builders and we have one such testimony, based on an inspection of the fortification of the fort of Jinji in the south. According to one of them, Shivaji “constructed new ramparts round Jinji, dug ditches, raised towers and bastions, and carried out all these works with a perfection of which European skill would not have been ashamed”. The Maratha king devoted the same care and spent enormous sums of money on the construction of his sea-forts. Sindhudurg was the premier stronghold of its kind and deserved the panegy- rist's description that it was like a luminous star in the firma- ment. Three thousand skilled men laboured for three years to raise the stupendous fortress towards the construction of which Shivaji sanctioned as much as one crore of horn. THE STATE 181 It is only to be expected that Shivaji exercised the utmost care in organizing the defence and the management of his forts. Three senior officers, all of proved ability and integrity, were appointed to guard and administer each fort. It was the func- tion of the havaldar or commandant, who was invariably a Maratha of good standing, to provide for the security of the fort, to keep a watchful eye over the duties and responsibilities of his subordinates in the combatant service, and to carry on correspondence with the government. No laxity in the per- formance of his duties was permitted and defaulting command- ants were severely punished. Shivaji’s visits to his forts were frequent and most often they were unheralded. It is a measure of his stem sense of discipline that he did not either desire or countenance any relaxation of the rules laid down for the administration of the forts even in his own case. It was the duty of the commandant to close the doors of his fort before nightfall each day and not to open them on any account till the prescribed hour of the following morning. The king repeatedly tested his officers by himself appearing before their forts and seeking admission during the prohibited hours. It required more than ordinary courage for a havaldar to refuse admission to his own monarch and in the conflict between his sense of duty and the need for obedience, the latter was some times allowed to prevail. Such unfortunate men were either severely censured or punished. There were, however, some who were made of sterner stuff and one of them was the commandant of the fort of Panhala. A heart-warming anecdote is told about him. One day, Shivaji presented himself before the fort after the gates had been clos- ed, demanding to be let in. The havaldar, who was sent for, politely but resolutely refused, saying that admission into the would be possible only on the following morning. Shivaji pleaded that he could not possibly allow himself to be captured by the enemy who were, he said, hotly in his pursuit. The commandant was, however, unmoved and promised to protect his master by stationing his men on the ramparts so that no enemy troops could come close to the fort wall. At the same 182 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT time, he lowered a cot and a bedding, requesting the king to retire for the night in the porch outside, with complete confi- dence in the ability of his servants to protect his life ! Shivaji was gratified and showed his appreciation of his subordinate’s steadfast devotion to duty by holding him up as an exemplar, besides rewarding him generously. Phirangoji Narsala, it will be recalled, was a valiant defender of the fort of Chakan when it was attacked by Shaista Khan’s imperial forces. Appointed to the command of Bhupalgad, he showed less energy and determination in defending it against the Moghuls in 1679. The reasons for his seemingly strange behaviour were, however, not personal. On this occasion, the fort under his command was attacked by no less a person than Sambhaji, who had, to the detriment of his good name, defect- ed to the Moghuls. Narsala refrained from opening fire on the enemy troops, fearing danger to the life of the heir-apparent, and thus made it easy for the invaders to capture the fort. Shivaji could see the dilemma of this seasoned and trusted servant of the state, but did not forgive him for his weakness. The unhappy Narsala was severely reprimanded “for not firing on Sambhaji and putting such a sinner to death”. Such was the Maratha King’s stem sense of duty and rectitude. The second senior officer of a fort was the Sabnis who ex- ercised the power of the purse. This officer was a Brahmin who was charged with the responsibility of regulating the ex- penditure and keeping a proper account of all financial tran- sactions. He also maintained the muster roll of the garrison. The third officer was the Karkhanis, a Prabhu, who was charged with the responsibility of maintaining adequate reserves of stores of all kinds required by the garrison and of ensuring an equitable supply. His duties were many and varied and often dovetailed into those of his other two colleagues in order to promote co-operation and interdependence among the principal officers of the fort. Shivaji showed his customary caution and shrewdness in the choice of his men for key positions. Like Hanfeitse, the great Chinese sage who lived many centuries before him, he realized THE STATE 183 the unwisdom of expecting people to be good and, therefore, concerted measures to “make it impossible for them to be bad”. But the appointment of the Marathas, the Brahmins and the Prabhus to responsible offices was not entirely governed by the doctrine of counterpoise. Perhaps, the more important reason why Shivaji drew so liberally and impartially upon these three major sections of the community was that he wished to create the most spacious opportunities for talent. Indeed, a free career to ability and enterprise never failed to appeal to him. His catholic mind and his wide-ranging vision accepted no artificial or absurd constraints on the choice of his men. The Mahars and Muslims and men of other faiths and social gradations were all welcom- ed into service so long as they satisfied the criteria of ability and integrity. His prejudice was, therefore, not against any religion or caste, but against incompetence and disloyalty— a principle the wholesome implications of which have still to be fully appreciated in the India of our own times. The commandant of a fort and his colleagues were liable to transfer so that the scope for intrigue and for the creation of vested interests was minimized. In fact, Shivaji did not allow the hereditary system, the enemy of efficiency and progress, to weaken his administration. No office could be handed down from father to son unless the new incumbent deserved it. Such precautions, about which we will write more later, greatly helped Shivaji to maintain his government at a high level of efficiency. It was precisely because most of his officers shared his patriotism and enthusiasm for noble causes that no reverses, however frequent and devastating, could deflect them from the pursuit of their appointed tasks. The fall of the forts in particular was considered worse than a disaster and no sacrifice was considered too great to wipe out the “disgrace”. The Queen-Mother, Jijabai, did not hesi- tate to send the brave Tanaji Malusare to his doom when she peremptorily demanded her son to wrest the Lion Fort from the hands of the Moghuls. The affection with which the forts were looked upon and the fervour and determination with 184 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT which they were defended did not long survive Shivaji’s death. The elaborate safeguards devised by him for their defence and management were not scrupulously adhered to or enforced so that during the reign of Rajaram, his younger son, many of the senior officers of his government gained possession of them, virtually treating them as their personal property. In 1710-11, for instance, Parashurampant Pratinidhi alone controlled as many as thirty-five forts, including such famous ones as Vishal- gad and Pratapgad. Shivaji showed the same foresight in organizing his army. At the commencement of his career his striking force consisted mostly of foot-soldiers drawn from the hardy hill-men in the neighbourhood of Poona. At no time did he feel a dearth of recruits to his army since his movement of liberation strongly appealed to young and old alike. The flower of Maharashtra’s youth was at his disposal, as also the enthusiastic support of the elderly members of the community. The sturdy-limbed and stout-hearted Mavlas flocked to his standard, often taking with them their horses, swords, spears and shields, in wielding which they were second to none. They were, as Grant Duff observes, “active, intelligent and remarkably faithful in situations of trust”. The mode of warfare for which they were trained was most effective, especially in the early years of the freedom movement. Creeping noiselessly close to the enemy under cover of the hills, valleys and forests, the Maratha troops struck suddenly at a bewildered enemy, raising at the same time the famous war-cry “Har Har Mahadev”, which, reverberating like thunder from the lofty mountains and the deep valleys, created the illusion and fear that the number of attackers was indeed unlimited. Thus, slowly and steadily, the Maratha soldiers under Shivaji gained confidence and ability to launch both offensive and defensive warfare. Shivaji’s cavalry was extremely small when he unfurled the flag of freedom. It consisted of 1,200 household troopers and 2,000 volunteers of shiledars who brought their own arms and mounts with them. The conquest of Javli in 1656, besides THE STATE 185 bringing him large territories and revenues, gave him access to a large reservoir of manpower. In the result, the number of State cavalry rose to 7,000, while that of the shiledar to 3,000. The infantry was 10,000 strong. Two years later, he took the momentous step of recruiting 700 Pathans to his infantry, in response to the earnest plea of Gomaji Naik, an old retainer of his maternal grandfather, Jadhavarao of Sindkhed. The Pathan contingent, which had been in the employ of the Bijapur Darbar, was now placed under a Brahmin commander, Raghunath Ballal, the man who had played a leading part in the destruction of the Mores of Javli. Ramchandra Nilkanth, the amatya, whom we have quoted earlier, has recorded that Shivaji’s state cavalry was 40,000 strong, in addition to some 70,000 shiledars. His infantry, ac- cording to this chronicler, was as numerous as 200,000. The striking force of the Marathas during the King’s lifetime may well be reckoned at 40,000 state .troopers, besides twice that number of foot-soldiers. Their arms consisted of swords, spears and muskets, and the deficiency of an effective park of artillery remained their permanent infirmity. According to Sabhasad, Shivaji’s elephants numbered 1,260, which is regard- ed by some writers as an exaggerated figure. His camel corps was 3,000 strong. Shivaji believed in unity of command and created a cadre of officers in his army to enforce discipline and ejfficiency both on the battlefield and in the cantonment The gradations were not as numerous as in a modern army—from subaltern to Field- Marshal—but the ranks that were created were adequate to en- sure the effectiveness of the combatant service. The officer grade in the cavalry arm began with the havcddar, who com- manded a body of twenty-five horsemen. Next in rank was the jumladar, who held command over five such units, number- ing broadly 125 troopers. Over him was the hazari, who con- trolled ten jumlas. The panchhazari, an expressive name, may be likened in rank to the present-day Lieutenant-General. On top of the cadre was the Sarnobat or the Commander-in-Chief, who became the confidant and counsellor of the King, with a 186 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT place in the Ashta Pradhan or the Cabinet of Eight Ministers. With some important modifications, the infantry branch of the armed forces was similarly organized, although the emoluments of the foot-soldiers and their officers were less than those paid to their mounted comrades. A number of civil officers were attached to the army for administrative purposes and consisted, among others, of accountants and newswriters. Shivaji paid his officers and men well and regularly. The Jumladar of the cavalry received 500 hons a year, the Hazari 1,000 hons and the panchhazari, 2,000 hons. The purchasing power of the hon, the value of which varied from four to five rupees, was enormous so that the emoluments paid to the ser- vants of Shivaji’s Government were quite good. Apart from their annual salaries, the officers received various honours be- fitting their rank and responsibilities. Familiar among the pri- vileges enjoyed by them was the use of the palanquin and the umbrella. In the infantry, the jumladar was paid 100 hons and the hazari 500 hons. The havaldar of a fort, it is presumed, was paid a salary of 125 hons. Apart from the regular infantry, Shivaji raised a guard brigade of 2,000 Maratha foot-soldiers who were selected specially for their manly bearing and intre- pidity. They were given gorgeous uniforms and excellent wea- pons at great cost to the government. Shivaji was* an implacable opponent of hereditary rights and vested interest^ {especially when their existence militated against the security and progress of the state. It was a cardi- nal principle of his state policy that the emoluments of his subordinates should be fixed and paid regularly—sometimes partly in cash and partly in kind. The second mode of payment entailed no hardship to the recipients since a large segment of the economy of the time was still non-monetary. Since no ser- vice was hereditary, no permanent jagirs were granted to his officers. Even his closest kinsmen were not exempted from this rule. We read, for instance, that Pilaji Shirke, Shivaji’s son-in- law, asked for the grant of hereditary deshmukhi rights to him in the town of Dabhol as a reward for rendering meritorious services to the state. Shivaji tactfully but firmly declined to de- THE STATE 187 part from the law of the land, although he was himself the law- maker. Shivaji saw with his own eyes the evils of the jagir system since it flourished, though in different forms, both under the Moghuls and in the Bijapur darbar. The military commanders of these governments were almost always overtaken by a seri- ous financial embarrassment so that their troops were often sullen and disaffected. Shivaji effectively prevented this malady from gaining possession of the body politic of his state. His officers were paid regularly from the central or provincial re- venues. On no account was an official permitted to collect his salary direct from the revenue of either the principal or the subordinate governments. Payments were made only by autho- rized persons. If a land had been granted to him, the govern- ment dues were deducted from his salary and the balance was paid to him. In fact, Shivaji waged a relentless war against conditions that fostered the growth of the pernicious system of imperium in imperio. He sternly suppressed the petty barons in whom the country abounded and whose continued existence, with all their privileges and pretensions, constituted a serious menace to the state. He dismantled their castles, confiscated their properties, and enlisted the more discerning and patriotic ones among them in the service of his government. His administration was in every sense strong, clean and efficient. Naturally, he laid great stress on military service, but at the same time he inter- dicted any intervention of the army in the affairs of the civil government. Shivaji showed keen interest in the recruitment of officers and men to his army. His uncanny ability to select the right type of man in his service was of inestimable value to him in in his wars against the Moghuls and the Sultans of Bijapur. He was equally meticulous in the choice of the horses for his cavalry so that his army soon became famous for the celerity of its movement. Lightly armed and equipped, the Maratha horse- men were able to cover forty to fifty miles a day, while the 188 shivaji : the portrait of a patriot heavily encumbered armies of the imperialists and of Bijapur found movement of any kind most painful. Accustomed to a simple and frugal way of life, the Maratha soldiers could live cheerfully on whatever fare and amenities they could secure from the provinces they invaded. Shivaji himself set an example in such simplicity. He forbade to him- self the luxuries that were not given to his men. Foreign ob- servers both at Surat and in the south were amazed at the King indifference to ostentation and to the seductions of an easy and comfortable life. He was a great captain who, like many of his famous equals that preceded and followed him both in his own country and in foreign lands, fully shared the trials and tribulations and the dangers of camp life with his troops, thus winning their unstinted loyalty and devotion to his person and cause. « After Shivaji's death, the Marathas lost many of the virtues which he had so assiduously taught them, but their democratic spirit and their innate love of simplicity remained in their fight- ing forces till the last. It was quite common to observe mighty chieftains on the battlefield, upon whose valour and judgment the issues of success and defeat depended, besides the lives of hundreds of thousands of combatants, and others, performing the most humble chores at the end of the day without the slightest consciousness of their dignity or status. It was not derogatory to their honour to assist their orderlies in kindling the fire to keep themselves and their companions-at-arms warm during the night. For instance, a distinguished man was ob- served to sit on the ground on a spread saddle-cloth, “dictating to his secretaries and otherwise discharging the political duties of his station”. This “primeval plainness” had the most salu- tary and decisive influence on the discipline and outlook of the entire army. Sir John Malcolm, who played the memorable role of per- forming the obsequies of the Maratha Empire by compelling the abdication of the last Peshwa, Bajirao, in June 1818, had intimate knowledge of the Maratha troops, although the pic- ture presented by them in his time was certainly not the bright- THE STATE 189 est. He wrote thus about the Maratha soldier: “Few could claim superiority to him in patience under fatigue, hunger, and thirst, and in that plain manliness of character which remained unchanged by success or adversity: nor can we deny to the Mahrattas, in the early part of their history, and before their extensive conquests had made their vast and mixed armies cease to be national, the merit of conducting their Cossack in- roads into other countries with a consideration to the inhabi- tants, which had been deemed incompatible with that terrible and destructive species of war." Such a high tribute was indeed well deserved. The Marathas did not depend entirely upon mere physical prowess. Under the resourceful leadership of their master they made free use of skill and strategy, to which were added certain sterling moral principles. They lived for eight months in a year out- side their home territories and were disciplined to observe cer- tain norms of conduct violation of which involved severe punishment. First, all the spoils collected during their expedition were required to be made over to the state, the troops retaining no- thing for their personal use. Secondly, women, places of wor- ship, cows and sacred books were not to be insulted on any account. Indeed, this rule was enforced with such strictness that “a brave Mughal governor once deemed it safe to leave in a woman’s garb when the Marathas appeared at the gates of his city”. Shivaji was equally insistent that no soldier should take with him his wife or any other woman during the military expeditions. It is precisely because the Marathas under Shivaji were train- ed to be considerate and respectful towards the civilian popu- lation and to observe certain commendable standards of beha- viour that their expeditions were not regarded as a calamity. “In their first invasion of Central India,” writes Sir John Mal- colm, “the war the Mahrattas carried on was evidently against the Government, and not the inhabitants. They appear, at this stage of their power, to have taken a large share of the revenue, but not to have destroyed, like more barbarous invaders, the 190 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT source from which it was drawn, for if they had, it could not have recovered so rapidly, as we find from revenue records that it did. But there is in the whole of the proceedings of this period, the strongest ground to conclude, that they were acting with the concurrence and aid of the Hindu chiefs of the empire, whose just reasons for discontent with the reigning monarch, Aurangzebe, have been noticed.” Lastly, Shivaji and his men were animated by a high sense of mission which helped them face their difficulties with a stout heart Compared to the military resources and equipment of the .imperialists and the Sultans of Bijapur, their own means were incredibly inadequate, but they overcame this serious handicap through superior discipline, greater mobility and hardihpod and, what is more important, from the conviction that their cause was just and noble. The potency of patriotism has been repeatedly proved in history. The Anglo-Nepalese War may be cited as an instance in point. Though hopelessly out- numbered and equipped with the most primitive weapons, the humble hill-men of the Himalayas, who had never known mili- tary training or discipline, fought the mighty forces of the East India Company, led by renowned British generals, with such skill and doggedness that the campaign of 1814-15 electrified the entire country, with people in far-off places watching its fortunes with bated breath. Writing with evident consternation at British discomfiture, Sir Charles Metcalfe declared: “We have met an enemy who shows decidedly greater bravery and greater steadiness than our troops possess; and it is impossible to say what may be the end of such a reverse of the order of things. In some instances, our troops, European and native, have been repulsed by infe- rior numbers with sticks and stones. In others, our troops have been charged by the enemy sword in hand, and driven for miles like a flock of sheep Our power rested solely on our military superiority. With respect to one enemy, that is gone. In this war, dreadful to say, we have had numbers on our side, and skill and bravery on the side of our enemy.” In the bitter, long-drawn-out and sanguinary conflict between THE STATE 191 the Marathas and the Moghuls, the plight of the imperialists was precisely like that of the British. The Marathas in their turn eventually lost their military supremacy and gave place to a foreign power when, according to some writers, their armies were deprived of their homogeneity and national spirit. Apart from the land revenue, an important source of income for the Maratha Government was chouth and sardeshmukhi. Chouth, representing twenty-five per cent, of the standard assessment of the land revenue, was collected by the Marathas from the subjects of other states. The levy was not their in- vention, since it had been in vogue earlier and was employed as a source of revenue by some of the principalities, including Dharampur. Like Lord Wellesley, who transformed an undefin- ed subsidiary system into a potent political instrument by per- fecting it, Shivaji made chouth a famous impost by systematiz- ing its levy. Chouth was not an instrument of oppression, but a payment that exempted the contributing region from Maratha invasion. The primary object of its collection was revenue, since Maharashtra’s own resources were totally inadequate to finance a costly war against the imperialists and Bijapur. The superb intelligence service of Shivaji, which played no small part in his successful military campaigns, safeguarded against oppressive exactions, since the Maratha Government was plac- ed in full possession of the economic condition of the regions visited by its armies. Many instances have been recorded where towns and districts that were scheduled to pay the full amount of the chouth were permitted to contribute a much smaller sum. Apart from the necessity of increasing his revenue by the only means available to him, Shivaji, according to all impartial testimony, was fully entitled to collect chouth from unfriendly states as a political measure. To quote Sir John Malcolm again: “The contests carried on by Shivaji and his successors did not differ more from those of other nations in the mode of warfare, than in the manner in which the army was paid, its commanders rewarded, and the different countries they invad- ed, were plundered, divided and settled.” The same authority 192 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT has been quoted earlier to show that the incidence of the levy was not extortionate. Sardeshmukhi was not a noteworthy impost and was confined to some areas of the Deccan, over which Shivaji claimed revenue rights, based on the assertion that he was their Sardeshmukh. Shivaji’s navy was not as formidable as his land armies were. His most cherished ambition of conquering Janjira by crushing the Siddis remained unfulfilled. Apart from their great sea- faring abilities, the Siddis operated on the waters of the Arabian Sea with the support and sanction of either the Bijapur Gov- ernment or the Imperialists. As on land, Shivaji’s exertions on the seas were wholly unaided, their success depending en- tirely upon his own initiative and enterprise. Being locked in mortal combat with the Imperialists and the Adil- shahs on land, he could not devote the time and money that were essential for the construction of a powerful navy. Nevertheless, his achievements in that direction were im- pressive. Perhaps, his most noteworthy contribution to the naval history of western India is that he broke the shackles of superstition by destroying the Hindu prejudice against sea voyage. It was not within his means to revive the glorious maritime traditions of ancient or medieval times, when Indian vessels roamed the high seas in their hundreds, carrying the merchandise and the culture of this country to distant lands, but by building his own ships and launching them both for trade and war, he made it possible for his people to defend their hearths and homes in the coastal Konkan and to partici- pate, however modestly, in the maritime trade. In contrast, the helplessness of the Moghuls on the seas was complete. Old chroniclers like Sabhasad and Chitnis have given different accounts about the number of ships built by Shivaji. Their estimates range from 400 to 500 vessels. It is, however, gene- rally believed that his navy consisted of a fleet of 200 fighting vessels of varying size and effectiveness. They ranged from the fragile dug-out vessels to stately three-masted ghurabs. The biggest warship weighed between 150 tons and 300 tons and both for its seaworthiness and usefulness in naval warfare it THE STATE 193 compared favourably with the Portuguese and the English fri- gates of those times. The battleships were equipped with two big guns and twelve to sixteen smaller ones, but their firing power was rather limited. The cannon cast in Indian foundries was woefully defective, while that of foreign manufacture was seldom available. A ghurab was generally manned by some 150 fighting men whose modes of engaging the enemy were almost similar to land warfare. The gallivats were better suit- ed for manoeuvrability and formed the backbone of the Maratha navy. They were two-masted rowing boats capable of gather- ing good speed. Many of the senior commanders of Shivaji’s navy were Muslims who served him with as much courage, determination and fidelity as his own co-religionists. The names of Daulat Khan and Siddi Misri, among others, have come down to us as the men who made the Maratha cause their own. After Shivaji's death the command of the Maratha navy passed into the competent hands of Kanhoji Angre and his successors. The Angres won a great reputation as sea-captains and were both respected and feared by the maritime powers on the west coast, both Indian and European. Indeed, by their daring exploits the Angres have won an honoured place in the maritime history of India. Shivaji’s land revenue system was based on the time-honour- ed belief and conviction that the peasant was, as he still is, the country’s backbone. He was not only the tiller of the soil, but the' swordarm of the state. His contentment and well-be- ing, therefore, claimed the magnitude of state policy in Shivaji’s administration. Competent observers have recorded that the fanners were happy under his government. The basic features of his land revenue administration were derived from the dis- positions of his preceptor, Dadaji Konddev, who, in his turn, was influenced by the measures of the great Muslim statesman of the Nizamshahi Government,- Malik Ambar. Though a foreigner, this sagacious man did for the Deccan peasantry what Akbar’s Minister,: / Todar Mai, did for that of north India, “lake Todar MalM -, says Dr. Sen, “he divided the arable lands 194 SHIVAjx: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT into four separate classes according to fertility and ascertained their produce, roughly it is true, and fixed the assessment once for all. He, however, did not want the peasants to pay in kind.” He reorganized the agency for revenue collection and made the offices of the Patil and other village officials heredi- tary, charging them with the responsibility for ensuring the collection of the government dues in full. Shivaji improved upon this system in many ways. The culti-, vable area of every village was carefully noted and the extent of each plot of land was measured, not with the traditional .rope or chain, but with a standard measuring rod. Assessment was determined on the basis of the fertility of the soil. “An esti- mate,” we are informed, “was made of the expected produce of each bigha, three parts of which were left to the peasant and two parts taken by the state.” Extension of agricultural opera- tions was encouraged by distributing seeds among the pioneer- ing peasants and buying cattle for them. Loans granted for such purposes were recovered by easy instalments and exemp- tions from payment were liberally given during bad seasons. Shivaji made a clean sweep of all intermediaries and put an end to the widespread evil of tax-farming by bringing the pea- sent in direct relations with the revenue officials of the central government. The village officers, namely, the Patils, the Kul- karnis and the Deshmukhs, were not given a carte blanche in the matter of revenue collections, although they performed, other duties and received their emoluments as before. It was a salutary check, since under the Moghuls and the Deccan Sul- tans. it had become customary for the village officers to appro- priate the bulk of the collections for their own use, remitting only a negligible portion of the revenue to the government. It was with the aid of such ill-gotten resources that they grew in strength which they often employed to, defy the central authority. Shivaji rendered them ineffective by organising his administration on a more efficient basis. Besides providing for the management, of the forte, as des- cribed earlier,; Shivaji' sub-divided the provinces into subhas and, mahals, very much in the manner Of the present-day district THE STATE 195 and taluka administration. The average revenue of a mahal ranged from three-fourths of a lakh to over one lakh of rupees. A subha consisted of two or three such mahals. The head of the subha was called Subhadar, who was a man of considerable prestige and one who enjoyed the full confidence of the central government. His annual salary was 400 hons. Apart from his other duties, it was the function of this officer and his sub- ordinates in the mahds, known as the Mahalkaris, to adminis- ter the land revenue within their jurisdiction. Two or three villages were grouped together and placed in charge of an offi- cial called the Kamavisdar, who directly collected the land re- venue under the direction of the mahal and the Subha revenue officers. .Shivaji, who was deeply nurtured in the traditions of ancient India, was evidently aware of the injunction of the text- book writers that taxes should be collected in the same man- ner as the bee gathers honey from flowers. Indeed, his land revenue policy worked well and conduced to the growth of the' population of his kingdom and its prosperity. ‘ The complex machinery of government, civil and military, de- vised by Shivaji was sustained by his unique personality. It needed his personal guidance and authority for its efficient operation, but the growing burdens of an administration that differed fundamentally from the prevailing ones called for the assistance of a team of seasoned officials who could be trusted to carry out loyally and diligently the policies and programmes prescribed by the king. Shivaji was generously endowed with the. capacity for masterful leadership, but in the wider interests of his cause he always associated wise and experienced men in his undertakings. He was both humble and sagacious enough to realize the manifest absurdity of any ruler claiming himself to be the state. . -'All the Talmud of interpretation that has been built around the famous Ashta JPradhan system would have been found to be i.wholly unnecessary if this simple fact had been recognized. The Ashta JPradhan was neither, a cabinet in the modem sense of the. terM, consisting of eight duly elected ministers answer- able to a cqnstitutional king, nor was it a cabal of clever offi-’ 196 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT cials created with the object of advancing the personal inter- ests of a despot. It was simply an institution which, far horn divesting the king of his unlimited powers, helped him in exer- cising them with wisdom and moderation and with a view to promoting the well-being of the people. The powers entrusted to each member of the Ashta Pradhan support this point of view. Shivaji did not begin his kingly responsibilities with eight ministers around him. In fact, that number was not reached till 1674, that is, barely six years before his death. Chief in this team of expert advisers and executives was the Peshwa or the prime minister. It was undoubtedly a position of great responsibility and dignity. The government of the realm was conducted under the orders of the Peshwa during the king’s absence. He was to supervise the working of the administra- tion and to ensure its efficiency. All letters and charters issued by the king bore the seal of the Peshwa. The times demanded that the chief minister should also be a man of the sword and lead armies against the enemy. His salary was commensurate with his standing as the first servant of the state and amounted to 15,000 hons a year. The Majumdar or Amatya performed the role of the present- day auditor-general and carefully checked the income and ex- penditure of the government. He kept the king fully informed about the financial position of the administration. It was the duty of the Waknis or the Mantri to compile a careful and comprehensive daily record of the activities of the king and of the members of the royal family, besides function- ing as master of ceremonies. He was required to exercise a careful watch over the men that were invited to meet the king and to lunch or dine with him. The fourth officer was the Sachiv, known in Persian as Sutras. He was in charge of the king’s correspondence and ensured that both in content and in style it conformed to royal wishes and the convention of the. times. His seal of approval was essential on all the correspondence of the king. He was in addition called upon to check the accounts of the provinces. THE STATE 197 The foreign secretary was called Sumant, its Persian equi- valent being Ddbir. He advised his sovereign on foreign affairs and received ambassadors from other states on behalf of his government. He was to keep himself fully informed about tiie happenings outside the realm and to ensure that the gov- ernment of his master was held in high esteem at other courts. The duties of the Panditrao were to promote learning and in the Ashta Pradhan. Know as Senapati or Sarnobat, he was to watch over the interests of his officers and men with the unsleeping eyes of Argus. The troops must be in the highest state of efficiency and measures designed to promote this end should be promptly adopted. The Commander-in-Chief should keep the king fully posted with the happenings in his depart- ment. He should also lead his armies in war and arrange for the integration of the conquered territories into the realm. The duties of the Panditrao were to promote learning and piety in the land and to reward scholarship generously. Men devoted to the pursuit and the propagation of knowledge and enlightenment should never bo allowed to suffer destitution or seek asylum outside the state for their livelihood. Besides, he should attract scholars from the rest of the country and suit- ably reward them for their attainments. He also settled reli- gious disputes and generally ensured that the theological in- junctions laid down for the governance of the society were scrupulously observed. The Nyayadish was the highest judicial authority in the kingdom and settled both civil and criminal cases that were brought in appeal before him. The village panchayats, which enjoyed considerable local autonomy settled most of the dis- putes that arose in their villages. All the ministers of the Ashta Pradhan, with the exception of the last two, namely, the Panditrao and the Nyayadish, were required to be on active service, should such a need arise, so that they were proficient as much in the arts of war as in the arts of peace. Everyone of the officers appointed by Shivaji to these responsible positions performed his duties with exem- plary devotion and ability. Besides these men, he was ably 198 SHXVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT served by his personal secretary, Balaji Avji, whose quiet com- petence and attachment to his master have won for him a unique place in the Maratha history. Nila Prabhu, Shivaji’s Persian Secretary, distinguished himself for his penmanship and the letter of protest against Aurangzeb’s intolerance, drafted by him for his master, is remembered as much for its dignity and loftiness of sentiment as for its style. It was with the aid of such men, inspired by a sense of mis- sion, that Shivaji governed his country. But he remained the sole architect and builder of the mighty edifice of swarajya. He commanded the unswerving loyalty of his subordinates, the affection and admiration of his people and indeed of all dis- cerning men in the country, as much on account of his sterling character as his towering abilities. His administration was pure and efficient because he became widely known as an im- placable foe of every kind of jobbery, intrigue and dubious behaviour. He heartily hated the social drones that contribut- ed nothing to the common good but enjoyed large hereditary landed estates. He certainly did not seek to anticipate the socialist or welfare state of our modern conception, but by sincerely striving for the common weal, he unwittingly led his kingdom in that direction. His administration could justly claim this distinction because he was able to dismiss, to bor- row Burke’s famous phrase, “rank and office and title and all the solemn plausibilities of the world” as mere glitter without substance and devote his entire attention and energy to the well being of his people.

CHAPTER U THE COMRADES Among the many remarkable qualities with which Shivaji was endowed, the ability to attract talent was one. Like all great leaders, he had a natural capacity for separating the chaff from the grain. His shrewd and unerring judgment of men and things wag vastly helped by his training and outlook. Nothing escaped his penetrating perception. As the son of a prominent Sardar, with large estates in the countryside, he had ample opportunities for making a careful study of the quality and the character of the diverse elements that comprised the then Indian society. The Emperor and the Sultans were regarded as the supreme embodiments of God’s creation and their gratifica- tion and appeasement constituted the sumum bontim of the existence of their statellites. Few among the nobles that sur- rounded their monarchs had the courage of their convictions. As we saw earlier, the mental outlook of the Marathas till the advent of Shivaji as an exemplar of national resurgence was even more deplorable. There was nothing in their aspirations that was noble or heart-warming. They eagerly sold their swords either to the Sultans or to the Emperors, asking for nothing more elevating in return than jagirs for their personal enjoyment and a patronizing nod from their overlords. It is a moot point whether the numerous Maratha names, with which the pages of history are dotted, would have won any recogni- tion at all if there had been no Shivaji. In no country have ill- considered sacrifices been admired or cherished. It is incon- ceivable that men like Baji Prabhu and Tanaji Malusare would have won legendary fame if their heroic exploits and sacrifices had been made merely to sustain the status quo. Like the bloom of flowers in the wilderness going unnoticed, their great deeds would have been buried deep in the bowels of oblivion. Shivaji’s life and career have saved us from such a sterile vista of the past. It is a past that abounds in heroic and THE COMRADES 201 epoch-making episodes, not only in his own career, but also in that of his lieutenants, most of whom considered themselves twice blessed if they could lay down their lives in the service of their friend and leader. Indeed, the bonds of comradeship that united him to his men were of a quality that transcended the relations that normally subsist between a master and his subordinate. It was a unique relationship and had little in common with the one that existed, for example, between Aurangzeb and Mirza Raja Jai Singh. The Raja’s capacity for sacrifice on behalf of his sovereign was no less considerable, but it lacked the sublime quality that is derived from the championship of worthy causes. It is for this reason that we look upon this eminent Rajput, not as a person worthy of emulation, but as a tragic figure who wantonly or unwittingly spumed a distin- guished place in history by his failure to subordinate his self to the country’s wider interests. To cite another but a gene- ral and a relatively recent example, the sufferings and sacri- fices of generation after generation of Indian soldiers under British rule have not won the recognition they would undoub-' tedly have deserved had they been made for the liberation and the greater glory of their own motherland. The cause for which sacrifices are made is thus as important as the sacrifices themselves. Shivaji’s goal was just and noble, but no less attractive was his personality. His engaging appearance and magnetism, his sobriety, his resourcefulness, his concentration of purpose, his fearlessnes and his personal rectitude were qualities that deeply impressed his friends and foes alike. He abhorred ostentation and preferential treatment for himself. His deep and abiding love for the humble hillmen of Maharashtra, who constituted the backbone of his great movement, not only pro- tected him horn the perversities of the times, but also stimula- ted in him a true and healthy sense of values. Like many great military commanders, he spumed discrimi- natory amenities on the battlefield. He fought, ate and slept alongside his comrades, always placing himself before them as 202 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT a worthy example for emulation. Not for him were palaces of canvas in camp, provided with the choicest luxuries which the world of his time could produce- By his Spartan simplicity he stimulated the conviction among his troops that he went to. the front, not for self-indulgence, but to defeat the enemy. The contrast presented by the pomp and splendour of the Moghul camp was significant. The second outsanding characteristic of Shivaji was his fear- lessness and tireless energy. His courage became proverbial. In every engagement, where his personal appearance could decide the issue, he was always in the forefront, striking terror into the hearts of the enemy by his energetic attacks. He showed great sagacity and thoroughness in ascertaining through his superb intelligence service both the strength and the weak- ness of the opposing forces and fell upon them with relentless fury once he knew where to strike. His short and wiry frame was specially made to endure any fatigue. The celerity' of his movement and its secrecy deeply mystified and discomfited his enemies. His lightly-armed and fast-moving cavalry acquired undet-his' leadership and that of his lieutenant, Netaji Palkar, a felicity in manoeuvre and attack which proved most potent when dealing with slow-moving and heavily-equipped Moghul forces. Orme the well-known English historian, gives Shivaji the highest tribute by holding that in courage, resource- fulnes and quickness of. action he had few equals in his time. No general ever traversed as much ground as he did at the head of armies. "He met,” writes the historian, "every emergency of peril, however sudden and extreme, with instant discernment and unshaken fortitude. The ablest of his offi- cers acquiesced to the imminent superiority of his. genius,’ and the boast of the soldier was to have seen Shivaji charging sword in hand.” • In many ways’ Shivaji was the beau ideal of a soldier. -His courage and his ever-flowing combative energy filled his men and others with wonder, often stimulating them to similar feats of endurance and valour. He did not believe in measureless sacrifices in order to win evanescent victories. Unjustified car- THE COMRADES 203 nage invariably repelled him. It is precisely because his methods of warfare comprised an infinite variety of ruses and strategems that victory invariably crowned his exertions. To these inestimable qualities he added a moral gift of leadership that inspired, as in the case of Hannibal, the devoted loyalty of his troops. Shivaji, says Justice Ranade, “attracted towards himself all that was hopeful and aspiring in the land, without distinction of class or caste or creed or colour”. Few among the men that accepted his leadership proved faithless to him which, says the same distinguished authority, is “the highest privilege of genius”. Apart from other reasons, such loyalty was willingly rendered because the King watched over the interests of his sol- diers with the greatest care, whether they were in canton- ment or on the battlefield. Instructions were issued to the com- manders and the governors of his realm to bring to his notice the names of men who distinguished themselves in war. Such soldiers were promptly honoured either by increased remunera- tion or by promotion to the higher rank. Thus, every member of the armed forces was animated by the resolution to exert himself to the utmost in the cause of his king and country, being convinced that merit would always receive its due recog- nition sad reward. • “Shivaji,” says the Portuguese writer, Cosme da Guarda was “naturally loved by all men of valour and good conduct”. There was a reciprocal understanding and affection between him and his men so that the fighting apparatus created by him soon developed into a powerful people’s army, held together by a comifiunity of language, thought and sentiment. New leaders came to the fore, unreservedly placing their newly-discovered but considerable talents at the disposal of the state. A good number of them were like Berthier, Massena and Augereau, French commanders of humble, origin who owed their distinc- tion entirely to Napolean’s discovery of their abilities. Thousands of skilled and strong hands helped Shivaji in rearing the edifice of stoarajya. Men of all classes and creeds enthusiastically took part in the great enterprise of building a 204 SHIVAJI: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT new order in the country. The Pathan from the wilds of the North-West Frontier fought shoulder to shoulder with his Hindu comrade-in-arms in sustaining and strengthening the new crea- tion. The sea-faring Muslim from the Konkan was received with open arms in the Maratha navy and given positions of trust and responsibility without the slightest suspicion or fear that the ties of religion would triumph over his sense of loyalty and obligation. Indeed, the Muslim in the Maratha service had little to fear. He was assured of regular pay and promo- tion—a rare blessing, taking into account the bad record of the chronically impecunious Muslim governments—good and impar- tial treatment and a complete liberty of conscience. We have already referred to the brave defenders of the hill- forts among whom the names of Phirangoji Narsala and Murar Baji are justly famous. Indeed, the number of men who dis- tinguished themselves in Shivaji’s service was legion, but the rest of this chapter will be devoted to a brief description of the heroism displayed by Baji Prabhu and Tanaji Malusare during his lifetime and by Santaji Ghorpade after his death. Baji Prabhu was the Deshpande of Hirdas Maval and an adherent of the Mores of Javli till the principality was overrun in 1656 and annexed to Shivaji’s territories. At first it was im- .possible for Baji Prabhu to appreciate the rights and wrongs of the Javli episode, but it did not take him long to become an en- thusiastic supporter of the new movement in Maharashtra. The engaging radiance of Shivaji’s personality, the loftiness of his aims, and the need for a change from an iniquitous status quo, decided him to take a significant step in his life. Thencefor- ward he became a staunch friend and comrade of Shivaji. The cricumstances in which Shivaji shut himself up in die fort of Panhala in 1660 and how he escaped from the besieging armies of Bijapur have been described in an earlier chapter. He made his escape on the dark night of July 13 and, escorted by a contingent of Maratha troops led by Baji Prabhu, proceed- ed towards Vishalgad, twenty-seven miles from Panhala. Baji Prabhu would perhaps have won no place in history and ended his life in ^relative obscurity if Shivaji and his party had THE COMRADES 205 reached their destination in safety. But Fazl Khan, the son of Afzal Khan, had sworn implacable enmity against the Mara- the King and was too wary to let go so good an opportunity to fulfil his heart's desire. The surprise and disappointment caused by his adversary’s escape from Panhala gave greater keenness to his pursuit. The troops that accompanied him were much larger than the Maratha contingent and the flaming torches with which he and his men were equipped, greatly hdp- ed him to gain upon his enemy. Shivaji's anxiety increased with the day-break. Fazl was now dose upon his heels and there was no means of shaking off the pursuer except by giving him battle. Taking hurried counsel with his commrades, Shivaji derided on such a course of action and ordered Baji Prabhu to face the Bijapuri troops, for which undertaking he was given half of the contingent. He himself continued the journey with the rest of his men. The instructions to Baji Prabhu were clear and categorical. He should on no account allow the enemy to get past him and should retreat or take any other measures for the safety of his contingent only after hearing the report of the cannon from Vishalgad as a signal of Shivaji’s safe arrival in the fort. Baji Prabhu promptly occupied the narrow pass known as Ghodkhind or ‘horse ravine’ from where he made a determined stand against the pursuers. He knew the momentous character of his mission; he was responsible for the safety of a man of destiny. This thought fortified his resolution to repel the as- sailants till the last man in his contingent lived. Fazl repeat- edly tried to break through the defenders of the pass, but failed. The unequal battle raged for hours, with the valiant defenders clinging desperately to their positions. Confronted by heavy odds, the small numbers of the Mara- thas were gravely depleted with each attack by the enemy. The situation was indeed desperate and yet Baji Prabhu and his men ' held on doggedly, with no thought of yielding to the enemy. At last, five hours after Baji Prabhu had taken his defensive position at the Ghodkhind pass,' the announcement of Shivaji’s safe arrival at Vishalgad was heard. Seven hundred 206 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT valiant Marathas had by then laid down their lives for the sake of their master, with their commander, Baji Prabhu, him- self being desperately wounded. The dying hero was, however, jubilant. He had done his duty and thus saved his king and his realm from danger. He asked for no better reward in this life and died a happy man. “The defence of Rangana,” says Dennis Kincaid, “has become legendary in Western India. The action is remarkable, as an example of the spirit which Shivaji’s leadership .had infused into his followers.” The action at the Khind has been rightly com- pared to the famous battle of Thermopylae, thus ensuring that the heroic role played by Baji Prabhu and his men on a critical occasion will be remembered as long as good and great deeds are considered worthy of commemoration. Perhaps, no episode in Maratha history has stirred the hearts of the Maratha people as deeply as the death of Tanaji Malu- sare, the conqueror of the Lion Fort. The Treaty of Purandar (June 1665) had forced Shivaji to surrender twentythree forts to the Moghuls, including Sinhgad. The cession of historic strong- holds galled the pride of the Marathas and none felt the humi- liation more keenly than the Queen-Mother. The loss, of 'Sinh- gad in particular had made her inconsolable/ Shivaji, -how- ever deeply he loved his mother, could not gratify hef WiSh. for the reconquest of the stupendous fortress was considered almost impossible. - Sinhgad or Kondana, as it was originally called' is situated on the eastern side of the great Sahyadri range, about twelve miles from Poona. It communicates with the Purandar hills bn the east and west by high and narrow ridges, while on the north and south it presents a huge rugged mountain with a sharp ascent of nearly half a mile. From the slopes rises a great wall of black rock more than forty feet high, crowned by the 'forti- fications of Sinhgad. The fortification^ consist of a strong stone wall flanked with towers and enclose a nearly triangular space about two miles round. The >exterior presents on all- sides- a stupendous barrier -so that, except by : the gates, access , to. ithe fort is almost impo'ssible. 1 Such '-a strong castle* was THE COMRADES 207 commanded by a noted Moghul soldier, Uday Bhan, who was given picked troops of Rajputs, Arabs and Pathans to guard it. There was a manifest disinclination on the part of Shivaji and his lieutenants to force the pace for the reconquest of Sinhgad since they knew the disastrous consequences of any such pre- cipitate attempt. But Jijabai refused to share their hesitation. One morning, says the Ballad of Sinhgad* while she was comb- ing her' hair at Pratapgad, she suddenly saw through the win- dow of her palace the Lion Fort, “gleaming in the February air”. The poignant thought that it did not belong to her son made her unhappy. She summoned a rider and ordered him to go in all haste to Shivaji, then in residence at Rajgad, and tell him that she desired his immediate presence before her. The call was indeed urgent, for, in the expressive language of the ballad: “Within his walls my son may dine; But bid him wash his hands in mine.” Shivaji promptly responded to his mother’s summons, with- out-knowing the reasons for its peremptoriness, but his heart sank within him when he heard what she wanted from him. He pleaded 'earnestly but in vain that the conquest of Sinhgad call- ed- for* Herculean efforts which he was not, in the difficult cir- cumstances prevailing, able to make. “To win it (he explained) went forth many, but There came back never any; Oft .planted was the mango seed, but nowhere grows the tree.” Jijabai was, however, adamant. Dreading his mother’s dis- pleasure more than the hazards, of the undertaking, he cast about foi; a suitable man to whom he could entrust the perilous task.,,. Who else could he be if not Tanaji Malusare, his boon companion from boyhood and a man .of jron will who almost inyarjably accompanied him pn all historic occasions? * This is distinct frdm the one translated by H. A. Acworth who has called it The Ballad ofifranuji Mdloosre. Both are quoted in these pages. 208 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Tanaji was in the village of Umrathe or Umbrat in the Mahad taluka of Kolaba, engaged in celebrating his son’s wedding to the “fairest damsel in the Konkan”, when the call came to him to appear before his king at Rajgad. Neither the festivities nor the earnest entreaties of the bridegroom to delay his departure could detain him in the village. Collecting his retainers, he sped post-haste to Shivaji, accompanied by his eighty-year old unde Stieljirmama, and his brother Suryaji. Shivaji, who did not have the heart to tell his dear comrade that he had been summoned to his doom, directed Tanaji to the Queen-Mother to hear from her the nature of his mission. She told him: “Of all the Bhosle’s barons men shall deem thee as the first, Nay, I shall be thy mother and Shivaji thy brother, If thou wrest the Lion’s fortress from the rule of the accurst”. Undaunted by the terrifying nature of his mission, the lion- hearted knight from the Konkan marched towards the fortress with his men, reaching it unnoticed on a clear, cold, still and moonless night, “the ninth of the dark fortnight of the month of Magh”—February 1670. He had taken with him Shivaji’s favourite gfwrpad or lizard to assist in scaling the fort wall The creature, to whose waist a cord was tied, refused to climb the fort, as if to warn Tanaji of the impending disaster. The subhadar as Tanaji was called, was furious and threatened to kill it if it tried to play prophet to him! The frightened lizard sped to the hill-top and fixing its talons firmly in the heath helped the Marathas to clamber the cliff. But scarcely before 300 men had reached the top, their arrival was detected by the guards. The sentries were pounced upon and slain by the Marathas, but the shouting and the dash of arms that accompanied the proceedings thoroughly roused the garrison. Tanaji whs now faced -with & grave dilemma. With 700 bf his men still at the foot Of the fort, he was forced to engage an, enemy that greatly outnum- bered his troops. He, however, did not take long ito make up his mind and ordered his men to charge. The Marathas fought THE COMRADES 209 with desperate valour, knowing that neither timely succour nor escape was possible. Uday Bhan, the Moghul commander, who had lain “drenched in lust and wine”, was apprised of the in- vasion. Donning his armour and armed with a mighty sword, he rushed to the blood-drenched battlefield in search of his chief adversary, Tanaji. The two formidable men came face to face, each determined to destroy the other. The dice were, however, heavily loaded against the Maratha warrior. The long night march to the foot of the fort, the tremendous exertion involved in scaling the difficult cliff, the anxiety that weighed upon him by his failure to secure the arrival of all his men inside the stronghold, and the desperate hand-to-hand fighting in which he had been conti- nually engaged before confronting Uday Bhan, had taken a heavy toll of Tanaji’s energy. But his spirit and courage never flagged. Uday Bhan, an accomplished swordsman, was hamp- ered by none of these handicaps. The ballard describes the fall of Tanaji in these moving words: “As the lightning-flash descends where the Indrayani wends, When the thunder-clouds are gathered around Visapur in Jest (Jyestha) * On Malusare fell the blow, beating sword and sword-arm low, And Tanaji, the Lion, fell cloven to the waist.” The death of their leader unnerved the Marathas, but the timely arrival of Suryaji, who had by then entered the fort, and his exhortation to his men to fight courageously, saved the situation. In the fierce battle that ensued the Moghul com- mander was killed. The garrison was routed and several hun- dred soldiers, to save themselves from the fury of the invaders, ventured over the rock and were dashed to pieces in the at- tempt. It was a great victory for the Marathas, but there was no elation in their camp. The news of the victory was conveyed to the King who rushed to the fort, eager to congratulate his friend, but to his dismay he saw the brave man’s dead body. His grief was tremendous: * The third month in the Hindu Calendar. 210 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT “Twelve days the king wept o’er him for the great love that he bore him.” The sorrow of the Queen-Mother was no less profound. The ballad, translated by Acworth, reads: “The scarf removed, she saw his face, ‘No worthier chief of Kshatri race’, 'Twas thus she wail’d ’e’er drew a sword Before the armies of his lord. Shivaji, son and king, today Thy goodliest limb is lopp’d away” Nor less the monarch to his chief The tribute paid of royal grief.” Shivaji immortalized the sacrifice of his friend by exclaiming: "I have got the fort, but I have lost the lion”—a laconism that has deservedly became famous in Maratha history. Santaji Ghorpade was among the younger generals who rose to prominence as a stout-hearted defender of the Maratha king- dom after Shivaji’s death. Santaji had seen active service in many theatres of war during the King’s lifetime, but the oppor- tunity to display his abilities as an outstanding military com- mander came to him in full measure during the convulsive period that marked the history of the Marathas after 1680, the year of Shivaji’s death. The misfortunes that overtook the Deccan highlanders after this melancholy event were overwhel- ming. Sambhaji, who shared many of his father’s abilities, would undoubtedly have consolidated and enlarged the heritage of independence bequeathed by the founder, had he been en- dowed with one more gift, namely, stability of character. He paid a terrible penalty for this deficiency and, Ming into the hands of the Moghuls, was cruelly done to death by Aurangzeb in March 1689. The Emperor, who had arrived in the Deccan towards the end of 1681 with a large army, determined not to return to his capital till he had accomplished the total destruction of the Marathas, was jubilant that the prospect of reaching his long; cherished goal was extremely bright, now that he had .murder- THE COMRADES 211 ed the founder’s son. Rajaram, Shivaji’s second son, upon whom the responsibility for protecting the kingdom from anni- hilation fell, was known' to be mild-mannered and good-natur- ed, Could he rise to the occasion by making an abundant dis- play of masterful leadership? Much to the disappointment of his enemies and to the elation of his nation, he did. What was equally fortunate, thanks to the enduring influence of his father’s genius, a band of competent men came forward to assist him in the darkest hour of Maharashtra’s history. Ramchandra Nilkanth, the progenitor of the Amatya family of Bavda in Kolhapur district, was a man of great vision and sagacity. He had been trained under Shivaji and knew well the art of promoting concord and concerted action among the self-willed leaders of government. He was himself not a man of the sword, but he was gifted with the rare spirit of rous- ing others to great heights of heroism. Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav were conspicuous among his lieutenants who shattered the imperialists’ dream of conquest. Rajaram’s warm tribute to Ramchandrapant presents the true measure of the Amatya’s valuable services to the nation. “The Maratha king- dom,” declared the King, “is a gift from the gods. Ramchandra- pant saved it from a grave crisis by creating a band of leaders in its defence after a careful appraisal of their individual abili- ties. He made the best use of the nation’s resources for pro- tecting it from the aggression of the imperialists. Providence has crowned his endeavours with success, while defeating the designs of the enemy.” Dhanaji Jadhav; one of the two outstanding captains under Rajaram, was bom in 1650 and belonged to the family of Shivaji’s mother. He had received his training under the re- nowned. Senapati Prataprao Gujar. His considerable military abilities were frankly acknowledged by the Moghul generals who felt the weight of his arms on many a battlefield. Dhanaji was a cultured and farsighted soldier who knew the value of humility and moderation even in the midst of resounding vic- tories. For some years, he actively co-operated with Santaji 212 SHXVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Ghorpade in ensuring the security of the fugitive Rajaram and in inflicting crushing defeats on the enemy. Santaji was cast in a different mould. He was a -magnificent guerilla leader, with a genius for organizing large bodies of men and welding them into a mighty fighting force. He abhorred laxity and indiscipline and severely punished his men when such lapses were detected. There was no limit to his daring and resourcefulness. Nothing was impossible to this dashing gene- ral who proved his stature again and again by inflicting defeat and disgrace on many a renowned Moghul commander. Per- haps, the most memorable episode in his meteroic career was his attack on the camp of the Emperor at Koregaon. Taking a band of exceptionally courageous men with him, he entered the Imperial camp unnoticed in pouring rain and suddenly fell upon Aurangzeb’s tent. The supporting ropes were cut and the massive edifice of canvas collapsed, with the aged Emperor, it was at first believed, falling with it. Fortunately for him, he had slept elsewhere the previous night. Santaji and his men stripped the tent of its valuables and carried them away, to- gether with the massive gold cupolas that adorned it. Santaji’s audacity always paid him rich dividends. No Im- perial General dared to face him. Sarkar, who observes that the Maratha captain’s name “inspired abject fear in all ranks of the Moghul army,” gives an example in support of his view. The source quoted by him says: “When the news reached that Santaji had arrived within a distance of sixteen or eighteen miles from him, Firuz Jang (Aurangzeb’s highest general) lost colour in terror, and making a false announcement that he would ride to oppose him, appointed officers to clear the path, sent his tents in advance, but fled towards Bijapur by another route!” More than any other individual leader, Santaji saved his mas- ter and his kingdom from destruction by his brilliant victories against the imperialists whose dreams he haunted by his pro- wess. His incredible successes galvanized the waning energies of his people, stimulated their declining morale, and thus brac- ed them up to overcome any danger. Grant Duff rightly de- THE COMRADES 213 dares: “Santaji Ghorpade was one of the best officers of whom the Maratha annals can boast, and his eulogy is best recorded, when we say, he was the terror of the Moghul detachments for seven' years.” Unfortunately, this 1 great soldier was stricken with the malady of conceit. In his dealings with his colleagues and subordin- ates, he had the narrow outlook of a martinet. He made enemies of his most intimate friends and became increasingly insufferable by behaving as if he was a man of destiny. He overreached himself by withholding from his own sovereign courtesies and obedience due to his eminence. The end of such a man could not be peaceful. A brilliant career was sud- denly cut short by the hand of an assassin. Santaji Ghorpade was the stormy petrel of Maratha history, but his role in stem- ming and repelling the tide of Moghul invasion will always be remembered with pride and gratitude. The hopes of the aged Emperor, who had despaired of fulfill- ing his mission in the Deccan, were suddenly revived when Rajaram, worn out by cares and anxieties, died at Sinhgad in March 1700. But unfortunately for Aurangzeb, whose overstay in the world was resented as much by the people as by his sons, a lady came forward to frustrate his ambition. Tarabai, the widow of Rajaram, was a spirited woman who had learnt her lessons in patriotism and discipline in the stem school of ad- versity. She was brave and resourceful and was abundantly endowed with the gifts of leadership. She inspired her military officers to organize effective resistance to the invaders and often shared the suffering and weariness of. the troops by living and moving with them. Great care was taken to ensure that the standard of the civil administration did not decline. In brief, the widowed Queen assumed complete dominion over the life of the Marathas, holding them together and en- couraging them to fight to the bitter end, and thus thoroughly exposed the hollowness of Aurangzeb’s boast that after Raja- ram’s death Maharashtra would fall into the lap of the Mo- ghuls like a ripe plum. Perhaps, the best tribute we can , pay to this heroic woman is to recall the high praise that has been 214 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT given to her by the hostile Muslim historian, Khafi Khan, who says that she was extremely wise and enterprising in the con- duct of public affairs mid popular with the army. . In fact, she became so dearly loved and respected by her people that “all the efforts of Aurangzeb against the Marathas down to the end of his reign failed”. The inspiring leadership of Shivaji thus became a precious legacy which sustained the Maratha Empire through many vicis- situdes even though the direction of its affairs sometimes fell into the hands of feeble men. Far away from his native pro- vince, his victories and wise administration stimulated a strong urge among the valiant people of the land, both during his life- time and after his death, to establish a new order based on justice and tolerance. The Rajputs, the Sikhs, the Jats and the Bundelas, among others, strove mightily towards this end. Raja Chhatrasal of Bundelkhand, who drew the sword against the excesses of Aurangzeb, cherished the ambition of serving in person under the banner of Shivaji. When the two leaders met in Maharashtra, the Maratha king persuaded the Bundela chief to return to his home province and provoke hos- tilities against, the imperialists from there, Chhatrasal, who went back to his people in 1671, fought for decades against the invaders and eventually succeeded in expelling them from his land. He died in December 1731, full of years and glory. Such heroic uprisings in the country marked the fulfilment of Shivaji’s crusading mission on behalf of a new order based on religious harmony and political justice. REFERENCES Kincaid, C.

CHAPTER 12 THE PATRIOT Shivaji was not vouchsafed a long span of life and yet his achievements are monumental. There was, however, an impe- rative need for his masterful guidance for some more years in order to ensure the consolidation and expansion of the Ma* ratha Kingdom. But when he knew that he would not be spar ed long, he faced death with complete resignation and fortitude, seeing that it was a necessary end. A man of deep piety, he spent several months in the company of Ramdas Swami, his spiritual guide, philosopher and friend, before death claimed him. Religious discussions, prayer and meditation brought peace and tranquillity to his troubled mind and braced him up to meet the distractions of his domestic life with composure. Taking leave of Ramdas, whose ministrations had meant so much to him, he journeyed to Raigad on February 4, 1680, perhaps with the premonition that the two would never meet again. He busied himself in the capital with preparations for the wedding of his second son, Rajaram, who was married on March 15 to the daughter of Prataprao Gujar. A week later, he was laid up with fever from which he never recovered. The end came at midday on Saturday April 3, 1680. At the time of his death, he was fifty or fifty-three years old, according as we choose to accept the date of his birth as 1627 or 1630. A luminous star disappeared from the Indian firmament The last years of Shivaji were clouded with concern about the future of his realm. His eldest son, Sambhaji, was barely twentythree years old at the time of his death. The young man was undoubtedly a chip of the old block. He was hand- some, sturdy, brave and generous. He fully inherited his father’s enthusiasm for great and noble causes and valiantly donned Shivaji’s armour and sword as the defender of the faith. He had the benefit of careful and liberal education. Men known for their learning and rectitude had undertaken the THE PATRIOT 217 training of his mind and had found in him an intelligent, if wayward, student. He was carefully instructed in the signific- ance of his parent’s historic mission and was exhorted by no less a person than Ramdas Swami to qualify himself for taking Shivaji’s place after him. Composing his counsel in verse, the Swami urged Sambhaji to weld his people into a strong and purposeful fraternity, animated by a lofty conception of their obligation to their dharma or religion and to their rashtra or country. Despite his numerous pre-occupations, Shivaji missed no op- portunity himself to enlighten the mind of his son and heir. At what proved to be their last meeting, the father made a moving appeal to his son to realize his exalted mission and act accordingly. He reminded Sambhaji that the essential quality of justice is impartiality and that discrimination in favour of the powerful and the so-called well-born would be gravely detri- mental to the good name and efficiency of a government. It was the duty of a ruler to listen not only to the great, but also to the humble, because he himself, Shivaji declared, had “often received better and sounder counsel” from the latter. Moreover, it was the work and the worth of a man and not his birth or wealth, that determined his real importance to the society. “What I should most recommend to you,” Shivaji told Sambhaji, “is that in no case should you have a favourite if you are to spare your subjects from jealousy.” He added that by strictly adhering to this principle a ruler could count on the support of all sections of his people in a period of real crisis. In spite of the nobility of his character, Samhbaji was by temperament one who brooked no constraints on his behaviour, no matter how very salutary and desirable they were. This mettlesome young man grew up with a feeling of grievance. He had been brought up in an atmosphere of stem rectitude, not sufficiently softened with love and affection which only a mother could give. Unfortunately, his mother had died when he was still a boy. He appreciated his father’s anxiety to give him the choicest training with the object of fitting him for his 218 SHIVAJl: THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT high office, but, in the exuberance of his youthfulness, he re- fused to accept discipline as a necessary adjunct to the realiza- tion of the goal. He was indeed the Prince Rupert of Maha- rashtra whose impetuosity often led him into grave difficulties and ended in his death under the most distressing circum- stances. It was this lack of balanced judgment that led him to escape from Panhala with his wife in December 1678 and rush into the arms of the Moghul commander, Dilir Khan, at Bahadurgad. Nor did he consider it wrong to strain the loyalty of such a veteran servant of his father as Phirangoji Narsala by attacking Bhupalgad. Only the Khan’s excesses and his open contempt for the religious susceptibilities of Sambhaji served as an eye- opener to him and impelled him to return to the path of duty by stealing himself out of the Moghul camp in November 1679. After this date not many months remained for Shivaji to attempt the reformation of his son. A recent biographer of Sambhaji has made a grievance of the candid appraisal of the infirmities in the character of his hero by contemporary and later historians. Much of his ad- miration for the high qualities of the courageous victim of Aurangzeb’s religious wrath is justified, but it was necessary that the son and successor of Shivaji should not only be an Arthurian figure, but also a man of shrewd and sound judg- ment and of unlimited circumspection. This Sambhaji was not, as probably most others could not have been. Many pen-portraits have been handed down to us about the personal appearance of Shivaji. He was of medium stature and his limbs were sturdy and of excellent proportion. He was of a fair complexion, with a long nose and beaming eyes. He weighed one hundred and forty pounds and, although he ate only one meal a day, was extraordinarily agile and active. His skill and courage became proverbial and his followers placed implicit confidence in his superior wisdom and generalship. “His life,” wrote Orme, “was simple even to parsimony; his manners void of insolence or ostentation; as a sovereign most humane and solicitous for the well-being of his people THE PATRIOT 219 the same principles of frugality and expense were observed in the municipal disbursements of his government; far superior himself to magnificence, none of his officers were led to expect more than competence. In personal activity he exceeded all, of whom there is record. He met every emergency with instant discernment and unshaken fortitude Respected as the guardian of the nation he had founded, he moved every- where amongst them with unsuspicious security and often alone.” Barthelemy Carre noted that the Maratha King, be- sides being dreaded by his enemies, was regarded as one whose stars invariably led him to victory and glory. Apart from these avowed admirers of Shivaji, even his most implacable foes and uncharitable critics were compelled to acknowledge his eminence. Grant Duff, whose judgment of men and things and more especially of the doings of the founder of the Maratha Empire, was warped when he wrote his famous History, felt constrained to extol Shivaji in these eloquent words: "We view his talents with admiration and his genius with wonder. For a popular leader, his frugality was a remark- able feature in his character; and the richest plunder never made him deviate from the rules he had laid down for its appropriation." The historian of the Marathas goes on to say: “Shivaji was patient and deliberate in his plans, ardent, resolute and persevering in their execution”, and concludes by observing that the wisdom of the Maratha King’s plans “raised the des- pised Hindus to sovereignty and brought about their own ac- complishment when the hand that framed them was low in the dust”. Aurangzeb, whose iniquity, according to Grant Duff, was “almost unparalleled”, whose “boundless ambition was conceal- ed by deep dissimulation” and whose “boldness was equal to his hypocrisy”, was frank enough to concede that he found in Shivaji a truly formidable foe. When the news of the Maratha King’s death reached him, the Emperor declared: "He was a great captain and, the only one who has had die magnanimity to raise a new kingdom. My armies have been' employed 220 SHIVAJI : TOE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT against him for nineteen years and, nevertheless, his state has been always increasing.” No adversary of the Emperor, Muslim, Rajput, Sikh, Jat or Bundela, had caused him greater consternation than his Deccan enemy. In the course of his campaigns he reached a stage when it became impossible for him to choose a competent com- mander who could bring victory to the imperial arms against Shivaji. It has been recorded that in 1670 the revelation con- tained in a newsletter about the military successes of the Mara- thas struck Aurangzeb dumb. Asked which of his officers should next be sent against his Deccan enemy, Mahabat Khan replied with biting sarcasm and disdain: “No general is neces- sary. A decree from the Chief Kazi will destroy Shivaji!” The Shah of Persia similarly served a bitter drench to the proud Alamgir, the “World Conqueror,” to swallow by twitting him for his failure to subdue the son of a mere sardar. “I am coming to India with an army,” he announced, “to teach you your business!” It was easy for the monarch of Iran to send out such distant and peripheral threats, but he would probably have met with no better fate than Aurangzeb had he ventured to tilt his sword at Shivaji. In an, earlier chapter we have discussed at length the abilities of Shivaji as a military leader and strategist. It was he, more than any other Hindu or Muslim commander, who forced the .disciplined and heavily armed Moghul cavalry to flee before .the charge of the lightly-equipped Maratha horse. His strength and activity on the battlefield, says a foreign military expert, “were the glory and admiration of his race”. Justice Ranade writes with enthusiasm about the victorious generalship of Shivaji thus: .“.Throughout his career of thirty-four years, 'Shivaji did not on a single occasion suffer defeat where he led his. armies in person, and even when his affairs were at the worst, he' seemed to gather new courage and resource from the inspiration of the dangers around him.” Such a categorical 'statement perhaps requires S6md modification, but there cannot be' any doubt that the confidence created by Shivaji among the Marathas in their ability to meet the Moghuls on their' own THE PATRIOT 221 terms proved, to quote Ranade again, “the salvation of the country during the twenty-two years that Aurangzeb spent in the conquest of the Deccan”. Men liked to follow Shivaji and make any sacrifice for him, not merely because he was a successful fighter, but also because he was a benevolent ruler who strove sincerely to promote the progress and prosperity of his people. His readiness to recog- nize merit, no matter in whom it existed, and to reward it ge- nerously drew towards him a large band of brave, intelligent and resourceful men who stood steadfastly by his State long after his death. Cosme da Guarda describes the devices employed by the King to ascertain the reactions of the people to his administra- tion. Towards this end he moved freely among them, either alone or with a few companions, and, mixing with the crowds, deliberately spoke ill of himself and about other things con- cerning his government. He thus collected much useful infor- mation which he used for a more diligent and efficient fulfil- ment of his responsibilities. “He was”, says this foreign ob- server, “naturally loved by all men of valour and good con- duct.” In contemporary India Shivaji’s government was by far the most efficient and benevolent. In religion, as in many other matters, Shivaji was far ahead of his times. His devotion to his ancestral faith was deep and un- affected. Besides being brought up by a pious mother and a religious-minded guardian, he lived in an age when saints and savants in Maharashtra preached the excellence of the simple beliefs and practices that flourished in ancient times. Tukaram, whose simple songs in praise of God have entered almost every Marathi-speaking home in the country, advised the King thus “There is one Truth in the world: There is one Soul in all Be- ings. Pin thy faith to This Soul, see thyself mirrored in Ram- das: Do this, 0 Priiice, and thou and the whole world shall be blest therein; thy fame will pervade the Universe, saith Tuka.” • Ramdas Swami was more explicit when he reminded Shivaji of his obligations to his religion and country. It was necessary, the Swami told him, to protect the faith of the land from 222 ctttvajt : the portrait of a patriot insult and destruction and none could accomplish this task ex- cept he. “When the Faith is dead,” announced the spirited preceptor, “death is better than life; why live when Religion has perished? Gather the Marathas together, make religion live again: our fathers laugh at us from Heaven!” The words faith and religion were used by the two saints to comprehend the entire way of life. Apart from his natural inclination towards the concerns of the spirit, Shivaji was thus nurtured in traditions which impos- ed upon him the responsibility of reviving and defending the immemorial heritage of the land. He willingly undertook such a task and when he succeeded in clearing Maharashtra of the invad- ers, he liberally extended state patronage to learning and piety. The study of the Vedas and other sacred literature was reviv- ed. Learned men received generous benefactions so that they could pursue their studies and practise their devotions undis- tracted by the sordid material demands of the body. The fame of Shivaji as the patron of learning and scholarship reached many parts of India and men flocked to his court in search of recognition and reward. As the Marathi chroniclers have re- corded, famous scholars were “assembled, honoured and re- warded”. No man of learning had occasion to leave the hos- pitable realm of Shivaji. Shivaji’s enlightened policy, besides stimulating the study of Sanskrit, gave a great impetus to the revival of Marathi lan- guage and literature. Before his time, the prose literature in that language, especially on secular subjects, was negligible. Under his guidance a team of experts set out to enlarge and en- rich its vocabulary by translating the technical terms from Per- sian. The result was the Raj-Vyavahar Kosh or the dictionary of technical terms for use in administration. Such pioneering labours paved the way for a rapid and many-sided development of Marathi literature which to-day is distinguished as much for its excellence as for its vastness. Shivaji’s veneration for other faiths was as profound as for his own. He showed the highest respect for the holy men of Islam and of Christianity. He looked upon Baba Yakut of THE PATRIOT 223 Kelsi as his honoured friend and benefactor, while a number of Muslim shrines received liberal endowments from his gov- ernment. He showed similar respect and consideration to Father Ambrose when he met him at Surat. Like the temple and the Gita, the mosque and the Holy Koran won his greatest respect. During his military operations, he made it his invari- able practice to give the Koran to a Muslim divine when the sacred book fell into his hands. In this, as in many other respects, we are brought face to face with the most striking contrast between the attitude of Shivaji and that of Aurangzeb towards faiths other than their own. Perhaps, there cannot be a more decisive or heart- warming testimony to the catholicity and the tolerant outlook of the Maratha King than the fact that he specially built a mosque in front of his palace at Raigad so that his Muslim ser- vants and subjects could offer their prayers according to the prescriptions of their own faith. In contrast, temple-destruc- tion and desecration became an axiom of Aurangzeb’s state policy. Even Khafi Khan, whose patently hostile writings have pro- vided the source material to many of the early British writers of Maratha history, has felt constrained to concede that when- ever Shivaji and his army went on military expeditions they made it a point to cause “no harm to the mosques, the Book of God, or the women of any one. Whenever a copy of the sacred Koran came into his hands, he treated it with respect, and gave it to some of his Musalman followers. When the women of any Hindu or Muhammadan were taken prisoners by his men, and they had no friend to protect them, he watched over them” until they were restored to their relations. Such restrained* behaviour on the part of a conqueror and such a high sense of virtue and morality are rare at all times. Shivaji’s self-discipline and generosity towards his foes were a characte- ristic of his nature which, to quote justice Ranade, “stands out in marked contrast with the looseness and ferocity of those time” 224 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT Professor Basham, in his excellent book on ancient and me- dieval India, observes: “Shivaji, a brilliant leader, a just ruler, and a statesman of consummate craft, was a conservative in his outlook, and appeared to his contemporaries rather as a restorer of the old than as a builder of the new.” This is certainly a valid observation, but Shivaji’s mission was not to reform society but to save it. Had he functioned otherwise, he would have been guilty of pitying the plumage by forgetting the dying bird. It does not require the sword to mend the social infirmities of a community: that is essentially the task of the reformer and the preacher. There was no dearth of such men either in Maharashtra or in the rest of the country, both before and after the advent of Shivaji. It would, of course, be wrong to belittle or ignore their contribution to the Hindu revival, but without the political and military resurgence in- augurated by the Maratha ruler, the labours of these estimable men would not have been of much avail. The character of Shivaji and his place in history should, therefore, be viewed from a much wider perspective. It is to gain such an intimate glimpse that the first chapter of the pre- sent book has been devoted to a description of the pinnacle of civilization to which the Hindus rose at one time and of the depth to which they fell. Subsequently the true measure of Shivaji’s greatness is apt to elude us, if we fail to grasp how his heroic labours helped in raising them from their fallen con- dition. Nor would it be a correct appreciation of his career to judge him as if he was a missionary of non-violence. He drew the sword with the clear and well-defined object of promoting equitable conditions in the country. It was no part of his con- cern to abate or to allay the fear which his victorious armies raised in the minds of his powerful and treacherous enemies. Indeed, any kid-glove methods or half-measures in dealing with them would have been as futile as preaching calmness to a storm-tossed sea. As has been shown in the preceding pages, the task that con- fronted Shivaji was of Himalayan proportions. Until his ad- vent there was none to meet the country’s crying need for com- THE PATRIOT 225 bating the pusillanimity and the defeatism of the Hindus. The fact that they formed an overwhelming majority of the popula- tion, with vast stakes in their homeland, made no difference to their helplessness. They chose to crawl on their stomachs, while they should have stood up and fought for their legitimate rights and privileges. The Vijayanagar Empire certainly played a great part in reviving the morale of the Hindus, but, except on rare occasions, it was mostly on the defensive so that when it fell, defeatism and helplessness regained their hold over the Hindu mind. The manhood of such a demoralized and disorganized people could be revived, not by mere exhortations, but by repeatedly proving both to them and to the ruling minority that the so- called invincibility of the latter’s armed might was a mere make-believe. The obvious way of striving for a new order, based on a genuine Hindu-Muslim collaboration, was to qualify the majority community to play its part worthily and on terms of equality with its partner. Since at no time and in no part of the world are a dependent people treated with respect and honour, it was essential for the Hindus to shed the stigma of belonging to a defeated race. The means that were required for attaining this goal were not prayer and supplication, but unity and strength derived from the power of the sword. That power was given to them by Shivaji in full measure. In fact, we search in vain in the pages of history since the advent of the Muslims for another leader whose victories were so decisive and were fraught with such far-reaching and beneficent conse- quences as those of the great Maratha ruler. Perhaps, the greatest tribute that can be rendered to Shivaji is that his achievements caused a complete change in the course of Indian history. Mountstuart Elphinstone, whose understand- ing of the Maratha affairs was first-hand and profound, points out that it required the genius of Shivaji to avail himself of the mistakes of Aurangzeb “by kindling a zeal for religion and, ‘ through that, a national spirit among the Marathas. It was by these feelings that his government was upheld after it passed into feeble hands, and was kept together, in spite of numerous 226 SHIVAJi: THE PORTRAIT OP A PATRIOT internal disorders, until it had established its supremacy over the greater part of India”. It was because Shivaji imparted such a powerful impulse to Maratha expansion that during the regime of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao, the power of the Marathas rose to its zenith. Under this Peshwa, “the Maratha cavalry, fully one hundred thousand strong, could truly boast that they had slaked their thirst in every stream that flowed between Cape Comorin and the Himalayas”. It is true that continental sovereignty eluded these spirited men in spite of their rise to such pre-eminence, but there cannot be any doubt that they would have maintained their ascendency in India if the European countries had not intervened. “India contains,” wrote Metcalfe during the days of the East India Company’s expansion, “no more than two great powers, British and Maratha, and every other state acknowledges the influence of one or the other. Every inch that we recede will be occupied by them.” The failure of the Marathas to establish their para- mountcy in the country may or may not be regretted at this distance of time, but it is undeniable that their original goal of ending a dispensation under which a handful of men could claim impunity for holding the country in fee was fully realized. Thus, the success of the Marathas under Shivaji and his suc- cessors is not a mere episode in history, but an event of out- standing importance. Their achievements and of those that followed their example created a feeling throughout the country for the first time after many centuries that the Hindus could no longer be taken for granted. Better minds among both Hindus and Muslims began to wonder whether it would not be in the best interests of their communities and of the country as a whole that they should come together, sharing in full measure die joys and sorrows of belonging to a common motherland. The readiness and the confidence with which Emperor Shah Alam came under the protection of the sagacious Maratha soldier-statesman, Mahadji Scindia, in preference to the tutelage of his own co-religionist, Ghulam Kadir, is a signal proof of the fact that the wind of change had begun to sweep the country. Again, it was the Maratha supremacy in arms that prompted THE PATRIOT 227 another great Indian of the eighteenth century, Suraj Mai Jat, to propound the startling scheme for bringing the entire country within the frame of a single government through the combined administrative skill and military strength of the Hindus and the Muslims. The fact that the plan was still-born does not detract from the revolutionary significance of the conception. New forces were at work to bring the two communities to- gether and the degree of interdependence and mutual cordiality which they fostered would perhaps have surprised even Akbar. The establishment of British rule in the country gave a power- ful stimulus to the new trend. There was complete impartiality on the part of the foreign rulers in treating Hindus and Muslims alike with contempt. With honourable exceptions, they func- tioned like J. B. Priestley’s Big Englanders, “red-faced, loud- voiced fellows, wanting to go and boss everybody about all over the world”. Their racial arrogance was only equal to their ignorance. Men like Clive, who mercilessly despoiled the coun- try, spoke and behaved as if they were heaven-bom. By Wel- lesley’s time it became customary for the officials of the East India Company in Bengal to call certain parts of Calcutta a “Black Town” and to describe its dwellers as “dusky swarms”. As years rolled on, religion became increasingly intolerant and dogmatic and racial pride more exclusive. “A certainty,” write Edward Thompson and Garratt, “of immeasurable superiority settled on British minds. It was felt that Indians had no parti- cular rights beyond that of accepting the government provided for them, without demur as to cost or kind.” It was not merely in social intercourse that the Indians were kept at arm’s length; they were also rigorously excluded from all positions of trust and responsibility in the government of their own country. The reservation of higher offices in India for Englishmen was introduced by Lord Cornwallis who, besides be- ing influenced by racial considerations, held a dim view of the abilities of Indians. The manifest absurdity of such prejudices did not prevent the British rulers from persisting in their misguided views about the people of this country. In the early years of the Company’s territorial expansion many Indian officers com- 228 SHTV'AJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT manded troops with European soldiers under them, but this “anomalous” position was soon rectified by cleansing the offi- cer ranks in the army of the Indian element ! The sepoy army that was maintained in India underlined the subordinate status and the helpless condition of her inhabitants. The first widespread protest of the principal communities against their confinement, in the words of Sir Thomas Munro, to a mere “animal state of thriving in peace” was made in 1857. It was a tremendous uprising in which both Hindus and Mus- lims participated, but it was not decisive enough to bring about the deposition of the British from their paramount position. Part of the reason for its failure has been explained by Maulana Azad who says: “As I read about the events of 1857, 1 am forc- ed to the sad conclusion that Indian national character had sunk very low. The leaders of the revolt could never agree. They were mutually jealous and continually intriguing against one another.” But to discerning men the rebellion, despite its failure, gave unmistakable proofs of the formidable omens under which .the country was destined to march towards its goal. The Hindus and the Muslims were thus bound together by their common suffering and by the genuineness of their grievances. A great opportunity for building up a secular and democratic order in continental India through the united labours of her principal communities was, however, lost because the Muslims increasingly pursued a separatist policy. The myth—and it was none else, as the pages of this book abundantly bear out—that the Muslims had held the sovereignty of India before the advent of the British, was invented and sedulously fostered in order to disrupt Hindu-Muslim relations. The Aga Khan’s deputation of 1906 to die Viceroy was one of the most unfortunate events in Indian history and was naturally hailed by the imperialists and their handymen as epoch-making. Lady Minto, who recorded her glee over the happening in her diary, received an exultant letter from a correspondent in which it was claimed that the episode was “nothing less than the pulling back of sixty-two millions of people from joining the ranks of the seditious opposition”. No less a person, than the Aga Khan has claimed in his Memoirs THE PATRIOT 229 that concessions to the separatist demands of his community inevitably led to India’s partition and the creation of Pakistan. Pakistan is thus ths fulfilment of a wild dream. The Hindus could not avert the country’s partition, partly because of their weakness and disunity and largely because the major political party, the Indian National Congress, was pledged to fight, not communalism, but the British rule. Now that a new Muslim State has come into existence, although some of its territories constitute the cradle of the ancient Hindu civilization, all fair- minded persons sincerely wish it God speed. But have the pro- blems which made its birth possible ceased to plague the parti- tioned India? If they have not, does not the life of Shivaji offer us a lesson in solving them? Indeed, no study of great men can be rewarding unless it helps us to understand our present problems and to avoid their recurrence in the future. Speaking at Poona in June 1961, while unveiling the portrait of Shivaji, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, then President of the Indian Republic called attention to the problems of unity that confront- ed the country and pleaded with the people to “realize our duty to place India and her interests above everything else”. They could, he said, develop such a broad outlook by studying the life of Shivaji and following his example in patriotism. “Once again,” the President observed, “history has brought India to the cross-roads. We must turn to the right path. If, Heaven forbid, we commit any mistake at this critical, juncture, all our hopes may be belied, our aspirations frustrated and our national unity endangered.” To avert such a calamity and to strengthen the forces of unity in the country, it was, he said, necessary that we should assimilate the ideas and ideals propagated and prac- tised by Shivaji. The supreme elements in the Maratha King’s character were, Dr. Rajendra Prasad declared, “a high personal character, religious tolerance and a burning patriotism”. By virtue of its position and numbers the majority community has an inescapable obligation to set an example in unity and patriotism to the rest of the population. If it gives such a lead, it will have worthily assimilated the message of Shivaji. His life has shown how through unity, strength and patriotism, it 230 SHIVAJI : THE PORTRAIT OF A PATRIOT was possible for an infant power to supplant a mighty empire resting on iniquity and intolerance. His crusade, as we saw, was not against any individual or community, but against a system which unjustly and arbitrarily denied the people their basic rights and privileges. Shivaji employed tolerance to supplant bigotry and enlighten- ed government to end tyranny. In striving towards this goal he accepted the services of all these who shared his enthusiasm and satisfied his rigorous tests, no matter to what class or commu- nity they belonged. He put a Muslim in charge of his navy to fight the Moghuls and the Sultans of Bijapur, without doubting his subordinate’s loyalty or integrity for a moment. Supremely conscious of his own strength and the justice of his cause, he disdained to entertain such ignoble thoughts in his mind. In perpetuating the memory of this illustrious son of India, whose outstanding contribution consists in practising the triple virtues of unity, strength and patriotism, let us recall Burke's famous inscription on Chatham’s tomb. “The means by which Providence raises a nation to greatness are the virtues infused into great men.” Writers of biographies often overwhelm their heroes with superlative praise. Charles XII, King of Sweden (1697-1718), is one such hero who has received more than his measure of adulation. This extraordinary monarch has been described by Voltaire as “the only person in history who was free from all weakness”, while Dr. Johnson has compared him with Hannibal. Even Peter the Great, that untamed genius who defeated Charles, declared that the Swedish ruler was “the most perfect man and hero since the world began”. We need not lavish such flattery on Shivaji, for his eminence, being both towering and massive, can dispense with all exaggerations. A man who was the true incarnation of courage, generosity and statesmanship, could easily do without such flummeries. Maharashtra cherishes Shivaji’s memory with profound res- pect and affection. His name is enshrined in the hearts of mil- lions of her people who remember and revere it in many ways. That shrewd' political strategist, Lokmanya Tilak, elevated the life-story of the Maratha King into a popular movement. THE PATRIOT 231 Through the columns of his Marathi weekly, Kesari (Lion), Tilak wrote stirring articles, freely invoking the name of Shivaji, to rouse the dormant energies of his people and to brace them up for purposeful action. In the farflung theatres of the First and the Second World War, his name was heard as a way-cry wherever the Maratha troops fought under the banner of the Allied Powers. The British, who were so meticulous about their prestige and protocol when dealing with Indians, brushed aside both when the Prince of Wales, now the Duke of Wind- sor, laid the foundation stone of the All-India Shivaji Memorial at Poona during his tour of the country in 1921. Dr. Rajendra Prasad has described Shivaji as “the builder of an epoch in our history”. There cannot be a more appropriate tribute to the Maratha hero than this. Perhaps, we can best perpetuate the memory of this remarkable man by giving wider currency to the ideals of tolerance and magnanimity, both der- ived from a position of strength, for which he lived and labour- ed. Let us end this book with our appreciation of this great patriot and national leader in the words of Ramdas Swami: “Remember Shivaji! And count this life as grass. In this world and the next, rely on fame alone. Remember Shivaji! His form, his noble aims. Forget not also all his valiant deeds on earth.” REFERENCES Sen, Surendra Nath, Foreign Biographies of Shivaji, Volume II, The Book Co., Calcutta, 1927. Bendre, V.

London, etc. Professor of Economics and Principal, Rajaram College, Kolhapur, India Part IV Shivaji, The Man and His .Work THE ARYA BOOK DEPOT, Kolhapur COPYRIGHT 1940 the Author Published by The Anther A Note on the Author Dr. Balkrisbna came of a Ksbatriya family of Multan, in the Punjab* Born in 1882, be spent bis boyhood in struggles against mediocrity. For after completing bis primary education he was first apprenticed to a jewel-threader and then to a tailor. It appeared as if he would settle down as a tailor when by a fortunate turn of events he found himself in a Middle Vernacular School. He gave the first sign of talents by standing first in the Vernacular Final ^Examination. Then he joined the Multan High School and passed en to the D. A. V. College, Lahore, from where he took his B. A* degree. Then be joined the Government College, Lahore, and passed bis M. A. with high distinction. During the last part of bis College career, be came under the influence of some great Indian political leaders, especially of Lala Lajpatrai, Sardar Ajitsingh and the Honourable Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and in 1908-9 took an active part in politics. But soon after he was drawn more powerfully to the Arya Samaj. His high place in the M. A. examination would have helped him to a promising career under the Government, but he chose differently. He joined Lala Munshiram ( later Swami Shraddha- Btnd ) *s a worker in the Guruk.ul, Kangri. Here he spent over ten years as a Professor of Economics and Politics, as Vice- Principal and as Principal and sometimes acted in the place of Swami Sbraddhanand as the Governor of the Gurukul University* In 1919 he went to^ England and in February 1922 was admitted to the Ph. D. degree of London University. While a student in London, he went on lecturing tours and lectured on Vedic Religion and Economics in London, Oxford, Manchester and other towns in England, Wales and Scotland. The same year he returned to India and in May was appointed Principal of Rajaram College, Kolhapur. He worked in that capacity till his death on 2 1st October, 1940. His term of Office was distinguished (2) by the phenomenal growth of the institution. In 1922 it was an Arts College with only 293 pupils on the roll ; at the time of his death it was a full-fledged Arts and Science College, teaching- post-graduate courses in many subjects, with 920 pupils on its roll* He was also instrumental in developing Kolhapur as an educational centre, the Law and the Teachers' Training Colleges owing their existence to his initiative and efforts. He also worked as Inspector of Secondary Education in Kolhapur from 1926 to 1936. He was connected with numerous learned societies. He was a Fellow of the Royal Economic Society, of the Royal Statistical Society, and of the Royal Historical Society, London; a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, Bombay; a Member of the Econometric Association, U. S. A.; and a fellow of the University of Bombay till shortly before his death. He was a Member of the Historical Records Commission of the Government of India and the first President of Bombay "Presidency Teachers' Conference held at Poona in 1935 and President of the Modern History Section of the History Congress held at Allahabad in 1938. He also took a leading part in the public life of Kolhapur, From 1924 to 1933 he was President of the Kolhapur Boy Scouts* Association. He was a Member of the Kolhapur Municipality and Kolhapur Itakha Panchayat for a number of years. He was 'President of Kolhapur Arya Samaj and of the Educational Boards under it. He was for several years President of the Teachers* "Association, Kolhapur. As a representative of the all-India Arya Sitnij organisation he attended the World Fellowship of Faiths in Chicago in 1933-5* and toured in U. S. A. and Europe on his way back. In U. S. A. he gave many lectures on Hindu Religion and Culture in the North .Western, Howard, New York and Columbia Universities, to the World Fellowship of Faiths, the Indian Association at Detroit, the Amstican League of India's Freedom and other todies o4 wjts highly honoured by them and other American intttutipp6 and (3) -eminent individuals. He delivered an important series of public lectures on political conditions of Europe after his return tp Kolhapur. He was distinguished as a public speaker and lectured in different parts of India too. As an author he directed his energies to different subjects including Indian Religion and Culture, Economics, Politics and History. His monumental work, on which he devoted a large parf of his spare time during his 18 years at Kolhapur, is the History of Shivaji the Great, of about 1650 pages in four volumes, dedicated to the only ruling representative of the noble House of Shivaji the Great, His Late Highness Chhatrapati Shri Rajaram Maharaja of Kolhapur. He wrote and saw through print the concluding pages of the book during the last weeks of his illness. The index given at the end of the last volume was left in manuscript by him. It has been printed after his death. It was the desire of the Doctor to follow up his history of Shivaji by that of Rajaram, the second son of the founder of tha Maratha Empire. He was collecting meteriai for the purpose, especially from Dutch sources. Shortly before he left Gurukul, Kangri, his first wife had died, leaving him a son and three daughters. He married again in 1925 and left five children four daughters and a son. His first wife belonged to the Punjab and his widow, the undersigned, is from Maharashtra. * In the publication of Shivaji the Great the author received valuable help and encouragement from His Late Highness Chhatrapati Shri Rajaram Maharaj of Kolhapur and his Govern- ment, from His Late Highness Shri Sayajirao Maharaja oC Baroda, from the late Rajasaheb of Mudhol and others, for which I record my sincerest gratitude.

European envoys Several distinguished Europeans had interviews with Shivaji, but they were too much engrossed in their immediate concerns. Though they had golden opportunities of talking with Shivaji and closely observing him, yet they did not leave any detailed account of his personality. Stephen Ustick went as an ambassador of the English from Bombay, in 1672, Thomas Niccolls in 1673, II. Oxenden in 1674, Samuell Austin, R. Jones and Edw. Austen in 1675, Lieut. Adames and Mr. Mauleverer in 1676, and John Child in 1678. Each of these envoys had interviews with the Raja. Similarly, the chief of the Dutch Factory at Teganapatam carried rich presents to Shivaji in a pompous procession and secured an interview with him in July 1677. The French envoy Sieur Germain from Pondichery visited the Raja on the bank of the Coleroon river in the same month. It is a pity that no sketch of his person is available from these envoys. 1 2. Personal description Shivaji is described by Escaliot on the evidence of those who had seen him, to be of medium stature and of excellent proportion. He was active in exercise, possessed quick and piercing eyes, and was whiter than any of his people* He seemed to smile whenever he spoke. 9 His was a light weight of 140 Ibs English or at most 160 Ibs Dutch at the time of his coronation in June 1674 at the age of 44 years. 3 According to Thevenot, Shivaji was small in stature and tawny in complexion. " His eyes are very sharp and fiery, showing a great deal of intelligence. He usually takes one meal a day, and is quite healthy.*' 1-3. Shivaji Vol. I, Pp. 212, 229, 407, 411-25 ; II, Pp. 14. 33, 57, 59, 67. 74, 91, 96, 106-7. One Dutch envoy Abraham Lefeper visited Sh. at Rairi in 1672, Vol. I, p, 305. 2 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Father P. J. d'Orleans describes him as 'a little lively, restless man, but with all his impatience he wanted neither decision nor manly bearing.' Cosmo Da Guarda has fully confirmed the preceding remarks. 4t He was not only quick in action but lively in carriage also, for with a clear and fair face, nature had given him the greatest perfections, specially the dark big eyes were so lively that they seemed to dart rays of fire. To these was added a quick, clear and acute intelligence." 8 3. Portraits of Shivaji > We can form our own ideas on the physique and personality of Shivaji from the several paintings reproduced in these volumes. Manucci had the fullest opportunity to see Shivaji and talk to him in Raja Jaisingh's camp. The picture of Shivaji drawn for him by Pir Muhammad before 1688 should be the most reliable. The one from the Jaipur collection might be contemporary and would have been drawn by order of Raja Jaisingh. It has similarity of dress and features with the painting obtained in the Prince of Wales Museum in Bombay, but the latter has a dark coloured "face which is incorrect on all the evidence produced in the preceding section. In this picture Shivaji is represented in the court dress, while the Jaipur one depicts him in a homely atmosphere. The portrait from the British Museum and its reproduction given in Orme's Fragments are also contemporary and true to life* The portrait given in Bernier's Travels is a copy of the one in Valentyn's Oud-en Nieuvo Cost-Indian ( 1724 A. D. ). The latter was obtained at the Mogul court in 1712. They all show hint possessing a black beard and moustache, long hair at sides, a flowered chint toga with white ground, a purple silk scarf rich in gold embroidery thrown across the left shoulder, a beautifully worked sash, a Muslim paijama and a stylish pair of embroidered shoes. -The gold pagri or turban with a jewelled aigrette, black plume* 1. English Records, Vol. II, p. 334. 2. Sr N. Sen, Foreign Biographies of Shivaji, pp. 2 , 3. PERSONALITY OF SHIVAJI 3 and white pearls is peculiar to Shivaji. He can be easily identified by the shape of his turban. He is holding a very long straight sword, probably the well-known Bhavani in his left hand, and a patta or rapier in his right hand. Then on the left *ide a dagger is sticking out from the waist. One can easily mark out sharp eyes, a long aquiline nose, a neat and trimly cut beard, and small moustaches covering his upper lip. His face is fair, firm, and awe-inspiring. " We could descry ability and cunning, and the hardihood and daring of a conspirator against the rights of man one not easily cowed or alarmed, \\ith a strong faith in himself, and a gift to measure his own capacities, and those of the men who were to- be his helpers in his career of aggrandisement. \Vell worth looking at this man among men; sash across his breast, himself a Star of India, baleful enough, kingly cowl with its tassel of pearls and feathers. No need of a tiara of the diamonds of Golconda for this man, for his eagle eye ( on which all contemporaries are as much agreed as on the eye of Burns ) outshines them all." 1 4. Spartan simplicity was the most distinguishing feature of Shivaji's life. He cheerfully bore hardships by living in an unostentatious manner with his soldiers. His principles were rigid to an extreme degree. His army was not burdened with families of --officers and soldiers ; no dancing girls or women, no drinking booths, no wine and other intoxicants were allowed in the camps. In all flying expeditions wherein some town was to be surprised, rapidity of movement was achieved by having no equipage and commissariat department. In the Surat expedition of 1664 we find Shivaji sitting under a tree without any tent. Even in the Karnatic expedition we are told that there were two tents, one for himself and another for his ministers. In his dress and meals he was abstemious to an extraordinary degree. He contented himself with only one meal a day. Thus he avoided -all the Epicurean ways of life which enslaved many princes in every country; 1. J. Dongbias. The Book of Bombay. or> 424-25. 4 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 5. Freedom from drinks He led a very austere, stern and sober life. Non-indulgence in drinks and other intoxicants was religiously observed by him. The ancient conquerors like Alexander and Caesar were addicted to hard drinking, even Napoleon was not free from this vice. The Mogul emperors from Baber to Slmh Jahan were a prey to excessive drinks and narcotics. But here was a man far above the best generals of the ancient and contemporary world in this respect. He led the life of a saint, and abhorred dissipation of his energy in the pleasures of the flesh. The appreciative note of Montgomery Martin is worthy of record here : "Impartial judges admit that Sevajee possessed qualities which, in an unenlightened Hindoo, may be termed admirable. Prepared for every emergency, peril could not daunt, nor success intoxicate him. Frugal even to parsimony in his habits, courteous and endearing in manner, though passionate in disposition, he continued to the last to move freely about among the people, inspiring them with his own spirit of determined opposition to the Mahomedans. Intent on following every turn and winding of Aurangzeb's snake like policy, he also practised treacherous wiles ; but the use of these unworthy weapons* did not detract him from his personal courage. To have seen him charge, was the favourite boast of the troops engaged in the Deccani wars ; and his famous sword was preserved and regarded with nothing short of idolatrous veneration. 1 6. Respect for women While the Mogul Emperors like Akbar* Jahangir and Shah Jahan indulged in sexual excesses and loved Mina Bazars, Shivaji showed an unusual control of his passions. Though he married several wives for political purposes, he led a pure and noble family life. Even in his youth he refused to accept the hand of the captive beauty of Kalyan. He did not allow women in his military camps and even punished his own son Sambhaji for transgressing moral bounds. A high standard of sexual morality was set before his officers, generals, soldiers and the people. Chivalry was always shown to the weaker sex. Women were not to be killed fior made captives of waf. Whenever they fell into the hands of 1. R. Montgomery Martin, The Indian Empire, Vol. I, p, 149. PERSONALITY OF SHIVAJI 5 his army, they were treated with respect and honourably kept in custody till they were ransomed by their relatives. People took advantage of the rule of not capturing women by escaping m female dress as was done during the Karanja loot. J The Rai Bagin, one lady general of the Mogul forces, fought against Shivaji like a tigress, but was ultimately defeated and captured. She was, however, released with all honour due to her rank. 3 Similarly, in the Karnatic campaign when the Desain of Belvadi after submission was ill-treated by one of his officers, Shivaji had the latter blinded and interned. 3 Thus in entertaining high ideas regarding women of all sects and religions, he was far above the contemporary princes. 7. Religions devotion A robber and a monster could not be religiously austere. There are numerous evidences of his deep devotional mind, superstitious awe of gods, genuine respect for saints, and a deep faith m the greatness of the classical epics. His mother was responsible for inspiring the young mind with religious ideals, for creating a love for Hindu classics and for sermons of the saints. We are told stories of his attendance at Tukaram's sermons at the risk of his life, of renunciation of the world after hearing a discourse of Tukaram, of self-hypnotization which made him his own oracle, of dedicating his life to the service of the god at Shri "Shaila andofhis resolve of committing suicide there. He built new temples, repaired old ones, established new gods and goddesses in them, donated large sums for their expenses, made pilgrimage to famous shrines, and revered the holy men of all religions-Hindu, Muslim and Christian. In his expedition to Barcelore, he made it a point to visit Gokurn. In the Karnatic expedition many old shrines and sacred places were visited by him. Even while his life was in danger and *he was pursued by Aurangzeb's soldiers and spies, he did not lose 1*3. ShiTEJt Vol. I, pp. 283, 333 , Vol. II* 24. 6 SHIVAJI THE GREAT the opportunity of visiting the famous holy places of the Hindus- from Muttra to Jagannathpuri. Before his coronation, he is said to have gone on a pilgrimage to Chiplun and Pratapgarh, and to be- engaged m worshipping the deities and in performing other devotional ceremonies for several days in succession. His chanties to the Bhawani of Pratapgarh, to the famous- Math of Ramdas at Chafal, to the Math of Mauni Baba at Patgaon,. to the most sacred shrine of Shn Shaila, to Keshav Swami of Hyderabad, and to the Konheri Math are a few instances of the vast donations given by him for revival and development of the Hindu religion. He was consequently conferred the title of " the Protector of cows and Brahmans" which he richly deserves. For the preservation and development of religion he created a new department under a new minister called Panditrao, while for his family guidance he had distinguished scholars like Balam Bhat. There is an order of the Minister Panditrao Moreshwar dated 19 Feb. 1677 to the Deshmukh to give maintenance allowance to all the Brahmans of the districts of Phonda, Dicholi, Mandangad and Bhivgad whether they belonged to Desha or Karad, Chitpawans, Padye Brahmans and Jyotishis after holding an examination to test their learning. At the time of his coronation twenty-thousand Brahmans were present at Raigad. All of them were fed for several days and finally were presented gifts. Therefore he was rightly called the " Protector of Brahmans." His devotion to saints and seers will be shown later on. It will suffice to remark here that he was the cause of renaissance and reformation in the Hindu religion and Hindu society. 8. Shivaji a mystic Howsoever paradoxical it might appear, it is true that Shiva was a great mystic. In his early career he is~ said to have taken the resolve to renounce the world after hearing the sermon of saint Tukaram on renunciation. His mother -and friends could not dissuade, him from his intention to become a PERSONALITY OF SHIVAJI 7 Tecluse. However, the advice of the saint and the entreaties of the mother induced the youth to give up his resolve. At the end of his -career on the march to Madras he visited the magnificent temple of Shri Shaila. There in a fit of devotion and ecstasy he was ready to dmmolate himself on the altar of the god ( Vol. II, p. 233 ). The Bakhars record that he used to get hypnotic fits wherein he sought the advice of his guardian goddess Bhawani. The words spoken by him during these ecstatic fits were written down by his private secretary Balaji Avaji. In times of crises he used to follow this advice. On many critical occasions such as the invasions of Afzal Khan, Shaista Khan, Jaisingh, or even during his imprisonment at Agra, Shivaji had trances to find out the solution of his difficulties through these intuitions. It is possible that Shivaji might have been dissimulating to impress his colleagues and subjects with the idea that he was in communion with God whose will was being carried out through his instrumentality. The people came to believe that he was the chosen medium of God, His effective instrument to destroy the Mlechhas. The general impression of his devotions and trances, of his being a favourite medium of God if not His incarnation, won him the veneration of all his officers and subjects. They began to look upon ^hini as a superman, as a favourite of fortune, a man of destiny who had been born to avenge and restore Hinduism. 9. Shivaji a fatalist His frequent appeal to God proves him to be a fatalist. He blindly followed the advice obtained in the fits of trance. For instance, he gave up himself and his forts to Jaisingh at the dictates of the so-called divine Bhavani. He went to Agra -after he had been given an assurance in an ecstatic fit by this protecting goddess. It is stated that his intellect was clouded and he was highly dejected during his imprisonment at Agra, but the goddess again came to his rescue. Thus he has been shown to be working under the spell of a supernatural power by the writers of theMarathi chronicles. This version placeshim under the supremacy -of a controlling power outside himself. A great conqueror like Shiva was a master and not a slave of destiny. There is no mention in 8 SHIVAJI THE GREAT these Bhakars that he ever consulted astrologers on what he should' do and should not do. On the other hand, there is European evidence tha he was always cautious to studiously conceal his plans. Here is the impartial testimony of Jonathan Scott. "He planned his schemes- wisely and executed them with steadiness. He consulted many on every point but acted according to that advice, which after weighing in his own mind he thought best applicable to his designs. No one was ever acquainted with his determinations but by the success of their execution." A remarkable confirmation comes from the pen of the historian Scott Waring: " His talent as a soldier places him above the heroes of the East. His schemes comprehended the option of more than one success ; nor did the accomplishment of his object discover the extent of its advantage, until developed by subsequent acquisitions. His personal activity was astonishing ; no route, however, but had been traversed by his indefatigable patience. His troops, led by himself by the nearest and most secret paths, hardly knew the object of their attack, until they beheld the enemy they were to defeat, or the city they were to pillage. His passions were at his command; and he never betrayed, either by word or gesture^ the movements of his mind. No emergency, however sudden, found him without recourse; no danger, however imminent appalled a mind accustomed to the greatest trials." Such a master-mind could not be a slave of fate or destiny. He was indeed a favourite child of destiny upon whom she invariably showered successes in all his adventures. 10. Shivftji a diplomat His diplomacy shines forth brilliantly at the early age of eighteen when through Mogul intercession he succeeded in securing the release of his father from the living coffin raised by the Bijapur king to smother him. Shiva and his men outwitted the Mores, and captured Javli. He took fullest advantage of the death of the Bijapur king and the absence of Aurangzeb from the Deccan by allying himself with the Moguls against Bijapur and thereby winning their friendship. This step resulted in the invasion of Afzal Khan who was outrivalled in S. 1. PERSONALITY OF SHIVAji 9 diplomacy and treacherous wiles by Shivaji. This 'mountain rat' was, through his superb genius, able to surprise the giant-like Shaista Khan in his bed, thoroughly rape Surat, sear the beard of wily Aurangzeb in his own capital by making a miraculous escape from Agra, tear off the veil of invincibility of the Mogul Empire, and finally eat away its vitals to such an extent that it was left a Jhollow carcass. His diplomacy reaches its climax in coming to terms with the Hindu Raja Jaisingh whom he wanted to win over to his cause and in wreaking his vengeance upon Bijapur which had stabbed Shivaji in the back by invading the Konkon. But he did not assist the Moguls to such an extent as to really weaken Bijapur and thus permit it to become a morsel to the Moguls. He showed his mailed fist in a velvet glove to the ruler of Bijapur and entered into a, secret alliance with him against the invaders. After his release from Agra, he consolidated his kingdom and strengthened his forces with such rapidity that he was able to forcibly retake all the forts which he had been compelled to cede to- the Moguls. Through his unrivalled diplomacy he maintained a successful struggle against the mightiest empire of the world, and hardly suffered a defeat from the greatest generals of the Mogul army. In 1675 Shivaji coaxed Bahadur Khan for a truce, but after a few months when his object of conquering parts of the Konkon from Bijapuris had been realized, he summarily insulted the Mogul commander and the Emperor by rejecting the terms of the treaty. Soon after he again succeeded in making a truce with the- Moguls and an alliance with Kutub Shah to conquer the Karnatic. His triumph in annexing the defunct Vijayanagar empire up to- Rameshwaram to his kingdom and freeing his younger brother from the suzerainty of Bijapur, sheds glory on his statemanship. At thfr cod of bis career he was trying to capture Bijapur itself and in saving it from being absorbed by the Moguls. It was his incomparable statesmanship which was ever vigilant against the conquest of the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golconda by the Moguls. Through his- 10 SHIVAJI THE GREAT displomacy he secured financial help from these states for his wars against the Mogul armies. We must not lose sight of the fact that he maintained friendly relations with all the four European nations with whom he came into contact. Yet he defended his shipping, trade, port towns and his people from their onslaughts. The Portuguese, the English, the Dutch and the French were, as far as possible, well treated by Shivaji. He also tried to maintain a balance of power among them. For instance, he did not help the Dutch in capturing Bombay or Goa. 11. He was unique as a constructive statesman His organizing ability is manifest from the very start, since orderly administration went hand in hand with expansion. He took 20,000 Brahrnans with him on his Karnatic expedition to organize and consolidate the newly conquered districts. The contemporary European writers have borne testimony to the remarkable skill shown by Shivaji in introducing improved methods of administration in the south. The Moslem administration was oppressive on account of the employment of illiterate, mercenary and foreign adventurers who were working as officers. He did away with all foreigners and uneducated people, but appointed only educated men as officers. He took effective steps to check peculation and corruption, and thus raised the standard of administration to such a high pitch that his subjects were contented, peaceful and prosperous. Whatever fort or territory fell into the hands of Shivaji, was immediately so strengthened and organized, that it could scarcely be recovered by his enemies. Very few instances can be quoted of the reconquest of forts by the Mogul or Adilshahi forces. This fact alone speaks volumes of his organising capacity, vigilant administration, and faithful devotion of his people. 12. Shivaji as a commander Shivaji stands foremost in the rank of the great commanders of the world. During the political career of 35 years from 1645 to 1680 there was no commander Hindu or Muslim of the Bijapur kingdom or of the most powerful and prosperous Empire of the Moguls who did not ultimately suffer defeat from Shivaji. Princes of the royal blood, Persians, premiers, Pathans and Rajput rulers like Jaswant Singh Rathor were all PERSONALITY OF SHIVAJI 11 Helpless against the resources of the Maratha commander. Shivaji stands foremost as an individual warrior, as an organizer and leader of armed forces. He possesses the highest military qualities of chivalrous courage, vigilant precaution and abundant resourcefulness* He took the fullest advantage of his victories and struck effective blows where they were most unexpected. He was always prompt in taking advantage of the enemy's vacillation, and in falling upon him unawares. He was inaster in the art of diplomacy. No- politician, statesman or general of his time can stand comparison to him in this sphere. He never shirked from entering upon desperate attempts with utmost vigour and courage. He risked his life in a duel with Afzal Khan, in his remarkable exploit against Shaista Khau, or in visiting Surat and Prince Muazzam in disguise, and especially in placing himself in the wily clutches of Aurangzeb. Alexander and Frederick had the fortune to inherit armies- trained by their fathers, and most of their distinguished generals had served in the army before their times. Here was an adventurer who had himself to create an army and train commanders in the shortest possible time. Scholars, clerks, peasants, rustics, wild tribes, in fact, men of all classes and grades of society were recruited in the army. We see the wonderful phenomenon of the creation of an army which inflicted defeats upon the Muslim warriors of the Deccan, the veteran forces of the Moguls, and the unflinching Jknights of the Rajput Princes. His claim to greatness lies in training hundreds of commanders and infusing an indomitable military spirit among the masses, so that after his death they could successfully fight a war of independence against the greatest power on earth in those days. They were all animated with religious fervour, courage,, patriotism, discipline, self-confidence and hope of success-remarkable qualities inherited from this great leader of men. Contemporary Englishmen compared him with Alexander, Hannibal, Caesar. The Portuguese confirmed the same view. The Hindus compared him with their greatest heroes like Parashuram, llama, Krishna, Bhima, Balaram, etc. 12 SHIVAJI THE GREAT The distinguished historian Orme has paid a great tribute to Shivaji. " Shivaji possessed all the qualities of a commander. He spared no cost to obtain intelligence of all motions and intentions of his enemies and even of their minuter imports. In personal activities he exceeded all the generals of whom there is record. No general ever traversed as much ground as he, at the head of armies. He met every emergency of peril howsoever sudden and extreme with instant discernment and unshaken fortitude. The ablest of his officers acquiesced to the imminent superiority of his genius, and the boast of the soldier was to have seen Shivaji charging, , sword in hand." ! General Sullivan's remarks deserve notice. " He possessed every quality requisite for success in the disturbed age in which he lived ; cautious and wily m council, he was fierce and daring in action ; he possessed an endurance that made him remarkable even amongst his hardy subjects, and an energy and decision that would in any age have raised him to distinctions. By his own people he was painted on a white horse going at full gallop, tossing grains of rice into his mouth, to signify that his speed did not allow him to stop to eat. He was the Hindu prince who forced the heavy Mogul cavalry to fly before the charge of the native horse of India ; his strength and activity in action were the glory and admiration of his race. 9 The appreciation of J. Scott is worth reading. " Sewajee was, as a soldier unequalled, skilled in the art of government and a friend to men of virtue and ' religion. He planned his schemes wisely and executed them with steadiness. He consulted many on every point but acted according to that advice which after weighing in his own mind he thought best applicable to his designs. No one was ever acquainted with his determinations but by the success of their executions." 3 13. Shivaji and Napoleon-*- Napoleon ' was indeed a great military genius, a unique general and administrator. But we must 1. Orme, Historical Fragments, pp. 93-94. 2. Sir E. Sullivan, Warriors and Statesmen of India, p. 384. 3. Jonathan Scott* History of the Deccan,. Vol. II, p. 54. PERSONALITY OF SHIVAJI 13 not forget that he left one army to its fate in Egypt, and fled with his own life by abandoning a still greater multitude on the snows of Russia. Finally, the remnant of his vast army he saw routed at Waterloo. This great conqueror of the world ultimately fell into the hands of his mortal enemies and remained their captive on a solitary island up to the end of his life. His empire vanished, his code was torn up and his son was disinherited in his life-time. The tragic end of Napoleon and the pathetic dissolution of his empire wear off the lustre of his victories and glories. Shivaji had no mortification of such disgraceful defeats and heart-rending tragedies. The foundations of his empire were dug so deep and it was so completely welded together that it could successfully pass through the greatest crisis after his death. It grew bigger and stronger with the lapse of time, so that his successors are still ruling at Kolhapur after the lapse of more than 250 years. 14. An extraordinary resourcefulness was a remarkable feature of his genius. His whole life is a commentary on the superb versatility exhibited by him in times of emergency. He was never taken at a disadvantage by the wiles, deceits, secret plans and perfidy of his enemies. On the contrary he mostly succeeded in catching them in his net. His genius seemed to shine brilliantly amidst dangers, and he adopted original means to rescue himself or to destroy his enemies. The release of Shahji, the massacre of Mores, the assassination of Afzal Khan, his escape from Panhala, his ruse near Vishalgad, the rape of Surat, his escape from Agra, his flight through the Mogul Empire, are exploits which appear to be romances. These magnificently illustrate the versatility of his -unique genius. Dpuglas has well said : " Like all animals that have been hunted ( as he, Shivaji had been ) he was wary and apprehensive to a degree and boundless in stratagem to meet sudden emergencies. In this science he had more in his little finger than Aurangzeb had in his whole body a light sleeper with one eye ever open. And for courage we have Orme's authority and he may have had it from a Jiving representative, that it was the boast of soldiers to have been 14 SHIVAJI THE GREAT -with Shivaji when he rushed sword in band into the midst of the- enemy." l 15. The character of Shivaji has been rightly protrayed by Swami Ramdas. His appreciation of the virtues of the young king was the reflection of the popular opinion. Therefore it embodies* the Hindu contemporary view. " He is like a high mountain in determination. He is th&^ support of many people. He is unflinching in his ideals. He is rich in asceticism. The stream of his good deeds is ever flowing. How can the greatness of his virtues be compared to others ? He is a glorious, victorious, valorous, virtuous, charitable, diplomatic, and wise king. He is devoted to virtue, reason, charity and religion. He is humble, though he is omniscient. He is unwa\ering, liberal* grave, heroic and ever-ready for action. This best of kings has outdone others in resourcefulness. He is the protector of the gods,, religion, cows and Brahmans. In his heart God has established Himself to inspire him. Scholars, Sadhus, poets, Brahmans devoted to sacrifices, and philosophers are supported by him. There is none like him as a protector of religion in this world. If the religion of Maharashtra is somewhat alive now, it is due to him." 16. The Lion of Maharashtra: Such was the saintly king who was spitefully and preversely called a ' Mountain Rat ' and an. unscrupulous villain by his enemies. He was undoubtedly a man of the mountain. His admirers style him the Lion of Maharashtra^ There is no doubt that he turned lambs into lions. The poor,, down-trodden, submissive, fatalistic masses of Maharashtra were galvanized by his magic touch and inspiring personality into a superhuman activity. They were transformed into finest soldiers*, dare-devils, consummate generals, constructive statesmen to match the mighty Moguls, the heroes of a hundred battles. Such was the magic transformation brought by this ' illiterate, uncultured,, despised, robber.' Shivaji can justly be called a magician, a superman whose deeds shall ever emblazen the pages of Indian., history. I. ] Douglas, Bombay and Western India. Vol. I, p, 368. CHAPTER II Shivaji a Robber 1. European view: The Europeans did not realize that "Shivaji was fighting for the freedom of the Hindus from the onslaughts of fanatic Muslim kings. They called him a marauder, a robber, a rover, a thief, a freebooter, a plunderer. Contemporary Englishmen condemn him as " a pirate and universal robber that hath no regard to friend nor foe, God nor man." The republican Dutch were specially profuse in calling him a robber. In almost every letter reproduced m these volumes, Shivaji is addressed a robber or rover by them. He has been branded as a monster of atrocious cruelty, a merciless tyrant, an incendiary who indulged in an orgy of plunder and desolation of opulent cities and rich provinces. He was railed a devil, a devil's son, the son of damnation, a hell-dcg by the contemporary Muslims, and the Atila of Asia by the Portuguese. Even Col. Tod was so unsympathetic as to say that " the Marathas were associations of vampires who drained the very life-blood wherever the scent of spoil attracted them. ' Sir John Seeley bluntly wrote that ' in the Maratha movement there never was anything elevated or patriotic, but that it continued from the first to be an organisation of plunder. 1 V. Smith, a distinguished English historian who spent his whole active career in India, has nothing better to say. " The Maratha independent rule A* as the rule of professed robbers. In short, the Marathas were robbers by profession." Sir J. Sarkar, the learned historian of Shivaji, writes that the object of Shivaji's military enterprises was mere plunder. 2. Plunder ifter an ultimatum: It is asserted that Shivaji freely indulged in lawless plunder and rapine, indiscriminate 16 SHIVAJI THE GREAT destruction, cruelty and tyranny. The plunder of Surat, Rajapur^ Karwar, Hubli, Chhapra, etc, left heaps of ashes and ruins of desolation. We have heart-rending scenes of the destruction of many such places. These volumes provide numerous instances of the horrible scenes of plunder and arson. But we should not forget the circumstances which led to the fiercest retribution. Shiva did not indulge in indiscriminate plunder, but his loot was regulated by humane laws. Every time that the Maratha forces approached Surat, the- authorities and the people \\ere given ultimatums to send an adequate present to the invading army within a certain time,, otherwise the city >\ould be given over to the fire and sword. Even in the case of Karwar, Vmgurla, Hubli such ultimatums are unequivocally mentioned. As early as May 1663 the English factors write that " all the way as he goes along, he gives his Qaul, premising them that neither he nor his souldiers shall in the least do any wrong to any body that takes his Qaul ; which promise he hitherto hath kept" * Thus plunder was resorted to in places where ransom was not paid. The Dutch while condemning his tyranny, have admitted that he gave an opportunity to the people to ransom their places, *' Nearly all the places he marched through, were set on fire by him if they did not pay the money he demanded and that so hastily that parents could not save their children from the flames." * 3. Rules re. Plunder: It was a recognized law of Shivaji that cows, calves, women, children, Brahmans and priests of all religions, were not to be molested in plundering a town. All houses of God, like temples, mosques and churches, even orphanages and convents were sacred, and consequently, exempt from plunder. A millionaire escaped in the disguise of a woman from Karanja as he Jcnew that he would not be molested or questioned in that dress. 3 1. Shivaji, Vol. I, p. 83; see pp 196, 291, 294, 326, 345, 559. 2. Shivaji, Vol. I. p. 559. 3. Sbivaji, Vol. I. p. 232. S. 2. SHIVAJI A ROBBER 17 In Surat the Capuchin priests were given protection, and hence the Maratha Raja is called " the Holy Shivaji " by Bermer. Not only this, the same writer produces another testimony of the discriminatory system of Maratha loot. Mohandns Parekh of Surat was well-known for his charities, and hence even after his death the house of such a pious man was exempted from plunder by an order of Shivaji. On p. 573 of Vol. I, there is a Dutch statement that Shiva carried away from Bardes young girls whom he sold to his soldiers. This might be an exception to the general rule. He had invaded Bardes for the protection of the Hindus who on pain of banishment had been prohibited the exercise of their religion (Vol. II, p. 507 ) The general practice of the times was to enslave both men and women. Shivaji as a rule refrained from slavery, but the Portuguese oppressions might have led him to follow the general custom of enslaving women as a retaliatory measure. When Shah Jahan destroyed the Portuguese town of Hugh in Bengal, 4,400 were taken prisoners, and of these 500 best looking young persons were sent to Agra. The girls were distributed among the harems of the Emperor and the nobility ; and the boys were circumcised and made Mussaltnans. 1 4. The regulations regarding expeditions laid down that an inventory of the goods of every soldier was to be made on the start and also on his return. The articles taken in loot and belonging to the state, were taken from him and his pay for the months of service was given to him. Shivaji kept spies in the army to see bow far his regulations were being observed. The delinquents were punished. In the loot of Hubly the English claimed a large sum of compensation from Shivaji. He told them that he had not received their articles. These might have been plundered by a party of the Muslims which followed the Maratha army. In the Dharangaon plunder too the English factors demanded far more than was reported to Shivaji. He refused to compensate them for anything more than had been received by him. It is evident that 1. Elliot, VII, pp. 42-43; 211. 18 SHIVAJI THE GREAT he had much confidence in the strict discipline of his army and believed that there were a very few opportunities for embezzlement accessible to his sepoys. Thus plunder was regulated by detailed rules, and indiscriminate cruelty was avoided as far as possible. We learn from Da Guarda that it was the strict order of Shivaji that unless resistance was offered, no one should be killed. 1 5. Plunder justified His system of plunder is fully justifiable. Once it is admitted that he was at war with the Muslim States, "both of the South and the North, he was permitted by both Eastern and Western international laws to lead plundering expeditions into- the enemy's country. Sukra in his ' Sukraniti ' has clearly laid down that 2 The powerful should carefully coerce the enemy by stopping- the supplies of water, provisions, fodder, grass, etc. in an unfavourable region and then extirpate it. One should commence military operations all of a sudden and withdraw also in an instant and fall upon the enemy like robbers from a distance. 1 ' The punitive expeditions in the N. W. frontier of India led by the Indian Government are of the same kind. The desolating expeditions against the Red Indians by civilized Americans to exterminate the whole race, were decidedly worse than those of Shivaji. The Spanish expeditions for the wholesale extinction of the native Americans in Mexico, Peru and Brazil fully illustrate the unbridled character of civilized warfare of Europe. Shivaji did not adopt those devilish methods. Compare the cruel tyrannies inflicted upon the innocent people by the Christian conquerors in Mexico, Peru and Brazil, or in the U. S. A. and Australia in modern times. We should not ignore the indiscriminate slaughter of the undefended civilian population by bombs and poisonous gases in Abyssinia, Spain and Poland. 1. Shiraji, Vol. 1,208. 2. 'Ch, IV. VII. 740, 747 ( Eng. Trans. ). SHIVAJI A ROBBER 19 6. System of Ckantk We should particularly remember his system of Chauth which was le\ ied from the enemy subjects to give them protection from further invasion and molestation. Thus the Maratha ruler made all efforts to reduce the miseries and pangs of warfare by wise regulations- He invited the enemy subjects to accept his sovereignty or his protection by giving Chauth. If these alternatives were not accepted by them, they were to undergo all the miseries which war would justify to be inflicted upon them. By Ins frequent expeditions against Surat and other rich commercial towns, he impressed upon the people that they were insecure and unprotected under Muslim rulers, hence they should renounce their allegiance to them and accept his rule. Once they became his subjects, whether they were Hindus or Muslims, they enjoyed peace and security in the Maratha Raj. 7. Why Black-nail necessary ? Shivaji often used to say to the Mogul subjects that their Emperor was hurling armies after armies against him, and was thus compelling him to maintain large forces to defend his territory. These extra armies could be maintained by extra taxes levied upon his own subjects or by the plunder obtained from the Mogul territories. The first course would have exhausted his own people, but by the second method he enriched his people* enthused them for war, infused a spirit of invincibility in them, and showed them the weakness of his enemies. Thus for eight months his soldiers used to feed themselves at the expense of the enemy, and also bring much wealth into their own country. In short, the maxims of political science, international lawt and historical practice supply justification of his plundering system. It is to the credit of Shivaji that he made efforts to minimize the miseries of war. His was an organised plunder full of humane laws. Hence he stands far above such conquerors as Alexander, Afahmnd, Changez, Timur and Nadirshah. 8. Sbi?aji aid Makamd: The lust of plunder alone lured Mahmud to the richest temple of Somnath. It was mere filthy lucre that was the cause of his fourteen expeditions to India. 20 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Compare his proverbial cupidity of refusing to give the agreed sum to Firdausi, the author of Shahnama, with the generosity that characterized Shivaji in patronizing hundreds of scholars and saints. Then compare the death-scenes of both. While Mahmud bitterly cried and shed a stream of tears at being deprived by the god of death, of wealth which had been laboriously accumulated by him, Shivaji, though his treasuries were full like those of Mahmud, lay unconcerned with respect to wealth. He was engrossed in contemplating God with a spiritual calm and peace unusual in crowned persons. It appeared that he had been leading a life of renunciation and not of a leader of conquering hosts. 9. Shivaji and Changez Khan It is necessary here to bring- in the name of Changez Khan, the scourge of God, the mighty man-slayer who demolished numerous cities, devastated vast countries, massacred and enslaved hundreds of thousands of men. In Herat and its surrounding districts 600,000 persons were put to the sword, while in Bagdad the figure of the dismal holocaust rose to 1,600,000 people. Historians have estimated that more than one crore and eighty lakhs people were done to death by the Mongols. " The grim pageantry of death that appeared in the tracks of the Mongol horsemen" has been well depicted by various historians- Elphinstone has well said that " this irruption of the Moguls was the greatest calamity that has fallen on rnankind since the deluge/* "This destruction of human life bewilders the modern imagination." 1 Shivaji was mercy itself as compared to the Mongol conquerors. 10. Shivaji and Timor: Now let us compare him with Timur. This Turko-Mongol scourge of mankind invaded India for slaves and wealth. From Hindukush to Samana, ' he slaughtered the inhabitants of every place he passed.' 8 By the time that he reached Delhi, he had one hundred thousand Hindu slaves in his camp* Foreseeing the danger of revolt and disturbance by such large , i 1. Cf. Harold Lamp, Genghis Khan. p. 13 ; Elphinstone, History of India, p. 321. * 2. Elphinstone, Ibid, p. 406. SHIVAji A ROBBER 21 -numbers at the time of his battle with the Delhi forces, he mercilessly ordered all these human beings to be put to the sword as if they were dogs or flies. This is only one example of the mercy and humanity of this world-conqueror. On his return from India, in all the places visited by him innumerable infidels were despatched to the fires of hell. Thousands of people who escaped death were made prisoners and carried to Samarkand. The fair city of Delhi was given up to plunder and conflagration for five days. During such a horrible massacre of human beings Timur was celebrating a feast in honour of his victory. Towers were built with the heads of Hindus and their bodies were Mt to beasts and birds of prey. Elphmstone summarizes the character of Timur by calling him a wily, violent, and perfidious politician. 1 Shivaji did not enslave any people - even the Muslims, though captives of war could be sold in slavery by him according to the custom of the time. Even the Europeans in those days were enslaving Indians and transporting them to their colonies. But Shivaji did not follow this reprehensible practice. His ideal was to liberate his people from the foreign yoke and to break the bonds of the slavery of the Hindus. 11. Shivaji and Nadirihah: Lastly, we should like to bring out an incident from the lives of Nadirshah and Shivaji. The former gave up Delhi, the most splendid city of the Mcgul Empire to fire, sword and indiscriminate plunder on the murder of his few soldiers by some aggrieved inhabitants of the city. At least 30,000 persons were brutally murdered, though Fraser puts the figure at 150,000 men. The city remained a hedious scene of rapine, lust, destruction, fire, blood and terror for full one day. Shivaji was mercy itself on a much more serious occasion. The Governor of Surat employed an assassin to murder the Raja. He came as an ambassador of the Governor, and in course of conversation thrust his dagger at the heart of Shivaji. The body-guard of the Raja was extremely vigilant, he cut off the hand of the assassin in the very act of thrusting the dagger, so that Shivaji received only 1. History of India, p. 408. 22 SHIVAJI THE GREAT a slight wound. But both the Raja and the assassin weltered in a pool of blood. The Marathas thought that their Raja was murdered. They ordered the heads of the captives to be cut off in revenge.. In a few moments Shivaji came back to senses. He at once stopped the massacre of the few captnes in his camp, and took no measures to avenge himself for this dastaidly deed upon the Governor or the the people of Surat. On comparing Shivaji with the Asiatic conquerors, it will be seen that the latter fully indulged in plunder, rapine, oppression, tyranny, slavery, forcible conversions. All of these came to put the yoke of foreign rule on this country. They \\erenotonly slave-making and fanatic Ghazies for comerting Hindus into Muslims, but were the destroyers of the liberty and autonomy of the Indian people. On the other hand, Shivaji stood forth as the patriotic champion of the freedom and independence of his people. He proved himself their liberator from the centuries of foreign rule. There can really be no comparison between a patriotic liberator of his mother-land and a destroyer of the liberties of men, between a slave-driver aud a slave-liberator, between a fanatic Ghazi and an ardent and respectful admirer of all religions. Comparisons are said to be odious, but the study of history will be fruitless, if readers are not to have a comparative insight into the deeds of great men. CHAPTER III The Grand Rebel or Liberator 1. Misconception of European settler*: The English factors of Karwar felicitously described Shiva in 1678 as " the grand rebel and great disturber of the felicity of the Deccan." Whilst the Bijapun forces " lie effiminately at house fearful of wetting their tender skins, our Maharajah plays his game so wisely as to destroy, rob, plunder, devastate and ruin the major and best part of their kingdom." One Surat letter of 1666 reports the defeat of ' that grand rebell Sevagy ' and another of his imprisonment in these words: " The grand rebell Sevagee is at last entrapped and caught in the same nett of glorious promises that hee was wont to make for others by this King, who is as perfidious as himself." Soon after it is reported that ' the grand rebel Sevage is escaped ' from Agra. The Surat factors again in 1673 refer to Shivaji as ' that grand rebel who doth persist in his villanies.' : In several letters he is styled ' the great rebel ,' ' the arch rebel.* It is true that he was a rebel against the Muslim monarchies of Delhi and the Deccan. He aimed at their overthrow, and worked for the restoration of the freedom and independence of his own country. He stands in the foremost rank ot such liberators as Washington, Garibaldi, De Valera and Lenin. Each one of these rebels fought apainst the foreign or despotic government then prevalent in his country. Shivaji rebelled against political oppression, religious intolerance, social injustice, and cultural suppression, rampant under the Muslim monarchies. Through his extraordinary powers he succeeded in freeing the Hindus from the galling yoke of centuries. The European settlers in India could not appreciate his high and noble motives, but were superficial observers of the events passing before their eyes. Abbe Carre rightly appreciated the career of Shivaji by 1. Shivaji, Vol. I, pp. 245, 256, 266, 409, Vol. II, 198. 24 SHIVAJI THE GREAT saying that he soon appeared to the East in a rebel subject a_ conqueror worthy nevertheless to be compared with the greatest men. 1 In another place he describes Shiva as ' one of the greatest warriors that the East has seen since a long time, and who, for his courage, the rapidity of his conquests and his great qualities, does not badly resemble the great Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus. The same author has testified that Shiva was loved by his enemies. "To this swiftness he like Julius Caesar joined a clemency and a goodness which gained for him the hearts of those whom his arms came to terrify.' 1 It is a pity that the European powers of the time, though themselves fighting for religious liberty in Europe and struggling for the independence of their countries, could not perceive any higher motive in the struggles of Shivaji. In England the struggle for religious liberty was led by John Wichf and Henry VIII. For a century and a half the English kings and people were fighting for the victory of their respective faiths, Protestantism or Catholicism. At last in 1688, the people succeeded by a bloodless revolution to change the succession to the throne from a Catholic king to a foreign Protestant ruler, William III. In that very year here in India, the Mogul Emperor Aurangzeb completed his conquest of the three Deccan monarchies and wreaked his vengeance by mercilessly -executing the Hindu Chhatrapati Sambhaji, the leader of an independent Hinduism against the persecuting Islam. He came to believe that the Hindus of the Deccan would submit themselves- like those of the North to his persecuting laws and would soon accept Islam. He could hardly realize that Shivaji had prepared millions of Sambhajis for the defence of the Hindu religion and the overthrow of the Islamic state. " The army of Rajaram like that of Rama should fall upon the Muslims suddenly, from unexpected quarters in bands of 500 or 1,000, even 200 men. They should separate them, drive them,, kill them and then run away. To sum up, all the people should have one aim of protecting Rajaram's kingdom at the sacrifice o 1. Shivaji. Vol. I, p. 232 ; Hist. Misc. Pp. 36. 46. S. 3. THE GRAND REBEL OR LIBERATOR 25 their own lives. The whole Hindu people should struggle for their independence without caring for their lives." The Marathas -were transformed from a timid and down-trodden people into a conquering nation. Man)' people had been prepared to lay down their lives at the altar of their religion and country by the great king Shivaji. It was this wonderful transformation of the whole people from down-trodden, persecuted, passive, patient, submissive -and suppressed sheep into fearless, revengeful and conquering lions that \vab the immortal work of the great king. He had succeeded in uniting all the warring castes of the Hindus into one nation infused with the spirit of independence and conquest. His real work was visible after his death in times of the grave national emergency. The indigenous as well as the foreign people used to- call the Maratha soldiers as " Shivajis," as if every Maratha sepoy had become an incarnation of Shivaji. 2. The mortal fear of the Maratbas: It was not merely the name of Shivaji which caused consternation among the Muslim .armies, even after his death his generals Dhanaji Jadhav and Santaji Ghorpade had created an extraordinary terror in the minds- -of their Muslim foes. Whenever a horse refused to drink water, the attendant used to question the animal whether it was seeing Ghorpade in the water. Trained for many years under the vigilant eye, strict discipline, elevating example and noble idealism of the great king, hundreds and thousands of officers unflinchingly carried on the war of independence for twenty years against the greatest power on earth in those days, and finally succeeded in inflicting crushing defeats upon their aged foe who died of a broken heart. At Aurangabad at his death-bed he had the generosity and vision to appreciate the virtues of Shivaji, who though dead, was present upon the battle-fields in spirit and was encouraging his soldiers to -display their superhuman bravery. 3. HinM Swaraj or the ideal of Indian independence: It is absolutely incorrect to say that Shivaji had no ideal except plunder* His ideal bad been definitely determined as early as 1645 when he was a boy of sixteen and at the threshold of his political career* 26 SHIVAJI THE GREAT The appropriate portion has been reproduced on 23rd page of Part II. There are two more letters Nos. 503 and 506 requiring Dadaji Naras Prabhu to give up the cause of Shivaji and show allegiance to the Bijapur ruler. * It appears that up to that time notable Maval Deshmukhs like Bandal, Khopde and Jedhe had not allied themselves with this Maratha dreamer of Swaraj. Shivaji was convinced that God was with him in this holy war. He was consequently anxious to obtain the blessings of holy men and through them of gods. In a letter of Feb. 1653 Shivaji granted an Inam to a Brahman of Mahabaleshwar for performing certain rites to secure the progress of his Rajya. As this grant was made with the sanction of his mother, it is evident that she was in full sympathy with the ideal of her son. A few months later another grant was made to a Brahman of Chakan, because Shivaji had become entitled to a Rajya and obtained the fulfilment of his desire through the power of the holy man's prayers to God. a Being a noble of Bijapur and anxious to keep his power and position in old age, Shahji could not openly sympathize with the deeds of his son* After his release from captivity at Bijapur in 1649, he planned an independent kingdom for his adventurous son, gave him his most trusted servants, advised them to bring all the Maval Deshmukhs tinder him and to repel the attacks of both the Mogul and Bijapur forces. All along Shahji was anxiously watching and praying for the success of the young dreamer. He had vowed to offer a rich gift to the famous god of Jejuri if his son succeeded in establishing Swaraj. 3 After the murder of Afzal Khan Shahji began to advance with his troops to assist his son for capturing Bijapur, but the scheme was given up when the old warrior learnt the withdrawal of the Maratha forces. Thus Swaraj and Hindvi Swaraj were ideals before Shivaji from 1645. Nothing succeeds like success. In the beginning it was a day-dream impossible to be realized. Hence all important persons kept themselves aloof from the arch rebel. But l. P. S. S. 2-3 Shivaji, Part I, 168; Part II. 30. THE GRAND REBEL OR LIBERATOR 27 as the dream began to be transformed into a reality, more and more Maratha nobles joined him in this holy cause. Now it is manifest that Shivaji for the first time used the magnetic \\ords "Hindvi S\varaj" which ha\e become popular since then. It should be noted that it was not merely Swaraj for Maharashtra, not even Swaraj for the Hindus, but an All-Indian Swaraj. He was against foreign rule and religious persecutions. He even tried to win the Irdian Muslims to his cause and made an alliance against the foreign Pathans, Moguls and Persians. As the Muslim rulers were fanatically engaged in the unholy work of forcible conversions, he was ultimately led to subvert Muslim rule in India and establish Hindu Swaraj in the whole of India. A few evidences are culled below to manifest his noble ideal of Indian independence. 1. His ambitious programme of conquest is significantly indicated by the motto engraved on his royal seal. It was fixed to- each important document, and reminded him and the world the ultimate ideal of the hero. " This seal of Shivaji, son of Shahji, rules for the welfare of the people. This world-worshipped seal is desirous of growing like the new moon into a full moon." This seal can be traced to 1639. Shivaji was merely a boy of 9 years. The ideal was probably put before him by his astute father. 2. Even in 1665, the letter written by Shivaji to Mirza Raja Jaismgh, puts forth his whole programme and ideal in unequivocal terms. (Vol. I, p. 247). 3. His conquest of Southern India as far as Tanjore and covering a large part of the Vijayanagar Empire, took him nearer his ideal. 4. His system of veiled subsidies from the two Muslim Kingdoms of the Deccan, was the recognition of his suzerainty over them. In outward form and in name it may be a gift made by a friendly power to an aggressor to cease from hostility and also to keep away others from aggression. It was really a tribute, and it lias been so called by the Maratha chronicles. 28 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 5. The system of Chauth was a powerful instrument to impose the suzerainty of the Marathas on non-Maratha territories. The successors of Shivaji widely used this instrument of augmenting the empire by bringing in chauth paying protectorates. 6. Shiva followed the subtle policy of exciting the Rajputs against Aurangzeb for becoming independent. In his letter to Jaisingh he pleaded for a union of northein and southern Hindu rulers, for bringing about the overthrow of the Muslim domination. In pursuit of this policy he advised Chhatrasal to return to his country and begin the fight for independence in the heart of the empire. This policy was finally crowned with success, since the Bundhelas dealt severe blows to the empire and dissipated its resources. 7. Shivaji went to seek the blessing of saint Parmanand for the conquest of Rajapur. He offered the saint in gift a village for every fort conquered by him, but the Swami declined to accept the offer and demanded villages in the unconquered provinces of Hyderabad, Berar, Khandesh, Baglan, Malwa and Gujerat. The Maharaja understood the implication of the demand. " All these provinces are now bestowed upon me," said he, " through your blessing these will be annexed by me." A similar offer is said to have been made by Samarth Ramdas. Thus saints encouraged Shivaji in strengthening his imperial idea of conqueiing the whole of India. 1 8. We have H. Gary's evidence that "Shivaji had vowed to his pagod ( Goddess Bhavani ) never to sheath his sword till he had reached Delhi and shut up Aurangshah in it." 8 9. Dr. Fryer too has fortunately recorded the views of Shivaji. ' He tells them, his compeers the Duccanees, he is their champion, and that none of them besides himself has the heart to stand up for their country : and therefore if he chance now and then to rob them, it is but to reward himself and soldiers for his and their pains in endeavouring to free them from a more unnatural slavery."* 1. Wakaskar, 91 Q. Bakhar, p. 131. 2-3. Shivaji, Part III, Pp. 254, 174, THE GRAND REBEL OR LIBERATOR 29 10. The 91 Q. Chronicle informs us that during his conversation -with Tana Shah, Shivaji observed that if the two kingdoms of Golconda and Bijapur assisted him, he would conquer for them the whole of Hindustan. 11. The Chitragupta Chronicle ( P. 131 ) records that Shivaji -expressed regret to his son Sambhaji that only one object of his remained unfulfilled and that was the conquest of Delhi by making Aurangzeb absolutely helpless. However time was to show how for his goddess Amba would favour this design. 12. One more testimony is to be found in Shivaji's letter to Maloji Ghorpade. The latter \\as persuaded lo leave the cause of Bijapur, and join Shivaji and Kutubshah in stamping out foreign rule from the Deccan. *' It is not a good thing that the Pathans came to possess the Fadshahi of the Deccan. If they become powerful, they will destroy the families of the Deccani nobles one after the other. They will not allow any one to live. The Pathans should be destroyed, and steps should be taken to keep the Padshahi of the Deccan in the hands of the Deccanees. After an agreement was accepted by both sides, we also thought that whatever Marathas are of our caste, they should be taken into the confederacy and should be introduced to Kutubshah." 1 13. The last will and testament of Shivaji is significant in showing his ideals and ambitious programmes. He exhorted his officers to put forth all their energy for the extension of the Maratha kingdom to the further most confines of India and for capturing 1 the throne of Delhi; to free the sacred Ganges from the yoke of the Muslims ; to cross the Indus and implant the Maratha flag in the trans- Indus Himalayas. '* It was my intense desire to conquer the whole of India, but I have not fulfilled it on account of my premature death. You should all attempt to realize this high ideal. The kingdom founded by me should be consolidated and extended "with more heroism than I have ever exhibited." 1. Shivaji, Part III, 282. CHAPTER IV Shivaji, Prince of Perfidy 1. A prince of perfidy, a cunning fox, a master of craft, a perfidious thief, a wily and subtle politician are the titles given to* Shiva. He is said to have unscrupulously used all sorts of treachery, duplicity, intrigue, giles and frauds to confound and kill his enemies. Even in April 1660, Shivaji is described by the Dutch asacunning fox who stands ready with all his devilish practices and cunning to buy Siddi Jauhar. The English depict him as one of the most politic princes of those eastern parts. Escaliot describes him as distrustful, secret, subtle, cruel and perfidious. 1 Instead of condemning Shiva we should admire him that his sharp genius was ever ready to discover new methods to humiliate and embarrass his enemies and to win as much by diplomacy as by war. All great conquerors had recourse to intrigue and treachery according to the necessities of the moment. Smith concludes that Akbar telt no* scruples about removing his enemies by assassination. He adds that the tortuous diplomacy and perfidious action which on several occasions marked the emperor's political proceedings, should not excite surprise or draw excessive censure. * Aurangzeb was no less perfidious than Shivaji. He had tracked ' his unfaltering way through a cloud of mysterious intrigues and a sea of blood to the throne. 1 In him were combined the venomous craft of Louis XI with the merciless ferocity of Caesar Borgia*. The Bijapur rulers did not spare clandestine means to do away with their enemies. Napoleon took pride in saying that he knew when to exchange the lion-skin for that of the fox. Though Shiva never shrank from using subtle means to fulfil his ends, it has been proved that he did not practise perfidy in the disposal of the Mores of Javli and Baji Ghorpade of Mudhol. The assassination of Afzal Khan has remained a live issue even up till now. Kincaid, the latest 1. Shivaji, Vol. I, Pp, 212, 390, 480. 2. Akbar the Great Mogul, p. 342. SHIVAJI, PRINCE OF PERFIDY 31 biographer of Shiva, has absolved him from treachery in his recent book ' The Grand Rebel.' I have critically examined the evidence available on the murder ef Afzal Khan to throw more light on the controversy. 2. Statement of the case: The question should have been closed after the most definite views of Sir J. Sarkar expressed in his third edition of Shivaji. Its recent resuscitation requires a re-examination. I take it for granted that the reader is acquainted with the mam story of the death of Afzal Khan. My conclusions on this controversy can be stated in four propositions. (1) Shivaji was justified even in treacherously murdering Afzal Khan, because everything is fair in love and war. (2) In that age treachery was the useful weapon for assassinating one's enemies. We should not judge the men of that age by our standard of morality. If any one is to be blamed, it is the Khan for using treachery. (3) The Khan had taken the pledge to use deceitful means for capturing or murdering Shivaji. Therefore, the latter was justified in paying the Khan in his own coins. (4) Lastly, the Khan was extremely anxious to have the Maratha rebel near him as he was confident that he could over-power him with his superior strength. So he readily consented to the terms proposed by Shivaji. In the long run the latter out-witted his adversary in diplomacy and deceit. Both of them were suspicious of each other and had come prepared to meet the worst. The Khan was the first to attack Shivaji, so that the latter killed the former in self-defence. The Khan's murder was consequently not a premeditated and treacherous act of Shivaji. These propositions will now be explained below. Starting with the -supposition that Shivaji did use treachery in killing Afzal Khan, we see no reason to condemn him. 3. Life and death struggle This war was a life and death struggle for both Shivaji and the Khan. The former had to face a formidable army sent by Bijapur to destroy his infant Swaraj and 32 SHIVAJI THE GREAT to murder him. It was his duty to save himself and his kingdom by all means, as everything is fair in love and war. Secondly, the Khan had been the cause of the murder of Shiva's elder brother; he had led Shahji in fetters to Bijapur ; he was guilty of desecrating the Hindu temples and of the inhuman murder of his numerous wives ; he was the enemy of Maratha Swaraj and was pledged to restore Javli to the surviving scion of the More family; and lastly, he had taken a solemn vow to carry Shivaji alive or dead to Bijapur. Shiva should not be condemned for his success in entrapping such a foe in his clutches and finally assassinating him. Thirdly, he believed himself to be a divine agent tor establishing a Hindu Kingdom in Maharashtra. His success meant the existence and growth of this new Raj. His death entailed its total destruction. Shivaji was trying to bring in a revolution. Evry revolution is fostered by subterranian propaganda, secret massacres and satanic atrocities. Secrecy and treachery are the very soul of a revolution. Shivaji was justified in following ail these methods to bring the revolution to a successful issue. The hands of Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler are dyed red with the blood of thousands of innocent people. Shivaji was mercy itself in comparison to the horrors perpetrated by the Bolshevics in establishing their suppremacy in Russia. Fourthly, it was a war of arms and diplomacy. Shiva was certainly weak in the first, but extremely strong in the latter. He -was a master in the art of dissimulation, and easily confused his foes by this subtle means. Even Rama, Krishna, and Indra are said to have a recourse to treachery in war. Sukra has frankly advised rulers " to inspire confidence in the enemy by sweet smiling face, soft words, confession of guilt, gifts, humiliation, praise, good offices as well as oaths" (IV. VII. 365. ) Chanakya, the Indian Mechiavelli, has taught hundred and one means of secretly murdering enemies. We need not recoil at the use of treachery, . rather admire Shivaji for befooling his foe and ending the war to his immense advantage. His act is justified in the light of history and on the principles of policy. S. 4. SHIVAJI, PRINCE OF PERFIDY 33 4. Treachery- the most common means of murders: Afsal Khan had been guilty of treacherously murdering the Nayak of Sira after he had invited him to a conference ( Shahji, p. 111). Ali Adil Shah was guilty of murdering Bahlol Khan treacherously ( Shivaji Vol. I, p. 95 ) ; he and the queen-mother murdered several ministers by some treacherous means up to 1658. Then Khawas Khan was murdered by Bahlol in 1675 through treachery; Aurangzeb had treacherously put to death his brothers and relatives; even Mirza Raja Jaisingh was ready to use treachery against Shivaji by inviting him for negotiating a marriage of the latter's daughter with his own son. Scores of officers were poisoned by the Mogul Emperors and their Governors. Even the most faithful and veteran general Jai Singh was poisoned by Aurangzeb. We need not quote the well-known examples of treachery committed by the Nizamshahi king to murder Shivaji's grand-father Jadhavrao- in the open Durbar, by Malik Ambar's son in murdering his master, the Nizam Shahi king in revenge for treachery used against him, by Alla-ud-dm Khilji in murdering his uncle and in capturing the ruler of Chittor, or by Sher Shah in capturing Rohitas Fort and in conquering Jodhpur. In such a vicious atmosphere of political morality, it is hard to believe that Afzal Khan intended r.o harm to Shivaji ; that he had come there like an innocent lamb to be murdered by the Maratha wolf. If he was really so stupid and simple as to fall into the trap of Shivaji, so much the worse for him. The Maratha rebel is to be admired all the more for the success of his artful stratagems. It Tvill be the climax of diplomacy, duplicity and machination that lie should have so lulled the enemy into a sense of security as to annihilate him in a moment. Shivaji was convinced that the general was finding out secret means of putting him to death. Therefore he came fully prepared to recoil treachery upon his foe. All preparations were made in self-defence, so that he should not be taken unawares. Hence Khan's death was a preventive and not a pre-meditated and treacherous murder. It should not be forgotten that the suppression of Shivaji was considered to be the most difficult task by the nobles of Bijapur. 34 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Afzal Khan alone came forward to bring Shiva alive or dead to Bijapur. But he was really doubtful of his success. According to Abb6 Carre he shut himself up in his mansion for several days to enjoy the last pleasures of this world. The climax of this round of enjoyments was an incredible tragedy. He was afraid that after his death his wives might be taken up by others. Therefore, he killed 120 ladies of his harem. 1 The Muslim world of those days was not stunned with the demoniac murder of so many innocent ladies. This tragedy is a strange commentary on the unlimited power enjoyed by the nobles of those times. Instead of being* hanged for such a brutal inhumanity, he was honoured by his ruler and given command of the forces sent against Shivaji. It is evident that Afzal Khan came with a determination to conquer or die. He desired to have Shiva in his clutches by diplomatic means. But he was out-witted by his subtle adversary. 5. Evidence of the Khan's treachery (1) The tragedy of Afzal occurred on 10th Nov., 1659. Exactly one month later the English Factor of Rajapur wrote that Afzal Khan was counselled by the Queen to pretend friendship with his enemy ; and (2) that the General did follow this advice. " The other whether through intelligence or suspicion, it's not known, too dissembled his love towards him ", till he lured his troops to the fatal valley of the Koina. (2) The fact of capturing him alive and bringing the captive to the court is borne out by the contemporary Shiva Bharata (17. 13. 37 ). If capture was not possible, he was to kill him in any case. The Shiva Bharata says : " Raja Shivaji has trust in me ; so I shall now meet him under colour of arranging peace, and myself plunging my concealed dagger deep into his heart, shall presently create panic even in the abode of the gods " : thus the Muhammedan planned treachery in his own mind ; how Sbivaji, knowing all that, prepared to visit 1. Basatin-i-SalatiD confirms the story. The number of ladies killed i 64 and their graves are said to exist outside Bijapor ci*y near the Mnsolenm of the Khan. SHIVAJI, PRINCE OF PERFIDY 35 lum with the fruits of his treachery in battle-all that I will tell 1 you: 9 (3) We are told thrice by Sabhasad that Shivaji was to be captured alive ( see pages 10, 15, 16 of Sen's Sh. Chh.) and that he was informed of the secret plans of the Queen and the General by friendly nobles of Bijapur. (4) The firman to Kanhoji Jedhe mentions that Shivaji and his followers are to be exterminated ( Shivaji Souvenir, p. 142 ). Shiva did not remain satisfied with the information received from his friends at Bijapur. He sent his envoy to the Khan's camp at Wai to confirm the truth. He came to know that the Khan was cherishing perfidious designs against him. Therefore he adopted all means to counteract his secret plans and to pay him in his own coin. (5) Doth these facts are fully borne out by an impartial Dutch document. This evidence is so explicit and unequivocal that all later accounts have to be ignored before it. (Shivaji Vol. I, p. 475) . " He commanded thither the noble Lord Abdulchan, his Genera], with an awful army with an express order that he should destroy the above-mentioned Siwasie by the strength of his arms or he should rob him of his life as possible with sweet words and jgreat promises and affirmations of unmingled friendship. This resolution has been plainly communicated to him by a most prominent councellor of the Visiapour Court, warning the above-named Siwasie not to trust in the noble Lord Abdulchan ivho was sent for no other purpose but to ruin him ( lit. to fetch his head )." In this war of diplomacy Shiva outwitted the Khan and successfully despatched him to the other world. This is described as treacherous murder, but it was really a preventive murder or a murder in self-defence. It is permitted by ancient and modern laws and the Hindu books on polity. 6. Khan 1! aeziety to bnre the interview: Shivaji took up the challenge and thought out plans to destroy the Khan and his forces. 36 SHIVAJI THE GREAT The former had taken the central part of Shivaji's kingdom, now he was most anxious to obtain an interview with the rebel so that in a duel he might despatch that short-sized youth to the other world. It seemed to be a fight between a giant and a pigmy. Afzal with his gigantic figure was a hero of a hundred victories. Shivaji was a small and slender young man of 30 years in no way a match for the strong, sturdy and stalwart Khan. The latter was warned by astrologers of his failure, but he rightly paid no heed to their prophecies. During the march to Javli there were ill omens. These too were passed unheeded. His advisers dissuaded him from going to Javli, but he reprimanded them for their pussilanimity. He thought that without fighting any battle he would be the master of the ancient town and castle of Javli, that Shivaji would come into his clutches and be captured or despatched forthwith. Therefore, he accepted whatever terms were demanded by the Maratha leader. Afzal might have been convinced by the diplomatic manoeuvres of Shivaji that the latter was absolutely ready to submit to him and crave pardon for his past deeds. The purpose of the war would be fulfilled by an interview alone. Shivaji was naturally unwilling to go to Wai for being murdered in cold blood and be unable to take revenge for the deed. He was anxious to entrap Afzal and his army in the valley of Javli, so that from the thick and wild forests his wild men should fall, if need be, upon the armed or unarmed Muslim forces and prevent their escape through the impenetrable forests. He succeeded in enticing them into his trap by his superior diplomacy. He cut roads through the thick forests and treated them right royally all along the route. He gave them a sumptuous feast after their arrival on the banks of the river Koina. He pitched up a very beautiful Mandap for the reception of the general. The latter sent a party to reconnoitre the place and to examine the Mandap, and was satisfied that no treachery was designed against him. Thus his suspicions were fully removed and he consented to enter the pavilion with two attendants only, while ten picked body-guards SHIVAJI, PRINCE OF PERFIDY 37 were stationed outside the pavilion. He first advanced with 1,000 or 1,500 men to the place of the meeting, but was told that this was against the stipulations. Therefore, they were left on the slope of Pratapgarh at the distance of a bowshot. According to Chitnis, they were stationed at different places on the way. Thus he had taken precautions for his safety and for an eventual coup on the castle by placing his men near him ready to rush in time of need. 7. The Khan was the first to strike the blow: Having come to know that he was to be either captured or murdered, Shiva took all the precautions to prevent both these acts. He was even justified in attacking his enemy at the first chance. By giving him time he might have been attacked first and thus the whole game would have been lost. But he was not the first to strike the first blow. The Khan with a giant's strength was impatient to end the war by killing the small and slender youth. The Hindu writers are unanimous that Afzal Khan was the first to take the offensive ( Shivaji Vol. I, p. 51 ), while the Muslim historians and their European followers blame Shivaji for the same, but no Muhammedan present at the tragic scene escaped alive. The general impression must have been that Afzal Khan was treacherously killed. That version became popular and therefore was repeated by every traveller and historian afterwards. In our own day we find that Germany was charged with the war-guilt by almost all the nations, but she has persistently protested against the charge. (1) It is said that Afzal Khan did not seem to have taken any precautions to protect his person. He did not wear any steel armour -under his clothes just as Shivaji had done, and that (2) his attendants and generals were not instructed to be ready to take action in the event of treachery. In my opinion, he was over -confident in his success in despatching Shivaji during the interview and in capturing the fort with 1,500 body-guards, so that he did not think it necessary to take any more precautions. His army was 38 SHIVAJI THE GREAT taking rest and amusing itself, so that it was attacked unawares from all sides by the Marathas. Shivaji took all precautions for his defence and for the destruction of the enemy's army. He even received the blessings of the Goddess Bhawani for his success in murdering Afzal Khan,, provided he was perfidiously attacked. The Khan wss proud of his strength. He was fully convinced that he could easily overpower the young man at the interview, that his death or capture would so utterly confuse his leaderless followers that a picked force of 1,500 would suffice to crush the handful of Marathas in the fort. He over-estimated his personal and military strength, and was ignorant of the Maratha forces which lay concealed in the surrounding forests. If Shivaji merely wanted to murder Afzal Khan even at the place of meeting, he could have easily done it through his hidden men. The Chitragupta Ch. says that he kept forty heroes hidden in a subterranean cell in the Mandap. He could have given them a sign to fall upon Afzal and cut him to pieces just before his appearance on the scene. Why should he have at all endangered his own life in an interview wherein the issue was doubtful and the odds were against him ? It is, therefore, evident that he came fully prepared for the worst, but not for treacherously murdering the Khan. J. Kareena records that Afzal tightly caught hold of Shivaji's neck under his arm and struck him with a dagger. Having been thus attacked Shivaji used his tiger-claws and opened his bowels. The same version is found in the Sh. Bharata and Sabhasad Chronicle ( Patwardhan's S. Bk. Pp*. 73, 79 ). The use of the Waghnuck or tiger-claws is extremely doubtful. He used the dagger and the sword. This point has been discussed by me in my book Shabji 1 ( p. 23 ). 1. 91 Qulmi Bakhar, Shiva Bharat. Rairi Bakbar, Fryer, Kfaafi Khan. . Manucci and the English letters mention the use of the dagger and not of the - IVaghnukh. Therefore this weapon wa not held in his hand by Shiraji, SHIVAJI, PRINCE OF PERFIDY 39 In short, Shivaji murdered the Khan in self-defence, but the Muslims represented this as a treacherous murder. They were the rulers of the day. The Maratha leader was known as an arch rebel, a disturber of the peace of the Muslim kingdoms. Hence their version was accepted by the contemporaries. The belief of the people was confirmed by the secret surprise of Shaista Khan and the sudden invasion of Surat. The contemporary European writers describing the incident of Afzal Khan, merely followed the popular version of the ruling classes. Their hearsay opinion is not a biblical truth, and need not be taken seriously by us. CHAPTER V Civil Administration 1. Exttnt of Sbivtji'f Empire: A glance at the map opposite- p. 265 of Vol. II will show that Shivaji's kingdom included the following parts : (A) Swaraj- (1) A long strip of territory on the Western coast of India from the Northern confines of Dharampur or Ramnagar State to the boundary of Bednur with the exception of Bombay, Janjira and the Portuguese possessions. (2) All the inland country including Baglan, part of Nasik, the districts of Thana, Kalyan, Kolaba, Poona, Satara, Gadag^ Chitaldurg, Balapur, Kolar, Uskota, Vellore, Ginji, Arni, Bangalore and Shrirangpatam. (3) On the Eastern or Coromandal Coast his sway extended over Porto Novo, Negapatam, Pondichery, and the territory of Tanjore, while the ruler ot Madura acknowledged his suzerainty by paying tribute. Thus his kingdom bounded by the Tapti in the North extended to Rameshwaram in the South, while from the Arabian Sea to the Bay of Bengal it included the parts named above. (B) Chauth -pay ing territories: He used to collect the chauth from parts of Khandesh, Berars and the Central Provinces. The extent of this territory varied from time to time and the sums collected too depended upon the force used by his expeditionary army. Aurangzeb did not recognise his right of collecting the chauth. Therefore Shivaji gave Qauls 1 to the Mogul subjects who agreed to directly pay this contribution to him. (C) Tribute-paying states Then the states of Bijapur and' Golconda used to pay him a tribute, but these were in no way feudatories of Shivaji or in any way subject to him. The tribute 1. Written assurances of immunity from Maratha attacks, S. 5. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 41 was really a friendly contribution for keeping the Moguls at an arm's length and for securing immunity from the predatory expeditions of the Marathas in these kingdoms. An indefinite and indefinable overlordship extended over all those parts of the Mogul Empire and the Deccan states which paid chauth, or a tribute to Shivaji. 2. Administrative divisions The country was divided into Subhas, Sarkars, Parganas, and Maujas both in the Mogul Empire and the Deccan states. Shivaji replaced this division by Prants, Tarafs and Maujas. But the old nomenclature continued to be used for a long time, hence there is much confusion in identifying territories. We read of Sarkar Koregaon in Piant Wai, Pargatia Karad, 1 Subha Mamale Prabhavah, 2 Subha Dabhol or Mamala Dabhol. 8 There were in 1691 Sarsubhedari of Prant Moglai and Prant Bhaganagar, i. e., of territories captured from the Great Mogul and the Golconda kingdom. 4 Military Circles and Civil Districts According to Justice Ranade the civil territory held under the direct sway of Shivaji, was divided into seventeen districts. He took the list from Chitnis, but it was either wrongly read by him or his copy was defective. (i) He has left off Chandi, Ami, Balapur, Phonda from the said list and added Karnatic as a district. Really it is * Jagdevagad in the Karnatic.' Then follow the names of other districts in the above-mentioned list. (ii) Further, he gives six forts in the territory of Tanjore* Chitnis has these forts in the district of Chandi or Ginji and not under Tanjore. In fact, Chitnis does not give the number of forts under Tanjore and Ami. Only Chitragupta has named thirty-two forts in the Prants of Vellore, Chandi and Tanjore. Thus the Prants mentioned by Chitnis and Chitragupta are with respect to the forts and not to the civil administration. In fact, the whole Konkan was divided into several civil districts. At 14. Raj.

Pp. 320-323. 42 SHIVAJI THE GREAT least twelve Prants are mentioned in another list, but in Chitnis- * list Konkan is mentioned as one Prant. The names of seventeen Military Circles with the number of forts under each are reproduced by us from Chitnis in the section en forts. 3. Civil Divisions: The Mogul Emperor Farrukhseer granted the right of collecting chauth to Shahu. The extent of the country under him was mentioned in a list ' which was made according to the ancient rules as it was handed down from former times/ 2 Therefore, we can take this to be the extent of Shivaji's empire. It appears that the Suba and Prant were interchangeable words. In Doc. 81 the names of eight * Subas ' are given. 5 Further on these are called Prants in this very document. In the list of hereditary estates of Ramchandra Pant Amatya, 4 we read of Sarkars Junner, Sangamner and Parande, but Poona, Panhala* Satara, Kadewalit, Miraj, etc., are mentioned as prants in this list. Therefore the civil districts of the time of Shivaji may be said to be the following : Civil Districts No. of Tarafs or Talukas.* Doc. 78 of Raj. VIII. Zabta Swaraj 1. Poona and Wai 12 Tarafs 10 2.

Zabta Swaraj Not given - do - 5 20 20 Not given 18 18 5 15 No. of Tarafs is not given. Baramati and Indapur are named as Prants in the Zabtar but they are counted as Tarafs under Poona in the first list. Secondly, this list has Mahad in place of Betgiri in the Zabta. It is said in the 78th Doc. that there were six more Prants, but their names are not mentioned. Mi raj, Kadewalit, Hukeri ( poc. 81 ) might be three of these in Maharashtra. Besides these thirty-five districts, there were provinces of the Karnatic and Southern India included in the Swaraj. This new conquest was divided into six military circles, but the number of civil districts is not known. It will be seen that Chitnis includes in the Military Circle of Thana such districts as Kalyan, Bhiyandi, Wai, Karad* Supe, 44 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Khatav, Baramati, Miraj, Kolhapur, and three sub-districts. It is now evident that the names of ' Prants ' mentioned by Chitnis were certainly not those of administrative districts. In my opinion* for military purposes the Swaraj was at one time divided into seventeen circles. The civil districts were surely different from these circles, though the word Prant has been loosely used for both*, Each Prant was divided into Tarafs and each Taraf into Mahals and these into villages called Maujas and Kasbas. Sometimes a Prant had Subas and then Tarafs, as Suba Dabhol under Talkonkan. 4. Civil officers The kingdom was divided into divisions, ach under a Sarsubedar. He was also styled Sarkarkun or Mukhya Deshadhikari. We read of Narhari Anandrao as Sarsubedar in the Konkan, probably with his capital at Kudal. 1 Moropant, Annaji Datto and Dattaji Anant are frequently mentioned as Sarkarkuns or Sarsubedars in the time of Shivaji. Each Prant was put under a Subedar and a Karkun, while the Taraf was governed by a Havaldar. A few villages were put under the charge of a Kamavisdar. The nomenclature prevalent in Muslim governments for civil officers was continued in the Swaraj. There were regular establishments or offices for the work of the officers. Each Subedar had generally eight assistants in charge of various duties. They were Dewan, Muzumdar, Fadnis, Sabnis, Karkhanis, Chitnis, Jamadar and Potnis. 8 We learn from Dr. Fryer who had an interview with the Subedar of Kalyan that in his office many Brahmans were busy in writing account books and there were present some officers who were consulted by him as members of his Privy Council. On account of the authority of such a council, a governor could not be Very oppressive* 1. Raj. VIII, p. 22. 2. Sen, Ad, $. It, p. 97. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 45 The administrative division? can now he represented thus : Division Sarsubedar Suba Subedar Pargana Sarhavaldar and Vatandars Taraf, Hawal Tarafdar, Hawaldar or ' or Mahal Mahaldar Union of villages Kamavisdar Mauza and Kasaba Patil Peth Sethe Mahajan A Subedar was named Deshadhikari and a Sarsubedar, Mukhya-Deshadhikari, while the Karkun was called Lekhak and the Sarkarkun, Mukhya-Lekhak. The Sanskrit names Introduced by Shivaji did not become popular. Through the force of custom old names continued to be used even in official documents. 5. Dr. Fryer on Maratha Administration: A gloomy picture of the administration of Muslim and Maratha countries depicted by Dr. Fryer should be read on p. 145 of Vol. II. His experience was very much limited and he was bitterly prejudiced against the Grand Rebel. One can hardly believe that the Brahman officers tore the flesh of their brother officers with red-hot pincers and applied other tortures to extract money from them. It is possible that some officers guilty of corruption -extortion might have been tottured to extract confession. Otherwise Shivaji did not oppress Brahmans. These were under his special protection, (i) He was therefore given the title of the " Protector of Cows and Brahmans. (ii) He was adored as an Avatar of Vishnu who had taken birth for uprooting the barbpfian^ and for establishing the Hindu religion* (iii) He never mokfted Brahmans even in his looting expeditions. (iv) At the time of Afzal Khan's murder when Shivaji was attacked l>y the Brahmin envoy, he refused to U%B his weapons against him 46 SHIVAJI THE GREAT and asked him not to take advantage of his position as a Brahman*. (v) Docs. 24 of 1671 and 30 of 1674 in Rajwade VIII bring out the- principle of immunity of Brahmans from death. ' Fryer himself admits that Brahmans alone were put in places of trust and authority. 9 The whole hierarchy of civil officers was composed of Brahmans. Hence it is incredible that these very men would use inhuman means of torture against men of their own class. While Fryer condemns the Maratha administration, he frankly admits that it was not an exception to the general rule. All contemporary governments were of the saine type. " This is the accustomed Sawce all India over, the Princes doing the same by the Governors, when removed from their offices, to squeeze their ill-got Estates out of them ; which when they have done ; it may be they may be employed again ; the Great Fish prey, on the Little, as well by land as by Sea, bringing not only them, but their Families into Eternal Bondage." 3 The Dutch have given a glimpse of the oppressive administration* prevalent in the Bijapur state. "Each Governor takes the appearance- of being a king, and after having committed divers crimes by robbing, murdering, burning and devastating the land to their hearts' content, they appear at court, where they are praised for being brave soldiers, if they know how to oil His Majesty's palm. This- practice is daily increasing more and more and has taken so very deep a root that the king ( who is simply adorned with the crown ) is unable to prevent this/ 14 On another occasion the Dutch factors reported that the government of this country was so unsettled and tyrannous that it was impossible to commit it to paper, Tavernier, Bernier, Manucci and other travellers have condemned the Mogul administration in unambiguous terms. But the standard of Shivaji's administration must have been much. 1. Raj. VIII, pp. 20,26. 2. Shivaji, Vol. II, p. 145. 34, Sbiraji, Vol. I, pp.,509, 554, Vol. II, p. 146. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 47 superior to other governments on account of the important reforms introduced by him. 6. Administrative reforms of Sbi?aji 1. Hereditary posts as exceptions Shivaji attacked the radical cause of maladministration by not conferring hereditary jagirs and posts. Yet he was considerate in not discontinuing the Watans of the Deshmukhs, Deshpandes, Kulkarnis, etc., or in abolishing religious endowments existent from his predecessors. He reduced the powers of the fief-holders. In a few cases he was compelled to confer hereditary grants and posts on account of the very meritorious services performed by a few officers. (l) Krishnaji Bhaskar was awarded a jagir for his meritorious service in the murder of Afzal Khan. (2) Babaji Baji was conferred jagir and the commandantship of all the forts held by his gallant father Baji Prabhu, the Leonidas of India, in lieu of the glorious service of his immortal father. 9 (3) The four Kolis who chose the place for building the Sindhudurg at Malwan were given hereditary grants of villages for their signal service in 1664. 3 (4) Ramchandra Pant, the conqueror of Fort Purandar from the Moguls, was given hereditary Sabnisi of the famous Sindhudurg Fort. (5) Balaji Avaji, his personal secretary, was granted hereditary secretaryship. (6) Koyaji Bandhal was granted lands for his brave exploit in "Shaista's surprise. 4 (7) His brother Vyankoji and his sister-in-law Dipabai were granted hereditary jagirs and so was their Minister and Shivaji's Viceroy Raghunathpant favoured with Inams in the Karnatic. 5 (8) Villages were granted in Inam to the Brahmans attached to the famous temples of the holy places of the Karnatic.* (9) Hambirrao Mohite, Santaji Ghorpade, Bahirji Ghorpade were- granted jagirs. 9 (10) The Ramdasi Maths of Chafal and Paili were granted villages for their expenses. Some of these continue up to this day. In a grant of 1677 there is a mention of eleven ^villages, 121 candies cereals, and 1100 pagodas having been given to the Chafal Math. 1. Shiyaji, Vol. II, p. 288; Yak. 146. 4. No. 63 Q, of B. I. S. M. 2. Yak. 80. 3. Shivaji, Vol. II, 289. 3. Chitragupta Cb. P. 132. t 6 & 7. Yak. 153. 130, 48 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Such instances are few and far between. In the long period of 35 years from 1646 to 1680, Shivaji selected only a few persons for Inams out of the thousands of brave commanders and famous statesmen. This fact decidedly proves that these were exceptions to the general rule. In fact, we do not find the great men of this period founding families with hereditary lands. Netaji Palkar, Prataprao Gujar, Hambirao Mohite, Moro Pant Pingle, Dattaji Pant, Annaji Datto and host of other officers may be quoted as such instances. No new Inams Ramchandra Pant proceeds to argue against the grant of new Inams. " Hereditary estates should not be granted as this method leads to a great injustice. Only an enemy of his kingdom should be generous in granting Inams. This method would result one day in granting away the whole kingdom. All the evils pointed out above in the case of Vrittis invariably occur here. Therefore a king should not at all get infatuated and grant land to the extent of even a barley corn." One of his ablest ministers has thus described the evils of granting new pensions, Vrittis, and Inams, but at the same time he has prohibited kings from confiscating the ancient grants. In his opinion it is a great sin to confiscate any Vritti, hence it should neither he handed over to another nor be appropriated by the king himself. Even when a heinous crime is committed by the holder of a Vritti, his case should be decided according to the dictates of the Shastras. The main reasons advanced by him for not granting Vrittis may be said to be these : (a) Public revenue is reduced by such grants. It leads to the loss of the prosperity and therefore to the decay of the kingdom. (b) Such grants result in the increase of taxes which oppress the people. " To cause affliction to a large number of people for the sake of one carries its own curse." (2) Selection of officers The devotion of officers to Shivaji was simply remarkable, although they were not given hereditary S. 6. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 49 and Jagirs. It was his personal charm, ever-smiling face, amiable manners, generosity, bravery, genius, resourcefulness, and humour which turned his foes into friends and devoted servants ever ready to lay down their lives for their master. The illustrious names of Moropant, Balaji Avji, Ramchandra Pant, Baji Prabhu, Murar Baji, Prataprao Gujar, Tanaji Malsure, Frangoji Narsala and a host of others can be written in letters of gold in the Maratha history. The main cause of this devotion may be said to be the recruitment and dismissal of officers by Shivaji himself. They were directly responsible to him. The feudal system had been abolished, and the central government had been strengthened by all possible means. Every officer was anxious to please the Raja by his devoted service. It is remarkable that even soldiers in the standing army were appointed with his approval. He had the genius to find out the true merits of his men and to give them sufficient scope to show their talents. He imposed full confidence in them, and they invariably proved faithful to him. Aurangzeb lived in an atmosphere of mistrust, suspicion, intrigue and faction. He sent on every expedition two commanders who generally envied and mistrusted each other. They were often faithless, venal and rapacious. Shivaji took full advantage of this weakness. He bombarded these officers with gold bullets. Jaswant Singh, Prince Muazzam and Bahadur Khan have been mentioned several times in this respect. The Bijapur generals were no better. Rustam Zaman and Siddi Jauhar are well-known examples. The commandants of several forts were bribed to give up the same to Shivaji. Not a single instance is recorded of a Maratha officer who gave up a fort to the enemy for the sake of money. On the other hand, Shivaji's officers were devoutly attached to him. (3) The third reform was the frequent transfer of officers from place to place, so that they should not create vested interests there, and the people should not suffer from tbeir autocracy. SmvAji THE GREAT (4) The fourth means to improve the administration uurir freiinent inspection -tours. He himself and his ministers often used to go on tours of inspection. The necessity for such tours has- been briefly stated by the Raja himself. " No kingdom can be preserved long without constant touring and attention. For watching over the peasantry, strengthening the forts, and putting down oppressors it is necessary ( for the ruler ) to tour in his kingdom.' We read of Abaji Pant having gone on a tour of inspection before the death of Shivaji. Abaji Pant and Annaji Datto were, on another Occasion, appointed to inspect the forts. (5) The fifth means to systematize the government was the drawing up of an elaborate code of rules by Shivaji's order. The Tarikh-i-Shivaji records that 4 after he had satisfied himself about the regulation of the revenue and the administration, he called for the records of all the lands in his possession and inspected them.'* (6) The sixth reform may be said to be the removal of differences among officers and nobles by uniting their families by marital ties. For instance, Moro Pant Peshwa's daughter was given to Prahlad Pant, son of Niraji Pant ( Vak. 131 ). His own marriages with ladies belonging to distinguished Maratha nobles were for political reasons. The marriage of Rajaram with the daughters of the two commanders- in-chief shows the same policy. (7) The seventh cause of the good adminstriation is the employment of all classes in the service of the state. The educated classes of the time consisting of the Brahmans, Prabhus, Saraswats were entrusted with the civil and military administration by the Raja. The illiterate people of all castes and perferably the Marathas, were recruited as soldiers. Thus the masses and classes of Maharashtra were filled with his ideals and enthusiasm to promote and perpetuate the stability and prosperity of the swaraj. (8) The eighth cause of improved administration was Shiva's exemplary life. He did not allow any officer, companion or favourite of his to oppress the ryots. 3 There was no ciircle of 13. Vak. Pp., 130. 131, 151. 153. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 51 sycophants surrounding Shivaji. He never wasted his time in idle gossips, hunting, racing, drinking, luxury, profligacy. He lived a life of rigorous discipline, exemplary simplicity, and high ideals. He devoted all his time, energy and resources to the protection and prosperity of his kingdom. (9) Shivaji recognized that the essential requisites of efficient government were the spirit of responsibility and the feeling of security of tenure. Consequently he devised means to vouchsafe these by the adoption of council government and the continuation of the services of efficient officers. (10) Lastly, Shivaji put a stop to corruption among officers by giving them high salaries. 7. Growth of the Execotiie Council Shivaji was put under the guardianship of D. Konddeva and given four experienced administrators who formed his advisory council from 1642. These were Sham Rao Nilkanth as Peshwa, Balkrishna Pant Hanmanteas Mujumdar, Sono Pant as Dabir and Raghunath Ballal as Sabnis* They were confirmed in their posts even after the death of Konddeva in 1649. In that very year Shiva created the post of the Sarnobat or commander of the army. It was filled by Tukoji Chor ^Maratha. Some time after the latter was replaced by Mankoji Dahatonde. After the conquest of Javli in 1655, four new posts were created and filled up as follows : Nilo Sondeva was appointed Surnis; Gangaji Mangaji, Vaknis; Prabhakar Dhat, Upadhyaya ; and Yesaji Kank, commander of the infantry. Dahatonde was replaced by Netaji Palkar as commander-in-chief. The year of his appointment cannot be traced with certainty. The title of Panditrao was conferred upon Raghunath Pao 1 Korde who was sent as an envoy to Raja Jaisingh for negotiating 1. Sen. Sb. Chh. 51. On p. 59 he is called Korde and brother-io-Uw of Soiaji Pant Dabir. 52 SHIVAJI THE GREAT peace in 1665 and was afterwards deputed to Aurangzeb himself.. Raghunath was included among the councillors called together by Shiva to consider the crisis during bis imprisonment at Agra, and he was sent to Jafar Khan, the Mogul Premier. 1 On his return from Agra he was made chief superintendent of public works and another R. Balal Atre was made a Subha of cavalry. 9 Narahari Anandrao was appointed Peshwa in 1661. He was succeeded by Mahadeva Matimant in 1662 and in that year Moro Trimal or Trimbak was appointed. He continued in the post till the death of Shivaji. \Ve have documents with the seals of Samaraj and Mahadeva, but none of Narahari has as yet been recovered. 3 It is rather strange that there are four grants of the years 1671 and 1673 bearing the seal of Mahadeva Matimant Pradhan. 4 There is one letter of 1662 June and another of 1668 Oct. bearing the same seal. In 166S Nilopant Sondeva was appointed Mujumdar in place of Hanmante, and Annaji Pant as Surnis.* At that time the new office of chief justice was created and it was filled by Niraji Pant who is described as an intelligent Nizamshahi Brahman. He accompanied Shiva to Agra and was one of the four heroes who formed the small party of the Raja during his long flight from Agra to Rajgad. After the death of Gangaji Vaknis, the post was filled bjr Dattaji Pant, another hero of the romantic flight. He was reckoned as one of the councillors. The royal household troops were put under the able command of Ragho* Mitra, the third hero of the thrilling escape. Nilo Sondev was succeeded in his office in 1672 by his two 1. Sen, Sh. Chh.

CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 53 sons Naro Pant and Ramchandra Pant, but the latter alone who was considered to be a thousand times better than his father, was entrusted with the work of Muzumdar. ' Sometime before the coronation the post of Dharmadhikari Avas also created. It was filled by the two brothers Raghunath Bhat and Balam Bhat.' The number of the councillors was augmented after the coronation by the addition of the two ministers of Vyankoji Raje. They were Raghunath Narayan and Janardhan Narayan. There is no information as to the offices filled by them. They might be- ministers without portfolios, <J as they have been called Sarkarkuns. Shivaji changed their Persian titles to Sanskrit and specified the duties of the eight councillors and other departmental heads. Thus a portfolio system was introduced on the basis of the Sukraniti. The names and duties were largely adopted from Sukra's Polity. In the king's cabinet the Chief Priest and the Chief Justice are included by Sukra and the same was done by the crowned king of the Marathas. These Sanskrit names, however, did not become popular, so that even in the official letters written after the coronation the old names and the old Persian era persisted. The Chronicles make special mention of the council meetings at such crises as the invasions of Afzal Khan, Shaista Khan and Jaisingh, and during Shiva's imprisonment at Agra. Therefore the council did not come into existence after the coronation. Shivaji used to consult his ministers from the beginning of his rule. 4 It has been seen that the executive council had been growing up from time to time with the extension of administrative needs* 1.

Then the post of Dabir or Sumant was held by Janardan Hanmante according to Chitnis, while Chitragupta gives the name of Trimbak Sondeva. It is a pity that the name of the Dabir is not given by Oxinden, and hence the difference in the names given by the three Bakhars for the holders of this post, cannot be removed. 8. Duties of the Mimters: Their duties specified by the Law Code ( Qanunzabta ) and Chitnis have been summarized below* The Peshwa was in charge of the whole administration of the kingdom. He was to work with the counsel and co-operation of his colleagues. In times of war he was to bravely lead the army, subjugate new kingdoms and make necessary arrangements for the administration of the newly-acquired territories. All state papers and charters had to bear his seal below that of the king. 1. Sen, Sh. Chh. P. 116; Chitnis, 311, 331; Chitrag. Chronicle. 109. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 55 The Senapati (Commander-in-Chief) should properly maintain the army, make war and lead expeditions. He should preserve the newly-acquired territories, render an account of the sports, report to the king the requirements and grievances of the army, and obtain lands and rewards for the meritorious. The Amatya ( Finance Minister ) should look after the income -and expenditure of the whole kingdom and submit it to the Raja after auditing it. He should put his seal on all official letters and on the accounts of income and expenditure of the Mahals and the whole kingdom. The Sachiv ( Accountant General ) should see that all royal letters were properly drafted. He had to check trie accounts of the Mahals and Parganas. He had to put his seal on all royal papers -as a sign of his approval. lie was also to serve in war and lead armies. The KJantn ( Political Secretary ) was to conduct the political and diplomatic affairs of the kingdom. The invitation and intelligence departments were under him. He was also to serve in war. His seal was to be put on official documents. The Sunuint ( Foreign Secretary) was in charge of foreign affairs, war and peace. He was to receive and entertain foreign envoys and maintain the dignity of the state abroad. He was also to serve in war and put his seal on state documents. The Panditrao ( the Koyal Priest ) was to have jurisdiction over all religious affairs. He was to honour scholars, Brahmans aad religious men. He was to get all religious ceremonies performed in due time. He was to put his sign of approval on all papers relating to custom, conduct and penances. The Nyayadhtsh ( the Chief Justice ) was to righteously decide all disputes about occupations and lands with the co-operation of officers and learned Brahmans. He was to put his signature on alt* judgment papers. f. FriBciple* M&rljrinf vmstcritl rmnnMt It is worth ntotftdog that all ministers were .Brahmans, only the Chief 56 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Commander was Maratha by caste. But all of them except the last two had to take the command of armies. Besides three of the ministers were Governors in charge of divisions, while the provinces or Subas were under Subedars. These ministers fully enjoyed the confidence of their master and were continued in their posts up to the end of his regime. It speaks volumes of the genius, patience, spirit of compromise of Shivaji that he should have continued the same officers on the same posts for years together. In case of proved inability, he removed the ministers as the Peshwa Mahadeva and the commander-in-chief Netaji Palkar, otherwise Moro Trimbak continued Peshwa for eighteen years up to the death of the great king. No change was made in the chief command of the army except on account of death. There was no re-shuffling of the cabinet from the coronation up to the death of the illustrious king. Secondly, he did not make these offices hereditary as they were done afterwards by the Peshwas. Thirdly, these officers were not given any jagirs, but salaries were paid to them in cash from the treasury. They had nothing to do with revenue collection and could not oppripss the ryots on account of their ministerial positions. Justice Rsbade has rightly stated that " none of the great men, who distinguished themselves in Shivaji's time, were able to hand over to their descendants iarge landed estates. 1 ' Fourthly, each of them was severally responsible for his portfolio, so far so that his secretary had the right to carry on the administration in the name of the chief. Fifthly, they were jointly responsible in carrying on the administration. All important parsers required the signatures of the ministers in charge of the civil administration, such as the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister, the Financial Secretary, the Home Secretary and the Foreign Minister. The judicial decisions -were signed by the Chief Justice alone and the Ecclesiastical S. 7. CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 57 Decisions by the Minister in charge of the department, while th* army-papers were submitted to the chief commander. The Law Code ( Qanunzfibta ) and the Chitragupta Chronicle both lay down this rule of the circulation of important papers and the approval or disapproval of the five ministers. We have no papers on the working of the cabinet, but the ministers and in their absence the secretaries must have been meeting frequently to discuss important matters, so that they could put their seals of approval on them* That the treaty with the English was signed by all the ministers,, has been recorded by their envoy, Mr. Oxenden. Grants bore the seals of the Raja and the Prime Minister. 10. The salaries of the Ministers: Chitnis ( Pp. 342*43 ) has given the following scale of salaries to the various officers. Prime Minister 15,000 Hons. Amatya 12,000 Every other minister 10,000 Balaji Avji Chitnis 6,000 Cfaimnaji Avji Phadnis 3,000 Officers in charge of 18 Karkhanas and 12 Mahals 500 to 100 Hons. Military Commander 5000 to 4000 Subordinate Officers 200 to 15 The salaries of the ministers and the personal secretaries were very high. Fifty thousand to 75,000 rupees were paid to the cabinet ministers. Taking into account the value of money in those days, these salaries when expressed in to-day's rupee, seem to be excessively high. Thus peculation and corruption were cut at the jroots. 11. The personal staff tf the kief The private secretary of Shivaji was the famous Balaji Avji or Bal Prabhu Chitnis and he was assisted by his brother Chimnaji Avji Phadnis a*d Nil Prabhu Parasnis. He used to submit all state papers to the Maharaja, was in charge of the private and personal correspondence of his royal master, and used to note down the hypnotic messages uttered 58 SHIVAJI THE GREAT by Shivaji during his ecstatic moods. All letters conferring any kind of Inara or Qauls to villages, towns, provinces, and new markets ; correspondence regarding jagirs and political intelligence, all passports, visas, and permits for opening Kothis ; all orders regulating the prices of things, and many other spheres of administration were in his charge. He was also to supervise the working of the mint and of the department to supply royal drinks. 9 His services proved to be so meritorious that Shivaji was pleased to confer the posts of the Chitnis, Karkhanis and Jamnis on him and his successors. It was the only exception of a hereditary post made by the Raja. High posts were conferred on the sons of the ministers but only when they showed exceptional intelligence and merit for the same. Prahlad Niraji, son of the Chief Justice Niraji was appointed ambassador at the court of Qutub Shah. Nilo ( Naro ) Pandit, son of Moropant Peshwa, enjoyed the confidence of the Raja as is evident from Oxenden's letters. 12. Minor Departments A few public departments like the mint, treasury, P. W. D., artillery, ammunition, elephant corps, camel corps were each under a hierarchy of officers. There were other departments serving the personal needs of the royal household. The Sabhasad, Chitnis and Chitragupta chronicles* give the names of eighteen Karkhanas and twelve Mahals. There are minor differences in the names of these in the Marathi chronicles. But the list given by Sabhasad may be taken to be typical. The names of the Karkhanas are : treasury, jewel-store, granary, medicines, artillery, record department, wardrobe, armoury, kitchen, camel -corps, music house, gymnasium, elephant stables, carpets and other accessories, drinks, hunting, ammunition-magazine, and conservancy. Then follow twelve Mahals: treasury, purchase of merchandise, palanquins, warehouse, P. W. D., chariots, horse-stables, provision of comforts, the harem, cow-sheds, mint* ^od guards. 1. Sea. M.S.M. 64-71. 2. Sabbasad-San, Sh, Chh. 133. CfcttaiB, pp. 170-71. Ctfeftu, p.120, CIVIL ADMINISTRATION 55} The Hindu kings possessed thes (e institutions from very earty times. Kautilya has given detailed information on the nature and scope of many of these departments. The names and duties changed with circumstances, but the fundamental institutions remained alive through ages, till they were adopted by Muslim kings. The Ain-i-Akbari supplies information about the departments possessed by Akbar, the Great Mogul. The detailed list of articles which were found in store at the time of the death of Shivaji, brings out the real significance of the existence of such departments. It is worth noticing that Shivaji had departments to look after the manufacture of guns, cannon, gunpowder, and various kinds of arms, weapons, cloths and carpets. There were separate departments for managing the affairs of cows, horses, camels, and elephants. For physical culture and recreation gymnasium and hunting arrangements were provided. The household needs were looked after by the departments of Zanana, kitchen, drinks, medicines* wardrobe, granary, carpet-making, provision of comforts, warehouse, chariots, palanquins, guards, etc. Each one of these departments was managed by its officers under the supervision of one of the Councillors. Thus Shivaji had not to directly manage any department. He was free to control the policy, to appoint officers and to test the working efficiency of the departments. Finally, we should examine the nature and powers of Shivaji's Council of Eight. 13. Comparison ef the Astia PraAait to tk EiecrirtCodt> The assertion of the late Justice Ranade that Shivaji's council resembled the Executive Council of the Governor General of India, is cot based on facts. There is no real resemblance between the two councils. (1) The Councillors are appointed by the King-Emperor and are irremovable by the Governor General. . Shivaji was free to choose and remove his ministers according to hie sweet will* <2) All important questions are decided by a majority of votes, tb* 60 SHWJI THE GREAT Governor General enjoys a casting vote. He can veto the decision of his Council, but is required by law to put down id writing his reasons for rejecting the decision of the majority. Similarly, every Councillor has got the right* to note his reasons for the advice given by him. All the papers are sent to the Secretary of State for India. For all these reasons the Governors General have very rarely used their vetoing power. The Government of India is a council-government in name and deed, but Shivaji was an autocratic king with no restrictions upon his powers by his ministers. (3) These Councillors are not required to take command of armies, nor do they work as governors of provinces and councillors at .the same .time. (4) There is no question of caste and creed among the Viceroy's Councillors. Shivaji's cabinet consisting of seven Brahmans and oue Maratha Commander-in- -Chief, signified the supremacy of Brahmans. Thus there are radical differences between the two Councils. Yet it must be noted that in the presidential form of government prevalent in the U. S. A., the ministers work as secretaries of the head of the state. Being appointed tad dismissed by him at hie discretion, they are not his colleagues but his subordinates. However, a sense of responsibility is maintained among them by having their signatures on important papers. This practice adopted by Shivaji acted as a check upon his autocratic powers and infused a sense of responsibility in the ministers. The people too respected them as the colleagues of the Raja, because no important orders could be issued without the signature of the minister in charge and even of a few other ministers. The principles of collective and individual responsibility of ministers to the ruler were partially* recognized by the system adopted by Shivaji. CHAPTER VI The Military System I. Evils of the Moilim Military tyiten The administrative reforms secured peace, prosperity, and progress in the Maratha Swaraj. These could be maintained only by a most efficient military organization. The feudal armies of the Deccan Sultans and the Mogul Emperors were expensive and inefficient instruments of warfare. In these volumes we have sufficient side-lights on the evils of the contemporary military systems. (i) The feudal lords were given extensive territories for the upkeep of the armies. Being anxious to enrich themselves in the shortest possible time, they resorted to unbridled terror, oppression and exploitation. The ryots were left to their minions who like vultures ate away the possessions of the poor. (ii) The nobles were often disloyal to the ruler and secretly allied themselves with his enemies. The instances of Rustam Zaman, Bahlol Khan, Bahadur Khan and others joining Shivaji are frequently found. (iii) These lords were mutually fighting and even secretly murdering each other. The assassination of Jadhavrao, Khawas Khan, Murari Pandit* Siddi Jauhar, Ikhlas Khan, Sher Khan, and another Khawas Khan. Khizar Khan, are some of the instances mentioned in the volumes. . (iv) The feudal armies did not consist of properly trained and equipped soldiers, but these were levies of haphazardly recruited soldiers, with .whatever arms and horses were possessed by them, Such a militia poorly clad, ill armed, badly trained, and full of mercenary spirit did not fight for the defence of the flag, religion or country. These soldiers could be no match to a trained army figbtinff for religious and national ideals. (v) *fhe feudal armies were officered by untrained men who were not actuated by bigfaer motives. They wanted to saire their SHIVAji THE GREAT skins. Bernier ' rightly observed that the Mogul Omrahs were mostly adventurers from different nations, and persons of low descent, some having been originally slaves. The king was surrounded by slaves, ignorant and brutal; parasites raised from the dregs of society ; strangers to loyalty and patriotism ; full of insufferable pride, and de$titute of courage, of honour and of decency. Hence these could be easily bought off or defeated by the national armies of Shivaji. ( vi ) Dependence upon cavalry and elephants was the mainstay of the system. Both these arms were useless in the rugged and mountainous regions of Maharashtra. ( vii ) The extension of the Jagir system and its concomitant evil of defrauding the state in the strength of the militia to be kept by each mansabdar, adversely affected the efficiency of the army. ( viii ) An immense amount of money was needed for an incredibly large army which was maintained for keeping the people m subjection. Then an enormous sum was required to maintain the splendour of the royal court. The people were subjected to an indescribable oppression. In the words of Bernier " in the Indies the gold and silver disappear in consequence of the tyranny of Timariots, Governors, and Revenue contractors a tyranny which even the monarch, if so disposed, has no means of controlling in provinces not contiguous to his capital a tyranny often so excessive as to deprive the peasant and artisan of the necessaries of life, and leave them to die of misery and exhaustion * a tyranny owing to which those wretched people either have not children at all, or 'have them only to endure the agonies of starvation, and to die at a tender age-a tyranny, in fine, that drives the cultivator of the soil from his wretched home to some neighbouring state." ' ( ix ) The Mogul camps were slowly moving cities with afr the encumbrances of women, children, beasts of burden, and a .numerous host ol servants to look to the comforts of the men oC afl ranks from the officers down to the * ordinary trooper. Vivid 1-3. Itartlt in the Mogul Empire, pp. *i2,' 226, 230. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 63 descriptions of the march of the armies are given by Tavernier, Bernier, Manucci, and others. An interesting account of the march of Shaista Khan's army and its plight by the guerilla tactics of the Maratha army * bring out the weakness of the Mogul and the strength of the Maratha army. Small kingdoms could be easily conquered by sheer numbers and inexhaustible resources of the Mogul empire. Shivaji had the extraordinary genius to realize the ills of the Muslim armies and to take full advantage of these by his novel and effective military organization. The founder of the Maratha Empire fully realized the serious defects of the feudal levies and therefore he overhauled the whole military machine. His army consisted of the royal guards, cavalry, infantry, militia, elephant corps and camel corps. The forts formed a most crucial factor of the strength of the military machine. Lastly, the navy and merchant marine were added to the land forces. Each one of these will be separately taken up to give a detailed view of the working and of the reforms introduced by Shivaji, the great military genius of the time. 2, Royal Bodyguards Shivaji soon realized the importance of possessing special troops to protect his hody and to be of prime support to him in times of emergency. For this purpose only those who were brave, strong, obedient and faithful were personally selected by him. While inspecting the country, the army or the forts, he was on the lookout for such men that their very name would inspire terror and admiration in the army and the people. These tried men were to be employed for the protection of the Raja's person and as guards at the gates of the royal residence and court They formed a fourfold force of musketeers, spearmen, light-armed men, and artillery men in both the cavalry and infantry. 9 The vital importance of this force is pointed out by Ramachandra. in his Polity. Very strict discipline was to be kept among these troops. No weakness was to be shown in punishing indiscipline and treachery in them oat of any consideration. 1. Shtaji,PartH,77-*0. 2, Sen, Sh, Cbb. 76-77; Ramacbacdra, Polity, Pp. 20-22, 4 SHIVAJI THE GREAT There were six different units of these Patak$ ( Body-guards ) -consisting of 100, 60 A and 60 B, 40, 30, and 20 soldiers acd known by these numbers. The special force consisted of two thousand to two thousand and five hundred men. They were given by the government uniforms consisting of embroidered turbans for the head, jackets of broadcloth for the body, two gold bracelets for the hands, gold and silver rings to be put on their sword-sheaths, silver-rings for the guns and spears, and a pair of ear-rings for themselves. These were put under the charge of Jumledars and a Kazan officer. Whenever the Raja went out, they used to march on four sides of his palanquin or horse. We have a view of these troops in the picture given by Manucci. 1 The Raja is shown on the march. His personal troops are clothed in a uniform of long togas stuffed with cotton. Each one of them has got a Tilak on the forehead probably to signify his readiness to die for the king. The extraordinary alertness and bravery of one of his bodyguards was shown in cutting off the hand and head of the assassin at Surat when he made a dastardly attack on the Raja. Another view of the march of the army is given by the Rajapur Knglishmen when they waited to meet Shivaji on the way. They saw abundance of horse and foot and 150 palanquins carrying him and his officers. It is a pity that the English factors were so much engrossed in their immediate business that they did not at all Describe the Maratha army. 1 A Dutch factor who had the honour of several times speaking with the Golconda Sultan, was an eye-witness of the visit of Shivaji to that city in August 1676. The Raja is said to retire in z. litter embellished on every side with sheets of massive gold rtccompained by eight outriders and 30 chaise-bearers. This Dutchman records that Shivaji had no doubt of the fidelity of his troops and especially of his bodyguards. He testifies to the discipline in the Maratha army in these words : " Whilst they 1-2. Shivaji, Part III, pp. 32, 56-60. S. 8. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 6S ( the Sultan and Shivaji ) were thus talking, the place was surrounded by 6,000 cavalry who approached so silently that the buzzing of a fly could have been heard. It was thus that th* brigand made known to the world that like a second Masaniello he was as much beloved as respected by his subjects." * 3. State Cavalry and Militia The cavalry was of two tjpes: (1) the Paga belonging to the state, and (2) the Siledars or horsemen possessing their o^n horses as well as arms, but accepting service under the state for some time. The state-cavalry was organized in units of 25 troopers ^bo were under an expert Maratba Hawaldar. Each unit had a water-carrier and a farrier attached to it. Five Hawalas made up a Jumla and its officer was a Jumledar. Ten Jumlas consisting of 1,250 troopers made up a Hazar ( Thousand ). The commander was styled a Hazari. His office-establishment consisted of a Brahman Mujumdar, a Matatba Secretary, a Prabhu Jamnis and a number of cleiks. A group of five Hazaris was commanded by a Panch Hazari, an officer possessing the title of Five Thousand. Three civil officers of the above- mentioned titles were also attached to him. All the Panch Hazari generals were directly under the Sarnaubat or Ccmmander-in-Chief. Each battalion of 1,250 horsemen had newswriters or Vaknis ( Vaq'navis ), couriers and spies. AH these were appointed by the Commander-in-Chief. The chief officer of the Detectives was the famous Bahirji Jadhav of a thousand exploits. All officers were paid decent salaries as shown below: Jumledar over 125 troopers 500 pagodas and a palanquin. His accountant 100 to 125 pagodas. A Hazari over 1,250 troopers 1 ,000 pagodas, a palanquin and other accoutrements of honour. His Accountant, Secretary and Jamnis got 500 pagodas besides a palanquin was given to each. The emoluments of the Commander-in -Chief are not mentioned anywhere. 1. Eng. Records, II, 350. 66 SHIVAJI THE GREAT The organization of the other type of cavalry consisting of Siledars was exactly of the same kind. They were also under the Sarnaubat. 4. Training of the Cavalry: Arrangements were made to keep the cavalry in cantonements during the rainy season. Hence sufficient stores of grains, fodder, medicines, etc., were preserved* ,Houses for men and stables for horses were provided. Tiros Shivaji had a regular cavalry in bis service, and he looked to its comforts, efficiency and discipline. It was maintained on a new- system in opposition to the feudal system of the Moguls. The nobles of the Delhi Empire were interested in cutting down the expenses of the cavalry under their charge. The troopers were recruited as occasion arose. Hence there was no regular training- of troopers, and no regular breeding studs for horses were in existence. All was confusion, corruption and inefficiency. A description of the Mogul cavalry by Tavernier, Bernier, Manned irnd others clearly brings out these defects. 5. The Infantrj: This branch of the army was mainly recruited from the Mawalas. The ascend ing grades were as follows:-' Names of Officers Names of Infantry Units One Naik or Corporal over a squad of 10 men. Hawaldar or Sergeant a half company of 5 Naiks or 50 men. One Jumledar or Captain over a company of Hawalas or 100-150 men. One Hazari or Brigade over a battalion. Commander One Sarnaubat or Commander- ... over seven Hazaris. -in-Chief. Their salaries are given as under: Jumledar 100 pagodas Hazari Commander ... 500 pagodas His Secretary... 40 His Secretary ...100-125 6. Strength ef the tray: From the Dutch documents we team that in 1660 Sbivaji had 3,000 soldiers at Panhala with Ipim. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 6fl He must have distributed some forces for the protection of conquered places. A force of 4,000 foot and 7,000 horse was despached to reinforce the captain who had captured Kudal. The 1 latter must have originally got some three to four thousand soldiers under him. Then a flying army of sixteen thousand picked, men under Netaji was harassing the march of the grand army of Shaista Khan. Another flying army was threatening Bijapur and trying to decoy Siddi Jauhar from Panhala. This flying force might be composed of some seven thousand men. We have to take into consideration the garrisons left in such strong fortresses as Purandar, Javli, Pratapgad, Rajgad, Sinhagad, Khelna, Rangana, Chakan, Vasota, Lohgad, etc. It is evident that the whole active army of. Shivaji could not be less than sixty thousand in 1660 l A. D. It is said on P. 480 of Part II that Shivaji had as strong an army as the Bijapur King had given to Siddi Jauhar which was. 16-20 thousand horse and 35-40 thousand foot. In other words, the strength of the Raja's army varied from 50 to 60 thousand men in 1660 on the strength of Dutch evidence. ^ Shivaji must have increased the army with the expansion of his kingdom and financial resources. The Siledars were raised to 8,000 just after Afzal's death. Netaji Palkar was sent with 15,000 horse and 12,000 foot to make depredations in the Mogul territory in 1661. Shivaji is said to have 50,000 foot and 10,000 horse in camp during the rainy season of 1664. He must ha\e got about 500 x 35 = 17,500 men more in the thirty-five forts under him at that time. He started with 30,000 soldiers in 1670 against the Moguls. A few months later, he is reported to have marched with 10,000 horse and 20,000 foot tp surprise Surat.* He marched with 15,000 horse, 14,000 foot, and 10,000 labourers against Phonda in 1675; with 15,000 horse and 30,000 foot against Konkan in 1676, and with 40,000 horse and 40,000 foot in 1677 on the Karnatic expedition. This army was on 1. Shivaji, Part II, Pp. 78, 479, 483, 485. 2. Ibid, pp. 117, 241, 365. 68 SHIVAJI THE GREAT the whole newly recruited. The best and bravest soldiers were left behind with Moro Pant to defend the kingdom. 1 We have to add the garrisons which were permanently kept for the defence of the forts and the country. In Nov. 1678 he had concentrated 15,000 horse and 20,000 foot at Panhala alone. In 1679 Shivaji was about Malkapnr with 20,000 horse; one of his generals plundered Dharangaon, Chhapra, tc., with 12,000 horse, another force of the same strength appeared ear Aurangabad. Thus more than 40,000 horse were in the field in one province. Then Moro Pandit had another force of 20,OOO strong, 9 while Shivaji himself returned with another army to kis capital* At the end of his life the strength of his cavalry is stated by Sabhasad to be 45,000 regulars and 60,000 irregulars, 9 while Chitnis changes the proportion to 80,000 regulars and only 25,OOG irregular Siledars. It is evident now that the figures of the Sabhasad and Chitnis. Chronicles are not unreliable ; 4 that the infantry preponderated ver the cavalry in Shivaji's army, and that he devoted very great personal attention to the efficiency, discipline, recruitment, payments rewards of the army. 7. The relative strength of the orrilry tod iafatrj: The Moguls were in need of more horsemen than foot soldiers, since the former were mostly useful in the distant expeditions to Kabul and Kandahar, to Assam, Gujerat or Sind, and to the Deccan. The infantry was mainly employed on garrison duty in the numerous forts and palaces. The Deccan monarchs, following the Moguls, had a preponderance of cavalry over the infantry. In fact, all the military grades were based upon the number of horses commanded 13. Vakasfcar, 138; Sbiraji, Part II, 287; Part III, 137, 177, 211-1^ ' 4. Rawlinsorrs statement that Sbiraji's usual striking force was about HIJOOO troops of all arms, is a gross underestimate ( Shivaji, p. 91 ). Fryer (? that Shivaji had 30,090 horsemen and footxaea innumerable. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 69 by the officers. The distinguished historian Baldaeus records that the forces of the Bijapur-King consisted of 1,50,000 horse and only 8,000 foot. 1 Shivaji did not require cavalry in the mountainous country and in the inaccessible forests of the Sahyadri range. His numerous forts needed, a large force of brave foot soldiers. Moreover, the cavalry was far more costly than the other arm. Besides, horses were difficult to obtain in Maharashtra. For the first fifteen years he was mainly, if not exclusively, devoted to the rerrmnntf, equipping and training of the infantry. His military genius, personal bravery, organizing capacity, charming personality, all combined to produce a self-confident, a loyal, and an almost invincible army from the poor, ignorant, simple, but hardy and sturdy Mawalas and other mountaineers. He specially devoted himself to the recruiting and training ot the cavalry after his victory over Afzal Khan. With the enormous wealth captured in his camp and the loot obtained in the subsequent depredations he could swiftly increase his military strength in all arms. The triumph of Shivaji in 1660 was really a turning point in his life. The growth of the cavalry was subsequent to the wealth obtained after the memorable victories over the Bijapur generals. It was necessitated by the invasion of Shaista Khan. In the military forces organized by Shivaji, the infantry predominated over the cavalry. This fact is clear from the figures given in the previous section. At the end of his career, he is said to have a lakh of foot soldiers, recruited, equipped, and paid by the state, though the 91 Q. Chronicle raises the figure to two lakhs.* 8. The excellence of his cavalry The excellence of the light Maratha cavalry has been fully brought out by the numerous wars* expeditions, depredations and guerilla tactics described in this work. The pomp, luxury, magnitude and cumberousness of the camps of I. A Description of the E India Coasts, p. 602 ( London 1703 ), a. vak. 70 SHIVAJI THE GREAT the Mogul commanders like Shaista Khan, Diler Khan, Bahadur Khan and the Mogul princes, have also been frequently detailed in the writings of Da Guarda, Abbe Carre, Manucci, etc. It has been truly concluded by Vincent Smith that if Akbar had had the misfortune to encounter the Maratha light horse, it is possible that he might not have fared much better than his great grandson did. Akbar's military organization had in it the seeds of decay and failure. 1 Without tents and equipage, without provisions and other commissariat encumbrances, without heavy artillery, the light Maratha infantry and cavalry moved with lightning speed from place to place. The soldiers and horsemen gathered their provisions as they went along. Their diet must have been of the poorest kind. They could hardly have time and opportunity to relish dainties and luxuries. These simple rustics subject to all the inclemencies of the climate of different parts in their long expeditions to Khandesh, Berars, and Southern India, performed deeds of heroism, sacrifice, patriotism which won them the admiration of the world. Dr. Fryer keenly observed the difference between the Muslim and Maratha armies and remarked : " Sevaji's men thereby being fitter for any Martial Exploit, having been accustomed to Fare Hard, Journey Fast, and take little Pleasure. But the other will miss of a Booty rather than a Dinner; must mount in state and have their arms carried before them, and their Women not far behind them, with the Masters of Mirth and Jollity ; will rather expect than pursue a Foe ; but then they stand it out better ; for Sevagi's Men care not much for a pitched Field, though they are good at Surprizing and Ransacking ; yet agree in this, that they are both of stirring spirits." The fighting strength of the army was maintained by strict discipline. Dr. Fryer also observed that Shivaji did not permit " whores and dancing wenches in his army," nor did he allow drinks and intoxicants to be taken by his soldiers. Thus all officers as well as men lived a life of Spartan simplicity like the Maharaja 1. Akbar the Great Mogul, p. 368. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 7f himself. Abbe Carre observes that " he greatly cherished the officers whom he called his brothers and friends, living familiarly with them, and attending to their needs wit hall distinction, he did not give anything to himself. He conducted himself with such ability, not affecting anything, and proposing through others the things to which he appeared aloof, and ( but ) which he desired at bottom." ' Further, "Shivaji who being always at the head of his troops, knew not pleasure. 1 ' ' The evidence of Dr. John F. G. Careri * ( 1695 A. D. ) is worth recording here : " This Shivaji is so powerful, that he maintains war at one ami ihe same time with the great Mogul and the Portuguese. T!e bungs into the field 50,000 Horse, and as many or more For 4 , much better soldiers than the Moguls, for they live a clay upon a piece of dry bread, and the Moguls will march on with eaFe ( arrying women, abundance of provisions and tents so that their army looks like a moving city." 9. Training of the army: Shivaji was one of those rare rulers who devoted much attention to the regular training of the soldiers. Here is the testimony of Abbe" Carr : " He had in his troops many young men still novices in the business whom he had assembled from all sides. In order to accustom them, he encamped for nearly three months on a level plain, training them to manage horses and to fight, and forming them with care in all the exercises of the military art." 8 This confirms the statements of the Marathi chronicles about the training of the soldiers in the cantotements and in the forts* It is said by Carre that the Raja used to choose a most beautiful place, most abounding in forage, for making his army encamp and for giving it leisure and comfort to refresh itself. 4 Shivaji had regular studs in several places. One of these was at Mahad Korigao, the other was near Junner, and the third B**r Surat. I. Hist Misc., pp. 49. 55. 2. A Voyage Round the World. 3-4. Hist. MiK., pp. 45,57. 5. Yak. 89. 72 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 10. Army regulations of Sbivaji maybe stated on the evidence of Sabhasad to be as follows: 1. During the rainy season the army was stationed i- cantonements. 2. The commissariat officers were to provide houses for men and stables for horses, and keep sufficient grains, fodder and medicines in store. 3. The army was employed on some expedition after celebrating the Dasrah festival. 4. Then an inventory of the belongings of all men ready to march out was made. 5. For eight months these forces were to subsist on provisions obtained in the territories of the enemy. 6. No women, female slaves, or dancing girls were to be taken with the army. Those who kept them were to be capitally punished. 7. Women and children were not to be captured anywhere. 8. Cows were not to be captured, but bullocks could be requisitioned for transport service. 9. Brahmans \\ ere not to be molested nor were they to be admitted as surities. 10. No one was to commit adultery. 11. On return from an expedition, an inventory of the loot :*nth every sepoy was to be made. All cash and articles over and above the salary due to a sepoy were taken for the state. 12. All officers were to present gold, jewels, valuable clothes and commodities to the Raja. Accounts were rendered to him, and sums due from the treasury for pay and other charges were to be taken by them. 13. Men guilty of violating the rules or charged .with cowardice, were to be tried by a military court and the offenders were to be duly punished. S. 9. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 7* W get glimpses of the observance of these rules in the preceding pages and in some Marathi documents. Strict discipline prevailed in the army on its march to Golconda. Inventories, of the loot at Rajapur, Hubli, Chhapra, Dharangaon, etc. are referred to several times in these pages. Shivaji was much distressed at the news of the Chiplun people being harassed by the troops encamped there. He issued these instructions to the officers. " If articles are forcibly taken away from the cultivators, they would desert the place. Some would die of starvation, and your presence would be more unwelcome than that of the Moguls, Do not give ryots the least trouble. Whatever is wanted by the soldiers should be purchased from the market with money given you from the Government treasury. Violence should not be offered to any one on any account." * Shivaji did not encumber his army with beasts of burden to supply provisions. Spare horses were led in the cavalry to take the place of those which died on the expeditions. Similarly, pack animals were taken to bring back the booty. But there was nr> other hinderance which was experienced by Mogul commanders tr> supply commodities for the camp bazars. Caravans consisting of thousands of bullocks Were led by Baftjaries tor the supply of provisions to the Mogul army. The movements of the Muslim armies were consequently slow and ineffective. 11, Spies and scents: The detective department was the backbone of the administration. The Maratha spies were found in tbe army, navy, civil departments, and camps. They were scattered over the whole country and in the territories of the other rulers. These spies supplied minute information on the questions entrusted to them. For Sbivfrjl had complete information atom the housfesof the rich merchants of Sufat, ftubli, Dham&fcatt, Chhapra and other cities plundered by him. He even knew where the treasures were concealed in the houses. Therefore he could pillage large cities in two or three days and depart with bis booty 1. R> VIII, doc, 23-25. 74 SHIVAJI THE GREAT to other places. The Raja had to outwit Aurangzeb, the prince of wiles, and outdo his extensive system of espionage. Then he is said to have himself visited Surat in the guise of a fakir before he launched upon his lightning expedition against the richest port of the Empire in 1664. It is said that the Sadhus in charge of Ramdasi maths used to play the part of spies, and this religious order was of immense help to Shivaji in his administration. A few principles of the military organization evolved by Shivaji are mentioned by Martin, the French Governor of Pondicbery from personal knowledge obtained by visiting the Maraiha camp. "His camp is without any pomp and unembarrassed by baggage or women. There are only two tents in it, but of a thick simple stuff, and very small, one for himself and the other for his minister. The horsemen of Shivaji ordinarily receive two pagodas per month as pay. AH the horses belong to him and he entertains grooms for them Ordinarily there are three hordes for every two men, which contributes to the speed \\hich he usually makes This Chief pays his spies liberally, which has greatly helped his conquests by the correct information which they give him." 12. Rewards for military service: Sabhasad has recorded the rewards distributed by Shivaji among his army after the destruction of Afzal Khan's forces. Further, as Kahnoji Naik Jedhe performed splendid service in annihilating Afzal's army, he was given the First Honour of the Sword in 1659. Kavji Kodhalkar and Waghoji Tupe were rewarded for their service during the same war by being appointed commanders of 1,000 foot in 1660 ( J. Ch. ) Shivaji conferred the title of Panch Hazari on two great military officers, one Makaji Anand Rao, a natural son of Shahji and the other Vyankoji Datto, a Brahman military leader. During Shivaji's flight to Khelna Randal's men fought magnificently and many died fighting for the Raja, hence the First Honour of the Sword was transferred to Bandal, and Jedhe was placed in the second rank. 4 ( J. Ch. ) THE MILITARY SYSTEM 75 Kartoji Gujar was made Sarnaubat with the title of Pratapraor Prince of Valour. Since that time he was known to the world as Prataprao Gujar. Similarly, Hansaji Mohite was decorated with the title of Hamir Rao. Anand Rao who acted as commander- in-chie f after the heroic death of Prataprao, was honoured with the highest title of Haft Hazari according to Chitnis and Hasam Hajari according-to Sabhasad. One Surya Rao Kankde who fell at the battle of Salhir, had the title of Panch Hazari. Hazariship ' was conferred upon Ram Dalvi, Tan Savant, Admiral Ibrahim Khan, Ramaji Pangera, Mai savant, Santaji Raje and many others* Civil or military officers were given palanquins, horses, elephants, and even banners and drums to maintain their status with magnificance. It appears that there was an honorary or titular post of Sena Saheb Subha- Major General of the whole army. In 1664 it was conferred by the Raja upon his half-brother Parsoji. 13. Feudal forces: Although Shivaji's greatest work was the abolition of feudal traditions, still hereditary Watandars, Deshpandes, Deshmukhs and others continued to enjoy a part of their incomes. The few armed attendants in their service could naturally be summoned in times of emergency. This militia served as a reserve force for all contingencies. The contemporary Muslim rulers mostly depended upon their feudal levies, but Shiva did not rely upon the inefficient, irregular, indisciplinecl troops haphazardly raised by a feudal baron for himself or for the Raja. These forces were, however, occasionally used ; for instance, Moro Pant was called to the battle-field of Salhir from the Konkan where he had gone at the head of the Hasams or militia. Similarly, an important battle was fought by a Hazari officer of the militia with Diler Khan.' 14. Arm and Weapons: The army was generally equipped with arms and weapons like swords, daggers, scimitars, straight 1. 50o, Sh. Cbb, pp. 85, 97, 102, 104. 106, 126. 148; Vak. P.' 123. 2. Sen, Sh. Chb., pp. 102*103, 76 SHIVAJI THE GREAT rapiers, spears, poniards, spears with a string, bombs, bows and arrows, match-locks, coats of mail, head armours, helmets, cloth-covers, body-armours, armours for horses and elephants, grenades, and other weapons.^ Rockets and carbines were used by the Maratha army in a battle with Kbawas Khan { Shivaji, Part II, 528 ). We read of hurling fiery-arrows and stones ( Ibid., p. 28 ). He gathered together the infantry by collecting foot-soldiers * from the Maval territory, light 9 - armed men, spearmen * swordsmen, 4 camp-guards,* match-lockmen,* musketeers, 7 foot-soldiers* from the Karnatic, Torsali,* Jangade, 10 and ichers. 1 J He made fit and ready the moving artillery * 9 by collecting* small 19 cannon, long-range 14 guns, cannon 15 carried on elephants, guns 16 carried on camels, mortars 17 placed on big carts, and men 1 * with some kind of cannon. The kingdom was thus kept well protected and made prosperous. 15. The camel corps ind elephant corps were small units. The former is said by Chitnis < P. 186) to be from 1,000 to 1,500 strong. Camels were required to carry guns, luggage and post, while elephants were used for dragging heavy guns and baggage or were kept as ornamental appurtenances to palaces, mansions and forts, Sabhasad has given the number of elephants male, female and young to be 1,260 at the end of Shivaji's regime, while Chitnis 1 * reduces the number to 350 only. Out of these about one hundred mere kept for state use, while the rest were given to nobles and the artillery department. Shivaji is said to have captured 65 elephants, $ Their respective names in Marathi are; ; I. Mavals. 2. Adavas. 3. Itekari. 4. Pattaits. 5. Bankaits. 6. Bandukis. ?, Torsandajs. 8. Kanades. 9.

In the battle of Salhir the booty included 125 elephants, 6,000 camels and 6,000 horses. ' These seem to be exaggerated figures, but in many other battles and expeditions the Marathas were capturing these animals, and consequently there must have been a large number of these for military and civil use. 16. Military reforms In opposition to the Muslim armies the Maratha army was an imperial institution managed by the central government. It has been seen that many reforms were introduced by Shivaji. These are summarized below : 1. He created a special royal troop for his personal protection and as a reserve for contingencies. 2. He did away with the feudal army and created a standing- army directly recruited by the government 3. He reduced the importance of the mercenary troopers and increased the strength of the state-paid army. 4. He avoided the mistakes and pitfalls of the Mogul Emperors by having light-armed cavalry and by introducing very strict regulations against luxury, drunkenness, indulgence in music, etc. 5. He introduced the system of breeding horses and of branding them in imitation of the Mogul's method, 6. Ths Mogul Emperors depended more on the cavalry than on the infantry, but Shivaji paid more attention to the improvement of the infantry. 7. His forts could be defended proper! his strength lay in inaccessible stronghold light-footed infantry. He consequently t make it efficient and faithful. 1. Shi*a}i, Part II, 52, 189, 479. 78 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 8. He gave titles to his military officers but no lands in gift. 9. He absolutely did away with the vicious Mogul system of paying the salaries of officers from rents or lands given in Inam to them. All were paid in cash from the state and local treasuries. 10. Every soldier was paid directly by a civil officer and not by his military commander. Officers as well as soldiers were all liberally paid. Besides, they were honoured with titles and insignia. 11. He kept the military forces under civil administration. He created a graded hierarchy of military officers who were irr no way permitted to rule the country. The civil rulers were separate and had nothing to do with the army, but in various expeditions when Ministers were put in charge of the military operations, the army was to obey their orders. 12. Shiva was the supreme builder and fortifier of forts. His new regulations for the internal organization of the forts deserve attention. 13. Spies were posted in every unit of the army, so that the Raja could get full information of its movements and occurrences. 14. Officers called Vaknis wrote all news regarding the army, so that Shivaji was kept informed of all details. 15. Every commander was given a private secretary to write out his official diary which \\as probably inspected by the higher officers. 16. His army was non-communal, even Muslim soldiers and officers had a significant share in every branch of the army. 17. He established factories for manufacturing various kinds of armband ammunition. 18. He was the father of the Maratha navy which proved a terror to the Siddi, the M^gtil and the European navies. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 79 19. He introduced a private merchant marine. 20. He avoided pitched battles and relied more on guerilla tactics. The Forts 17. Shivaji, a nan of forts Daughlas has aptly said that Shivaji's dwelling was among the rocks, and his strength lay in the everlasting hills. He was a man of forts, born in a fort. The forts made him what he became, and he made the forts what they were the terror of all India ; the cradle of his nation ; the basis of his conquests ; the steps of his ambition, his home and his joy ; many of them he built, all of them he strengthened. 18. Classical names of forts One was a Lion's Den ( Sinhagad ), another the Bolt of Indra ( Purandar ), a third was Bhima's Fort, a fourth was Valour Fort ( Pratapgarh ). A few other instances are most interesting. Pandavagarh ( Pandavas' Fort); Vijayadurg(Victory Fort); Raigarh (Royal Fort); Vishalgarh ( Formidable Fort ) ; Panhala ( Serpents' Home ) ; Suvarndurg ( The Golden Castle ) ; Vishramgarh ( The Fort of Rest ) ; Lohgad ( Steel Fort ) ; Shrivardhangarh ( Enhancer of Prosperity ) ; Manranjangad ( Pleasing to the mind ) ; Kanchangad ( The Golden Fort ) ; Kamalgad ( Lotus Fort ) ; Mayurgad ( Peacock Fort ) ; Madangad ( Fort of Cupid ) , Mitragad ( Friendly Fort ) ; Rajhansagad ( dander Fort ) ; Sundargad ( Beautiful Fort ) ; Naladurg ( King Nala's Fort ) ; Devagad ( God's Fort ); Bhaskargad ( Sun-Fort ) ; Gajendragad ( Elephant Fort ) ; Chandragad ( Moon- Fort ) ; Satara ( Star-Fort ). Only inspiring names were not given to the fortified places, but some pleasing titles were chosen to create appreciation of their natural beauty. A few instances have been given at random above. All these are Sanskrit names. This fact furnishes an incontestible testimony of his literacy and love for Sanskrit* 19. Nmber of forts: In the words of Orme " nothing was spared which might contribute to the internal defence of his country. Regular fortifications well-armed and garrisoned barred the opener 80 SfflVAji THE approaches ; every pass was commanded by forts, and in the closer defiles, every steep and overhanging rock was occupied as a station to roll down great masses of stone, which made their way to the bottom, and became the most effectual annoyance to the labouring inarch of cavalry, elephants and carriages. It is said that he left 350 of these posts in the Concan alone/' The Sabhasad Chronicle gives the number of forts as 240. Out of these one hundred and eleven \vere construe ted by Shivaji himself, 49 were captured by him in Maharashtra, 30 in the Karnatic and 41 below the Ghats. 1 In tlie Chitnis Chronicle* the number of forts is 317 as under: Military circlet N. *f forts 1.

Hill castles and underground forts 240 Forts on the ground 108 Sea forts 13 This list is to be preferred to others. There is no reason to doubt the veracity of the names given therein except in a few cases. Thus we can safely assert that Shivaji was the master of about 350 forts, out of which some fifty must have played an important role in Maratha history. 20. Fortifications and repairs.The 91 Q. Chronicle records that Shivaji built a fort at every place which he found strong and beautiful in situation, and put in it trustworthy and brave men. Mudforts were demolished and stronger ones were constructed in their places. 3 We have already seen how he strengthened the fortifications of Kajgarh, Raigarh, Sinhagad, Lohagad, Mahuli, Purandar, Panhala, Vishalgad, Rangana, Phonda, Vellore, Ginji, Sindhudurg, and numerous other fortresses and castles. Shivaji fully understood that the hill-forts were the best means for the protection of the land, its people, the king and his royal power. Hence he took care to maintain the walls, gates and towers of the forts in full repair and to keep provisions, stores and munitions ready for a long siege. As he was in constant fear of Mogul invasions, he created in 1671 a reserve fund of 175,000 pagodas for repairs and another of 125,000 pagodas for provisions. These funds were to be used only in times of emergency when money from other sources could not be obtained. The relative importance of the forts is probably manifest from the amounts specified in the list of the reserve fund. 3 1. Chitragupta, pp. 127-131. 2. Vak.,p. 129. 3. Rajwade VIII. Documents. 21, 22 of 1671 A. D. It is as follows: Raigad, Sinhagad, Sindhudurg, Vijayadurg, Sinrarndurg. Pratapgad, Purandar, Rajgad, Pracbandgad, Prasiddhagad, Visbalgad. Mahipatgad, Sudhagad, Lohagad, Sabalgad, Shrivardhangad Iftanaranjan, Korigad, Sarasgad, Mahidbargad. Manobargad. i 82 'SHIVAJI THE GREAT 21. High waft* to workmen These letters bring out the important fact that Shivaji offered adequate and regular wages to the workmen, because ' otherwise the workers grew discontented, and the repair works suffered*. He was always on the lookout for expert workmen. He built Smdhudurg with the help of the- Portuguese engineers. For instance, he tempted several men from Bombay by offering high wages, and requested Englishmen at Madras to send experts for repairs of the Ginji fort. 1 22. Internal organization in a fort Every fort was in the possession of the Central Government, and no baron or Jagirdar was allowed to have one or even a house with a bastion. Each fort was manned by state forces and put in charge of several officers. The military command of the forts was of a different type from that of the army. A corporal f or Naik was appointed a leader of nine sepoys ( Paik ). Over every three Naiks was placed a Jamadar who thus commanded thirty men. Over all the Jamadars was appointed a Hawaldar. He was the Commandant of the fort and head of the garrison. He was usually a Maratha assisted by a Sabnis, a Karkhanis and a Sarnaubat. The first three officers were of the same status. The Sabnis or Accountant's post was filled by a Brahman who used to be in charge of the rolls and accounts, while the Karkhanis was invariably a Kayastha Prabhu who was the head of the commissariat department. The Sarnaubat used to be a Maratha. Besides these three officers of three different castes, there used to be watch officers of the ramparts, called Tat- sarnaubats. They were officers of the patrolling parties and night watches. The duties of Sabnis and Karkhanis were probably performed in the Bijapuri government by Chowkinawis. Shivaji appointed these officers in the beginning of his reign. For instance, Raghunath Balal was made Chowkinavis of the army just after the death of Kond Deva in 1647. Some time after he was raised from Chowkinavis to be the commander of the Konkan forts. After the capture of the fort of Purandar by Shivaji, A. R. Malekar was 1. Shnraji, Part III, 250-51. 2. Sen, Sb. Cbh,, p. 29. THE MILITARY SYSTEM . & appointed Chowkinavis, but in Sane's edition, the word " Sabnis " is used instead. 1 It is difficult to say when this new system was introduced by Shivaji, but from a letter oi 1665, it appears that the three officers of Hawaldar, Sabnis, Sarnaubat in addition to Naikvadis were in the fort of Rajgad. The Sabnis had delayed the payment of dues to the soldiers and an enquiry ^ as made into his conduct ( Raj. VIII, doc. 9 ). In seme cases the post was filled by some great man, but the work was done by his substitute. For instance, Ramachandra Kilkanth was made Sabnis in the fort of Sindhudurg on 100 pagodas per annum, but his agent cr Mutahk was to perform the duties according to the letter of appointment issued by Shivaji Raja himself on 13th April 1668. Moreover, this post was made hereditary in his family. 9 23. Pay of officers In two Marathi letters the pay of the Hawaldar and Sarnaubat of the fort Utlur is mentioned to be 125 and 100 Hons, the officer in charge of the buildings also got 125 Hons, while his secretary was paid 36 Hons per annum. The rampart-officers were paid 12 Hons and the Bargirs, 9 Hons 3 year. Grant Duff says that the regular pay of a foot-soldier was from one to three pagodas, that of a horseman from two to five, and that of a Shiledar from six to twelve pagodas a month. Besides, the officers used to get allowances for bearers of palanquins, torches, sun-shades and for other services. It was difficult for all these officers to conspire against Shivaji and to treasonably hand over a fort to the enemy. They were not only checks upon each other, but were jointly responsible for the safety of the forts. For instance, when Bhupalgad was invaded by the rebellious Sambhaji at the head of the Mogul troops, all the three officers jointly replied to his demand for the surrender of the fort. 8 1. In 91 Q. Cb, this caste is said to supply Chowkinavises, 2. Vak. Pp. 54, 59, 89. 3. Sh. pig. 206. 64 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Shivaji had frequently used the lure of wealth to buy off loyalty of the Adilshahi and Mogul officers, and thus he had easily got possession of many fortresses. His personal experience warned liim not to entrust the safety of a fort to one or two officers. While men of important castes were given high posts, they, impelled by mutual jealousies and self-interest, were sure to prove loyal to the benevolent ruler. 24. Guards for outskirts The Raja's genius found out still greater security in the employment of Mahars, Mangs, Ramosbis, Kolis, Bhils, and other jungle tribes for the protection of the- outskirts and slopes of a castle. All these tribes were mainly composed of most adventurous dare-devils. Some of these depressed classes were by tradition criminal people. He employed them as defenders of forts, and thus made them benefactors of the state. They proved to be the staunchest supporters of the suzerainty of their liberal sovereign. A third precaution taken by him was a careful selection of both men and officers. These were appointed after the Raja had individually inspected each man. Brave and shrewd youths of good family were recruited, but some one of the personal staff of the Raja was to stand surety for each of them selected for the army* Personal sureties were similarly taken for every officer appointed in the army. 1 Finally, he did not keep the same officers long in a fort, but used to transfer them from place to place. There was also no hereditary enjoyment of a post, as it was prevalent in the Bijapur kingdom. The fighting forces were composed of musketeers, spear-men, swordsmen, archers, and light-armed men. There were others who used to throw rockets, hand-grenades and stones. Sometimes huge boulders were rolled down the slopes to crush the ascend i soldiers and horses. 1. Sen, Sh. Chh., pp. 29-?0. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 85 25. Rqpdar taspcctira of fort* Shivaji used to often inspect the forts either himself or through responsible ministers. He had a code of regulations which were to be strictly followed by the officers of the forts. There is a fine anecdote narrated by Chitnis of the tests held by Shivaji. One night he approached the entrance of the Panhala fort and demanded it to be opened. The sentry at the gate consented to inform his officer of the Raja's arrival. After a time the Hawaldar appeared on the rampart and regretted his inability to permit him in against the rules. The Maharaja told him that he was hotly pursued by enemies and his life was in -danger. Thereupon the officer gave him assurance that he and his soldiers will stand guard on the rampart, and defend the gate against the enemy during the night. In the meantime he let down a bedstead and bedding for the king to sleep in the porch under the watch and guns of the fort. In the morning when the gate was opened according to the regulations, the officer appeared before the king with all humility for not complying with his wishes at night and hoped to be excused for disobedience. But Shivaji was much delighted at the bold conduct of the officer, so he munificently awarded him for fearlessly performing his duty. He paid such surprise visits to many forts before going to Agra. At other times he sent his commanders for inspection. Abaji Pant and Annaji Dutto were appointed to visit and inspect every fort, and to report upon the strength of its fortifications and the stock of materials and provisions. The views of Shivaji are given in a chronicle thus : " Forts are for the protection of the land and the people. Just as ships and boats are strengthened with nails of iron, so by means of forts and redoubts the kingdom is strengthened, and the ryots safeguarded. I have an enemy like the Emperor Aurangzeb. If, God torbid it, he decides on active hostility and spends his whole life in warfare with me, the conquest of these forts would be beyond his power. In fact, forts are the defendants and guardians of the kingdom and the royal power." From that time forward he laid down the rule that in the larger forts enough munitions and grain 86 SHIVAJI THE GREAT should be stored to last for 12 years, and in the smaller forts for two years, and that reliable men whose words could be depended on, should be posted in the forts and kept contented and attached to their master by all means, so that they might not hesitate to sacrifice their lives in time of need. These ideas were actually put into practice as has been strangely confirmed by Father Friere. ! " With this prevision, Shivaji applied all the energy of his mind and all the resources of his dominion to the fortifications of the principal towns. He constructed new ramparts around Gingi, dug ditches, erected towers, created basins, and executed all these works with a perfection which European art would not have denied. He did as much for the other citadels, whose position promised real advantages, destroyed all those which he considered useless, constructed a large number of new ones in the plains and hills, and put all these fortresses in a state of preparedness for a siege of several years." 26. Repair of fort$ The rule was to keep intact the walls of towers by repair, to strengthen the gates, and to keep stores, munitions and provisions of the forts ready for every emergency. There used to be a Sarnaubat or Hawaldar in charge of the public works. His duties were to look to the repair and construction of all buildings and ramparts in a fort. Among the reforms introduced by Shivaji one was the establishment of the P. W. D. Moropant and Hiroji Farzand were appointed to the post of the chief superintendent of buildings. In the beginning Brahmans, but afterwards Marathas too, were put in charge of this department. We have instances of such appointments at Ginji, Rudraj, Salvi and Utlur. 2 27. Vestiges of old forts A visit to one of the principal fojrts like Sinhagad, Raigad, or Panhala is an eye-opener. The tourist -will find that everything is lying in a dilapidated condition; ramparts' and gates are crumbling to dust ; the tanks and granaries are in 1. Shivaji, Part III, p. 253. 2, Vak., pp. 57, 88. 89: 141-42; Rajwade VIII, pp. 30-31. TH MILITARY SYSTEM 87 ruins ; old guns and iron balls are lying scattered among heaps of stones; old mansions have scarcely more than bare walls or foundations. Yet forts like Toma, Rajgad, Raigad, Sinhagad, Purandar, Pratapgad, Shivneri, Vishalgad, Panhala, Satara, Sindhudurg, present evidence of a very systematic government. These have very big granaries, so that for years they> could sustain a siege even without receiving provisions from without. Though many of these were hill -forts, sufficient care was taken to procure an adequate supply of water for human and animal pur- poses. Gunpowder and munitions of war were kept in underground cellars. They had secret tunnels or passages to effect escape in times of difficulty. Several of them had drawbridges to join and sever the connection with the land. They could be absolutely cut off by a ditch of water and yawning chasms of ravines. Their slopes were chiselled very steep, so that they were inaccessible even to the light-footed Mavalas. The weak points of defence were artificially strengthened with redoubts and fortifications. After capturing the impregnable castle of Ginji which included seven fortifications upon hills, Shivaji rebuilt it very strongly. Manucci has recorded that the Raja could foresee the emergency of Aurangzeb investing this castle. Therefore, he kept a great store of money, munitions, provisions, etc. to resist the Mogul armies during a long siege. 1 Shivneri has seven pates on the way which winds up the slopes within the ramparts. There are about fifty tanks both large and small there. Even the gates are doubled or trebelled in defence. One gate led to the other and to the third before one could enter the fort. At each gate a guard of soldiers was stationed and adequate arrangements for offence and defence were made. Two such gates are to be seen at Panhala, known as the " Three Gates " and the " Tiger's Gate." The masonry work is done in lead and lime. The gate has escaped the ravages of time for three hundred years. The old palace of Shivaji at by the rulers of Kolhapur even now, is preserv, original form. Similarly, the tower of the time of is kept in good condition there. It gives a pano/ 1. Shivaji, Part III, pp. 259, 269. 88 SHIVAJI THE GREAT whole of the Konkan and the surrounding districts. There were market places for the sale of all articles required by the soldiery and the officers. At Raigad we have the ruined shops of the great bazar of 25 ft. wide and a mile in length. In Panhala too, many shops must have existed. Barracks for the soldiers, and houses and offices for officers, temples, mosques, gardens, open spaces for military drills were to be had within the foits. Outside the ramparts the circumventing area of the slopes was generally divided into seven Petas or villages named after the week-days, such as Monday Pet, Tuesday Pet, Friday Pet, and so on. Each one of these was inhabited by Gadkaries or "Guardians of the Fort" consisting of different castes. The\ spent their time in cultivating the lands allotted to them on the slopes and at the foot of the hill, but in time of war, they defended the outskirts of the fort. Every day they had to keep watch, so that no hostile army shoufd pass through the intervening spaces for surprising the fort. 28. Architecture Shivaji had no time to go in for superb art in architecture. Many of his structures were hastily raised to defend the land against the constant raids of the Bijapuri or Mogul forces. Yet the stone arch constituting the great entrance to his palace and court at Raigarh is a marvellous specimen of architectural beauty and skill. The gateways of the Sindhudurgand Vijayadurg are of no mean quality. Similarly, the ramparts of these forts and of Shivaneri or of Satara are admirable pieces of workmanship. The works of Ginji, as already pointed out, were executed with a perfection which European art would not have denied. A very interesting description of the construction of the Smdhudurg at Malwan is given in the Chitragupta Chronicle ( Pp. 113-136). We get a vivid idea of the difficulties e.xperienced in such undertakings by Shivaji from the purchase of 200 khandis of iron to the manufacture of tools for the masons, the supply of lead and lime for joining stones, or from the collection of 3,000 men for the works including 100 Portuguese experts from Goa to the provisioning of gunpowder, balls and guns for the fort. It took three years to complete this fort under his- own instructions S. 11. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 89^ and the able superintendence of Gobmd Vishwanath Prabhu, Shivaji generously awarded the services of all at the completion of thiss fort which was expected to keep m awe both the Europeans and the Moguls. It has withstood the onslaughts of time and tide for two hundred and seventy years. Even now though it has beeiv lying in a neglected condition for several decades, it elicits our, admiration for the master-builder Shivaji. The present prospect of the fort can be had from the picture opposite p. 145, while the views of two sea forts with Maratha navies about them in 1755 are given in a picture opposite p. 372 of Part III. The Maratha Navy 29. Importance of the navy The navy was considered to be an independent limb of the state. It was essential to have a strong navy, because in the words of Ramachandra * mastery of the sea is in the hands of him who possesses the strongest navy.' Yet he advised kings not to have very large ships as these were not useful without the help of the wind. However, he favoured the construction of a few men-of-war to create dread in the enemy. He was an advocate of having a navy consisting of brave and efficient soldiers and fully equipped with heavy guns, short-guns, match-locks, grenades, ammunition, and other material for naval use. 1 The Maratha navy was composed of a light crew and was no, match to a European fleet on the open sea. The largest ships were frigates, called Gurabs of about 200 to 300 tons. These were looked down with contempt by the Europeans, because their ships were of bigger tonnage and though merchant vessels they carried guns and soldiers to protect themselves from hostile attacks. An English Company's ship of 500-600 tons was generally equipped with 36 guns and carried about 120 soldiers, and a ship of 400-500 tons had 30 guns and 90 soldiers. Smaller ships required less guns and soldiers. In short, every merchant ship was armed with guns to save itself and to guard the trade of its country. 1. Polity, p. 48, 2. Commercial Relations Between India an,d England, p, 253. 90 SHIVAJI THE GREAT The Marathas had no experts for casting big cannon, and were dependent upon the European nations for the same. The Mogul Emperor and Europeans were liberally helping the Siddis of Janjira in their war against Shivaji. The result was that that fort was at one time defended with 500 big cannon. Hence the capture of Janjira, even after enormous sacrifices of men and money, was not affected by Shivaji up to the end of his life. As he was dependent upon the Europeans for ammunition and ordnance, he treated all of them with much consideration. He showed special clemency to them at Surat, Vingurla, Madras, Negapatam and Pondichery. With the English too he continued to have friendly relations up to the end of his life, and did not ally himself with the Dutch against the English in 3673 even in time of emergency. He was a terror to them all. The Bombay settlement, being in its infancy, could not have been able to defend itself against his hordes, but he had realized the importance of every European nation which was carrying on commerce with India. He occasionally threatened the English, but actually did not give them any trouble, though they were affording refuge to the Siddi's fleet. Only at the end of 1679 he occupied Khanderi, and successfully kept its possession against the united fleets of the English and the Siddi. Suffice it to say that the prestige of the English was very much lowered in this war with Shivaji. Dr. Fryer has piquantly expressed the public opinion on this question :- " Amidst these Wars and rumours of Wars, we quietly lay down our arms, and leave Seva Gi and the Syddy alone to contend for our stony piece of Ground on Henry Kenry ; how much to our Honour or Reproach, may be gathered from the language we have daily cast in our Teeth ; " Why Vaunts your Nation ? What Victories have you atchieved ? What has your Sword done ? Who ever felt your Power ? What do you Possess ? We see the Dutch outdo you ; the Portugals have behaved themselves like Men ; every one runs you down ; you can scarce keep Bombaim, which you got ( as we know ) not by you" Valour, but Compact ; And will you THE MILITARY SYSTEM 91' pretend to be Men of War or Cope with our Princes ? It's fitter for you to live on Merchandise and submit to us. But for all these Revilings Seva Gi makes them tremble here, forgetting that twice their Safety has been owing to us, from falling into the hands of the- terrible Plunderer." ' 30. Types of ships : Sabhasad t has given six types : 1. Gurabs are grabs in English. These had rarely more than two masts. They were generally of 100 tons. Some with three masts were of 300 tons. 2. Galbats are named gallivats in English. Such a vessel is described by Orme as a large row-boat with two masts rarely exceeding seventy tons. By Vaupell it is said to be of 100 to 150 candies. On the evidence of R. Orme these used to carry six to eight pieces of cannon fiom two to four pounders ; they had 40 to 50 oars and were rowed at the speed of four miles an hour. 3. Shibads written as Shibars in English, were large vessels like half galleys of Spain. 4. Taratides were sailing vessels of large dimension. 5. Tarns were sailing vessels generally used by merchants. 6. Pagars were well-smoothed canoes. 7-10. Dubarc, Vabhor, Tirkati and Pal are four names added to the list by Chitnis and Chitragupta. The following types were in common use on the western coast. 11. Manchua is Machhava in Hindustani. It was a small vessel often of twelve candies. It had a main sail, 12 oars and four small guns. The Maratha fleet is said to have once lost 50 Manchuas. 12. Galleons were large ships generally sailing between Portugal and the East. * Shivaji, Part III, p. 492. t Sen-Sh. Chh, 93. 1-6. Sen, Sh.

Mahagiri was a vessel of burden carrying 30 to 200 candies of goods. These were probably the types of mercantile boats. 15. Paravs written as Prows or proas in English, were small boats, seldom exceeding thirty candies. Eight of these were once captured by Shivaji's frigates. 16. Balloon stands for Balyanv, a state barge. It was sent -with some Manchuas and a Shibar from Bombay against Khanderi. 17. Ketches were also called Doriohs. Each had a main and a mizen mast. 18. Parangttes were small coasting vessels employed in the carrying trade by the country merchants. We read a few other names of boats in the documents reproduced in these volianes : 19.

The reasons for the small craf I: Shivaji did not introduce any new type of vessel nor did he imitate the Europeans in constructing Jarge men-of-war. He began by building indigenous types of vessels which could easily be managed by the Konkan people and could freely sail in the creeks and shallow waters along the rocky coast. The Europeans were sovereigns of the sea. He could not hope to get any European engineers to build his ships or pilots to manage them, nor could he ever get the necessary guns and munition for the hip s-hips. The situation of his forts, the rocky character of the coast, and the limitations mentioned above must have obliged him to have small ships. These were looked down with contempt by Englishmen ' as pitiful things that one good ship \\ould destroy a hundred of them without running herself into any great danger.' ' 32. Organization of the marine: Op /'the evidence of Ramachandra ^ant the fighting fleet was ^rpanized in separate units, each unit \gnsisting of five grabs, 15 gallivats, and some small or light cnRi" 1- Thse were organised into two squadrons each under a separate admiral. One was Mai'Naik so often mentioned in the Maratha chronicles and the European documents. 1 The other officer was styled Daria Sarang. From a Bombay letter of November 1670 we learn that a Hindu Vyankatji Sarangji was Daria Sarang or Admiral of the fleet. 3 This general who was going to Surat with a fleet of 160 vessels small and great, was personally known to the Deputy Governor of Bombay, Mr. Philips Gyffard, who had been in correspondence with him fo,r the last seven or eight years. It appears that Vyankatji had been general of the fleet from at least 1663. A Dutch letter informs us that in 1664 the Maratha fleet was -commanded by two admirals. 0ne had the title of Daria Sarang and the other of Mai Naik whq^gfs also a Hindu of Malsi caste.? Daulat Khan who was gene^JBSIjLShivaji's sea-forces went to 1-4 Shivaji, Part II, pp. 106, ^/SSJ, *jl-^ 543. <M SHIVAJI THE GREAT receive the English on their arrival near Rajapur on 2nd February 1675. He continued to occupy that post up to the death of the Raja. Under him two Muslim officers, Siddi Sambal and Siddi Misri by name began to serve from 1676. According to the , ^aratha chronicles Ibrahim Khan was one of the admirals probably before Daulat Khan. ^ The English records bear out that there were two generals of the Maratha navy. In a letter of 23rd July of 1678 " we read of Daulat Khan and Daria Sarang, both generals of his fleet/' 1 Khanderi was occupied by Mai Naik Bhandan in Aug. 1679, and Daulat Khan was the other admiral in charge of the fleet. Therefore he should be Dana Sarang, 8 whilst from the preceding reference it appears that Daulat Khan did not hold the post of Daria Sarang. In Oct.-Nov. 1678 the Dana Sarang and his son were imprisoned by order of Shivaji. It is probable that this post was then given to Daulat Khan. 3 In spite of the tangle this much is certain that there were two fleets, each under an admiral, one Mia Naik and the other Dana Sarang. The former was generally a Hindu Bhandari and the other a Muslim after 1670. The crew mainly consisted of Bhandaris, Kolis and Malabaris-hardy fishermen of the western coast. These hereditary lascars, well-known for their adventure, courage and endurance, were also engaged by the Siddis of Janjira and the English of Bombay. The Bhandaris who had settled down in Bombay were considered to be loyal to Shivaji.. *' If he should have any design against us, they would be snakes in our bosom." 4 Therefore the English were thinking of expelling them from Bombay. Besides the Hindus a good many Muslims and a few Portuguese were also employed in the fleets. Ramachandra Pant has consequently strnck this note of warning : " The sheltering should be done only in fortified ports. Still it is possible that men of the fleet who are many and who are generally Muhammedans and arrogant would quarrel and cause injuries amongst themselves. Sometimes in secretly fixed places treachery may take place 1- 3. Shiraji, Part III, pp. 359, ttft, 379, 381-2. 4. Ibid. Part II, pp. l35% 384. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 95 without one's knowledge. This is not desirable. For these reasons the sheltering of the navy should be done every year in a different port which has got a fort facing the sea." ! 33. NiTil strength: According to Sabhasad there were two squadrons of two hundred vessels each, and the total strength of the fleets was seven hundred vessels, while Chitnis puts the strength of the fleet at four to five hundred vessels. 3 The Chitragupta Chronicle has, howe\er, tecorded the following number of each type of vessel. Grabs large 30 Hodi 160 small --- 50 Jug 15 Gallivats 100 Pal 25 Taru 60 Manchva 50 Mahagirya 150 Total 640 Excluding the Hodi and the other small craft consisting of Mahagirya and Jup, the fighting vessels numbered about 300. In addition to this navy, 1,000 Tarus are mentioned.* In 1664 forty good frigates were lying in the rivers of Kharepatan and Kajapur, while sixty new battleships were under construction. 4 In November of the same year we are informed that * this terror to all the kings and princes round about had fitted up four score vessels and sent them down to Baticola.'* It was really in February 1665 after the completion of the Sindhudurg at Maiwan that he himself led a naval expedition to Barcelore with a fleet consisting of 85 frigates and three great ships.' This was the only one expedition during which he travelled on the sea. He passed by Goa without any molestation from the Portuguese* 1. Polity, p. 51. 2. Sen, Sh. Chh., pp. 134, 192; M. S. of the Marat has, p. 182. 3. Chifra. Ch., pp. 125-26. 4. Shivaji, Part II, 102, 117,582. Shivajrs vessels are often spoken or as frtgots by the English. In mother letter the number of new vessels is reduced to 50 frigates ( Part II, pp. U6-117 )f 5-6. Ibid. Part II, pp. 105, lcS-118, 36T 96) SHIVAJI THE GREAT pluter&d Barcelore, sent back the fleet and kept only twelve, transport his army over the rivers on the way. In a letterN^2Is<: November 1670 the fleet in Nagothana is said to consist orWBwWall vessels, but in the following letter the Deputy Governor is more accurate in saying that the fleet consisted of 160 sail both small and great. It was not composed of small vessels only. Three thousand soldiers were being conveyed by ' it to Surat. It was victualled for 40 days, and equipped with extraordinary provision of tools such as pickaxes, showels, crows of iron, etc., in the creek of Nagothana. It sailed along Thull, Bombay and Mahim, but was unexpectedly called back. During its return journey it captured a great ship of the Portuguese off Daman, while the Portuguese armada took twelve of these vessels. Dr. Fryer saw a small fleet of 30 ships and vessels belonging to the Maratha navy at Shriwardhan. Only a white flag was flying over the Admiral or Flagship. 1 1 is clear that the navy did not then use the Bhagava Banner. 9 Even in 1664-65 the strength of the Maratha navy had so much frightened Aurangzeb who had adopted the title of Alamgir the Lord of the World, that he instructed the Governor of Surat to induce the Dutch with promises of a substantial reward to destroy the fleet of Shivaji, but they did not consent to do so since the Raja had promised them to give facilities in the Konkan. They decided to remain neutral. 3 The English were commanded by the Mogul authorities not to supply arms and ammunition to Shivaji. Then negotiations were conducted with the Europeans at Surat to guard the Mecca fleets against the Maratha navy. When in 1670 he could lead a fleet of 160 vessels, the actual strength of his navy must have been much higher. A large number .- i. Shivaji, Part II, pp, 405. 109-U8. 365. 2.

Then it must have gone on increasing with the growth of his power, resources and kingdom. Therefore the fighting vessels great and small might approximate four hundred. The number of light craft to victual the fleet or to serve as- mercantile boats can not be reliably stated. 34. The Merchant fleet of Shifiji In 1664 Shivaji is said to possess eight or nine ports which were most considerable in the Deccan. From every port he used to send two, three or more trading vessels to Persia, Bassora, Mocha, etc. ' Even his Subedar Raoji Somanath Pandit, following the example of his master, made eight or nine ships ready to sail ta Mocha, Congo, Persia, Muscat, etc. However the English factors made up their mind not to issue permits to them. ! Two ships were being fitted out by Shivaji at Jaitapur for Mocha in February 1663. In 1670 Daria Sarang's three vessels went to Bombay to take in salt. 9 Shivaji used to send a fleet in May for bringing salt. In 1672 the English were planning to surprise this May fleet which would have been a vast loss to him.* Ramachandra Pant has mentioned several facilities to be given to foreign merchants visiting the Konkan ports. For instance, 1. Naval and civil authorities should conciliate the merchants- in many ways. They should be allowed to take whatever wood and water they want. 2. They should be permitted to buy their provisions. They ought to have full freedom to bring and purchase goods after paying the custom dues. 3. Hospitality should be shown to important merchants. 4. Full security should be given to them for their person and goods. 5. Enemy vessels should be captured. An inventory of their goods be made and the king be informed of the whole affair. Thus 1-2. Shivaji, Par* II, pp. 114, 151-53, 165, 401. <KJ SHIVAJI THE GREAT encouragement was to be given to merchants of all creeds to settle in the ports. 1 He has truly advised the rulers to encourage trade which would bring about an increase in the revenue from customs* A large fleet should not be made to depend on the income from customs alone. We have the testimony of Abbe Carre * that along the sea where Shivaji was master, no vessel from Europe came to which the Maratha Governors did not send provisions. Then he gives an example from his personal experience of the year 1668 when he accompanied two vessels of the French Co. and visited several Maratha ports. They were treated in a way which they had never hoped for. The Maratha statesmen of the time of Shivaji had fully understood the policies and character of the Europeans, and therefore a note of warning was struck by Ramachandra Pant in these words : " The hat-wearers ( Topikars ) are not like other merchants. Their masters, every one of them, are ruling kings. By their orders and under their control these people come to trade in these provinces. How can it happen that rulers have no greed for territories ? These hat-wearers have full ambition to enter into these provinces, to increase their territories and to establish their own religions. Accordingly at various places they have already succeeded in their ambitious undertakings. Moreover, this race of people is obstinate. Where a place has fallen into their hands, they will not give it up even at the cost of their lives. Their intercourse should therefore be restricted to the extent of only their coming and going for trade. They should never be given any places to settle, nor should they be allowed to visit any sea-fort." 35. Shivaji's naval exploits:- were of no mean description. In the beginning of his victorious career about the year 1657, he wrested from the Portuguese who were the sovereigns of the Indian ocean in those days, the right of free navigation for his own armada ; he captured the maritime ports like Rajapur, Dabhol, etc. from I. Polity, pp. 49-50. 2. Hist. Misc. P. 46. Trtfi MILITARY' SYSTEM ' & Bijapur in 1660 ; be reduced Danda Rajpuri along with several other sea-coast towns of the Siddis ; he carried on a life-long struggle with them for the possession of their sea-girt rock-castle of Janjira; he built the Ocean Fort ( Sindhudurg ), the Victory Fort < Vijayadurg ), the Golden Fort ( Suvarndurg ), the Lotus Fo& (Padmadurg), the Jewel-Hill ( Katnagiri ) and the Royal Fort ( Rajkot ) ; he occupied the important fort of Colaba near Bombay and made it his principal arsenal ; he collected Chauth from the Portuguese for Daman, and plundered Sunda, Bardes, and Salsette; he personally led a naval expedition with 85 frigates and three great ships for the sack of the port town of Barcelore in 1665 ; he increased the strength of his navy to such an extent within five years that in 1670 he made a naval demonstration with 160 vessels in the Back Bay of Bombay to strike terror into the hearts of Englishmen and the Bombay people ; he captured a large Portuguese ship off Daman on his return voyage from Bombay ; he refused to enter into an alliance with the Dutch for the capture of Bombay in 1673 and thus gave an incontestable proof of his friendship with the English ; he sacked Carwar and Wingurla in 1675 ; he brought the Dutch town of Negapatam and the French town of Pondichery into his kingdom which, in 1678 r extended from the Indian Ocean to the Bay of Bengal ; and finally, -a few months before his death, he fortified Khanden, " so that from it, like another Tenedos, he might watch the Bombay shipping before it entered our Hellespont." Even in 1664 he had terrified the Mogul subjects on the one hand and the Bijapuri people of the Konkan on the other. The Dutch factors at Surat record that the Moors ' think that they will be attacked by him although he never before sailed the sea. If he has inspired, would enable him to inflict still , Mogul with robbing and plundering. HeJ conceptions and designs which he knows execute with ingenuity.' ' The Englishmen of Surat wrote that t' 1 . Shivaji, Part II, pp. 102, 113, 496. 100 SravAji THE GREAT expect him by sea. He was to waylay the Surat vessels returning* from Bassora and Persia, or to transport an army to Cambay for plundering Ahmedabad. The Dutch at Wingurla were afraid of Shivaji who had enough ships and had always opportunity by night and at unforeseen times to surprise and capture their ships with his armed 4 thousand legs ' (?). Thus by 1664 he bad succeeded to terrorize not only the Mogul subjects but even the three European nations who had monopolized the sovereignty of the sea from a long time. Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha navy, could rightly be proud of such an achievement. The Englishmen in India must have heaved a sigh of relief on his premature death. Mr. Douglas has aptly expressed his nation's sentiments regarding the maritime exploits of Shivaji. " It was a great mercy that Shivaji was not a seaman, otherwise he might have swept the sea, &s he did the land, with the besom of destruction. Even as it was he was very nearly doing it. He liked the sea, but the sea did not like him. So strong was his love of the salt-sea wave that when a young man he took up his abode at Mahar, on the Bankot Creek ; at Malwan, he is said to have worked with his own hands at the fortifications of Sindhudurg. His foot-prints are still shown here, not on " the sands of time,* 9 but in the solid rock; and the "erring brother," meaning no harm, worships him as an avatar-silver mask for every day : gold mask for bara din or big days : Poor Shivaji, who is now worshipped as a god, was sea-sick like ordinary mortals ; and though he arrayed himself in red fez with jewelled tasses, a big- green wave off the Chaul Kudu would have no mercy on him, but bowl him, into the lee-scruppers ; and then-bilge-water and mat de mer. " The victor overthrown ; The arbiter of others' fates, A suppliant for his own." * 1. Douglas Boaba? an<J Western India, Vol. I, p, 112. THE MILITARY SYSTEM 101 3C. Sbiraji's M?al ftehtrrtmats The creation of the naval and mercantile marine was a remarkable achievement of Shivaji. The Muslim rulers of the north and the south did not possess any navies to defend their kingdoms from foreign invasion or to encourage coastal and maritime trade. Jahangir, Shah Jahan or Aurangzeb Alamgir-each one of these mighty emperors, was nominally * king of the world,' yet not sovereign of the sea. None of them could create a navy for political and mercantile purposes. The Nizam Shahi and Bijapur kings too did not possess national navies. The Portuguese, the Dutch and the English shared the sovereignty of the Indian seas and fully contiolJed the foreign trade of this country. Its kings and merchants had to frequently suffer humiliations from the arrogant Europeans. No Indian ship could stir out on the open sea without buying the Portuguese permit and without fulfilling the conditions mentioned therein. With the decline of the Portuguese power, the Dutch and the English began to issue permits. An Indian ship holding a Portuguese cartaz could be captured by the English or the Dutch if these were at war with the Portuguese. Thus the Indian rulers and their subjects did not enjoy freedom of the sea. Though the founder of the Maratha empire was fighting a life and <Jeath struggle with the Deccan states and the Mogul Empire, yet he conceived the idea of having an Indian navy to rule the waves after his conquest of Kalyan a great ship-building centre of those days. Amidst adverse circumstances he had the time, energy and determination to give practical shape to this original idea. In 1659, the year of his triumph over Afzal Khan, he had built ships at Kalyan, Bhivandi and Panvel. The Portuguese ordered their captain not to allow these to go out of the ports. 1 No documents are available to throw light on the early struggles of Shivaji with his Portuguese neighbours, but evidently they soon recognized the right of his fleet to navigate the sea without any hinderance from them. Consequently, Shiva richly deserves the titles of ' theFather of the Maratha navy ' and ' the Creator of the Indian mercantile * marine.* 1. Shivaji, Part III, p. 293. 102 SHIVAJI THE GREAT This navy was national to its composition and ideals. The soldiers and sailors were Bhandaris, Kolis, peasants, Malabars, Marathas, Muslims and Christians. These were inspired by national spirit and unshakable loyalty to their great ruler. We cannot share the view of the learned scholar, Dr. Sen when he says that Shivaji's navy accomplished very little excepting ^ome fighting with the Siddis. The naval achievements of the Raja can be summed up as under: 1. His navy effectively protected the maritime possessions in the Konkan against the raids of the Europeans, the Moguls and the Siddis. 2. It protected his own merchant fleet and mercantile vessels of his subjects sailing along the coast and even on the open sea. 3. It gave him the power to impose his rights of sovereignty over territorial sea and thus claim the wrecks of all ships in his ports. 4. It enabled him to wrest from the Portuguese the right to send out his vessels without obtaining any permits from them. 5. He kept the Portuguese in awe by entering into alliance with the Arabs, the Dutch and the English according to the needs of the time. 6. He captured Khanden and kept its possession against the naval might of the English and the Siddi. 7. He plundered the pilgrim ships of the Mogul Emperor. Then he looted the port-towns of Jival, Pabal and others near Surat. Thus he proved his strength both on the sea and the land. 8. His land-forces could be helped in their expeditions to Surat or to Barcelore by the navy. 9. He could keep watch over the activities of the Europeans and reduce their power in his ports. His officers used to issue permits to every merchant ship after inspecting 1 it on the sea for coming into his ports. Thus every port of his kingdom was defended against surprise by an enemy. 1. Sen, Ad. S. of the Msratbas, p. 434. THE MILITARY SYSTEM J03 10. It kept open the sea for Shivaji to escape to an inaccessible fort or to obtain war materials and provisions in time of emergency. 11* It created a naval spirit among his people, and provided employment to thousands of sailors and soldiers. 12, The ship-building industry was immensely encouraged. Kalyan, Panvel, Colaba, Kharepatan, Malvan, Wingurla and other places had ship-building yards for the repair and construction of all kinds of vessels. 13. Shivaji maintained a bitter and determined struggle with the Siddis of Janjira for twenty years, and though he failed to capture their castle, he succeeded in creating a national sentiment for the maintenance of the naval forces. On the strength of this sentiment the Angrias afterwards developed the Maratha navy to such a pitch that it became a terror to the Europeans for forty years up to 1750. Artillery 37. Supply from the Europeans Like the Muslim rulers, Shivaji had established a department for the manufacture of gunpowder, guns, cannon and other missies. Their names have been given before. But these were not as effective and numerous as were required for his rapidly growing kingdom. He had to depend upon the Europeans for the supply of ordnance and munition. He came into conflict with the English of Rajapur in 1660 on this point, because they sold mortars and grenades ' to Siddi Jauhar, and used these in reducing Panhala under their own flag. Therefore Shivaji wreaked vengeance upon them by imprisoning all of them at Rajapur, plundering their factory, and demanding a large sum for their ransom. The English East India Company was keen for the disposal of guns, 9 but as the Raja's power increased, and he became a dangerous neighbour of the English at Bombay, they were unwilling to supply any guns to him, since he was likely to use these against them or 12. Shivaji, Part II. pp, 137, 144. 337. 104 ' SHTVAJT THE GREAT against Jinjira. 'Therefore, they made several excuses for not selling any guns to him, 1 They were often prohibited from supplying artillery and warlike provisions to the Maratha ruler by the Mogul Emperor and his Governors, and instead ordered to supply those stores to them. 9 On his part Shivaji too did not like the English to come into trouble on account of him. He was anxious to keep the transactions secret, and arranged the purchase of guns through some Portuguese agents in 167 1. 3 Two years later he sent his envoy Bhimaji Pandit to Bombay for securing two or three great guns, but he was told that these and other European goods could be supplied only if the Raja made peace with the English. 4 Some time after Shivaji granted the English a Firman for trading in his territory with special privileges which were denied to others, yet they did not reciprocate their friendship with him. In November 1674, his envoy carried an extraodinarily kind letter and a rich present for the English President. He desired to buy 50 big iron guns from 40 to 60 cwts each and two great brass guns, but the authorities of Bombay refused to sell these, though they had 89 iron guns for sale. The negotiations on their sale were prolonged for four years from 1674 to 1678, and their motives for not disposing them are detailed in the letters of the period. We incidently learn that iron guns were sold at about Rs. 11 per cwt in 1674. In short, Shivaji experienced serious handicaps in purchasing guns from the English. Only in 1671 we hear of one indirect transaction in English guns. Two of these were sold to a Frenchman who disposed them to a Portuguese at Thana, and he in turn sold them to Shivaji at Rs. 5 per Surat Maund. 5 These were really useless to the English, ' being very bad within : yet with their powder and stone-shot they may last a good while/ Next year too, old and defective guns with great holes in them were sold out. Similarly, in 1674 February honey-combed jguns were disposed of. " 1-2. Shivaji. Part 11. pp. 280, 375, 390. 395, 481. 3-6. Ibid, pp. 287, 385, fl96, 428, 431. S. 13. TM MlutAfcY SFSTEII 105 The French had no such scruples to supply guns to Snivaju In a fetter of 5th September 1670 the English admitted that he might furnish himself with lead and guns from the French Factory at Rajfcjfctfr, " but we will not bring ourselves into any intrigue.'* l Three years later in 1674 there is an entry of purchasing 2,000 tnaunds of lead and 88 small guns from the French.* The Governor of Surat, being offended with them, reported their conduct to the Empefor. Again, in December 1679 the French sold forty guns to Shivaji who also collected thirty pieces morfe from his several forts in the Konkan for strengthening Panhala against the impending Mogul invasion. 3 Similarly, the Portuguese and the Dutch used to supply munition to various rulers. In 1663 the Savant* of Wadi asked for 2,000 Ibs. ammunition from the Dutch for a war against Shivaji, while the Portuguese secretly helped the latter with ammunition during his war with Jaisingh. 37. Ordnance manufactured in state factories: These details bring out the difficulties experienced by the founder of the Maratha Empire in securing guns and warlike stores from the Europeans. He must have been manufacturing very large quantities of arms and gunpowder in state -factories. We learn from Jaisingh's letter that Shivaji had granted important posts in the army to the officers in charge of the manufacture of guns. At Purandar Ambaji and Kharkuli with their two brothers were officers of the rank of 3,000 each. They were entrusted with this work during Jaisingh's operations in 1665. 5 His forts and vessels must have got an adequate supply of cannon, while his army too must have been equipped with fire-arms. There is a mention of cannon-balls, bullets, -fiery arrows, rockets, hand-grenades being used by the Marathas in various battles. 6 For the siege of Phonda Shivaji ordered a craft of forty small vessels to be present at Vingurla. The large ones carried four guns each. 7 Similarly, other ships were provided with cannon. 1-2. Eng. Rcc. I, pp. 161, 318. 3-7. Shivaji. Part III, pp. 137, 210. In 1675 Shivaji captured the castle of Ankola which was defended by fifty brass guns. 5. P. S. S. I, p. 286. 4-6* Ibid, Part II, pp. 28, 91. , SHJVAJI THE .GREAT, An interesting description of native guns and Porjtqguese gunners in Junner is already given from Fryer. 1 Shivjaji too used to employ engineers from Goa for casting cannon, making* gup-carriages and contriving mines in the walls Of forts. He requested the English of Madras to send 20 or 25 such men for the fort of Ginji. Engineers from Goa were employed for building Sindhudurg. Jaisingh complained to the Portuguese that they supplied officers to Shivaji for the manufacture of ammunition. It is now evident that European and Indian experts were employed by the Maratha ruler in his munition-factories. 1. Shivaji, Part III, p. CHAPTER VH The Financial System 1. Introductory remarks Shivaji was not the inheritor but the creator of the Maratha empire that was composed of territories which were before under the rulers of Ahmednagar and Bijapur or the emperors of Delhi and Vijayanagar. Parts of Maharashtra and northern Konkan were annexed by Bijapur in 1636 after Sbahji had surrendered to Shah Jahan the remnants of the Nizam Shahi kingdom. Thereafter Bijapur rulers captured portions of the tottering Vijayanagar empire where ultimately Shahji and his son Vyankoji became the prominent figures. Before the year 1672 the Maratha Swaraj consisted of the portions which belonged to the Nizam Shahi and Bijapur i kings, but after that year Shivaji took morsels of the Mogul and a large part of the defunct Vijayanagar empires. Thus the revenue systems of the four empires were prevalent in the Maratha Swaraj. Each had its own hierarchy of officials, different tenures, varying rates of assessment of land-revenue and other sources of public income. Shivaji was faced with the difficult task of bringing about financial unity out of this diversity, and of either revitalizing the old systems or replacing these by a new one. We will see that he placed the part of a reformer as well as an innovator in the sphere of finance. Land revenue was the main source of the income of the central government in those days. Consequently the attention of every ruler was first drawn to it. The people of central Maharashtra had heavily suffered from the wars between the Nizam Shahi rulers and the Moguls. Large tracts of land were lying desolate. Crime had enormpusly increased. Oppression by officials and grandees bad depressed trade and agriculture. Lands had to be repeopled and brought under cultivation by giving every sort of encouragement,Tb.e first important step taken by Shivaji was to have a survey of the lands, and to assess the taxes and other dues payable by the cultivators. 108 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 2. Three MttltMBtf were made at different times under Dadaji Kond Deva, Moropant Peshwa and Annaji Datto. 1 Each settlement must have been preceded by some kind of survey, though its nature and extent are not specified. Dadaji generally followed the principles of Malik Ambar's assessment in the fully settled territory, but in the case of new villages he granted liberal concessions to the cultivators. The main features of Ambar's system were: (i) the classification of lands according to fertility ; (ii) ascertainment of their produce ; <iii) fixing the government share ; (iv) the collection of rents in kind or money ; and (v) the abolition of the intermediate, collecting agents as farmers of revenue. The rates charged by Kond Deva in the newly settled districts are stated to be one rupee per Bigha in the first year ; Rs. 3 in the second, Rs. 6 in the third ; Rs. 9 in the fourth ; Rs. 10 in the fifth ; Rs. 20 in the sixth ; the same rate as paid by other tenants in the seventh and the rate assessed by Malik Ambar in the eighth year. 9 On these terms the reclamation of lands in the Mavalsand Shivaji's estates in the central Maharashtra, was accomplished. It appears that the rate under Malik Ambar must have been about Rs. 25-30 per Bigha. These rates seem to be incredible. The tax of Rs. 25 per Bigha of the best lands extorted from the tenants must have been very excessive, when at present it is about five rupees. Since the people were familiar with the Rayatwari system and the fixed rates to be paid for various kinds of lands, the old system might have been continued for some years, till it was revised by Moropant. There are no papers available to throw light on the rates fixed by him, hence we have to pass on to the settlement which was undertaken by Annaji Datto in 1678. 3. SttttaBcnt fcy the people - Sabhasad suggests that before the new survey one-half of the produce was claimed by the state. As this demand was found to be oppressive, remissions were granted and a new settlement was introduced. The survey was not to be done by Brahman and Prabhu clerks as they were expected 1. Chitnis. p. 133. *. d. P. S. S . Ill, pp. It, 13, 19, 30, 42. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM log to proceed very slowly. It was entrusted to the Deshmukhs, Ptshkulkarais, Mukaddams, and officers in co-operation with the ryots. By eliminating clerks of the revenue department* the work was not only expedited, but the roots of curtuption and oppression were totally destroyed. Reliance was placed upon the highest officers of revenue-collection who were to take the cultivators with them in the arduous operations of the survey. Thus the people, free from official terror and pressure, could have full representation in the survey and assessment. Hence it may be called the People's Settlement. 4. Method of survey: (1) The commissioners were to go from village to village to ascertain the produce of each, measure the lands therein, and record the extent of arable land. (b)They were to divide the lands into three types, hilly, marshy, and the normal with black soil, (c) Each type was to be distributed into plots of the first, second, third and fourth class, (d) After carefully ascertaining the yield of each crop, field by field, the total estimate of the crops of each village was to be made. For this purpose both the autumnal and vernal crops and the variety of the stuffs produced therein were to be considered, (e) A comparison was to be instituted between the estimated produce and that current according to Malik Ambar's settlement in each village, (f) Further, the surveyors were to give an estimate of the probable increase in the produce if more labour and capital were applied to the tract. 5. A new measuring rod for survey: Sabhasad has recorded the general practice of surveying all provinces for purposes of revenue-settlement. Annaji adopted the new standard of a measuring rod which was eighty tansiis or five cubits and five fists long-a cubit was equal to 14 fansus and a fist equal to two tansits. Twenty rods square made one Bigba. One hundred and twenty Bighas made a chavar. 1 All villages were measured and surveyed by this new standard, and their area was recorded in chavars. * 1. A chaw consisted of Pads ( qjf \ and Biswas, but in another letter it is divided into Bigbas. Sh. Ch. S. VII, pp. 78, 107. 2. Sen, Sb. Chb,, pp. 36-37. T10 SHIVAJI THE G&EAT' The measurement by a rope was liable to abuse, while the 'Muslim method of* using a jarib or an iron chain was costly. Thus a cheap and reliable unit of measurement was introduced. 6. Introduction of the Rayatwari system: The share of, the government was two-fifths of the gross produce to be taken direct from the ryot. " In every village, from each individual ryot, the karkun should according to the assessment, realize the rent ingrains from the crops at the time of harvest." 1 The Zamindari system was replaced by the Rayatwari. The ryots enjoyed freedom from extortion by officials, and had facility to pay the revenue in the form of grain at the harvest time. Though the share of the government, being 2/5, was high, yet it was lower than what was exacted before. Al$J>ar first took one-third of the average produce, and eventually one-half. In the reign of Aurangzeb 50 per cent of the gross produce was the general standard. Thus the Maratha ruler gave relief, security, prosperity and happiness to the rack-rented peasantry in the Swaraj. 7. Classification of lands (a) Arable lands were distinguished from uncultivable areas. These were divided into three kinds, and each kind of land was subdivided into four classes, (h) There was a further distinction between Jtrayat and Bagayat lands, i. e., those meant for ordinary crops and for fruit gardens, (c) Then another classification was on the basis of irrigation ; unirrigated lands, tracts irrigated with canal water ( Patsthal ) and with well-water (motsthal). 2 (d) A further sub-division was made from the view-point of the kind of crops raised. Each major and minor crop was to be estimated. 8. Basis of Assessment The old unit of assessment was the plough. In this system an enquiry into the yield of crops was not necessary. The cultivator was assessed on the basis of the ploughs 1. Sen, Sh. Chh., pp. 36-37. , - ' 2. If the latter class of lands were cultivated with .such costly crops as sugar-cane, plantains, ginger, termeric, they bad to pay rent of 3 and 2 Hons per bigha for being watered by canals and wells respectively, but for the vegetable crops less tax was levfcd, Sb. Ch. S. VII, p. 115: Rajwade, Vol. XV. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM ill he worked with irrespective of the quality of the land and the crop he raised on it. Even Aurangzeb did not abolish this' system of plough-assessment in 1652, but kept it on for backward tracts. He introduced the sharing system and also that of cash-payments after measurement of good and middling lands. In the Maratha survey uncultivabje waste lands were excluded from assessment. The people were, however, encouraged to bring them under cultivation. Such lands remained exempt from taxes for some time, but were ultimately subjected to a light assessment. Jervis remarks that dongar or hilly lands were assessed on the nangar or plough basis. He gives the following scale of taxes ! : Nachni at 3? maunds and 3 maunds. Wari at 3 maunds and 2\ maunds. Hank at 3 maunds. Other inferior produce at li maunds. (4) We find that Shivaji introduced both the differential method of sharing the crops and of charging cash-rates on the estimated produce of cultivated lands. The preceding statements regarding survey are fully confirmed by Major Jervis. Says he, " It is commonly believed indeed, that be ( Shivaji ) measured and classified all the lands, and then ascertained the amount of their produce from one or two villages in each Muhal of the Ouchitgurh, Rajpooree, Rygurh, Soowurndroog, Unjunvel, Rutnagiri and Veejydroog districts, for three successive years, from which data he established the rates, half in kind, -half at a fixed commutation rate differing in each Talooka, to be paid by the beegah of each sort of land. The classification of the rice lands, mule or dhernp, under 12 heads; the four first still retaining their former well-known distinctions." * The twelve sorts of rice lands were assessed at 12i maunds per bigha for the best land and 5 maunds for the worst. The second crops on first class lands were assessed at different rates, such as, turmeric and hemp at 5 maunds per bigha and 1-2, Jervis, Geog, mod Statistical Memoir, in the Konkun, pp. 94-97* 112 . SmvAji THE GREAT -sugarcane at 64 to 3t maunds of jagaree per bigha. Thus the rates differed with crops and the quality of lands. For the first time an attempt was made to have a scientific survey of all lands in every village of the Swaraj. Though the work must have remained unaccomplished, the adoption of such a scheme was highly creditable to Annaji Datto. He lightened the burden of the cultivators and yet increased the income of the state by carefully fixing the crop-share and cash rents to be given by them. The crucial problem of collecting the revenue remained to be tackled. The general practice of those days was to collect it through farmers, and not by state-officials directly. 9. Prevalence of the farming system Sabhasad has briefly described the old system of farming revenue and the evils accruing from it in these words : " In the Adilshahi, Nizam-Shahi and Mogul territories conquered by Shivaji, the ryots used to be under the Patils, Kulkarnis and Deshmukhs. They used to collect the revenue and pay an unspecified sum to the state. For instance, for a village yielding 2,000 Hons as revenue, the Mirasdars used to pay only 200 or 300 Hons to government. Therefore these Mirasdars grew wealthy arid powerful by building bastions, castles, and strong-holds and enlisting troops. They did not care to wait upon the revenue officers, rather they used to resist them whenever more revenue was demanded from them. They grew unruly, and forcibly misappropriated the lands." Ramchandra Pant too has strongly condemned the Watandari system. " They fortify their places, rob travellers, loot territories and fight desperately. They make peace with a foreign invader with a desire to protect their Watans and help him in every possible manner/' These statements are buttressed by contemporary evidence from the Dutch records on the oppressive and deplorable system of the Bijapur government. "The governors represent and replace the lords in towns, villages and hamlets. Thjs office of governor is often let on lease S. 14. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM H3 by the lords for want of money, because they have no capital*. This system does not work well, as it gives rise to abuses, extortion and grinding down of the population* The King favours a lord by means of firmans with large territories of which the revenue is reserved for him in exchange for some services. His office is not an hereditary one, but a mere favour on the part of the King. Some lords practically conduct themselves as if they were independent." " Each takes the appearance of being a king, and after having committed divers crimes by robbing, murdering, burning and devastating the land to their hearts' content, they appear at court, where they are praised for being brave soldiers, if they know how to oil His Majesty's palm. This practice is daily increasing more and more and has taken so very deep a root that the king ( who is simply adorned with the crown ) is unable to prevent this, for if he deprives some Lords of their dignities, they instantly take refuge with Shivaji, Bahlol Khan or some other of the afore-mentioned subjects, by whom they are at once favoured with some dignities." In Golconda the oppressions on the peasants were no less destructive of prosperity and humanity. According to William Methwold ' the government is farmed immediately from the King by some eminent man, who to other inferiors farmeth out the lesser ones, and they again to the country-people, at such excessive rates that it is most lamentable to consider what toil and misery the wretched souls endure. For if they fall short of any part of their rent, what their estates cannot satisfy, their bodies must, so it sometimes happens they are beaten to death, or, absenting themselves, their wives, children, fathers, brothers, and all their kindred are engaged in the debt, and must satisfy or suffer. And sometimes it so happens that the Principal, failing with the King* receives from him the like punishment, as it befell to one Basbell Raw ( Governor at Masulipatam since the English traded thither) r who, for defect of full payment, was beaten with canes upon the back, feet, and belly, until he died. Yet hold they not these their governments by lease, for yearly in July all are exposed- in sale unto him that bids most ; from wherfce it happeneth that every 114 SHIVAJI THE GREAT Governor, during his time, exacts by tolls taken in the way and other oppressions whatsoever they can possibly extort from the poorer inhabitants, using what violence within their governments they shall think fit ; for in them, during their time, they reign as petty kings." 1 10. Watans: From ancient times the custom of holding hereditary Watans was prevalent in the Deccan. Hundreds of village officers and high government servants were given lands, rights and privileges for a certain service performed in the past or being performed in the interest of the village or the government. Such grants were kown as Watans. In the villages the Patil, Kulkarni, Mahar, Chougula, Chaudhari, Kamoshi, black-smith, gold-smith, carpenter, washerman, watchman, barber, potter, shoe-maker, tailor, oilman, Joshi, Kazi, Mahajan, etc., were the Watandars, while Desais, Deshmukhs, Deshpandes, Desh-kulkarnis, etc., were the district officers who held hereditary Watans. Grants of rent-free lands or share of the government revenue were given to these. If the rent of a tract of land was given over to a state-servant for the maintenance of troops and forts it was called Fauj Saranjam, but if it was meant for the support of the family or dignity of the grantee, it was known as Jat Saranjam. The holders of both kinds of Inams formed the landed aristocracy enjoying rights, dues and perquisites which gave them power to oppress the ryots on the one hand and to weaken the centra! government on the other. Shivaji deprived the fief-holdiers of their administrative powers. Though he did not confiscate their estates, he discontinued the system, of granting Inam lands or estates, and displaced them by cash payments. His policy has been rightly stated by his minister Ramachandra Pant. " The existing Watans should be continued* but the power of the Watandars over the people should be done away with."* This conciliatory policy was adopted by Shivaji. He demolished all fortified places of the Watandars, or posted his 1. MorcUnd, From Akbar to Aurangzeb. DD. 241*2. 2. Polity, pp. 33-34, , . THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 115 own garrisons in important forts. No administrative authority was left in their hands. He prohibited all that the Watandars used to take at their sweet will, fixed the rates of their dues in cash and grains, and specified the rights and perquisites of the various officers from Kulkarni to Deshmukh according to the yield of the village. 1 Similarly, military officers were given no political power over the tenants. " The Surnaubats, Majumdars, Karkuns and men on the personal staff of the Raja were given assignments on land revenue for their salary. The lands cultivated by them were taxed like those of the ryots, and sum due from them as revenue was deducted from their pay. The balance of their dues was paid from the central treasury or the district establishments. In this manner their annual accounts were punctually settled. Mokasa Mahals or villages with absolute proprietary rights should never be granted to men serving in the army, the militia and the fort establishments. Their payments should be paid by varats or with cash from the treasury. None but the Karkuns should have any authority over the lands. All payments to the military men should be made by the Karkuns. The grant of Mokasa would create unruly peasants. They would grow strong and disobey the revenue regulations. If the ryots grew powerful, there would be disturbances at various places. The Mokasa-holders and the Zamindars would become unruly. Therefore Mokasas should not be granted to anybody." f Shivaji completely abolished the farming system, collected all revenue through the central agency, made effective arrangements to reduce corruption, and provided for the inspection of revenue records by the district and central officials. Having cleaned the Augean stable of all harpies who were eating away the financial vitality of the state, he boldly dealt with the landed aristocracy. Besides granting civil and military Inams, the rulers used to make religious endowments. These were assignments of the whole >r part of revenue of a village or town made by the government for 1-2. Sen, Sb, Chh., 34, 38. 11-6 SHIVAJI THE GREAT religious purposes. Both the Muslim and Hindu rulers showed 2eal for their religion by being liberal in such grants, (l) Temples, mosques, monasteries, hermitages of saints, sacred places where saints were buried, alms-houses where free food was distributed to Sadhus and travellers, and other religious institutions were- granted income from lands or given money from the treasury. 2. Grants were made to Vedic scholars for encouragement of learning. 3. Saints like Ramdas, Keshav, Yaqub, etc, were given lands or money for their expenses. Mauni Baba of Patgaon was given by Shivaji in 1677 an annual donation of provisions sufficient to feed one thousand visitors, 18 hons p. a. for three assistants in 167P, and 125 Hons p. a. in 1680 for a musician and a few palanquin bearers. 4. Physicians were sometimes conferred concessions for their service to the poor. There are six Sanads of Inam lands given to one Brahman physician family by Muslim rulers and then by Shivaji from 1618 onwards. Thus even Muslim rulers used to confer pensions and lands upon Hindu as well as Muslim physicians. Shivaji followed the same practice. ' Ramchandra Pant has most emphatically condemned the grants of lands even for religious purposes. " Therefore a king who wishes to rule a kingdom, to increase it and to acquire fame as one who is skilled in politics, should not at all get infatuated and grant land to he extent of even a barley corn." * Consequently, Shivaji donated cash and not lands to the deserving men. His donations to numerous saints wi illustrate the tendency. 11. The agrarian reforms ( Shiviji can now be summarized as follows : (1) The systems of the sale of offices and of farming revenue i abolished. 1. J>. S. S. Ill, 125, 143-4. 2. Polity, p. 36. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 117 (2) The practice of bestowing Jatfirs was reduced to the minimum and the Zamindari system was displaced by the Ryotwari one. (3) The fief-holders were deprived of all political of revenue power over their tenants. Thus the worst features of the Jagir system were removed* (4) Agriculture was promoted by the system of Tagavi loans and free grants of lands to induce new cultivators and to help the tenants in times of need. Cattle were given to the new ryots who came to settle on the lands. Grain and money for the purchase of seeds and for their maintenance were lent. The sums were realized in two or four years according to the means of the debtor. 1 (5) Remission of rent due to famine, scarcity or destruction of crops by the armies was the usual policy of the Maratha government. This practice was prevalent in the Muslim and Hindu kingdoms. It is not possible to know the extent to which the policy was worked in practice for the relief of the peasants. 1 (6) Waste lands were reclaimed ; new villages and market places were founded; traders, artisans, money-lenders etc., were induced to settle in the Maratha territory. All these people were given concessions, remission of revenue, and certain rights for the security of their property and the development of their industry. Thus tbe state followed the enlightened policy of improving agriculture, trade, and industry. (7) A great encouragement to agriculture was given on account of the growing demand for provisions by the ever- increasing army and navy. (8) The people must have migrated from the Bijapur and Mogul territories as there they were subject to the plundering depredations of the Marathas. Since they could have security, safety and prosperity in the Hindu Swaraj, some must have come over there to escape from the constant horrors of war. 1. Sen, Sh. Chh., p. 37. 2, Sen, Ad. S. M., p. 67. A few Marathi^ettere of Adilshahi regime are published on pp. 37, 38, 61, 63, 65 of P. S. S, III. 118 SHIVAJI THE GREAT (9) Shivaji brought prosperity to the rural areas by employing the people in the army and engaging them for about six months in the year in conquering expeditions. These people must have- become more energetic, enterprising and fearless, Their visits to different parts of India must have widened their outlook with respect to life in general and agriculture in particular. (10) Their perquisites and several Inam rights in the form of cesses and fees were abolished. (11) All dues of the fief-holdiers were to be paid directly by the state and were not to be realized by them directly from the tenants. (12) The plough-unit of assessment was generally displaced by the sharing or cash-payment system. (13) Lands were surveyed by the new unit of the rod and the system of cash-payments was introduced for some crops and certain areas. (14) The share of the government was reduced in comparison to what it was before* (15) Besides remission of revenue Tagkavi loans were advanced by the state to improve agriculture and help the tenants. (16) Assessment was made with the help of the people, so that government interference was reduced to the minimum in estimating the average produce of cultivated lands. (17) Cases arising out of land disputes, money-dealings and criminal assaults were mainly settled by the jury system. Cheap, impartial and prompt justice was meted out to the people. (18) New villages and towns were founded, waste lands were reclaimed, deserted villages were re-peopled. Various kinds of inducements were given to the settlers. (19) Prosperity was brought within the grasp of all the classes of the people by Creating employment for them in the army, navy, forts, civil administration and in the state factories. THE FINANCIAL SYSIEM Mr. Pringle Kennedy has rightly said that ' the peasant knew what he had to pay and he seems to have been able to pay this without any great oppression." ' He is supported by Jervis who remarks that ' in the midst of all this confusion, warfare, and general disloyalty, the state of revenue and population is said to have prospered." Grant Duff too does not support the views of Dr. Fryer and the Muslim writers. " The Mahomedan writers, and one contemporary English traveller, describe his ( Shivaji's ) country as in the worst possible state ; and the former only mention him as a depredator and destroyer ; but those districts taken by him from Heejapoor, winch had been under the management of farmers and direct apents of government, probably experienced great benefit by the change." * Public Revenue 12 Heads of income: Having dealt with the main source of revenue, we proceed to discuss other heads of public income available to the central government during our period. Income from culturable domain lands formed part of the land revenue and therefore does not require any explanation. Other sources of revenue were quite numerous. These have been classified below. 1 . Customs 1 1 . Plunder of hostile territories. 2. Transit duties 12. Escheat 3. Excise 13. Forfeitures 4. Judicial fees and fines for 14. Piracy and capture of ships. criminality 15. Ship-wrecks. 5.

Duff, p. 105. 120 SHIVAJI THE <*EAT 13* The Caitoou levied by the Maratha government at seaports, were quite low* The prevalent rate was 2k per cent On imports and exports, and this was charged from the English who stipulated to pay the usual duties in all places. This is confirmed by Peter Mundy who states that in 1655 the customs duty at Kajapur was 2$ per cent. It appears that the English secured the concession of not paying export duties on their unsold goods, and of duty-free export of provisions, timber and fire-wood. They desired to procure freedom from transit dues on their imports, but if this privilege could not be obtained, they were content to secure the same privileges as to customs and other matters which they enjoyed Under the Bijapur government. These were probably incorporated in the treaty, and granted by Shivaji on the plea of being traditional. 1 Jn their Sanad obtained from Shivaji the English were careful to insert one clause which shows that customs officers used to harass merchants for exacting money and presents from them. Dr. Fryer bitterly complains of the dishonesty and grabbing: spirit of the customs officers of the Maratha kingdom. "They are neither for public good or common honesty, but their own private interest only: They refuse no base offices for their own commodity, inviting merchants to come and trade among them, and then rob them, or else turmoil them on account of customs; always in a corner getting more for themselves than their Master, yet openly must seem mighty zealous for their Master's dues; so that trade is unlikely to settle where he bath anything to do not with standing his country lies all along on the sea-shore, and no goods can be transported without his permission; unless they go a great way about, as we are forced to do." 8 European travellers like Sir Thomas Roe, Bernier, Manucci and others have frequently complained of the exlortions, bribes, villany and harrassing treatment of the customs officers at Surat and other places . The contemporary documents* are full of complaints regarding delay in clearing goods or^over-valuatio" n 1-2. Shiraji, Part III, ppT. 37-39 41, 45. S. 15 THE FINANCIAL SYSIEM Shivaji had an efficient system of espionage. He had spies and news-writers in every important centre to inform him of all that was happening m the administration. Then there was a strict system of supervision, and his officers used to get decent salaries. If in spite of all these precautions, there was so much corruption as has been depicted by Dr. Fryer, it must be attributed to the method of farming customs. As the fixing of the prices of goods depended upon the customs officers who were the reunions of a farmer to whom the customs were let on contract, exactions and harassment were natural in this system. There was probably a Daiogha-customs Superintendent on behalf of the government to settle the disputes in every important port. If Shivaji followed the Mogul practice of farming the customs of each port, the corruption of the officers can be easily understood. 1 Moreland has thus summed up his conclusions on the taxation system of Akbar. " But in actual practice, the 2j per cent ad valorem tax on goods levied by Akbar was a more crushing tariff than any tariff that is levied to-day in any civilized country. Uncertainty of taxes ; the wide range of taxes; the insatiable greed of official?; the frequency of taxes levied by powerful individuals on their own account ; the multiplicity of taxes ; and the weak protection of life and property on the King's highways and in the King's Courts ; all these were bound to kill all enterprise And initiative in trade/ 1 14. Transit duty known as Rahdari or Zakat in Marat hi, was a small tax on goods and animals passing from one place to another, but it grew to be a very burdensome and an oppressive levy on account of the search oi persons and packages and the presents demanded by the officers. Hundreds of English and Dutch documents condemn this universal practice. The Europeans tried to secure exemption from the payment of transit dues in the territory wherein they had commercial dealings, but Indians had no escape from them, 1. The values of goods imported and exported by the English wefe kto be fixed at every custom bouse by favourable merchants. If this was the .general practice* it must bare given much relief to all (fee merchants. 122 SHIVAJI THE GREAT > The famous Muslim historian Khafi Khan writes that " the Kahdari was condemned by righteous and just men as a most vexatious impost, and oppressive to travellers. Through the villany and oppression of the toll-collectors and the Zamindars, the property, the honour, and the lives of travellers and peaceful -wayfarers were frittered away." We have no evidence to show how far the evils of this oppressive levy were mitigated in the Maratha Swaraj. 1 15. Excise Ditier- It has already been shown that Shivaji was deadly opposed to the use of intoxicants by his soldiers and officers, but there is no evidence available to prove that the common people were prohibited from using liquors. The Peshwas later on followed the prohibitory policy. The sale of liquor like its manufacture, must have been taxed. When there were taxes on ordinary shop-keepers, liquor-sellers could not be exempted from them. We have no evidence on the control of the sale of intoxicants like opium, Bhang, Ganja, Charas, etc. The income from excise duty must have been a small one. The rate of a tax on liquor shops in the town of Athni is given 2 in a Marathi document. 16. Judicial fees: The winning party had to pay Harki and the losing party paid Gunehgari or crime fine. In adultery cases contributions, fines, harkis, etc., used to be taken by the government. Then Harki and Shela were imposed by the government for the penance prescribed by the Ecclesiastical Department. The amount of these presents and fines charged in various cases can be partially known from the study of documents. In civil cases the government used to take about 25% of the sum in dispute during the Peshwa period, but no information is available for the regime of Shivaji. 8 1.

Similarly, some income must have been realized from pasture-lands paying Vancharai cess on the grazing of cattle. 18. The profits of mintage could not have been large, since the right was given to rich goldsmiths by taking a royalty. The royal mint which seems to have been established after the coronation,, must have increased the income from this source. 19. The sale of offices was a very common practice in Muslim kingdoms. Large sums were paid by the new occupants to squeeze merchants, peasants and people in general to their hearts' content in the shortest passible time, so that when they were replaced by others, they should have sufficiently enriched themselves. In 1616 one man had to pay 800 Hons as a present for securing the Patilship -of a village. 1 1200 Hons were given for the same village in 1643.* Two years' revenue was given as a present 3 in another case. Shivaji did not generally follow this practice. 21. The presents given by the English, the officers and the people to Shivaji at his coronation, by the Europeans in his Karnatic expedition, by the ruler of Golconda at interviews with him, need mention here as examples. 21. Contribntions and tributes by states The Bijapur and Golconda kingdoms used to pay him annual tribute and contributions, as well as special subsidies for carrying on war against the Moguls. He obtained tribute from the rulers of Sunda and Madura for some years. The Golconda subsidy of 3,000 Hons a day for the Karnatic war, is quite well-known. The annual tribute of one lakh Hons paid by Golconda 4 from 1677, is worth mentioning. Shivaji demanded from the Portuguese ' his tribute of choutry ( chauth ) or the fourth part of the revenue of their country.' This was not the chauth for Daman, but for the whole country under the Portuguese rule.* 1-3. P. S. S. Ill, 12, 30, 41. 4. Sarkar, Shiraji, pp. 289, 295. 5.

Booty in wir The enormous plunder obtained By the Mafrathas in the wars with Afzal Khan, Kustum Xaman, Shaista Khan, Bahadur Khan and several Bijapur generals is now well-known to the reader. 23. Plunder ind ransom The sacks of Kajapur, Surat, Ratbag, Hubli, the Portuguese territory, Shahpur-the richest suburb of Bijapur, Dharangaon, Chhapra, Ahmednagar, are the most famous events in the political career of Shivaji. He plundered the Karnatic so thoroughly that it was ' peeled to the bones ' by his system of * organized pillage. 1 The capture of the treasures led by Baji Ghorpade and the loot of Shaista's camp form romances by themselves. Large sums of money were often secured as ransom for releasing the prisoners of war. Then gifts were usually received from the people of the newly conquered parts. 24. Escheat: The principle that the state is the proprietor of all the property to which individual claims are lost, has been prevalent in all countries. The Hindu law recognizes it, though it was very much limited on account of the extremely liberal laws of succession and adoption in case of intestate death of issueless persons. The Mogul Emperor was the heir to the property of all his subjects even in cases where the progeny of the deceased existed. Here is the evidence of Bernier. " The courtiers are often not even descendants of Omrahs, because, the King being heir of all their possessions, no family can long maintain its distinction, but, after the Omrah's death, is soon extinguished, and the sons, or at least the grandsons, reduced generally, we might almost say, to beggary, and compelled to enlist as mere troopers in the cavalry of some Omrah. The Omrahs, therefore, mostly consist of adventurers from different nations who entice one another to the court ; and arc generally persons of low descent, some having been originally slaves, and the majority being destitute of education. The Mogol raises them to dignities, or degrades them to obscurity, according to his own pleasure and caprice." * 1. Travels, p. 211. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 125 Shivaji was very liberal in granting concessions to the people in the matter of escheat. We have a few letters on the settlement of new markets and towns. The merchants are given the right to dispose of the property in cases of issueless persons according to the award of the traders' Panchayat. 1 Even a Brahman Jyotishi in case of being issueless is given in 1659 the right of disposing of his hereditary rights and property according to the wishes of his family. 2 Another sanad of 16S5 confers the full and complete right of enjoying the property of the grantee in case of dying issueless to hi^ relatives, the o\en,mrnt having no claim to it. 3 By renouncing his claim to escheats, Shivaji encouraged trade and secured contentment among his subjects. 25. Forfeitures of Watans and Inams ( Watan zapti ) were usual for disloyalty to the throne. Shivaji in curtailing the powers of the feudal lords, might have forfeited some Inams, but he followed a conciliatory policy to win over the old aristocrats to his cause. All orders of confiscation and restoration of property were written by the Private Secretary of the Raja. A present ( Nazar ) was usually offered by the adopted and even perhaps by the natural sons on succession. This worked as a succession duty. At the time of the grant of new watans or of the confirmation of an old watan, Harki or Sherni were charged by the government. 4 26. Piracy and deliberate capture of ships Shivaji's exploits m capturing the Pilgrim vessels of the Moguls and the Portuguese ships have already been described. The depredations of the Maratha fleet on the enemy coast were constantly going on. The English in their treaty with Shivaji made a special stipulation to the effect that their goods laden on ships belonging to other Europeans or the Indian people would be restored to them and that they too would restore the goods belonging to Shivaji or his subjects if laden on any ship captured by them.* 1-3. Sh. Ch. S., II, 304, 345, 370, 374, 384, 386; cf. P. S. S. Ill, p, 3. 4. Sanads and Letters by M. and Parasnis, p. 128. 5. Sbivaji, Part III, p. 24, 40. 126 SHIVAJI THE GREAT 27. Shipwrecks The English took special pains in persuading the ministers of Shivaji to restore the ships wrecked or cast by storm on the shores of the Maratha kingdom. The ministers rightly argued that the French, the Dutch and other merchants would have to be granted the same privilege. This could not be granted as " it was positively against the laws and constitutions that had been handed down to them from the Nizamshahi kingdom and by which they were then governed." ' 28. Treasure- trove, fisheries and mines: The right to hidden treasure has always been claimed by the state in India from time immemorial. In a letter of 1737 many traditional dues of the government are mentioned. Income from forests, fisheries, mines and treasure-trove are among the list. 9 29. Monopolies: In the Mogul Empire the Emperor and Governors used to have monopolies of various kinds in their own hands or in those of their favourites. Shaista Khan monopolized the bazaar that followed his own camp in the Deccan wars. 3 SO. Maritime trade: The Marathi documents of the period do not throw any light on the point, nor do the Europeans refer to any monopolies enjoyed by Shivaji. Even in 1665 the English records inform us that Shiva had possession of 8 or 9 ports on the sea shore and " from every port he used to send two or three or more trading vessels to Persia, Basra, Mocha, etc." Thus in 1665 from twenty to thirty ships were engaged in the foreign trade. Their number must have increased with the wealth, power and prestige ot the Raja. Even his officers sent ships to Persia and Arabia on their own behalf. The government must have levied fees for the entry and stay of ships and boats in the waters and ports under its sovereignty. This income must have increased with, the extension of the kingdom and the growth of the coastal as well as sea-borne trades. 1. Shivaji, Part III, p. 24. 2. Sh. Ch. S., II, p. 304. 3. English Records, I, p. 9 1 . THE FINANCIAL" SYSTEM 127 Tfct Chaith 31. Orifin of Chantb A detailed history of the Chauth and of Shivaji's demand for the same from the Portuguese have already been discussed. 1 It is interesting to note that even Aurangzeb liad claimed Chauth in 1639 from the people of Daman. He lived at Daulatabad as Viceroy of the Deccan for more than three years, and yet the Portuguese did not offer any present to him. The Moguls had conquered the principality of Baglan and all the district round Daman. Thereupon the prince deputed Mir Murad with 5,000 horse and as many foot to chastise the Portuguese by laying siege to Daman. Aurangzeb asked the Dutch to blockade the town from the sea. He promised to gratify them with 200,000 rupees in ready money, * the quarter part of the provenne -of the whole country ' and customs of the goods imported and exported by them, 8 but the Dutch did not give that help. The Moguls could not reduce the place even after a close siege of five months and then they were afraid of reprisals by the Portuguese on their merchant shipping. But the people of Daman were much harassed by the war, and hence they hastened to make peace with the Mogul commander. " The Portugal inhabitants of Daman had obliged themselves to pay the Prince the same rent they were accustomed to give the Raja of that country, viz., 60,000 Muhmudis said to be the quarter part of the provenue of that land"* Thus Aurangzeb got the right of collecting the Chauth which is wrongly called rent in the preceding letter. It was this very right which Shivaji claimed when he conquered the Ramnagar territory and put an nd to the Mogul sovereignty in the Konkan. 32. Nature of Chauth Before and during the time of Shivaji, Chauth was a contribution exacted by a strong prince from the people of a state to give immunity from his raids. As the Raja of Ramnagar was collecting Chauth from some villages of Daman and Bassein, for giving immunity to their 1. Shivaji, Part III, pp. 524-531. 2. O. C. 1658, 15th January 1639; O.

Shivaji, after capturing the territory of Kamnagar in 1672, claimed this Chauth from the Portuguese who were the rulers of Daman and Bassein. He adopted and extended this system with the twofold object of mitigating the evil consequences of war and of securing a regular source of revenue for the maintenance of his army. Thus he gave an opportunity to the subjects of hostile countries to pay an annual contribution for buying off immunity from the raids of the Maratha forces and thereby escape from loot, arson, fire, massacre and other horrors of war. According to Manucci Shivaji had obtained a grant of Chauth in the Mogul Deccan as early as 1658. " He sent Shivaji presents, together with a golden tablet, by which he granted to him the collection of a fourth part of the revenues of some provinces in the Deccan province, then held by Aurangzeb. This grant was to be perpetual ; all the same, the time came when he broke his word according to his habit." It appears that Shivaji used to collect this chauth irom some parts of the Mogul territories, because during the rebellion of Shah Alam he promised not to realize any more of the revenue than what was conceded to him by Aurangzeb. ' It is certain that Shivaji had knowledge of the Chauth contribution before 1664, because he demanded it from Aurangzeb to save Surat from his raids in that year. Soon after the first loot of this richest port, Shivaii threatened to rape it once more unless the king would give him peaceably " the fourths of what he receives of the town and country yearly which is too dishonourable for the king to accept." The Great Mogul not only discarded this presumptuous demand, but sent another big army under the able generalship of Raja Jaisingh to crush this dreadful raider. The latter bided his time, till in 1670 he was able to re-plunder Surat. On his departure he sent a letter a to the officers and chief merchants demanding twelve lacs of rupees as an annual tribute 1. Manned, I, 247 ; II, 25, 165. 2. ShiTaji, Part II, pp. 29?., 323, 326, 345. S. 16 THfe FltfAHCtAL &YS1EM tram them, and confidently assured them of his return if they ttii Mot ptjr the same to him. It is now evident that the tribute demanded from the authorities of Surat in 1664 and 1670 was no other than Chauth. The sum claimed in different years as ' Chauth ' varied considerably. In 1670 it was 12 lakhs ; and two years later, it was reduced to 3 lakhs annually, so that nine lakhs were demanded by Moro Pant as 4 Chauth * for the past three years. ' In 1672 after a successful invasion of Ramnagar, Moro Pant Advanced towards Surat and once more " demanded the Chouthy or ith part of the king's revenues under this government which amounts to four lakhs." The same news is conveyed by the Surat Factors to Bombay with an additional information for showing the cause of collecting the contribution. Shivaji declared that " as their king ( Aurangzeb ) had forced him to keep an army for the defence of his people and country, so that army must be paid and if they sent him not the money speedily, he bid them make ready a large house for him."* There are several evidences available from the English records that Shivaji gave immunity from plunder to all those places which Agreed to pay him the Chauth. During his plundering expedition in the Berars and Khandesh in 1670, he refrained from looting towns and villages near Karanja and Nandurbar as these gave him writings for payment of Chauth of the revenues thereof. 9 Kolhapur and Saagaon redeemed themselves from the fury of the Maratha forces by paying presents in 1675. The Governor of Hubli made peace with Shivaji by paying him ith part of the revenues of the Hubli Vilayat in 1678. A few months after, the Governor of Karwar gave a present to the Maratba Subedar, otherwise the latter would have burnt and ransacked the town. 4 Finally, thert is the most irrefutable testimoriy of the Chhapra letter 'dated 24th February 1680 that the Maratha > }.

' Thus the demand for 1th part of the revenue of Surat was first made by Sbivaji in 1664 and renewed in 1670. In this year it was actually imposed for the first time on the territory immediately subject to the Moguls and was extended to the various districts which were liable to Maratha excursions. S3. WroBf notions refardiof Chaotb ' The first pretension of Shivaji was to levy from the Rayats as Sar Deshmukhi, ten rupees for every hundred levied by the Government. This was afterwards followed by a demand of the fourth of the collections, which at length was yielded by the Moghuls. The fourth thus acquired is called by the Marathas the Chauth: it was immediately divided by the prince with his ministers and Sardars.' * This view of Elphinstone is erroneous with regard to facts and Chronology. The name ' Chauth ' was not given by the Marathas, but as shown previously, was extant long before their rise to power. Shivaji did not divide the Chauth income with his ministers and Sardars. This practice began with Rajaram. The Mogul Emperor Aurangzeh never consented to pay Chauth to Shivaji, but it was his successor who conceded the grant to Shahu. Then there is no evidence to show that Shivaji forcibly collected Sardeshmukhi previous to his demand for Chauth in 1664* The history of Chauth given by the late Justice Ranade in the * Rise of the Maratha Power ' is also not based on facts. He writes that in 1668 the Bijapur Adilshahi kings agreed to pay three lakhs of rupees on account of Chauth and Sardeshmuki and the Golconda ruler agreed to pay five lakhs about the same time* The Bakhafs use the word ' Khandani,' subsidy or tribute. There is no mention of either Chauth or Sardeshmukhi at this time. Similarly, he says that both these levies were exacted from the Mogul province of Khandesh in 1671, the Portuguese possessions 1. Shivaji, III, p. 212. 2. Elpbinttone, Report on the Territories conquered from tbc Peshwa* pp. 284-3. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM I3t in the Konkan in 1674, and in the Karnatic in 1676. Shivajt levied Chauth but not Sardeshmukhi from these territories. ' J Dr. Sen has rightly observed that the Chauth paid to Ramnagar was not a tribute, but a pension, and the ' Chauthia ' Raja was a vassal of the Portuguese. It was a subsidy like the one which the Indian Government has been paying to the tribes for keeping peace and order on the frontier. Shivaji merely got the idea from this practice, but he gave it a different connotation and used it on an extensive scale. He made it an impost, collected it at the point of the sword, extended it to all those places which were to be plundered and thus afforded an opportunity to the people to buy off immunity from his raids by the payment of the Chauth. Hence this levy assumed a new form and, in time, became an essential part of the Maratha financial system. For this reason Shivaji can be called the originator and organizer of the Chauth system. Moreover, this contribution had no features common to tho subsidiary system introduced by the British in India, because this was generally levied by force ; it was not a voluntary payment in return for military protection. This was collected from the people directly and against the will and order of the rulers, while the contribution under the subsidiary system was made to the British under an agreement with the ruler himself. The suzerain was 1x>und to defend the ruler from internal disorder and external aggression. Under the system of Chauth Shivaji only undertook not to raid the territory himself. Further, there was no binding on v the ruler not to enter into correspondence or alliance with other rulers-indigenous or foreign. Lastly, there was no stipulation by the rulers not to employ foreigners in their civil or military service. 1 It is evident that no similarity exists between the Chauth and the subsidiary system. Lastiy, it may be pointed out that in theory Chauth was not a claim for one-fourth of the land revenue but ' of all the incomes/ is clear from the three examples of Surat, Hubli and Nandurbar before. From the Portuguese too he demanded fourth part of 13? SHIVAJI THE GREAT Hie revenue of their country in 1674, while four years later, 1m ransacked the whole territory from Aurangabad to Surat and levied Chauth ' of all the incomes.' ' In practice it would have been impossible to estimate the total 'incomes of villages and towns within the short time of a lightning raid. Therefore the Maratha officers had to be satisfied with whatever they could extort from the people. 34. Economic collapse of the Moral Eaipire-While the forcible levy of Chauth by the Maratbas enriched Shivaji and his subjects, it soon brought about the economic bankruptcy of the Mogul Empire. Surat, though defended by a wall and well-fortified in 1669, was plundered second time as the Chauth was not paid. From that year onwards the Maratbas were often threatening the town, because they did not receive the contribution. These raids destroyed the trade and prosperity of the richest port, and created a sense of insecurity among the people. The rich and the poor left for the growing city of Bombay, and Surat began to decline. The territories of Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Khandesh and Berars wei;e often pillaged, burnt and destroyed by the Marathas. Trade, industry and agriculture were dislocated. The people were reduced to abject poverty and the government to financial bankruptcy by a sharp decline in revenue. The fall in the income of the Deccan Subas and the continuous wars against Shivaji compelled Aurangzeb to increase the tbufden of taxes on his subjects and to revive the levy of the poll-tax or Jazia on the Hindus* The economic and political consequences to the decline of the Mogul Empire are thus directly to the system of Chauth. IS. StttohMtt kcrtdiUry Kico: We learn from a document 9 containing the judicial order of Shivaji himself that M^vlangkar bo given the right of collecting from the districts of Prabhavali gq$ Dabhd. As *. skirfcji, fan, Ppu so, is*. THE FINANCIAL SYSTIM 133 right had been, enjoyed for generations by that family, it w*ft evidently a very ancient one. From the Sardesai Family History ( Part I, p. 43 ) it appears that one Krishnaji Narsingh who, was a contemporary of the Shilahar King Vijayaditya of Kolhapur < 1142-1154 A. D. ), obtained the Deshmukhi and Sardeshmukhi of seventy villages. Thus the system of giving grants for Sardeshmukhi can be traced to the 12th century A. D. Besides the Mavlangkars, Khem Savant was Sardesai of Kudal as is evident from a document of the year 1635-36. A generation later in 1659, a treaty was made between Shivaji and Lakham Savant Sardesai Bahadur. 1 But the hereditary title and office were not limited to the Konkan as is asserted by the late distinguished historian C. V. Vaidya. He was sure that there were no Sardeshmukhs in Maharashtra before or in Shivaji's time, but this statement is contradicted by the following evidence. 36. Sirdethmukhi in Maharashtra (i) One Deshmukh of Kanadkhore was given Inam of Sardeshmukhi of Anturli village by Dadaji Kond Deva, the Subedar of Kondana, in 1645.'

( viii ) From a letter of 1642, it appears that Sardeshmukhi had been prevalent in the Poona district for several generations. Exemption from the cess of Sardeshmukhi along with other cesses was given to the grantee in Jejuri. 1 There is a mention of another traditional grant of Sardeshmukhi in letters of 1696 and 1712 A. D, in the district of Supa.* ( ix ) In the grants to the Gosavi of Margaon in the district of Poona exemption from several cesses then current in the Deccan and especially in that district, has been given. Among the cesses one for Sardeshmukhi was fully recognized in Maharashtra. 4 ( x ) Another arbitration was held in 1652 at Khanapur in the Mamla of Walwa, Among the numerous officers one Sardesai was also present.* ( xi ) We read of Sardesai 's shares in the two documents of 1685, giving various cesses in that year. 6 ( xii ) Shivaji himself conferred the Sardeshmukhi of Dabhol on Balaji Avaji. 7 The Bijapur Sultan issued an order to the Deshmukh of Thana Mudhol in 1670- There was a Desai in Athni in 16589 Desai of Wai, Shirwal and of Karad in 1642, Kanhoji Jedhe Desai of Fort Rohida in 1638 and Kedarji Khopade Desai of Turf Bhor in 1648, and Desai of Kharepatan 8 in 1658.

It is, therefore, evident that the title Desai was also known as Deshmukh, and Sardesai was synonymous with Sardeshmukh even under the Adilshahi and Mogul regimes. These officials were not limited to Sawantwadi or -even to the other parts of the Konkan, but were found in several parts of Maharashtra. Sardeshmukbs were common in the Konkan, the Mawals, Poona, Bankapur, Dharwar, etc., under the Bijapur government and even in the Mogul provinces. Desai officers functioned in such parts of the Karnatic as Terdal, Mudhol* Manglage, Athni, Torga), Tawargiri, etc., Similarly, Deshmukhs flourished also in Khandesh and the Berars, but Sardeshmukbs were not so common. 37. Sirdeshmktii a cess - It should be borne in mind that Sardeshmukhi was not one-tenth part of the land-revenue, but it was only a cess like so many other cesses to be paid by the cultivator over and above the land revenue. In a grant by Shahji Raje dated 1625 the Sardeshmukbi cess (<H^UJJ<w^t) is counted along with the cesses given to goldsmiths, payposhi, etc. There is an important grant of 1671 endorsed by the Sardeshmukh of Poona as representative of Shivaji himself wherein the contribution given to the Sardeshmukh is insignificant, being only 4| out of 532 Takas. Similarly, in the revenue account of village Khore in the district of Poona the Sardeshmukhi cess is mentioned as four out of 500 Takas. 1 This nature of Sardeshmukhi is shown by several other grants. The Deshmukh's rights were many and quite different from those of Sardeshmukbs. The claim of -rVth part of the land-revenue as Sardeshmukhi must have been started, if at all, by Shivaji in the latter part of his regime. It can bfe definitely said that even in Shivaji's time and before him Sardeshmukhi was only a cess. Now it should be noted in passing that Shivaji had demanded the Desbmukhi and not Sardeshmukhi of Junnar and Ahmednagar 1. , Sb. Ch, & VII, pp. 14, 90, 112. 136 SHttAJt T*B GltEA* from Princ^ Muradbux in 1649. though he was feittftte* Sftrikestotokhi as he had himself made several Deshmukhs were well-known throughout Maharashtra hence there wad nothing novel in the request of Shivaji for being granted Deshmukhi of the two districts. There is no mention of Sardeshmukhi here. Moreover, it was a small cess, not wortk having. Deshmukhi alone gave him substantial rights of collecting land-revenue. 18. Concluding remarks. The study of numerous documents leads us to the following conclusions: (1) Shivaji was not the originator of the Sardeshmukhi tax which afterwards came to mean one-tenth of the Jand-revenue. (2) Sardeshmukhi was only a small cess and it existed long before the days of Shivaji. In fact, it is traceable to the twelfth century A. D* (3) It was not limited to the Konkan f but was found in the- Karnatic and Maharashtra. (4) The Bijapur rulers, Aurangzeb and Shivaji himself conferred or confirmed the Sardeshmukhi right during the forty years of 1640-80 A. D. (5) AH writers like Duff, Elphinstone, Ranade and a host of others who attribute the origin or the collection of Sardeshmukhi to Shiva, are incorrect. Supplementary Sources 39. Cestes or Abwab* In addition to the main sources of revenue there were many 'minor taxes levied from the people of villages and towns* There were known as Swat Jama or supplementary collections. We will call them cesses, though some of them are taxes, fees, fines and even loans. A few of these were surtaxes for imperial purposes, but many cases provided funds for local objects* It is difficult to distribute the I, P. S. S, Doc, 575, 1 Sh. Ch. S. VII, 90, U2,c S. If SYSTEU latter into urban an* mat beads of income, because some of fheafr were collected in both the areas, while regarding others we do 0t possess definite information. A rough classification is proposed in this section* 4t. Imperial iaeeve consisted of surtaxes charged by the government as Meeraspatti* Inantpatti. Duhuhpatti, Hahar Mahili, Hakpatti on the incomes of the persons named in each case. ' Dr. Sen has explained Meeraspatti as an additional tax levied once in three years on Meerasdars; Inampatti as an emergency tax on Inamdars ; Duhukpatti as a special tax on Deshmukhs or Deshpandes ; Mahar Mahili as a tax on hoidi&g Inams, and Hakpatti as one fourth of the fees levied every year* Besides these, the following cesses might have been collected for imperial use. ( i ) Hutnayun Patti is explained by Dr. Sen as a tax levied for celebrating the royal birthday. 9 ( ii ) Marriage 3 cess known as Lagnapati and Patpati ( mz tret ) in Marathi was much prevalent from ancient times. It was continued like many other cesses by Shivaji and his successors* It was levied even during the reigns of Akbar and Aurangzeb. ( iii ) A tax on documents 4 ( <h4IcT| <TCT ) was collected probably for central purposes. ( iv ) Jangampattt-A tax on the Shaiva Lingayats was levied by the Vijayanagar monarchs and might have been continued by the Maratha rulers. In the grants of 1646 and 1647 given by Shivaji himself this cess is mentioned. ( v ) Jang pan ( ^fi q^ft ) by its meaning seems to be a war cess, but Mohimpatti or expedition cess is separately stated. Therefore this cess might have been collected for defensive wars. ( vi ) Mchim* patti was levied to meet the expenses of special expeditions for defensive or offensive purposes. 1. Sb. Ch. S. Ill, 140. 146, 148, 151, 153, 164; Sen, Ad. S, 11. O. 306. 3-4.

Shiva, imposed this tax on the villages in the district of Belgaum to build 360 forts there. ( viii ) Nazar or succession duty was paid by Inamdars and government servants. 41* Town levies were probably the following. Shete Mahajan was an officer of Market towns as the Patil was in a village. He had his Watan or hereditary rights and perquisites. For instance, he had the right to take at stated periods fixed portions of each and every article sold in the market. Thus the government did not pay him much. The citizens paid for the maintenance of their leader, and he, in return, took every care to promote the interests of the town.* Shete, Mahajan, Sar Shete, Patansheti, Mutsadvani, etc. had also their shares s in some market-towns. Octroi duty ( Jakat ) or toll was levied on the entry of goods in towns. Then cesses on the purchase and sale of certain goods { called *T33)? and *R5?rffa ) were included under the octroi duty. There were special octroi officers or Kamavisdars in this department. 4 In some places there was a cess called Khot Jakat paid to the hereditary landlords called Khots. 5 Mohtarfa was a tax on trades and occupations. Shopkeepers, goldsmiths, blacksmiths, oilmen, potters, shoemakers, etc. had to pay it. A tax called Mohtarfa Kul ( J?rfcPTT jpy) might have been levied on families like a poll-tax. Sales tax A cess on the sale of oils, ghee, fodder, etc. was quite common. These taxes formed part of the old Hindu system as these are allowed by Manu, Kautilya and other law-givers.7 Police cess called Thanapatti or Kotwaleepatti, was collected 1.

A somewhat similar cess called qzf <IF5Wr *s often mentioned. There was an allied fee called Tag or Tagadi on scales for weighing bulky articles. * Stamping of cloths ( Chhap ) manufactured for sale was 'a rule. Sellers of unstamped cloths were fined. For examining the cloth and putting a stamp on it, a fee was charged by the government. 42. The rural cesses levied from time to time were so numerous and so varied that it is not possible to give a detailed account in this section. A cursory glance on the names and nature of the manifold levies will reveal an oppressive burden on the poor cultivator. From the time that he cut his crop to the time that he sold it, he was subject to so many exactions that he could hardly have any decent living for himself and his family. The one relieving feature was the customary nature of the cesses. Their number and the amount to be given in a particular locality were fixed by custom. Some of these were levied in kind, and a few in cash. The cultivators must have been living in extreme poverty and in constant awe of the myrmidons of government who like locusts were to devour his crop. Sometimes these rights were disputed/ Grievances of the people were removed by the decisions of the arbitration courts or by the orders of the king. 1. Sh. Ch.

Village as a whole Some of these officers had their shares in the crops raised by the cultivators and they had their own Watans or tends given to them by the state. Besides these, all the non-agriculturists who ij* one way or another helped the agriculturists in their work or assisted the village community as a whole, were given shares from tbe produce, and some of these too had lands from the government* The non-agricultural workers were divided into two classes of twelve Balutas and twelve Alutas. 43. The Balftas played an important part in the economic and political life of the village. They were hereditary workers in several occupations. Both Hindus and Muslims were caste-ridden in this sphere. Irrespective of caste, creed or social position each Baluta had his own part to play in the daily life of the village. While every one of these artisans had a share of grains from every cultivator at the harvest time and some of them had lands given to them for their maintenance, they performed service or gave articles to the villagers and officers. Instead of levying taxes in moaey from t|*e artisans and labourers, their labour or commodities made by 1, Sh. Ch. S. II, 219. 303,^17, 327, 339. 344; IH, 146, 153, 213; VH.105* THE FINANCIAL SrsTtn i were demanded according to the dictates of the Hindu The state is authorized to requisition the service of artisaos mechanics aod labourers for one day in each month. We can trace the existence of the twelve Balutas in the villages of Maharashtra from the 13th century onwards. Even now they exist in many parts of the Deccan. Their names vary in different places, and all the Twelve Balutas may not exist in each \ illage, but the system of the Twelve Balutas still persists in some of the villages. Tn an arbitration document of 1675 relating to a village in the Mawals, their names are given, and some of these are described as Mirasi or hereditary. A Patalki Watan was granted by Shivaji to one Bak&ji Pharzand in 1675. The Sanad of the Raja was brought before the Gots and Balutas for information. This was signed by headmen of several villages, and the witnesses consisted of the Balutas of the village proper. 1 Grant Duff gives' the names of the Balutas as carpenter, smith, cobbler, Mang, potter, barber, washerman, Gurav, Joshi, Bhat, Maulana. The Alutas were goldsmith, Jangam, tailor, weaver, Taral, gardener, oilman, Gosavi, Ramoshi, TamboJi, <7ondhali ( Musician ), Gharshi ( low caste singers ). Another list of Balutas has Patil, Kulkarni, Chaudhari, Potdar,,- Deshpaade, Joshi, Gurav, barber, washerman, carpenter, potter, Mahar. The Atotus are said to be oilman, TamboJi, Sali, gardener, Jaagavn, Kaivant, Dabarya, Thakar, Gharshi, Taral, goldsmith, Chaogula. The Patif was head of the village administration. He was the most important link between the government and the people. He allotted laads and helped in fixing the rents* He collected the revenue and managed to remit it to the Taluka treasury. He was to improve agriculture and promote the prosperity of the villagers. It was he who represented the governmental needs to the people and the grievances of the villagers to the government. He was to help all tourmg officers in tin performance of their duties* He was to 1. Sh. Ch. S, II, 272, 274, 278; III, 142 /rSHtvitji THE GREAT* and prevent all thefts- and crimes with the help of watchmen. He also worked as head of the village Pancfaayat and represented his village in ail political and judicial matters. Such an important functionary held hereditary watan land? and enjoyed rights and perquisites in the village. He was neither elected by the people nor appointed by the government. His was a hereditary office which could be sold and purchased in part or in toto. In case of partial sale of the Inam and its rights, there could be more than one Patil-all together enjoying the fixed or customary rights and privileges. In some cases 1 Police Patils were different from Civil Patils. The village accountant was known as Kulkarni, Gaon * Kulkarni, or Lekhak. He performed all the writing work of the village administration, kept the records and prepared the village returns. He helped the villagers by keeping their accounts with the creditors, Along with the Headman, he used to stand surety for regular payment of all dues from the villagers and for their good conduct and loyalty. His rights and perquisites, though less than those of the Patil, were quite numerous.* A Chaugula assisted the village officers in the village administtation and had Watan lands and perquisites given to him. The Potdar was the goldsmith or sonar to test the genuineness of the coins and to see whether they had the prescribed weight and proportion of the metal. Sometimes one Potdar used to do this work for more than one village. He used to get remuneration from the village and even from the government for testing the money received in revenue. A Mahar belonged to the untouchable caste and lived quite outside the boundaries of the village, because he used to impale dead animals and preserve their hides. Yet he served as one of the Twelve Balutas, worked as a peon of the officers and as a watchman of the village. He used to carry money and government reports to the higher officials, In return he enjoyed certain customary 1-2. Sen, Ad, S. M, Pp. 2(5-224, 227. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM MS rights and perquisites, and got share of -grain at the harvest time. He too had his Watani lands. In some parts the work of the village watchman was done by Ramoshis. They used to be on patrol duty at night, and helped the Patil in the arrest of criminals. 44. Every big village had its own astrologer ( Joshi ) who made horoscopes, fixed the dates of marriages and pointed out good or bad omens. There was a Brahman or Upadhaya to perform religious ceremonies. Similarly, there was a Kazi or Dhannadhikari to decide law cases. The remaining officials were local and central agents with rights of perquisites and levies fixed by custom or the government. The grantees of this category differed from village to village and time to time on account of local tradition, the economic importance of villages and the necessities of the government. Besides the shares paid to the government officers and public servants included among the Balutas and Alutas, there were other levies paid by the villagers. Village Levies Shingott 1 cess on breeding of animals like cows, oxen, buffaloes, goats, horses, etc. was levied in the Deccan. This cess had its counterpart in the north where it was known as Gaushumari and Ashva Jakati. The latter was on the sale of horses. Unth Patti f or cess on camels, and Gajpatti a tax on elephants are self-evident. Then one Sail Bail 9 ( %& %^) or cess on transport cattle, is separately mentioned in several grants* A tax on trees was called Sardarakati * or Jhad-Jh&dora in the Deccan. It cannot be definitely said whether it was levied on fruit trees only or even on other trees used as timber and fuel. Grazing fee ( Van charai ) for grazing cattle on government 1. Sh. Ch. S.

Forest dues Some fees must have been levied on taking away fuel, timber, bamboos, herbs, fruits, myrobatans, leaves, plants, etc. from the forest. . Bdtkati l exacted at the harvesting time, is frequently mentioned. Rarmayasi * was a common cess. It consisted of presents of fruits, vegetables, etc. to officers. Tashrufati was another form of this cess. Tejvpatti * might have been a cess imposed on landlords for their extra profits due to a special rise in prices* One Moreshwar Gosawi is feiven exemption from this new cess along with an exemption from all cesses old and new. Payposhi was the contribution of the shoemakers to the Patil for plying their trade. It is so often mentioned that references will be useless. Kharchpalti * was a cess to meet the expenses of the village. Similarly, a contribution had to be made to the standing funds of of the Gava Gana ( 3TT3" 15TT ) which was spent for common purposes of having a temple, a Serai, a well, a cow- house, etc. Miscellaneous cesses 5 were collected under the following names: house tax, watchman tax, market cess, beggars cess, goldsmith cess, tobacco duty and forced labour. Water cess was an extra tax o lands watered by wells. Karaj patti were loans forcibly taken from the people in case of emergency. Certain cesses have been left out from the preceding categories, because their significance is not clear. Marathi dictionaries and 1. Sh. Ch, S.

Some of these are: Thun Masul,' Aiheran, Kathvala, Bambar Bhet, Banpatti, Sundar Thakur and Ban Tafcat j 45. Coaclidiag reMnrki-\Ve must not be oblivious to three important aspects of the imposition of these Abwabs. Though the list seems to be formidable, many of these are being levied now in towns and villages in India, and were levied even in the urban and rural areas of Europe in those days. Secondly, instead of the money economy there was the barter system wherein exchange of services and articles was the common feature. The needs of cultivators were satisfied by the services of the Maliar, Mang, barber, washerman, Joshi, Gurav, ect. on the one hand, and by the articles made by the shoemaker, carpenter, potter, oilman, ect. on the other. Consequently, these were paid a share of the crop by ^every cultivator. The third feature deserving special notice is the socialistic organization of the society coupled with the principle of self-sufficiency. Every village was guided by the socialistic spirit to maintain its autonomy and self-sufficiency. All members of the village community from the lowest like Mahars and Hangs to the highest like Brahman,Joshi, and Upadhaya or the village officers, or the agents of imperial and local governments, pooled their resources and services for the common cause, and therefore each had his fixed share in the produce. In years of scarcity each would get less, while m years of prosperity each would share more of the produce of the land. Thus all were ensured maintenance, and there could not exist an unemployed or a starving group of persons. Every one living in a village with his hereditary occupation had a, place in the rural economy to do some useful work; in return, he was served or paid in kind by others. Thus the people lived in peace and contentment irrespective of turmoils, wars, revolutions in the capital of the kingdom. 1. Sh. Ch.S. II, p. 302; III. p. 151. Their names in Marathi are respectively- CHAPTER VIII Tbe Monetary Policy 1. The Laissez Faire policy The Maratha Swaraj has already been shown to be composed of territories wrested from the Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Golconda kingdoms, and from the Mogul and Vijayanagar Empires. Consequently, the monies of all these states remained current in the newly born state. We must expect a large variety of coins passing among the people and kept in the central as well as provincial treasuries of this kingdom. Shivaji was struggling to enlarge his dominion from the beginning of his career. On account of continuous wars with Bijapur and later on with the Mogul Empire, he was not sure of retaining the portions wrested from them. He had to cede a large part of his dominion after his treaty with Jaismgh in 1665. After four years only, he began to reconquer the lost forts and the territory protected by them. Therefore he could not evolve any monetary policy except that of giving full freedom to his subjects to accept whatever coins they preferred. He did not force any one coin on them. The Laissez-Faire policy gave the people the greatest satisfaction. 2. Shivaji mints money From H. Oxinden's letter it appears that Shivaji had no state-mint for coining money up to his coronation. His words are : ' After his coronation he intends to set up a mint, and proposes himself great advantages thereby, so that Naroji Pandit declares that he will never agree to allow the Bombay money to go current in his dominions." 1 It is said by Khafi Khan that Shivaji began to strike copper coins and Hons in the fort of Rajgarh from 1664. The Marathi chronicles confirm this statement. These were probably not in his own name, but some current coins were minted for using copper and gold, and for making profit thereby. The state-mint might have been established after June 1674 for coining pagodas and pice in his own name. He 1. Shivaji, Part III, 21 THE MONETARY POLICY 147 must have been striking before his coronation pagodas, laries and pice in the old form in which they were current in the country- This is confirmed by the 19th article of the Anglo-Maratha treaty itself wherein the English promise that " all sorts of coins made in Sevagee's Dominions shall pass freely on the Island of Bombay." * < It was the practice of those days to give license to goldsmiths to com money of proper weight and purity. In the Deccan states such licenses were granted by the government which used to charge royalty trom the goldsmiths, and to have superintendents to examine the coins and punish the license-holders in case of default. Shivaji too must have followed this practice as the pice minted during his regime have different and defective spellings of the word "Shiva Chhatrapati." 3. Variety of Coins: The cash in the government treasuries consisted of Hons or pagodas of \ anous mints and issued by numerous kings. Their names are given below to show the variety of pagodas which were current in the days of Shivaji. The Chitragupta Chronicle gives a supplementary list of fanams issued from fourteen mints : Sabhasad names twelve varieties in which three new names of mints occur. Thus in all there were 21 kinds of pagodas and 17 cf fanams in the treasuries of the Raja. The seven kinds of pagodas mentioned in these volumes are great Hons, small Hons, A&hmolah, Padshahi, Sungare, Tipke and Wingurla ones. Five of these are not included in the list of Marathi chronicles. The silver coins consisted of rupees, Mahmudies, Ashrafis, Lans, and Rials. The prices of all these coins for the fifty years' period from 1630 to 1680 are not available in a reliable manner. However, various travellers and authors have given their prices, and stray references are found in the preceding pages. It is evidently impossible to give an exact estimate of the value of the treasures left in cash and kind by Shivaji. A rough estimate will be attempted below. 1. Shivaji, Part III, 43, < 4. Ntaet tf HMS: The amounts of the various kinds of pagodas left in Shivaji's treasury according to the two chronicles were: ( In thousands ) Putlis 100 Sangari Hon 1275 Gadmal Hon 500 Pak (V) Naiki Hon 100 Mohars 20O Padshahi Hon 1 365 Ramchandrarai Hon 100 Shailyguti Hon 200 Ibrahami Hon 100 Ellori Hon 50 Fullam of different kinds 10,34 5. Prices of Hens: The Shivarai, Devarai, Achyntrai, Ramchandrarai Hons were named after the Vijayanagar kings who issued them. These pagodas had the figure of Vishnu either with or without his two consorts on the obverse, while their reverse was either plain or granulated. Even the Golconda and Madras pagodas were struck after the Vijayanagar type. The former had the name of a Vijayanagar sovereign in Devanagari characters on the reverse, while the other bore on the obverse the figure of Vishnu and his two wives with rays emanating from his person. Its reverse was granulated.* The Madras Hon was called the New Pagoda, while the Masulipatam Hon was known as the Old Pagoda. In 1656 one 1. In Sabhasad the sum is 300,450. 2. This figure is from Sabhasad. Chitragupta is evidently wrong, figures ate almost the sane in both the chronicles. 3. Satrami is another reading on p. 86 of Sh. Chh. 4. Vestiges of O. MM I,' p. 195; II, p. 312 n. Other MOHETAR^ PSfeltY OHI Pacoda was eqiial to 1.39, but in 1661 it rose to 1.425 New Pagoda. 1 (2) Kaven-pak, Adoni, Guti, Shailyguti, Hukcri, EHori; Dbarwari, Gadma), Tadpatri Hons seem to be after the names of the mint-towns at which these were struck. (3) Padshahi and Ibrahimi were the Bijapur Hons. (4) Gambar Dr. Sen takes it to be Gabbar which was worth Rs. 3-12 as-6 p. at Bombay in 1763. ( Ad. S. M., p. 123 ). (5) Putli was a small gold coin used as an ornament and was -equal to Rs. 4 in value. In other words, its price was nearly equal to a Hon. (6) Mohar was the \\ell~known Mogul coin weighing 170 grains and containing 16S grains of gold. The rupee was 179 grams and had 175.5 grains of silver. Hence Rs. 15*4 were equal to a Mohar at the ratio of the values of silver and gold as 16:1. The Mohar was popularly known as the gold rupee. There were half and quarter Mohars of gold too in circulation. Each Mohar was actually equal to 14J rupees= 21 livresor 4hons, alivre being equal to Is. 6d. (7) Shivarai Hons-The treasury of Shivaji had Shivarai hons to the number of 4 lakhs only; but these were probably Vijayanagar pagodas and not those struck by Shiva Chhatrapati. As he was often called Shivarai after his coronation, it is probable that pagodas might have been struck by him after his name with the figure of God Shiva on them. There is one specimen of a gold Hon in the B. I. S. Mandal of Poona with the figures of Shiva and Bhawani seated side by side on the obverse, while on the face the words ( tfnTCF* ^Rfcf ) are inscribed. The letter c 3f ' is missing due to incorrect spelling and the bad instruments. The inscription reveals the ignorance of goldsmiths and the freedom given to them for coining money without any interference from the state. The inscription on the copper coins was not uniform. Incorrect spellings 1. Vestiges of O. M., I, pp. 194-5. The new pagodas were made by the English and Dutch and were valued at 34 rupees, while the old pagodas were worth 4j rupees. Tawnier, II, pp. 70-71. 150 SHIVAJI THE GKEAT -were rather the rule. Eight different forms of Shivaji's name were- pointed out by Mr. Abbot who is said to have collected 25,OOO paisas of Shivaji. 1 (8) Sutigare, Ttpftee, Ashmolah, Vingurla Hons -The loss suffered by the English at Hubh in 1673 was estimated in Sungare pagodas. We learn from Dr. Fryer that a Sungare pagoda was equal to Rs. 4 or 9 s., an Asmolah pagoda was one per cent less than the Sungare. The Rajapore loss was to be made up by Shivaji in Ashmolah pagodas, but another letter has Padshahi pagodas. The Tipkec pagodas were found in the English factory at Hubli. It appears that up to 1665 pagodas were struck at Vingurla and called after this famous port. 5,000 Vmgurla pagodas were despatched to Surat by the Dutch. We also read of pagodas at 4 guilders and 5 guilders in 1664 and 1669. The exchange of a Dutch florin is stated to be about 1 . equal to 1H florins. (9) Padshahi Hon- In 3663 at Surat the exchange was 100 pagodas equal to Rs. 360. The Padshahi or Bijapuri pagodas were current at Rajapur. We read of Padshahi and Kaveripak Hons being paid in salary to officers by Shivaji. This pagoda was equivalent to Hs. Id. in English money. In a letter* of Jaysingh ( 1665 A. D. ) a Hon is valued at Rs. 5, and Da Guarda too gives *he same price. In the south the pagodas had fanams and cash as coins of smaller denomination. Prices of articles are given in these as can be seen on p. 235 of Part III. The European merchants were dealing in pagodas and rupees. The English price of a pagoda is confirmed by the records. It should be marked that a pound sterling was then equal to 9 rupees at the rate of 2s. 3d. per rupee and that a Hon varied from Rs.3.6- to 5, or from 8s. to Us. 3d. We may therefore take 2 Hons to be roughly equal to 1 . or Rs. 9. Up to 1675 A. D. the exchange 1. Sen, Ad. S. M., pp. 107-111, 123-126. 2-3.

Shivaji was paid 1,000-2,000 ducats daily by the king and was offered a present -of 1,000 by the Dutch at Golconda. 1 6. Now we will torn to the silver coins-Abasis, Laris and Rials were the foreign coins current in the country, while Ashrafis, rupees and Mahmudis may bo said to be the indigenous coins. (1) Abasis were Persian coins named after Shah Abbas who ruled Persia from 15S8 to 1629 A. D. They were current at -Calicut, each being equal to 16d. according to Fryer, 1 and ISd. according to Thevenot. One Persian Toman = Rs. 29i or 50 Abasis=100 Mahmudis = 200 Shahis. 3 (2) Lari The word Kabri in the Sabhasad chronicle is a misreading of Lari which was a Persian com current in the port towns of Western India. It appears that the Bijapur rulers and Shivaji used to strike these silver coins. The Basra Lari was known after the famous port town Basra of Persia. We read of Hurmuzi, Basri, Shirni, Bhivindi, Murbad Korkada Laris in Marathi letters.* Shivaji might have struck Laris at Chaul and Dabhol which were brought under him about the year 1660. The soldiers at Rajgad were given their salaries in Laris in 1665. Similarly, customs were paid at Dabhol, etc. in Laris. 5 A Lari was worth about 6d. (3) Rials-Royals ( Ryalls or Reals ) were silver coins imported from Spain, and were worth about Rs. 2 each. According to 1. Eng. Rec. II, pp. 349-350. 2. East India, Vol. I, p. 143. 3.

(4) An Asbfifi was an Indian word to signify a Portuguese Xerafeen ot Xerafin equal to 300 reis. It is said to be equal to Is. 6d. by Yule. 9 Even in 1677 the rents and customs of Bombay were farmed out in Xerafins 3 . So the Bombay rupee and pagoda were not much current there. (5) Rupees were mostly current in the north, but began to circulate in the Deccan with the extension of the Mogul sovereignty in these parts. Each rupee was equal to 40 dams and there were- half and quarter rupees of silver. 4 The value of the rupee was 2s. 3d. to 21 s. Rupees used to be sent for the expense of the army by Shivaji. At Surat 1 rupee was equal to 49 paisas, but it varied from 46 to 50 paisas. The Agra and Delhi a rupee was equal to 55-56 paisas and 40 Dams. There were coins of 1 paisa, paisa, 2 paisas Then I paisa was ==35-40 almonds or 50-55 cowries at Agra, but more shells near the sea. (6) A Mthnmtti was equal to 20 paisas or from 8d. to 1 s. Token Coins- In the Deccan token coins were different. The Rajvavyaharkosha has given the denominations of the coins under the Hons.

Tbe copper coins 5 were Takas, Rukas, Trirukas, Shivarais and ShaShganis. 1 Hon = 10 and sometimes = 11-12 Takas. 48 Rukas were equal to 1 Taka. There is an occasional mention of 1.

In 1628 Jan. the price of a Hon is said to be nine Khurda Takas, while in a letter of 1621, a Hon is taken to be equivalent to 8 Laris. In 1658 Nov. it went up to 12J Takas or Rs. 3 12 as. Then in 1670 and 1671 the Hon came down to 10 Takas." Phalam was another name for qoj or fanam. It comes under the silver coins in the Rajvavyaharkosha, though originally it was a gold coin. It came to be minted of silver and base gold in the 17th century. Its value varied from place to place. According to Fryer, the Madras pagoda was worth 8 s., the Fanam, 3d. and Cash id. in 1673. It follows that 32 F. were equivalent to a pagoda, and six Cash to one Fanam. But the nominal exchange was 36 Fanams to a pagoda. The Cash referred to by Dr, Fryer was only an imaginary coin of accounts, the actual Cash was different. In 1678, 74 to 78 Cash were equal to a fanam. There were sometimes double Cash 43, or single Cash 86 to a Fanam. 80 cash generally went to a fanam. It was merely a coin of account, while a 4 Cash-piece was the smallest coin struck. The number of fanams to a pagoda varied at different places at the same time. For instance, one pagoda was equal to 12 fanams at Golconda, 18 at Porto Novo, 24 at Pulicat and 36 at Madras. We also read of pagodas and jetts.* Captain Thomas Bowrey 4 who visited the Eastern Coast of India several times between 1669 and 1688, gives the prices of a pagoda from 6 to 12 s. in various places. 1.

Bowrey, The Countries Round the Bay ! Beaga 154 SmvAji THE GREAT The names of the Fanams of different types are mentioned in the Marathi chronicles. Some of these are similar in the Sabhasad and the Chitragupta chronicles ; others are different. Some coins are named after the kings and others after the mint towns. Ramarai, Hanamantrai, Katerai or Vyankatrai and Muhammad Shahi belong to the former group, while Trivaluri, Vellori, Devanhalli, Chandavari, etc. fall in the second category. The total number of the fourteen kinds of Fanams named in the Chitragupta chronicle is about 25 lakhs, while Sabhasad gives the value as 3 lakh Rons. In some mints both pagodas and fanams must have been coined, while others must have minted only one kind of coin* The text is defective and therefore exact names can not be decisively given. Trivaluri pagodas were the current coin of the Karnatic up to 1736 at least. 1 There were pagodas of Vellore and Tanjore mints too. Other types can not be traced. 8. Tbe Bombay Mint Englishmen used to make a large profit by coining money at Bombay and using it in the Maratha territory. They hoped that the copper pice and budgrooks would be demanded in larger quantities by the support of the Maratha government. In their treaty with Shivaji the> desired to insert a stipulation that the coins struck at Bombay should be made current by law throughout the Maratha kingdom, but the Raja deemed the article to be unnecessary, because he did not wish to force his subjects to accept those coins whereby they would be losers. His reply was very significant. He pointed out that in case the English coins were as fine and weighty as the Mogul's money, they would go current in his country. He gave them the assurance of not prohibiting their currency. The Englishmen acknowledged that Shivaji was true to his word and that the Bombay pice was quite popular, but tin budgroooks were not accepted by the people. The latter were old Goa coins struck at different times of copper, lead, tin, etc. The English at Bombay coined budgrooks of tin and desired to make much profit thereby. In 1671 sixteen budgrooks went to one pice. We have seen that the pice coined by Shivaji and the English were current in 1. Vettifes of O. M., II* p. 310. THE MONETARY POLICY 155 Maharashtra. The Bombay pice was so popular ' in the Maratha and Portuguese territories that the English proposed to use 1,500 chests of copper in minting pice in 1675. 9. The Hoarded Treasures of Shiiaji The Sabhasad and Chitragupta Chronicles and the Tarikh-i-Shivaji have presented detailed information on the wealth left by Shivaji at his death. The list is indicative of the distant expeditions which brought a vast treasure in cash and kind through plunder, chauth, tribute and gifts. Pagodas numbered about ten millions ; gold and silver in bullion weighed 250 maunds and 1,000 maunds respectively; jewels, ornaments and costly clothing were valued at more than three crores of Hons, while the total value of the arms, weapons and stores of numerous articles is estimated at two crores of Hons. The aggregate number of all the pagodas, Mohars, Putlies, Gambars and Fanams by being converted into Hons was more than a crore. There were nine crore rupees and five crore Hons worth of other goods. This seems to be a poor collection after a regime of 30 years 1 pillage and conquest. As Shivaji followed the system of paying salaries in cash to all the employees and as he had to maintain very large armies, the treasury probably showed poor balances. * The treasures amassed by Shah Jahan 3 at Agra and removed by Auraugzeb to Delhi, comprised 43 lakh gold Mohars and 2.6 crore rupees. At the capture of Golconda by Aurangzeb, its treasury * had only 68 lakh Hons, two crore rupees and 115 crore dams left in it. The wealth of Shivaji compares favourably with the fabulous wealth amassed by Akbar the Great. At his death the Mogul Emperor is said to have left 10 maunds of uncoined gold; 70 maunds of silver, 60 maunds of copper, one crore of tankas, and Ilahis worth 11 crores of rupees/ According to Smith, Akbar left forty million pounds sterling in coined money. 1.

All civil and even ordinary criminal casts were decided by peoples' courts. Law-givers like Manu, Narada, Brihaspati, Yajnavalkya and Sukra have given us glimpses of the universal practice of trial by peers. According to Sukra, cultivators, artisans, artists, usurers, corporations, dancers, ascetics and thieves should decide their disputes according to the usage of their profession. The reason advanced for this practice is that it is impossible to detect them through the help of others, so they are to be found out with the assistance of persons born of them. Similarly, the foresters, merchants and soldiers were to be tried by men of their own occupation. Further, in every village cases were to be tried by the neighbours. The families ( Kulas ) , corporations { Srenis ) and communities ( Ganas ) were to try cases excepting robbery and theft. Appeals from tht, Kula lay with the Sreni and from this to the Gana. King's Court According to Sukra, the judicial officers were to try cases not decided by the Ganas. The highest court of appeal was the King's Council consisting of the king, three to seven Brahmans well-versed in law and Veda, and of judicious merchants who were made assessors. The king presided, the councillors served as investigators, while the chief justice acted as the speaker. In another place Sukra says that the imperial court should consist of the king, the chief justice, the Amatya, a Brahman and the chie priest. It was a law that the king should never singly try cases, nor were suits to be heard in secret. The king who did not perform his judicial duties well, was threatened with the dire punishment of being thrown into the darkest hell. It is evident that cheap, prompt, and impartial justice was available to the people in the villages and towns of their residence. In a few important cases the* had to go out. Even the king was THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM not allowed to try cases alone, but Only fa company with the law-lords and assessors. The fundamental rule was not to try -cases in secret but in public, an&then too with the help of experts in law and the neighbours of the parties in a suit. 2. Cbaoffet during the Mfltlifli period During centuries of Muslim rule in southern India the vitality of the Panchayat system was not adversely affected. The rulers recognized the decisions of the Panchayats, superimposed certain courts or invested officers with judicial powers in criminal cases. The suits between Muslims and Hindus, and between Muslims were heard by the Kazi, an expert in Muslim law. Besides local Kazis, there were Kazis at the provincial capitals and the imperial metropolis. In the Mogul Empire the Kotwals, the Governors and the Emperors took over more and more judicial powers with the strengthening of the Muslim rule, so that the people were deprived of their powers and they suffered from denial of justice during the long rule of Aurangzeb. Prof. A. S. Altekar, after a thorough study of the village communities, has arrived at the conclusion l that in the north these communities lost their vitality by the introduction of the Zamindari system there. The landlords became the most influential members of the Panchayats, and thereby the headmen were deprived of their powers and position. Then the Panchayats too lost much of their power, because their decrees could not be enforced by the state. Further, certain social changes were introduced among the Hindus by the dominance of Muslims in northern India. But in the Deccan these changes could not be affected. Thus during the long Muslim rule village communities -continued to exist and perform judicial and political functions in southern India. However, these grew weaker and weaker under the Muslim dominance, so that some functions were performed by the headmen of villages. They had, however, to consult the elders on important matters. The Panchayats enjoyed judicial autonomy and as such these continued to exist in villages after the fall of the Ihfaratha Empire. 1. Village Communities in Wetttrn Indi^ p, 1*3. 158 ISfflVAji THE GREAT 1, , The Paa^kiyttt vThat the peoples' courts in those days* we^e known as Panchayats, is confirmed by a document 1 of 1622. These were of different types. The most popular one was the Got Council consisting of the Patil, Kulkarni, the castemen, or relatives and kindreds of the disputants. Other Panchayats could be composed of the Mokadam and Twelve Balutas of the village to which the disputants belonged, or of the Makadams and Mukhtsars of the neighbouring villages. The Panchayat also consisted of the Patil, the accountant, the Twelve Balutas, and landlords of the village. In towns Shete, Mahajan, merchants and Balutas took part in the Panchayat. Thus the number of its members was not fixed. The disputants had the option to choose any form of the village Panchayat. Shivaji * himself offered such an option to the parties in 1668 for the decision of a suit. An arbitration held in 1669 at Tandli deserves a special notice. Therein Mokadams, the Twelve Balutas, all elders ( Bap-bhaus ) and hereditary peasants were present. One man was aged 115 years, several were septuagenarians, while there were also present young men only 20 years old. It must have been a wonderful sight to have a venerable old man cf 115 years walking into the Council Hall and sitting for hours there. The young and the old, the rich and the poor took part in the Panchayats on a basis of equality, and thus enjoyed the threefold blessings, of equality, fraternity and liberty. Men of various castes, religions, occupations were not represented on it by election. The Panchayat was not dominated by men of any one community, religion, caste, occupation or interest. In this sense it was a democratic institution enjoying the confidence of the villagers and the towns- people. Still it was open to the parties to demand the transference of their cases to some- other village or town Panchayat, or to a higher authority. (a) There was a quarrel regarding the Joshiship of Kasba Shirwal. Both the parties agreed to have an arbitration in the city 1. Sh, Ch. S. II, p. 133. 2t B. I* S. M. SammeUa (Report, III, p. 39. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM of Ahmednagar. The Shetes, Mahajans, etc. of that city formed a court and gave their decision. Then the victory document was issued by the authorities and the Jeshi-ship was given over to the winning party in 1577 A. D, (b) In an arbitration ' of l6l3 A. D. the neighbours of town Shirwal, and the Deshmukhs and the Deshpandes of Poona, Wai, Saswad and Gunjan Maval were called as witnesses. The Deshak Council then gave its judgment. (c) In 1638 a case regarding division of property was decided ^by a Panchayat in which Dadaji Kond Dev, Subedar of Kondana, was present along with the Deshmukh, Desh Kulkarni and Gots, This decision 9 was reversed by another Panchayat in 1657 wherein Shivaji Raje himself, his ministers and officers, Deshmukhs, Desh Kulkarnis, Gots and others were present. Thus important cases were decided by councils attended by many high dignatories of the state along with the representatives of the villages concerned. It was quite natural for the people to repose complete confidence in the impartiality of such councils. The Hindu maxim that ' the panchas are representatives of God ' is similar to the Latin saying ' the voice of the people is the voice of God.' (d) Another famous decision was given by a Got Council in which Kond Dev was himself present. This Council is said to have based its judgment on the authority of the Mitakshara. 3 (e) On an appeal being made, Shivaji referred the case to a Panchayat consisting of the Deshmukh, Deshpande, Hawaldar, Gots, etc. 4 (f ; The sale of Kulkarni and Jyotishi rights of one village was affected in 1670. The deed was endorsed by a Patil, Mokadam, all the family elders ( ^T<T-*n3r ) , the Balutas and hereditary cultivators. Their names and seals are put on the document/ 1. Sh. Ch. S. I, p. 5; P. S. S.

Barada Daftar, Vol. I, pp. 11-16* SWVAJI THE GREAT The words ( Bap-bhau ) ' fothers and brothers ' -show that the- elderly relatives of both the parties were also invited to take part in hearing the case* In ancient times there was the Kuia or Family Council, but the Panchayat of the Maratha times included the family elders, village officers, artisans and hereditary cultivators. 1 4. The Deshak Sakfca was generally composed of Desbnmkhs, Deshpandes, Patils, Balutas of the villages, and Shete-Mahajans of the towns included in the Pargana. From a document " of 1652 it appears that the Deshaks included Desais, Sardesai, Desh Kulkarni, Naiks Pataks, etc. of a particular territory* Another document * of 1682 shows that the Deshakas and Gots formed a Panchayat presided over by the officer of the town called Rajmudra, because he was to put his seal on the victory certificate after the decision. Officers of the Pargana like Hawaldar, Thanedar, Sarnaubat, Karkun, Sabnis, Chitnis, Karkhanis, Sargrohs, Naikwadis, etc. used to be members of this council. Its membership was not fixed, and it is not certain whether attendance in it was compulsory or not, yet this court had original and appellate jurisdiction. A case relating to several villages was decided by it. If a party was dissatisfied with the decision of the Gots, it could request the re-hearing of the case by the Deshak Sabha. Even disputes regarding the rights of Jyotishi, Dharmadhikari, etc. were decided by a Deshak 4 Council. 5. The Brahmin Sabha was composed of one or more Brahmans who were well-known as distinguished scholars of high character. These were reputed to be fearless, impartial, God-fearing and incorruptible men. Such people were known as Dharmadhikaris. Karad, Wai, Kolhapur, Nasik, Mahuli, Paithan,. etc. were reputed to be the places of the residence of such Brahmans. Some times scholars from Benares were invited for deciding complicated cases. One of these councils was called by Shivaji to decide his Kshatrjya origin and the right to have coronation with- L See P. S, S, Docs. 64, 100, 125, 149, 151, 191. 2. Sh. Ch. S, III, pp. 218-20. 3.

One case was decided at Wai * in 1664. 6, Tht Raj Sabha is separately mentioned. It was probably constituted by the king, his councillors, some important officers of the kingdom, and persons of the place in which the dispute bad arisen. The case of Kharade brothers v. Kalbhar brothers about the Patilship of village Pali was heard by the council consisting of Shivaji, the Peshwa, the Chief Judge, the Panditrao, the Mujumdar, the Commander-in Chief, other important officers, Deshmukhs, Deshpandes, Patils, officers and Gots of the village Pali. The document is very important as it relates the procedure adopted in hearing and deciding suits. It was found that the case could not be decided on the available evidence. Therefore the complainant had to undergo an ordeal. Therein he failed and hence he lost his case. 4 Another case of Shivaji v. Netaji regarding the Patilship of village Talbid deserves notice. It was decided by the Brabmatt Sabha and the Rajsabha. The difficult law-points wete settled with the help of Vidnyanesbwar's commentary known as the Mitakshara.* Rajwade has published a document 6 of March 1686 giving details of a council of Brahmans and state councillors called to reclaim a Brahman from Islam to Hinduism. This council permitted Shudhi and penance on the authority of the Mitakshara, etc. There is another decision by a Dharmasabha wherein Dadaji Kond Dev was present. Therein some law-points had to b settled. The decision was given after consulting the Mitakshara. 1, Sfairmji, tot III* p. 3J. Sh. Giu 6, II* p 35$ set fr 294. 2-3. P. & S. Docs. 993, 995. 4. P. S.

Moreover, Mami Smriti, Vyavahara Mayukha and Kamalakara were also referred to as authorities in legal disputes. 7. Chief Justice Mid Paoditrto The Chief Justice had jurisdiction over all suits in the kingdom. His seal was to be put on all judgments given by him. Even Panditrao, the head of the ecclesiastical department, had the right to countersign all documents issued by the king relating to Achftra, Vyavahfira, and Prftyaschitta - the three parts of the Dharma Shastra. Some revisionary power was thus vested in the Panditrao, otherwise he would not give his approval to the decisions of the secular courts. 8. Municipal autonomy In towns and market places Panchayats consisting of officers and merchants were quite common. Many of these places had charters of rights from the king and enjoyed privileges of self-government in political and fiscal matters. Only two or three instances will be given here. There are two examples of charters given to Athani in 1683 and to Bankapur in 1686, but being traditional these are illustrative of the fact that during the seventeeth century all towns and ports enjoyed more or less similar rights. ( i ) Immunity from payment of certain taxes was conferred on Athani for seven years and on Bankapur for eleven years. ( ii ) All goods taken away by robbers and thieves if not recovered by government officers, were to be made good by the government. ( iii ) The intestate property was not to be taken as escheat by the government, but was to be given to the proper successors by the city Panchayat. ( iv ) All kinds of disputes, immoral deeds, even murders up to eleven were pardoned. Cases were to be decided by the Pancbayat. ( v ) Various kinds of taxes were either reduced or remitted. ( vi ) Forced labour was not to be demanded from the city. By these means encouragement was given to the people for rapidly developing depopulated or declining cities. 1 I. Sb. Ch, S. VI, pp, 368-387. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM It has been noted that Benares was looked upon as the greatest seat of learning. The decisions given by the reputed scholars of that holy place were recognized by the people all over India. There was a quarrel between the Jains and Lingayats of Athani regarding the respect to be paid to their Swamis at the time of their visit to the place. The Lingayats brought a written order from Kashi that the people of Athani should go out to receive the Lingayat Swami in procession. A Fanchayat consisting of all officers and Balutas of the city was held to examine the genuineness of the Benares dictum and the claim of the Lingayats was accepted. Sometime after the Jains claimed to have brought a similar order. Another Panchayat was held to examine the Benares dictum regarding them, and the Panchas refused to accept the same. Thus the state officials, village officers and the people played an important part in regulating the affairs of the town and villages. 1 9. Enforcement of decisions Several means were adopted to enforce the decisions of the Panchayats. (1) The parties had to give in writing their consent to abide by the decision of the Panchayat. (2) One or two men stood security for each party to ensure the carrying out of the decision. (3) Oaths were administered to the disputants and fine was to be imposed for violating the decision. The Hindus were bound by oaths and warned not to break the agreements, otherwise they could incur the sin of killing a cow at Benares. The Muslims were to swear by swine, and they incurred the sin of eating bacon for going against a certain decision. 9 (4) The parties were given a warning to abide by the decision, otherwise they were considered ' to commit a crime against the Dewan and be unjust to the Gots.' In hundreds of documents these words are to be found. The king is nowhere mentioned. He remains in the background. Only his dewan or minister figures prominently. Hence an impersonal reference to administration was made. No personal loyalty or fear was evoked among the 1, Sh. Ch. S. II, 358, 359 of 1658. 2. Sh. Ch. S. VI, p, 35.

This must have varied with the economic pppittpn of djspqtants, the amount of property involved and the frequency of the ppilt committed. For instance, ip aa arbitration held at Supg, ip 1658, this amount was two hundred Hons, but for violating the arbitration the amount of fine was raised to 500 Hon$ or R?. 2,000. In cities the disputants were considered to commit crimes against the city by violating the decision of the Panchayat. Thus the city formed an administrative unit which was to be considered sacred by the inhabitants. (5) Victory certificates ( nrqr ) and property documents / ercFTTO ) with proper seals and signatures were issued to the winning party and the government officers concerned. 10. Ordeals from ancient times The Hindu society used to hold trial by ordeals from the time of the Upanishads. Even the law-books of Apastamba, Manu, Narada, and Vishnu mention two to five forms of ordeals, while Brihaspati and Pitamaha give nine kinds. The balance, sacred libation, water, fire, heated metal, poison, rice-eating, drawing of Dharma-image, and ploughshare were the nine means used in the ordeals. Elaborate details of administering these are given in some commentaries. v Kautilya and Sukra too have testified to the use of ordeals in trials. As Mitakshara was followed in Maharashtra, some of the ordeals prevalent from ancient times and explained in that famous commentary, continued during the Muslim and Maratha periods. ~ Shivaji had the great ideal of reviving and strengthening Hindu laws and customs. He did not interfere in the customary law. The ordeals continued to be administered by the various courts during his regime. 11. Orfatli in Maharashtra Some of the ancient forms of ordeals had become obsolete in Maharashtra. The prevalent forms are noticed below: JuweiAL SVSTJM ( i ) A complainant b^ing dissatisfy} with tb deqfion of tbe Pj^jcbayat against hjm, demanded a fresh decision by ordea). Tberwjpon one took place in 1626 before an idol in 9 tempi* in the form of picking up papers with the names of litigants on them. 1 ( ii ) Ordeals were performed by drawing a piece of metal out of boiling oil, 9 or with the help of boiling water, and by burning lamps in a temple or a mosque. ( iii ) A heated ball was carried on a hand which was covered with leaves of peepal tree. Two such cases are mentioned in docs. 41 and 132. ( iv ) A disputant enjoyed the latitude of refusing to undergo an ordeal and demand another, even after having consented to perform a particular one. For instance, a man, being dissatisfied with the decision of the s Got Council, was ready to undergo a water-ordeal. He changed bis mind and requested that the case be decided by an oath taken in a mosque. Afterwards he rejected even this proposal and wanted tbe first ordeal. The Panchayat decided tbat the disputants sbould pour water over each other's bands. This form of ordeal too was not accepted by him, and he announced his intention of undergoing tbe fire-ordeal. The details of the first form of the ordeal by water are reproduced by Dr. Sen. 8 The disputants stood in a sacred river and the rightful party was drawn out of the water by a trustworthy man in the presence of tbe Pancbayat. ( v ) There was another simple form of an ordeal performed before the god in the village temple. On one chit the word ' head < of the god)' and on the other the word 'body (of. the god)' was written. The picker of the former chit was considered to have won the case. 4 The form of the ordeal was generally proposed by the Panchayat, but some times it was settled by the ruler himself. 1. P. S. S.

Btsic principles A few cases are referred to here for explaining the principles underlying the judicial procedure in general, and the administration of ordeals in particular. We will first confine ourselves to the first half of the 17th century, a period immediately preceding the rise of Shivaji to power. The first case deserving our notice is between a Hindu and a Muslim of Masur. Their ancestors had committed murder of each other for the sake of Patilship. The case was first decided by the Got Council of the village and then by the Deshak Council of the Pargana. The- Hindu complainant appealed to the king who sent the case to be decided by Ambar Khan. He gave his judgment, the case was again decided against the defendant by the Muslim officer of the district. Still the Muslim did not give up the Patilship. Thereupon the complainant demanded justice from the officers. The defendant desired the case to be transferred to an independent law-expert resident at a distant place. Thereupon the case was submitted to- two Brahman Dharmadhikaris of Paithan. The parties gave a writing to abide by the decision of this court. Their statements were recorded, and the necessary papers were examined by the judges. The Muslim demanded an ordeal to be performed by the Hindu plaintiff. The court referred to the lawbook of Vidnyaneshwar's Mitakshara and decided that no ordeal could be held in the existence of appropriate documentary evidence and witnesses available in this case. The learned judges further .declared that the defendant deserved a death-sentence, but since there was the Muslim rule and the defendant was a Muslim, he was pardoned. He was asked to give a Yajit-patra or victory certificate to the complainant and to band over the Patilship to the latter. This document was signed in the presence of the Muslim Havaldar of Paithan and given into the custody of the Hindu winner. 1 It must have. been noticed that a Muslim demanded his appeal to be heard by a'f^fodfrlawyer. The Muslim officer of Karhad and the Muslim 1&vaid&r f 'Paitfian both had confidence in the impartial judgment to be given by $36; Brahman Dharmadhikari. The Hindu judges administered justicte according to the Hindu law-books. These 1. Sfa/Ch, S, 17 p. 1; seeMocs. 39. 98 ai<123 of P. S. S.. THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 167 Jegal authorities were acceptable to .the Muslim rulers, and the Muslim people. Similarly, the, ordeals were performed by the Muslims as well as the Hindus even during the Muslim rule., Though trial by ordeal was definitely opposed to Islamic law, yet the Muhammedan , rulers in the Deccan did not or could not put it down. Besides, the legal terminology used in law. cases was mainly based on ancient Sanskrit law-books, especially on the Polity of Sukra. The words like 9TiT*nft ( complainant ), qftpr < defendant ), qf*TcT <JT or PT TO ( victory certificate ), ( ordeal ) have grown obsolete to-day, but were intelligible to the masses of those days. ' The government of the day afforded sufficient latitude to the litigants for appeal from one court to another, while it kept itself apart from directly interfering in the administration of justice. The majority of cases must have been decided by the peoples' courts. The masses must have been free from oppression on account of the enjoyment of judicial autonomy. Several documents ( nos. 8-12 ) on the Desh Kulkarniship of Shirwal town are published. 2 It appears that the Panchayat consisted of all the Deshaks, Shethes, Mahajans, the Twelve Balutas, all the hereditary cultivators of Pargana Shirwal and certain Mokadams and eminent neighbours of other towns. It was presided over by an officer called Rajmudra. The statements of the two parties were written on Tadpatri paper. The president asked the assembly to consider the means by which the case was to be decided. All unanimously desired to bold an ordeal. The parties consented to undergo the same. The hands of both the complainant and defendant were thoroughly washed and covered with gloves and sealed. They were then kept in custody in the fort. Next day the assembly met at the temple of Kedareshwar. There the complainant was asked < to draw out the^ a boiling mixture of oil and butter. He did it 1. P. 3. S. Doc. 50. 2. Sb. Cb, S. I. pp, 5-18. A similar case bat been i Vritta. II, p. 153, 168 8VAJ1 TttftGflEAt of all* and showing the same to^ll he dropped it. Thefa he his hand under hfc arm-pit and -walked rouftd the shrine 6f the god. The hands of both were again put in gloved and sealed* The? were then kept in the fort for two days. On 'the third day the assembly met again in the temple. The parties were brought in* Their hands were examined and it was found that the complainant had not suffered at all by drawing out the metal from the boiling oil. Therefore the assembly gave judgment in favour of the complainant. A suitor performed an ordeal and lost his case. Yet he did not accept this verdict and appealed to the authorities to reconsider his case. Thereupon a fresh trial took place. ' One most noteworthy case of an ordeal performed in the presence of Shivaji and a great Council has already been mentioned. The Raja, being requested by the members to remit the fine of Gunahgari to Kharade and the Harki gift from the winning party, acceded to their wish. Then documents were made to transfer the Patilship to the winning party. It is evident that even the ruler, his ministers and high officers sat as members of the law courts and did not impose their will upon other members. Such a practice brings out the democratic character of the judicial assemblies and the consequent confidence of the people in them. In no other territory in India such a democracy was enjoyed by the people of those days. Delay and denial of justice were common in Mogul India. In the Maratha Empire prompt justice through Panchayats consisting of their own neighbours, relatives, equals and even friends, was available to- the litigants. 1. P. S. S, Doc, 52 of 1610 A, D. S. 21 CHAPTER X The Relifiom Policy 1. SWvi incarnated for the protection of Hindu religion la the words of saint Ramdas "there is no protector of religion like Shiva in this world. It is due to you that the Maharashtra religion has been saved.'* The first and foremost ideal put by the elders before the young Shivarai was the protection of his religion from the onslaughts of the Muslims who were styled Mlechhas. For instance, his preceptor Kond Deva impressed upon his receptive mind that ' the whole earth is trampled down by the foreigners. All places, forts and towns are full of their forces. Important places should be possessed by you. Hindu kings and Hindu forces should be secured by you for your assistance. You should perform difficult deeds by supreme industry and daring. Then you will obtain the blessings of saints and the approval of God for your success.' ' His father Sbahji asked the blessing of the god of Jejuri for the establishment of Shivaji's rule to relieve the sufferings of gods, cows and Brahmans and to revive the ancient religion. 9 In his famous letter to Shivaji, Shahjj expressed satisfaction at the extension of Swaraj for such a noble and high ideal. All the Marathi chronicles also emphasize the same ideal in so many places that it is impossible to reproduce all the evidences here. The Chitnis Chronicle opens with the introduction that " the Mlechha rule uprooted the Hindu religion from the earth. Gods, Brahmans, places of pilgrimage, cows and the people, all were undergoing oppressions of various kinds. Shivaji was born as an Avatara or Incarnation for the re-establishment of religion." The same thing is repeated in other sections. 3 The court poet Bhushan has given expression to the Same belief in unequivocal words. His lyric poetry is full of spirit and 1*5. Chitnis, sec. 18, 40. 41, 46, 51, &, 17, 80, 84, 85, 86. 100, 173. I7CT SHIVAJI THE GREAT be is at his best in extolling the work of Shivaji as the restorer and preserver of the Hindu religion. This famous poet was neither a Maratha nor a resident of Maharashtra, but a Brahman of the United Provinces. He eloquently expressed the feelings of the millions of Hindus on the superhuman work performed by Shivaji. Jrle has described him as an incarnation of Shiva, Vishnu and Indra. The Raja is likened to Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Narsinha and Buddha of the days of yore for the establishment of religion and the destruction of irreligion. He is said to have been born for the total annihilation of the Mlechhas, whose sword was a shield for the Deccan, a wall for the Hindus, and death for the Turks. 1 Just as the Muslim rulers took pride in calling themselves Ghazis, similarly Bhushan has given Shivaji the title of Ghazi, as he was the guardian of the Hindu religion. He has been likened to a hydra who swallowed the armies of the Moguls, 9 or to Narsinha, the Man-lion incarnate who tore to pieces the forces of his foes. 3 "Shiva preserved Hinduism and the emblems on the foreheads of the Hindus. By proctecting the Puranas and Smritis, he preserved the Vedic rites. He it was who prevented the capitals of the Rajput kings from falling into the hands of the Moguls. He preserved religion on this earth. He patronized men of genius. By his sword he dealt death-blows to the Moguls and kept peace in the world. He Spread the Maratha fame by conquering countries after countries. Moreover, he preserved the Vedas and Puranas; nay, the name of Rama could be called out by the Hindus only through the political force of Shivaji. He was the preserver of the sacred bunch of hair on the heads of Hindus, the sacred thread on their shoulders and 6f the rosary in their hands. The Moguls in general and their emperor in particular were laid low. All the foes were reduced to ashes. By means of his sword Shivaji kept safe the frontiers of / fcis kingdom. He preserved gods, temples and the family-deities. In short, he struck terror into the heart of Aurangzeb himself." 1. Shivaraj Bhuban, couplets II, 56, 71, 73, 75, 84, 142, 228, 348, 361. 2. Shiva Bhavani, coup. 48. 3. . Sen, Sh. Chh,, pp. 2, f, 153. THE RELIGIOUS POLICY 171 Such are the sentimental out-pourings of the famous poet Bhushan. Let us now turn to the passive saint Tukaram. He too described Shivaji as an Avatara who performed the duty of preserving religion and uprooting irreligion. The Maratha Raja was only twenty years old in 1650, when Tukaram is said to have died. Yet the saint is represented to have been so much impressed by the successes of the young dreamer that he declared him to be an Avatara or omniscient incarnation of God Shiva himself. But the militant and patriotic saint Ramdas was so deeply charmed with the personality of this struggling adventurer that he more than once described him as an incarnation of God in his inimitable language. It is not necessary to reproduce the noble sentiments expressed in the sHH^H JFCT * Dasabhodha-the Magnum Opus of Ramdas, but a few lines will not be out of place here. "The power l of the Mohamedans is gone The Mother Goddess who had bestowed a boon upon Shivaji has come with a bludgeon in her hand, and has killed the sinners of old in the Region of Bliss. I see the Goddess walking in the company of the King, intent upon devouring the wicked and the sinners. She has protected her devotees of old, and she will again protect them to-day. 1 ' Finally, we may bring in the important evidence of Ramchandra Pant * on the work of his master. Says he, " Shivaji rescued the Dharma, and established gods and Brahmans in their due places* He created a new type of administration for his territories, forts and armies, and conducted the government without hindrance and brought it under one system of co-ordination and control. He created wholly a new order of things. He forced Aurangzeb to immerse in a sea of agony and sorrow, and acquired for himself a world-wide and well-acknowledged fame." " This kingdom is for the good of the gods and Brahmans.' 1 * It did not exist either for the selfish ends of Shivaji or for the 1. R. D. Ranade, Mysticism in Maharashtra, P. 367. 2. Polity, p. 8. 3. 1 SHJVAJI THE GREAT welfare of the foreigners. All the resources of the state could be dedicated to the preservation of religion. It is now evident that Shivaji was not actuated by the selfish and devilish motive of amassing wealth by plunder, but by the highest and holiest aim of restoring and regenerating the Hindu religion and of establishing Swaraj. Shivaji considered himself a servant of religion. Consequently he had adopted a life of mendicancy and humble service for its propagation. Though he did not become a monk like Asoka, yet he did his best to protect, patronize and promulgate the Hindu religion. Like the great Asoka who made a gift of his empire to the Baudha Sangha, Shivaji is said to have made a gift of his kingdom to saint Ramdas, who returned the same to the Raja with the advice that the kingdom was not for his benefit but for the glorification of Dharma. Shivaji was required to spend his whole energy and wealth for the welfare of the Hindu religion. Thus from the beginning of his political career to the end of his life, Shivaji devoted himself heart and soul to the protection and propagation of his religion under the inspiration of his parents, his preceptor, the poets and the saints of the time. 2. Muslim persecution of the Hindus The Hindus were persecuted in the Muslim states of the Deccan, though in the north on account of the political and military power of the Rajput princes, their blood relationship with the Mogul Emperors, and the commendable policy of toleration begun by Akbar and partially continued by his two successors, the Hindus escaped from persecution for about a century. The papers collected by Mr. Parasnis include a long document containing the following instructions of Muhammad Adil Shah to his successors. "All the high posts should be reserved for the Muslims; none of /these should be given to Hindus, but clerkships mi/' be filled ty them. Even the richest Hindu should not be able to claitp equality with a poor Muslim. THE RELIGIOUS POLICY 1T8 In a quarrel between a Muslim and a Hindu the former should not be punished by the Kazi for doing a wrong to the Hindu. All classes of Hindus should be subjected to the Jazia. The clerk who is to receive this tax, should remain sitting, while the tax-paying Hindu, howsoever rich he may be, should remain standing before him till the tax is paid." l The duties of a judge (Kazi) are mentioned in two documents. In each of these he is instructed to break the Hindu idols in the temples of the Maratha people. 9 3. Lament of the saints A succession of thinkers, poets and saints from the mystical Dnyandeva to the militant Ramdas lamented the decline of the Hindu religion during more than three centuries. Mr. Bhat has brought together the passages in his famous Marathi book entitled Maharashtra Dharma. It is not necessary to refer to a summary of the laments of the saints here, since sidelights have already been given in the preceding pages from the writings of Tukaram, Ramdas and Bhushan. Such is the incontestible evidence of oppressions committed upon the Hindus by the Muslim rulers in the south. Even when there was no actual persecution, the very indifference of the state to the religious, moral, intellectual and artistic activities of their subjects, led to their rapid decline. 4. Shivaji's policy of religions equality We have seen how the Hindus had to pass their lives in the suffocating atmosphere of religious persecutions, temple-destruction, desecration of images, iconoclasm, social and communal inequalities, crushing taxes and the impoverishing ostracism from political life. In fact, they were helots in their own country. Oppression of centuries had made them fatalistic, unambitious and unprogressive. Shivaji saw the tide of persecution and oppression advancing from Delhi to the Deccan in the reign of Aurangzeb. He would have been justified in retaliating the fanaticism of the Muslim rulers and paying them in their own coins. But he was not a product of his times. He 1. Parmsnis, I. S., Vol. II. p. 26. 2, Wad and Parasnis-Sanadapatren, pp. V, 81. 174 . SHIVAJI THE GREAT rose far above the contemporary rulers of India and Europe in following a liberal policy of religious harmony, tolerance and equality. Herein lies his claim to greatness. 5. Shiraji'i protest against Aumogzeb fanaticism The letter written by Shivaji to Aurangzeb has been rightly described by Sir J. Sarkar as a masterpiece of clear logic, calm persuasion, and political wisdom. It enunciates certain universal principles and policies followed by the enlightened Mogul monarchs for the guidance of Aurangzeb and men of his creed. For instance, it is said that all men created by God are living examples of the nature of diverse creeds and temperament; that kingdoms prosper and the subjects become happy only when they repose in the cradle of peace and security ; that Islam and Hinduism are only terms of contrast ; and that in every place of worship whether it be called a mosque or a temple, the same God is worshipped by all. Further on, the monarch is reminded that even the Quran which is a Divine Book and the Word of God, styles Him the Lord ot all and not of Muslims only; that the Jazia was unlawful, impolitic, inexpedient and an innovation; that the tax might have been justified, if there was perfect security in his empire, but everywhere there was insecurity and unsafely, and the subjects were being plundered; that the Hindus already crushed by heavy taxes were living in abject poverty. It was improper for the richest emperor on earth to covet the beggar's bowl and levy Jazia from monks, paupers, Brahmans, mendicants, famine-stricken and ruined wretches. It was no heroism on his part to oppress ants and flies. If he possessed any valour at all, he should first collect the tax from Udaipur or from the writer of this letter. Aurangzeb had already lost many forts and provinces, and Shivaji would leave no stone unturned in further ravaging and devastating his territories in case the Emperor persisted in the 'policy of continuing ttie Jazia* The Lord of the Peacock Throne- blinded by fanaticism and imperial might, paid no heed to these convincing arguments. But Shivaji had lighted a fire which could not be easily extinguished. He had succeeded in creating an THE RELIGIOUS POLICY 175 indomitable spirit of resistance, a sense of honour, an intense feeling of patriotism and an irrepressible will of independence ^amongst the unified Marathas, so that Aurangzeb could not suppress them with his myriads of mercenaries. The Raja set a noble example of perfect security and religious -equality for all his subjects. In that age of fanaticism and intolerance he was the first Indian ruler who attempted to found an empire broadly based upon the welfare and benefit of all his subjects. Shivaji was no less zealous than Aurangzeb in devotion to his own religion, yet as a ruler he allowed every religion to prosper in a free atmosphere under his protection. He was the patron of all religions and the real guardian of his people. 6. Islim patronized by Shivaji 1. After the murder of Afzal Khan, a large part of the Bijapur territory came into the possession of Shivaji. The latter was a mere Mokasedar of such 'districts as Poona, Indapur, Chakan, Supa and Baramati. Now he became an independent ruler of these parts. Therefore he ordered his officers to continue the charities to both the Hindus and Muslims as these were prevalent before the regime of Afzal Khan. He did not discriminate against the Muslims, even though Afzal is said to have desecrated the temples of Tuljapur and Pandarpur, 2. Even Aurangzeb himself gave him the certificate of being the " Defender of the Muslim religion " in his letters * of 14th July, 1659, 26th Aug. and 28th Aug., 1666 and 5th March, 1668. These four documents cover a period of ten years. 3. Dr. Fryer visited Kalyan and has paid a glowing tribute to Shivaji's policy of tolerance. 9 4. Grant Duff has truly said that, " Shivaji never sequestrated -any allowance fixed by the Mahomedan Government for the support of tombs, mosques, or places of commemoration in honour of saints." 8 5. Dr. DelIon, a great contemporary traveller and writer, records that Shiva tolerated all religions and that he was looked "upon as one of the most politic princes in these parts. 4 1. Raj. VIII, 14, 15, 16 documents. 2. Fryer, VoL I, p. 41o. 3. History of the Mahrattas, p. 104. 4. Eng, Records, II, 548. THE GRfeAT 6. Khafi Khan is conspicuous in his hatred of Shivaji, and in his history, he rarely does justice to his work. Even on the ddmtse of this great warrior and conqueror, the historian made a chronogram of the date of his death by saying that " the infidel went to hell." Yet he pays a glowing tribute to this " Hell-dog " for his religious tolerance in these words : " But he made it a rule that whenever his followers went plundering, they should do no harm to Muslims, the Book of God, or any one's women. Whenever a copy of the Holy Kuran came into his hands, he treated it with respect and gave it ta some of his Mahomedan followers. When the women of any Hindu or Mahomedan were taken prisoners by his men and they had no friend to protect them, he watched over their liberty." Further on, he remarks that " he entirely abstained from other disgraceful acts, and was careful to maintain the honour of the women and children of Mahomedans when they fell into his hands. His injunctions upon this point were very strict, and any one who disobeyed them received punishment/' 7. Shivaji paid respect to both Hindu and Muslim saints and sought their blessings. His interview with Baba Yaqut of Kelshi near Janjira is worthy of notice. He went to receive the blessing of this hermit for the conquest of Janjira. To his surprise the saint left the seat and walked off. Shivaji followed him. Thereupon the hermit returned to his seat, and finding the Raja very anxious to receive a boon from him, he pulled out a white hair from his moustache and handed it to him. The Raja entrusted it to an accompanying officer for making an amulet. The hair was afterwards lost, and it was believed that, therefore, Janjira could not be reduced by Shivaji. 1 7. Employment of Muslins 1. Shivaji freely employed Muslim soldiers who flocked to his banner from the Bijapur, Golconda and Mogul rulers from 1650 onwards. Although these men were mere mercenaries and many of them were Pathans and Persians, >et they did not renounce his cause, or show any treason to him, but very faithfully served him up to his death. 1. Vftkatkar, 91 Q. Bakbff, p. 130. S. 22 THE RELIGIOUS Poucj 177 2. Evan Siddi Sambal who bad been his deadly enemy, and bis son-in-law, Siddi Misri accepted Shivaji's service, and continued to faithfully serve his son Sambhaji. One Shama Khan was a cavalry-officer. 3. Two of the admirals of his fleet were Ibrahimkhan and Daulatkhan. There were other Muslim officers, including the two Siddis mentioned above. Thus the Maratha fleet which was constantly at war with the Abyssinian and Mogul fleets, was manned and officered by Muslims. 4. One Quazi Haider was a high officer in the service of Shivaji. After the Raja's death, he migrated to Delhi and rose to be chief justice under Aurangzeb. 5. The castle of Phonda was captured by the Raja after much bloodshed. The first governor appointed by him to rule over such an important place was a Muslim. 6. The Bakhars have related a remarkable story of the devotion of his servants and officers to their master. A Muslim boy who was a faithful page, accompanied him to Agra. He was fully in the know of the plot and was left alone to serve Hiroji Farzand who impersonated Shivaji on the sick-bed at Agra. Both of them left the house on the pretext of bringing medicine for the patient, but were seized and severely beaten to give out details of the plot. The Muslim boy was expected to expose the Kafir ( heretic } in the cause of Islam, but he refused up to the last to give out the secret. Such a devotion to duty and love for the master, even at the loss of life, are rare in history ; but Shivaji'? greatness and overpowering personality impelled his servants to sacrifice their lives cheerfully for him. In short, Shivaji appointed Muslims in the military, naval and civil services. Even his personal service was not barred to them. He showed respect to Muslim saints, gave funds to their religious institutions, and continued their old grants. Such * national and liberal policy in that age of religious persecution places Shivaji in die tank of the greatest rulers like Harsha, Sher Shah and Akbar. 178 ^SHIVAJI THE GREAT t. EedutttiM or Shridfci Shivaji and his mother were both very liberal in their religious outlook. They realized the danger of the extinction of Hinduism by the constant drain of apostates to Islam and Christianity. Therefore they tactfully conquered the prejudices and opposition of the orthodox Hindus against reclaimed Muslims, (l) Bajaji Nimbalkar, the ruler of Phaltan was brought back to Hinduism. The Raja gave his own daughter in marriage to Bajaji's son to show to the public that the Nimbalkars were restored to the rights and privileges of the Hindu society. This historic conversion is represented in a painting preserved in the Prince of Wales Museum, Bombay. (2) The second glorious case is that of Netaji Palkar, the famous commander of the Maratha cavalry. He accepted Islam in the Mogul service, but was won back after ten years. The Raja took him back in the Hindu fold and bestowed a high military rank upon him. (3) Shivaji led frequent expeditions into the Portuguese territory for preventing forcible proselytism of the Hindus into Christians. He required the Christian fathers to accept Hinduism as punishment for their activities in converting Hindus to their religion. In 1667 " he cut off the heads of four padres ! that refused to turn Marathas of his own persuasion, they having counselled the destruction of all that were opinionated as themselves; which so terrified the Viceroy that he was forced to revoke his fierce and severe edict. Shivaji burnt and destroyed all the country, and carried away 150 lack of pagodas/ 9 Thus he was not only ready to take back apostates, but even persons of other religions were welcome into Hinduism. (4) Shivaji issued a proclamation to the Hindus of Go& in 1668. An extract from it will reveal the intensity of his religious and patriotic sentiments and the means adopted by him to prevent conversion. Here is a small extract from the long document. " Slaughter of the most revered cows by Yavanas and Mlechhas, destruction of our Hindu temples, disrespect of our all-honoured and all-pervading religion shown by these low people, violation of the most sacred chastity of our sisters and mothers brought about by these villains such horrible things happen constantly. . Does it become us who call 1. Shtoji. Part III, p, 5GB. THE RELIGIOUS POUCY I7t ourselves Kshatriyas to silently see these acts like cowards, and to turn a deaf ear to them ? Alas ! Alas ! It is a most shameful thing that instead of striving restlessly till death for the uplift of our country which should be dear to us like our parents, we should be whiling away our time foolishly, tactlessly and indifferently even in the critical times like the present. What more deplorable thing can there be than the fact that we, with our own hands, should destroy our houses, our gods, our religion and culture by adopting a fawning attitude towards the Mlechhas, only for the sake of a little livelihood ? " * (5) Here is some English evidence on the religious policy of Shivaji towards the Portuguese. Both the parties used to " daily quarrel, the cheifest cause of his hatred to them being for forcing orphans of his caste to turn Roman Catholics." (6) The Captain of Bassien turned against the Jesuits for bringing troubles on the state by their proselytizing zeal, and even went to the length of burning their houses. Thus it is clear that a very great pressure was brought by Shivaji on the Portuguese government for stopping conversion.* (7) He was ever watchful against insults offered to his co-religionists by the Siddis. He even invested Bombay for the return of Brahmans who had been kidnapped by the Siddi and kept there. The English severely punished the culprits, returned the Brahmans, and thus saved the island from invasion. That Shivaji was far in advance of his times in respect of conversion to Hinduism, is proved by the fact that even after the lapse of 260 years, the Hindus are still opposed to the Shuddhi movement. The greatness of Shivaji is manifest from the conquest of the deep-rooted orthodoxy of the fanatic Brahmans of his time. 9. The Hindus, a nation The Hindus of the time of Sbivaji were divided and sub-divided into hundreds of castes and territorial groups. Even the Brahmans of Maharashtra were divided into three 1. tftivfc* mfrr cfafffl by w* witft vmJHK P. 112. ^. Shiraji, II, 521. HOT. 1675. ISO SHIVAJI THE GREAT mutually warring groups of the Konkan, Karad and the Desh. Their jealousies have continued even up till now. They do not inter-marry and inter-dine with each other. Similarly, the Marathas were divided into numerous sub-castes. The jealousies of the Bhosales, Ghorpades, Shirkes, Ghatages, Mores, Nimbalkars, and Dafles are well-known. The struggle of the Prabhus, Saraswats and Brahmans against each other and against the Marathas was no less keen. The lower classes, touchables and untouchables, were helots Of the society. There was not even a pretence to social equality. The greatness of Shivaji is evident from the attempts made by him to harmonize these antagonistic elements. He put an end to their struggles by giving each group opportunity to serve the state, by infusing into them the spirit of common nationality and an indomitable spirit of resistance to the foreigner. He quickened into them the sense of preserving their religion, race and culture from the onslaughts of the Muslims, and of self-confidence in their energies. The Mawal peasants, the Hetkari labourers, the wild tribes of the Ramoshis and Bhils, the untouchables like Mangs and Mahars, the advanced classes made up of the Brahmans and Prabhus, the military people like the Marathas, one and all were united together for the service of the state. He showed to the Hindu world that a Brahman was not merely an expert in pen, but could boldly wield the sword, lead armies, and defeat even the invincible Moguls. Moreover, the wild tribes and passive peasants were turned into loyal and indomitable soldiers. The welfare, prosperity and progress of the state were the aims for which all the castes and groups were to work under the magnetic guidance of his constructive genius. The saints furthered this cause of political unification and social fusion of castes by their forceful preaching. Just read the blood-stirring appeal of saint Ramdas. " Die for the sake of religion, but do not die till you have killed others. Our Raj should be won back by killing and murdering others* In normal times kings should do their royal duties, Kshatriyas should perform the duties of a Kshatriya, Brahmans should do theirs in all ways. But, if at all, gods are destroyed, death is better .than THE RELIGIOUS POLICY life itself. Then it should be understood that even one's own religion is destroyed. All Marathas should be brought together, our Maharashtra Religion should be furthered. If no endeavour is made to save it, our ancestors will laugh at us. There is no doubt at all that enemies of our gods are all dogs, and should be thoroughly destroyed. Devotees of gods will surely become victorious. " Gods should be raised to the head. All the people together should raise a cry, and the destroyer of our territory should be extirpated for the sake of establishing Dharma. For this purpose discrimination, thought and unending effort should be adopted as occasion arises. Rama killed Rdvan through the boon of Goddess Tulaja. Oh ! this Goddess Tulaja Bhavani is the famous boon-giver of Rama. For this reason Ramdas contemplates her in his mind. 1 " Such stirring appeals of intensive nationalism must have brought about national unity and religious awakening throughout Maharashtra. The work of the saints in furthering religious reforms among all classes of the people is discussed in the next chapter. 1. B. V. Bhmt, ttah. Db., p. 184. CHAPTER XI e and Reformation 1. Spread of Bjtticism under the Yadavas Under the free atmosphere of the Devagiri Yadavas towards the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th century, there arose a galaxy of saints who were the founders and propagators of mysticism in Maharashtra. Dnyandeva, a Brahman ( 1271-1294 ); Namadeva, a tailor; Gora,. a potter; Samvata, a gardener; Narahari, a goldsmith; Choka, an untouchable; Sena, a barber; Janabai, a maid-servant; Kanhopatra, a dancing girl; these form a group of teachers who were working: together for the spread of democratic mysticism. It has been aptly remarked that ' the gates of the Bhakti school were ever open. Whoever entered was hailed as a brother, nay more, was honoured as a saint. All were santas. Age and sex, caste and class, breathed not in this equalising air. For five successive centuries, Maharashtra was the abode of that noblest and truest of all Democracies, the Democracy of the Bhakti School.' ' 2. Results of religions persecution The fall of the Yadava Empire, the foundation of the Bahamani kingdom and the aggressions of Muslims in the Deccan, smothered the light of Bhakti lit up by the said saints. With the spread of Islam, oppression grew apace. The Muslim rulers in India demolished the temples of the Hindus and Jains; built mosques instead; burnt libraries ; abolished Mathas or religious houses and monasteries; discouraged education, literature and art; and tried numerous means to tempt and force Hindus into their fold. The process of conversion went on increasing with the growth and deepening of the Muslim rule in India. The Aryan culture and social structure found no place in the new polity. Classical literature bad a rapid decline. Thousands of schools died out or were forcibly closed down. The masses began to sink deeper and deeper into illiteracy 1. R. D. Ranade, Mysticisjn in Maharashtra, p. 409. RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION 183 and ignorance. In fact, the study of letters had perished for alt except a few Brahmans, merchants and upper classes. 3. Political condition* favourable to recradetcewe of religion thoifhft The lamp of Bhakti remained flickering for two centuries. (a) During the 16th century the dissensions of the Deccani and foreign Muslims led the kings and the court parties to depend upon the good-will of their Hindu subjects and the Hindu nobility. Persecution and intolerance naturally declined in the Muslim states. (b) The presence of high Hindu officials and lords in the Deccan states blunted the edge of persecution, (c) Then therrf arose a constant danger of Mogul invasion of the Deccan from the close of the 16th century. The rulers of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur and Oolconda were naturally anxious to win the sympathy of their subjects and thereby continue the existence of their states, otherwise these were in danger of being absorbed in the Mogul Empire. All these political causes produced an atmosphere of freedom of thought and of religious liberty. In such a liberal atmosphere, Ekanatha, Tukaram and their disciples preached mysticism, condemned caste, and expounded means for the purification of the Hindu religion. This movement received special impetus from Shahji and his son Ekoji in the Karnatic and by Shivaji and his successors in Maharashtra. While on one side the reformation movement served to further the cause of Swaraj, on the other, it was strengthened and advanced by the Swaraj. In fact, reformation and Swaraj are causally related to each other. 4. The Renaissance With the establishment of Swaraj a new era dawned upon Maharashtra. The patronage shown to scholars and saints by Shahji and Shivaji produced a renaissance here. No other period of history can be said to be so rich in saints, seers and scholars, poets, prophets and philosophers as that of Shahji and Shivaji. They released forces of life in all spheres. The minds of Hindus were filled with the joy of political liberty and religious freedom from foreign oppression. The elevating spirit of security -of religion and property permeated the people. Released from the shackles of centuries, the Hindu mind cfluld have free flights in the 184 SHWAJI THE GREAT spiritual sphere, and in the realms of poetry and literature. There* was a real quickening of intellectual, literary and religious life in the whole of Maharashtra, when persecution was replaced by encouragement and indifference by patronage. The period became amazingly remarkable for the flowering of the genius, so that seers, scholars and saints achieved such a fame that they have left their glory to our own day. 5. The Reformation These saints began to shed spiritual light by speaking to the people in their own tongue, instead of in the Sanskrit language which was an all-India medium for the- learned alone. During the 16th century pious men well-known for their saintly character, devotional spirit, spiritual gifts and a forceful literary style, preserved Hinduism by popularizing such classics as the Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita and the Puranas. They stimulated men's minds for spiritual culture, created a love for their ancient religion and polity; and finally blunted the edge of Muslim intolerance. Thus this reformation movement was miraculously effective in safeguarding the Hindu religion and neutralizing the aggressions of Islam. It created a valuable literature in Marathi; served to unify the nation by removing caste-distinctions; raised the Shudras and the outcastes to the social status and spiritual power of the Brahmans ; improved the status of women and sanctified family life ; brought about a reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims and thus made the whole nation more tolerant than before; it checked the excesses of polytheism ; it condemned all external forms of religion by emphasizing love and faith as the means of realizing God. In the words of the late Justice Ranade,. " it tended in all these ways to raise the nation generally to a higher level of capacity both of thought and action, and prepared it, in a way no other nation in India was prepared, to take the lead in re-establishing a united native power in the place of foreign domination." 1 C. The re?i?al of old celts was the greatest feature of the religious life of the 15th and 16th centuries. The worship of U Baaafe, ft, M. P., ?, 172. S. 23 RENAISSANCE AND REFORMATION Vithoba and Dattatreya was popularized by five saints hi Maharashtra. Bhanudas ( 1448-1513 ) brought back the idol of Vithoba from Vijayanagar to Pandharpur, and thoroughly devoted himself to ite worship. Thereby the cult of Vithoba was revived and strengthened by him in Maharashtra. Narasinha Saraswati flourished about the middle of the 15th" century, as is seen from a reference in the Guru-Charitra, a work by Gangadhar who was a famous disciple of the saint. No work of Narasinha Saraswati is so far known, but he was responsible mainly for the spread of devotion to Dattatreya in Maharashtra, The Guru-Charitra is the sacred book of this sect. Janardan Swami ( 1504-1575 ), the famous Guru of Ekanatha, was in the service of a Muhammedan officer in the fort of E)evagiri. He was a great devotee of Dattatreya, and is known in Maharashtra, more on account of his numerous disciples than by any literary work. 7. Saint Ekaoatha was a descendant of Bhanudas and the- foremost disciple of Janardan Swami. Given to the devotion of God from his early childhood, he rejuvenated Bhagvat Dharma in Maharashtra. Being a close student of Dnyaneshwari, he gave anew version of that famous poem. Ekanatha's main work is his melodious commentary on the llth chapter of the * Maha-Bhagvat.' His * Rukmini-Swayamvar ' too has captured the hearts of so m&ny people that it is widely read by girls expectant of marriage. He may be said to have lived from 1533 to 1599 A. D. Ekanatha made the ideas of Vedanta familiar to the man in the street. " With Jnanadeva, philosophy had reigned in the clouds; with Ekanatha, it came upon the earth and dwelt among men. He championed thft voiceless millions, espousing the cause of the vernaculars. His heart went out to the spiritually blind and mute, and he knew that the way to teach them was to approach them through their own mother tongue." The sixteenth cefitury qtt|ed with the pregnant teachings of turi*mda half the peopte of , SHIVAJT THE GREAT Had been partly aroused, by the writings of thi$ saint* and his few disciples. Among these the following four have played an important role in the spread of the Bhagvat Dharma. Dasopant, one of the closest disciples of the saint, was a member of the Ekanatba Mystic Circle. He is the author of the biggest Marathi commentary on the Bbagvadgita containing li lacks of couplets. He lived from 1551 to 1615 A. D. Jani Janardan, another famous follower of Ekanatha, is an author of many philosophical and devotional verses. He died in 1601 A. D. Rama Janardan and Vitjhal Renukanandan also belong to the Ekanatha Circle. Like the other three saints and scholars, they contributed much to ennoble the social and religious atmosphere of the time. Vishnudas, Madhavdas, Mahalingdas, Tryambakraj, Krishnadas and Krishna Yadnyavalki were the other most famous poets contemporary with Ekanatha. One Muslim saint, born of the royal Bahamani dynasty, accepted Hinduism and was called Mrityumjaya Swami. He is the writer of numerous works on devotion and mysticism in Marathi. 1 The life-work of Ekanatha, his followers and contemporaries consisted in preaching the devotion of God even to the outcastes. This sect became very popular through its doctrine of " equality in devotion." 8. The immortal Tokarim Now we come to another luminary in the religious sphere. His light has not faded, but has grown brighter with the lapse of centuries. He is the immortal Tukaram who has been a pillar of light and peace to millions of persons in Maharashtra. He was born in 1608 in a Shudra family which was given to the worship of Vithoba. He lost his parents at the age of thirteen and used to earn his livelihood by business. But he became more and more engaged in study and meditation, and ultimately turned a recluse. He began to compose verses, and gave numerous sermons to the people on spiritual topics and on the worship of Vithoba. His fame soon spread far and wide. Even Shivaji is said to have attended his sermons. He was able to attract a large Dumber of devoted disciples who, inspired by the en-eat ffenius ol I> S, K, Altekar, Sbri Sapartba Cb,, pp, 4U-41 RENAISSANCE AN& REFORMATION their preceptor, became preachers of hte doctrines. In theSvordft of Prof. Bhate, "by satire, by ridicule, by cajolery and by supplication, he tried his best to reform tbe society of his timfc. Thus he was a radical reformer of social customs and ideas. 1 The influence of Tukaram over men of his time was wonderful. Thufc Tukaram was under the class of saints and teachers who have beeu prophets of all ages.' 1 f 9. Disciples of Tnkiram Moraya Gosawi and his son Chintamani of Chinchwad were the devoted followers of TukaramL The former was a famous saint in the early period of Shivaji and composed the Ganesh Purana. He is said to have often visited Ramdas. Thirteen other learned disciples of Tukaram vigorously carried on the work of the master in various places. These were the centres of light, unity, devotion, spiritual solace and social refornp among Hindus of all castes* We find among them Marathas* Brahmans, oilmen, gardeners, etc. Their names are Rameshvara, Qangadhar, Kond Bhatt, Santaji Teli, Navaji Mali, Shivaji Kasar* Abaji Joshi, Kondpatil, Mahadaji Pant, Gavarshet, Malji Gade, Malharpant Kulkarni, Konhoba, the younger brother of saint Tukaram.* The names of a few more disciples who composed literary works were : Bhojling, Nagesha, Vithal Nand, Uddhav Chitgh&n* Sidhapal, Ranganath of Mogre, Niranjan of Karad, Vithal of Kalapur, Ganeshnath, Niloba, etc. 10. Contemporaries of Tukaram Many more saints and poets richly contributed to the reformation and literary renaissance by their sermons and writings. The names of the outstanding personalities 3 are given below. i J Mukteshwara ( 1608-1660 ), a grandson of saint Ekanatha, ranks very high as a poet. His Marathi version of the Ramfcyana, the Mahabharata and other books has survived up till now. He was a contemporary of Tukaram. 1. G. C. Bhate, History of Modern Marathi Literature, p. 27, 2. J. R. AJagfconkar, Tukaram, pp. 163-181. 3. S. K. Altekar, Sbri Sanmrtlm CbM pp, 417-428. Swv4ji THE GREAT of 4fie ymiest posts of TffriiaHu4*im He was qioNmd *wsa>e wpcks -in that Impose. H^ was a most prolific writer of Marathi works. * There are numerous works written by Ramavailabbadas which have escaped the ravages of time. He was born at Daulatabad in 1610. Shivakalyan flourished in the first half of the 17th century. He was a brilliant commentator on Dnyaneshwari, and a writer of books on Rama and Krishna. Lolimbaraj of Junnar was another poet-saint of great fame. He also composed a work on medicine by name " Vaidyajivan " in 1633. Shamaraja much influenced the religious thought of his time by writing Marathi commentaries on the Upanishads, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Bhagvata. Bodhale Buva of Dhamangaon was one of those famous saints who were well known for their poetry and devotion. He was a composer of Abhangas. Raghunatha Swami of Nasik was also a great devotee of Rama* He used to take the Ganges water to Rameshwaram and its water was carried back to Benares. Another Raghunatha was a Marathi poet of a very high order. Mention must be made of the celebrated poets like Shivaram, Mukund, Muchkund, Kashi, etc. 11. The Naked Messiah of Blabtrasbtni We now come to Ramdas, the greatest saint of Shivaji's time. Born in 1608 at Jainb in the Nizam's territory, he left his home to the surprise x>f all at the age of twelve years during the performance of his marriage ceremony. He spent the pext twelve years in celebacy, mentation a&4 realization of God by performing religious austerities. Then he visited the holy places of the Hindus throughout the length and breadth of India for twelve years. During his long travels he personally observed the religious, social and political condition of the Hindus in northern ap<} southern India, His soul must have been deeply stirred at the Degradation of the masses and RENAISSANCE To* nagfat faav* been thinking oat the means ojf tfctir saiv^ttoa and poiiticfd deJUwiwnc*. In oneof toppere rfce Swjuai says that ' the people are oppressed by the Muhammedanfl, witfc the result that many are starving. -Life and property are in (footer and farced conversions are taking pl^ce. Human corpses are left on the ground uaeared for, while those who are living have insufficient clothing.' He made up his mind to found a new cult for the worship of Rama, and selected Chafal in the Satara district as a fit centre for his Math. He built there a temple of Rama and Hanuman, and began to preach the glorious deeds of the epic hero and his own principles of religion. Then he devoted ten years of his life ( 1654-1664 ) at Shivathar near Mahableshwar in writing a most inspiring work called Dasbodh, the magnum opus of the Ramdasi cult. He had an extraordinary power of organization and a remarkable genius of selecting right men for conducting Maths in many important places throughout India. His magnetic personality, his unsullied chaiacter, his burning zeal, his vast learning, his -grim earnestness, and his sweet eloquence inspired hundreds of men and women to devote themselves to his cause. They readily renounced the world, and became recluses like him. They took the sacred vow of propagating the Ramdasi cult amongst the people. He had indeed an unparalleled success in producing thousands of devoted disciples and followers. This naked Swami infused a new life among the masses. He can be rightly styled the naked Messiah of Maharashtra. 12. The work ef the Messiah A list of 111 disciples has been -given by a biographer of Ramdas. Out of these 55 disciples were in charge of monasteries which were established from one end of India to another. Rameshwaram, Badrikedar, Dwarka, Benares,. -Ayodhaya, Muttra, Alkhabad, Tanjore, Kanheri, Shrishaila, Kaajivaram, Karanja, Telangan, Pandharpur, Surat, Jatnb, Chafal, Hiraj were the important centres for the propaganda of the tfult of JRamdas. The worship of Ramp-$e ^onquerpr of the 190 SfflVAji THE GREAT and the deification of Marati 'the personification of devotion and* physical force* were taught to the people. Thus all these placed became centres of politico-relifclous preaching for religious reform. Swaraj and unity among the Hindus. When Shivaji himself and high officials like Nilo Sondeva, Ramchandra Pant, Balaji Avaji*. Prahlad Pant, etc. became disciples of the Swami, his mission must have received special strength among the masses. We will now name a few most prominent disciples who carried on the work of the master. The male disciples of Ramdas form a very large- galaxy of poets and saints. Shrestha was the elder brother of Ramdas ; his real name was Gangadhat, but he used to call himself Kami-Ram das. Two or three works on devotion such as Bhakti-Rahasya and Sulabhopaya were written by him. He died in 1677. Jayaram Swami of Vadgaon and Ranganath Swami of Nigadi were called his sons by Guru Ramdas. The latter was devoted to the Ananda school of philosophy, and wrote a good many books on the Bhakti cult, such as Guru-Gita, Panchikarana, Shukarambha-Samvad and Yoga-Vasishthasara. He lived from 1612 to 1684. Anandamurti of Brahmanal in the Satara district and Keshav Swami of Hyderabad were other prominent disciples who founded Maths for the propagation fof the Ramdasi principles. Uddhav, a poet of great renown, was another distinguished disciple of the Swami. He was in charge of the two Maths at Takali and Indur in the Nizam's territory. Kalyan, the greatest of the disciples of the saint, was in charge- of the Domgaon Math ( 1678-1714 ). Diwakar Gosavi and Vasudeva Gosavi were highly respected disciples of the Swami. One Dinakar Gosavi, another disciple of Ramdas, was a great poet. He was 1. Additional disciples were : Bhimaji Sahapurkar, Trimbak, Dmradas, Mahadeva, Mnsalram, Mauni Gopavi, Bbolaram, Anantabhaty. Dftttatrey*,- , Xodandaram, Hanumant, Divakarbbat, Bajipant Sahapurkar, Maharodra of Berar*. tealakaram, Sbrfdhar of Ramtek, Bhairar of Gokarna, Janardan of Surat, ShiTtan? of Telangan, Sadathira of Faichur.

RENAISSANCE* ANIT REFORMATION ift =at the head, of the Tisgaon Math ixr the- Ahmednagar distripfe Giridhar Swami, one of the most prolific writers, is the famous author of the Samartha Pratapa which records the events in Ramdas's life. ^ . 13. WOMB Saiits The era of Shivaji also gave birth to poets and saints among women who furthered the cause of the reformation* Bahinabai (1628-1700), Venubai ( D. 1678), Premabai, Akkabai, and Ambikabai are pre-eminent among them. The names of eighteen female saints can be traced. Bahinabai was the disciple of Tukaram, and she used to attend the sermons of Jayaram Swami -at Kolhapur. She spent about 60 years in composing verses on the love of God and on high moral ideas. Venubai was born at Miraj and passed her married life at Kolhapur. She became one of the greatest disciples of Ramdas and was appointed head of the monastery at Miraj. Her Sita- Svayamvar * is a work of a high order. She has her S&m$dhi at Sajjangad. Akka worked zealously for the cause for forty years after the saint's death. She built a great temple of Rama at Sajjangad. One Satibai was in charge of the Maruti temple at Shahapur. Bayabai, Ambabai, and Premabai, other disciples of Ramdas, were well-known as poetesses, ' while Sakhabai, Rukminibai, Manabai, Gangabai* Godabai, etc. were also very -devoted disciples of the Swami. Thus females were not only initiated in the Ramdasi cult, but they were made heads of maths to preach and propagate the principles of the new faith. 14. Muslim Saiitt Even Muslims were so much inspired by the new spiritual atmosphere that they became worshippers of Vithal or Vishnu. Shekh Muhammad of Chambhargonda is one of those recluses. His Marathi works in poetry like Pavana Vijaya, Dnyanasagar, etc. possess a real merit. His followers observe the Ramzan an4 Ekadashi fasts up to this day. Shekh Sultan and Shekh Farid were the other Muslim saints of the period. . Bawa Yaqut of Kelstii near Janjira, a Muslim saint of repute* 1. S. K. Altekar, Sbri Samartha CJiaritra* pp. 234+419.: SfflVAji THE GREAT was approached by the Raja for blessings to capture the fort of Rajatrar. 15. fawaal cmrtfcct witk frfftts - Shivaji came into special contact with a few prominent saints. Mauni Bawa or * the silent saint ' of Maharashtra who had established himself at Patgaon near the formidable fort of Rangna in the inaccessible hills of the Sahyadri, was one of them. His fame for piety spread all over Maharashtra. Shivaji went to him to seek benediction fdr his success in the Karnatic expedition. This saint gave him an assurance of victory. Therefore on his return Shivaji made SL donation of Rs. 400 per annum for distributing free meals to all visitors of the Math. It still continues under the patronage of the Kolhapur rulers. Sitalpuri, a very pious Sanyasi of Benares, was invited and made his preceptor by Shivaji. He was allowed to stay at the holy town of Sangameshwar, afterwards famous for the capture of Sambhaji by the Moguls. He is named Achalpuri by Chitnis (78). Parmanand Gosavi of Poladpur and 'Narain Ashram of Trimbakeshwsr were highly honoured and served by Shivaji. Similarly, another Hindu saint Parmanand was also approached by Shivaji ' for benedictions. The famous Hindu poet Bhushan has earned a great reputation by writing stirring heroics on the Raja. He was along with his elder brother first in the service of Aurangzeb, but he left the latter in disdain and accepted the patronage of the Maratha ruler whom he immortalized in his ' Shiva Bhushan ' and ' Shiva Bhavani.' 16. Encouragement of Sanskrit An illiterate man could hardly have any love for the ancient and dead language of the Hindus. He would have patronized Marathi authors, but Shivaji gave special patronage to Sanskrit. A few works of the time have come down to us. One celebrated Sanskrit poet Jayaram wrote the " Story of the Capture of Panhata Hill " describing the heroic' exploits of Shivaji. He is also the author of the well-known historical novel entitled ' Radha-Madnav Vilas Champu.' This poet lived at the cburt of Shahji in the fcarn&tic. 1. 91 Q. B. Vftttklr, pp, *8-I31. 1. Sfari 9amarth Ch., pp, 210, 4*0. S. 24 RENAISSANCE AND REFOIOIATION was given the titles of the 'Lord of Poets' and * Indrfc among poets ' for his extraordinary poetic gifts. He was first patronized by Sbahji in the Karnatic, and then by Shivaji in Maharashtra. He planned a historical Purana of 100 chapters on the life of Shivaji and his ancestors. Only 31 chapters are now available of this epic, and these bring the story of Shivaji's life up to 1660. The remaining chapters are not yet available* The poet was intimately connected with the court and politics of Shivaji's time. He accompanied or followed his master to Agra and was arrested by the Moguls in Dec. 1666. Nothing further is known of his life and work, but his sons and grandsons were gifted with poetic genius and these were patronized by the successors of Shivaji. Gafabhat who was known as the Brahmadeva and Vyas of his age, wrote a historic poem entitled the " Rise of the Sun Shiva." It was a work on religious and social duties. Another work of his on polity called " Samayanaya " is traced by Aufrecht in the MSS. Library of Florence. Krishna Jyetisbi was entrusted with the work of correcting the Calendar, so that he wrote out ' Karna-Kaustubha.' i Taka, a disciple of Brahmanand, used to live at Satara. This Sanskrit scholar translated Sanskrit works into Marathi. Raghanath Haaamote wrote the ' Vyavahara Kosha ' wherein the Persian and Arabic words then current in Muslim India were translated into Marathi and Sanskrit. All the words then current in political circles for administrative, legal, judicial, financial and military affairs have been rendered into Sanskrit or contemporary Marathi. It is indeed a most useful contribution. He also wrote a Marathi work on Nala and Damayanti. Then Gorfod lanre, the author of " Shiva-Rajyabhisheka -Kalpataru " and the rival of Gagabbat, deserves a passing notice. Even at the Tanjoce court in the Karnatic there were contemporary scholars who wrote works in Saaskrftor Marathi 494 SHIVAJJ THE GREAT Besides Rfighunarh Pandit, Madfcav, Bhimaswami, Afta&d Taaaya, and Gosavi Nandaq were well-known amongst them. 1 ' This large number of saints purified the spiritual atmosphere bf their time from 1640 to 1690 with their sublime writings and preachings. Besides these celebrities, there must have been a great many ordinary poets. AH these produced a vast literature on a variety of subjects. An idea of their literary activity can be had from the fact that Dasopant's works cover two lakh couplets, while Ekanatha, Shivakalyan, Krishna Yadnyavalki contributed approximately sixty thousand couplets each. 17. Shi?aji inpplied the urge to reformation : Mr. Justice E. Abbot has partially stated the truth by remarking that ' the light spreads all through that century; and it cannot be thought that Shivaji escaped from being touched by it, while seeking to carry out what he considered his life's work.' Shivaji was not merely an on -looker or a passive subject to receive these religious and spiritual influences, but he was supplying the necessary urge by various means, so that the wonderful flowering of genius and outburst of spiritualism were mainly due to him. By starting the new department of religion under a minister he encouraged scholars and religious men to devote themselves to study and spiritual unfoldment. Hundreds of religious men were relieved of worldly cares by his munificent gifts* He gave five lakh pagodas to Keshav Swami at Hyderabad.* The holy men were protected, encouraged and enthused by the royal patron to carry on their religious propaganda free from Muslim persecution. There was a universal feeling of joy and pride in the country that a saviour of Hindu religion was born in the person of Shivaji. Numerous saintly persons devoted themselves to revive with unusual enthusiasm the dethroned and detested religion of the Hindus. Shivaji h&d consequently a very active share in r- JJ " quickening the twin movements of renaissance and riforjnation TO Maharashtra. V I. SbriiSmmmitba Ch., pp. 210, 429. RENAISSANCE AND V REFORMATION ' l!J$ 18, tfce cmrtfftitiea ef saioU to Swaraj Ekanath*, Tukarain; and their disciples form a long series of saints who boldly protested against the decline in Hinduism and passionately taught Bhakti ot devotion to God as the source of a true religion. They encouraged Hindu unity by denouncing caste and Brahman ascendency, by creating racial pride, love for ancient heroes, a strong sentiment of the superiority of Hindu culture and religion, and by a detestation of foreign rule. The preparation of such a background by 1650 was of no small value to the cause of Swaraj. But a new spirit was infused by Ramdas who should be styled as the father of aggressive and victorious Hinduism. He was the founder of the new order known after him. He popularized the worship of Rama the epic conqueror of Havana, of Balabhim who may be said to be an incarnation of physical force, and of Maruti Rama's devoted servant ever-ready to serve him at the risk of his own life. Victory* virility and service were the three principles of his new religion which was to save Hinduism from foreign tyrants. He inspired numerous disciples with this new cult, made them heads of Mathas or monasteries for the propagation of the creed, established new gods and-built new temples. He was first and foremost a saint devoted to mysticism, Vedanta, social and religious reforms. It was his Bhakti and saintly character which attracted thousands of men and women to him. Occasionally, during his talks, sermons and poems he gave harrowing accounts of the persecution of the Hindus, and thereby prepared the people for overthrowing the Muslim yoke and establishing their own kingdom instead. Riv. Deming has rightly remarked that " in this respect the teaching of Ramdas does differ from that of Tukaram and the other Bhaktas." Ramdas was veritably a saint of unique originality, mystic vision and superhuman energy. By dint of saintly cfanfecter and charming eloquence, he attempted to create among the people- ^patriotic sentiments and a martial spirit to avenge the wrongs done by the alien rulers and to defend their own religion and country Jrom the Mlechhas. The politicaj propaganda was, however. Iff SmvAji Tut GREAT * secondary ideal. In summing up his mission, he has unequivocally stated that the foremost ideal was the exposition of God and the second object of the cult was the explanation of political policies. 1 Thus he was not merely a great mystic like Ekanatha or Tukaram, but an inspiring patriot of bis time with a wonderful power of organization. The establishment of numerous mathas throughout the length and breadth of the country gives him a definitely distinctive role from the mystic saints preceding him. He taught to his followers that " political activities should be carried out secretly and carefully, and associations, wherever possible, should be organized upon a basis of equality."* Rev. Deming has aptly observed that Ramdas entered heart and sou) into the task of reviving the work of Shivaji in this regard and evidently approved of the secret political activities which helped to free Maharashtra from the Moslem yoke. The relation of Shivaji and Ramdas and their mutual influence upon each other have been discussed by several scholars. Here it will suffice to say that Shivaji used to pay respect to all saints. He came into personal contact with a few prominent Bhaktas, and Ramadas was one of them. During the last eight years of his life he was more in touch with this Swami than with any other saint. Hence he must have been influenced to some extent in his religious and political ideals by the advice of saint Ramdas. 19. Reformation began in the 17th cental? According to Justice Ranade the religious revival covers a period of nearly five hundred years, and during this period some fifty saints and prophets flourished in this lana who left their indelible mark upon the country and its people. 8 This statement is not borne out by the facts presented in the preceding sections of this chapter. There . jM$"&o continuity in the reformative movement. Mukundraj, the Lfitst famous writer of Marathi prose and poetry, is said to have xlived in the beginning of the 13th century.

Namadeva, a tailor by caste, grew to be a great poet and saint. He popularized the abstruse and profound philosophy of Dnyandeva among the people for some years more. But literary and religious activity received a sudden check by the ascendancy of Islam in the Deccan. The three saints of the 15th and 1 6th century, Bhanudas* Narasinha and Janardan Swami, were not literary men. They were Bhaktas or devotees of Dattatreya or Vithoba. Even the Mahanubhavas began to write works in a cipher alphabet, so that these did not reach the masses. It is consequently evident that the period of about 250 years from the death of Namadeva to the rise of Ekanatha, was barren in literary activity. The religious movement too remained suppressed. The language of the Dnyaneshwari had become obscure and unintelligible to the people. Therefore Ekanatha wrote out a popular version of that famous poem. Sporadic efforts were made by some Bhaktas here and there to keep alive Hinduism, yet as a whole both literary and reformative movements remained suppressed up to the close of the 16th century. Renaissance and reformation took birth in the teachings of Ekanatha, his disciples and other contemporary poets. These were vigorously developed by the profuse writings and profound teachings of Tukaram and his numerous disciples up to the middle of the 17th century. In short, the movements had their real rise in the last quarter of the 16th century. Within a period of 75 years up to 1650 the lives and teachings of numerous saints brought about a new consciousness of Hindu unity, nationality and reform, and awakened a strong sentiment against Muslim oppression. Thus the -ground for Swaraj was not being prepared for three cent -only for three-quarters of a century. Secondly, merely fifty saints and poets did, a period of five hundred years, but more than carried on the new light during the 1 7th cent the era of Shivaji and Ramdas was specially 198 SHIVAJI THE GREAT distinguished saints and poets. Their number was about one* hundred and fifty. These flourished in all strata of the society am} in different parts of Maharashtra. The birth of such an extraordinary number of poets and saints within one generation forms a phenomenon by itself. No other country of the world in that age can boast of such an extensive and intensive literary activity on social and spiritual topics. But it has been seen that the source- of this remarkable energy is to be found in the simultaneous efforts of the Naked Messiah and the Political Prophet of Maharashtra. It is mainly they who created the new age of the renaissance and reformation in their own country. CHAPTER X!ll The Causes and Cenieqaencei of Sbi?aji's Success 1. Caases ffivea by Ranade Having studied the personality, -administrative system and policies of the great king, we proceed to -analyse the factors contributing to his success. A review of the main achievements with which the great conqueror illumined the -pages of history will form a fitting epilogue of this work. According to the late Justice Ranade the ground was "prepared partly by nature, partly by the ancient history of the country, partly by the religious revival, but chiefly by the long discipline in arms which the country had undergone under Mahomedan rule for three hundred years. 1 ' ' Each one of these causes requires an -explanation. 2. The invincible Deccan The first point to be noticed is the fact that Maharashtra enjoys natural advantages of position and climate which are denied to the people of the north. It is a country of great natural strength. In particular the mountainous region of the Western Ghats bristles with hundreds of hills. These shoot aloft in steep and terrific cliffs and craggy summits which form natural fortresses. These bid defiance to the loot of man and horse. The prodigious and continuous rainfall, the steepness of the passes, the dense and pestitential atmosphere of the jungles, and the frequency of terrible thunderstorms made all warfare in such a district, during, several months in each year, almost impossible. Grant Duff has truly remarked that 'in a jnilitary pqintof view theret is probably no stronger country in the worjd than Maharashtra.'* Col. Tone confirms the view by Baying that a/cpuntry so strongly situated is unconquerable. * :> The heavy Mogul cavalry was useless in the Deccan, especially in the bitty portions which were thickly wooded. The Muslim 1. lUiwuJe.RiwoftheMttmthaPower/p. 38. 2. Cf. Manocci, II, p. 230; Shivmji, Ptryil/pp. 182, 498. 200 SHIVAJI THE GREAT infantry was afraid to move through such wild jungles, for they- could be easily ambushed and cut down* The Maratha soldiers were expert mountaineers and they could easily climb precipitous hills, pass through inaccessible jungles, hide in the trees, live for days on Bajri bread and forest fruits. The Mogul forces were no- match for such hardy people. Dr. Fryer, Khafi Khan, the Portuguese and contemporary writers have borne testimony to the fact that the precipitous and soaring hills favoured the success of Shivaji. His strength lay in the everlasting hills, but he took care that their peaks and spurs were crowned with a multitude of forts. "He made these forts the terror of all India; the cradle of his nation; the basis of his conquests ; the steps of his ambition, his home and his joy ; many of them he built, all of them he strengthened." ' We must not exaggerate the importance of these physical features. The impregnability of forts and the inaccessibility of the mountainous regions could not help the Marathas against the English. Several empires have risen and died in the Deccan inspite of these physical advantages. Heroes like Shivaji took advantage of the physical strength of the country and founded empires, while their successors did not have the genius and nerve to maintain the same. 3. Next to the natural advantages, the character of the people tod their institutions are said to have played an important role in the movement of Swaraj. The system of village communities and Panchayats coupled with the Ryotwari tenure of land held in full ownership by small peasant proprietors maintained democratic tendencies in the people. They cultivated habits of mutual helpfulness and independence which had stood them to good account in past times. But it is ignored that these institutions were in existence for many centuries during which several empires saw the light of day and ceased to be. Consequently there is no inherent power in th* institutions and habits to give independence and self-government to the people. The magic power of .a Shivaji is needed to utilize: these forces in the establishment of an independent kingdom. 1, ShiyajJ, Pwt IV, p. 79. S. 25 CAUSES&CONSEQrailCESOFSHIVAJPS SUCCESS 2Sttt ' 4. The third contributory factor was the reformtiea i We have already shown that the religious revival in Maharashtra reilly began from the 17th century, and became effective .from *bout 1630, the time when Shahji led the movement of Sw*n& It gathered strength only under the inspiration and patronage ofc Shivaji. The Swadharma and Swaraj movements are inter-related,, qach contributing its strength to the other. The influence of the reformation should not be exaggerated. 5. The taunaice of the Hilda elemtat in the Muslim monarchies is represented to have formed a potent factor in the revolutionary movement. Thousands of Hindu officers were no doubt employed in the civil and military departments. - There were' numerous feudal lords and chieftains who could bring retainers? for the service of the Sultan. ' But we should not forget th^t the Ghorpades, Mohites, Mores, Ghatges, Shirkes, Gujars, Dalvis* Savants, and a host of other Hindu chiefs were opposed to the revolutionary Shivaji. They were faithful to the Bijapur government and were, naturally afraid of the loss of their estates and offices by the failure of the revolution. The Hindu gentry was not a source of strength but of weakness and opposition to Shivaji. He conquered them one by one, and thus by force of arms brought them under |us sway. A few families were won over by his conciliatory policy and marital connections. Nothing succeeds like success. Hi* wonderful exploits must have ultimately drawn thousands of warriors and officers, but in the beginning of his career he had to lace strong opposition from the Hindu lords and chiefs. * fc Otfcar OHttes The main causes of the rise and progress of Shtvaji may be said to be (1) misgovernmept in the Adil ShaW itate, (2) continuous wars, the financial drain, and internal weakness of this Deccan kingdom, (3) the incompetence and corruptibility of Muslim officers, and (4) 4h* conquest of its exports by ^he Maratba* (5) Guerilla tactics and the . lightning speed of the Maratha armies were the most potent ciMpeq of tit* hero's wccess.

MfofOTeranent in tfce Kjapor Idafden The Dutch from- Wingarla write that the government of this country is so unsettled and tyrannous that it is impossible to commit it to paper. 1 On other occasion it is remarked that * the feudal system gave rise to abuse, extortion and grinding down of the population/ * Tyranny, oppression and corruption of lords, governors and officials inflicted untold miseries on the people. Their suffering was deepened by the frequent plundering and devastation caused by constant wars with Shivaji and the Moguls. Both had to be given tributes and Contributions. This economic drain depleted the state-treasure $nd bled the people white by oppressive taxes. 8. Venality of officew Shivaji -clearly observed that every man had his price. He lavishly squandered wealth in corrupting the greatest generals and highest officials of the Bijapur and Mogul Empires. How Raja Jaswant Singh was won over with ricb presents, has been humorously expressed by Da Guarda. " With these marvellous cannons Sevagy fought and reduced that fortress." 5 The incompetence and venality of the Mogul and Bijapur generals were frequently noticed by the contemporary writers. The unequivocal evidence of the Bombay Council deserves notice* ^Bahadur Khan, the king's foster brother who remayned in Deccan many years, attending Sevajee's motions, but effected little materially against him, by reason of being corrupted by him, feeding frequently his most insatiable avarice with gold."

Only a distant town Porto Novo beyond Tuticorin was left to Bijapur for the import of horses, but even this place was captured by the Marathas during the Karnatic expedition. Thus an irreparable damage was inflicted upon the military strength of the Adil Shahi kingdom. 10. Gmrilla tactics Shivaji and his generals were past masters in the art of guerilla warfare which stupified and scattered the veteran armies of his implacable enemies, the Moguls. We have already given Da Guarda 1s graphic picture of the ambuscades and sufferings to which the cumbrous army of Shaista Khan was subjected by the Maratha cavalry. * Lane Pool, a distinguished historian of the Muslim rule in India, has vividly described the lightning forages and dare-devil manoeuvres of the Marathas. "To fight such people was to do battle ^with air or to strike blows upon water ; like wind or waves they scattered and bent before the blows only to close in again the moment the pressure was taken off. They would dash down from 'their mountain retreats and intercept a rich convoy of treasure ; and before the Moguls could get near them, they were back in their irocky forts. Even if pursued to their layer and smoked out, so to speak, they only went to some equally convenient and almost ^inaccessible stronghold to resume their usual trade of plunder, in which they took unfeigned delight. Each man fought and' trapped juid pillaged in the same common causethe national war against sMubarnmadan .alliance and their separate efforts produced a sufficiently alarming collective .result.

The Bombay Council tocord in 1677 that Shivaji continues victorious even to a miracle in waging war with the potent kings Qf Hindustan and Deccan. The Dutch observe that " he continues robbing and looting wherever be comes as usual to the perdition of many of the unlucky inhabitants, neither the Mogul nor the Visiapur king being able to tame him. Sivasi's actions are of a marvellous insight and rather difficult to be traced." 12. SliifajiaotleHtkaAkzftiderorlhraftd The Maratha soldiers were called ' birds ' by their inspiring master. The agility s w inged men was incredible in those days. ' Shivaji was not less dexterous than Alexander the Great. He was a second Sertorius and came not short of Hanniball for stratagems.' 1 He rushed forth like lightning between the two armies and without their knowledge went away to Surat.' The jFrench Governor of Pondichery wrote that like fe >thnnd*rbolt Shivaji fell upon the citadel of Jmgi. , The Portuguese de*&tbed him as the Atila of India.

Shivaji ' reigns victoriously and uncontrolled, that he is a terror to all the kings and princes round about, daily encreasing in strength. For he is very nimble and active, imposing strange labour upon himself that he may endure hardship ; and also exercises his -chiefest men, that he flies to and fro with incredible dexterity.' 1 Here is Da Guarda's testimony. " There grew the firm belief that Sevagy was everywhere. He often sent expeditions to different places at the same time and in all of them he was convoked and he was in command. The question is still unsolved whether be substituted others for himself or ( whether ) he was a magician or the devil acted in his place." 9 Abbe Carry's evidence is no less interesting. ' This conqueror has all the virtues of a great general and an extreme activity which almost always decides the affairs of war ; hardly had he gained a l>attle or taken a city at one end of the kingdom, when he was at the other extremity, making havoc everywhere and surprising the important places/ Therefore the writer styles him as ' one of the greatest warriors that the East has seen since a long time* and who, for his courage, the rapidity of fate conquests and his great -qualities, does not badly resemble the great Swedish Kinp <Gustavus Adolphus.' 8 t SuHivan has aptly concluded that ' the fabulous speed of iu* Tttidnight marches and his sudden appearance in far off districts* before hi* absence from home was even suspected, read *lmo*t Uk I. 8ti**& Pfcrt II, pp. 102, 104.

Sorrey *f riipiifi How far the superhuman of this unique personality were responsible for creating a Jcintfdom* will be evident from a brief survey of his conquests. His political ^career can be divided into five periods :-* The first period from 1645 to 1655 of Silent Revolution. second 1656 to 1658 of Open Rebellion. third f> 1659 to 1668 of Defensive and offensive wars. fourth ,, 1669 to 1674 of Conquests by the Uncrowned King. fifth ,. 1675 to 1680 of Conquest and Consolidation by the Crowned King*- 15. A silent revolution which was afterwards to convulse all India, began unnoticed in the bosom of the Poona hills. The ideal of the Hindwi Swaraj was cherished by the young dreamer Shivrat who without shedding any blood captured the important forts of Torna, Rohida, Kondana, and Purandar. He succeeded in releasing his father Shahji by the display of valour and diplomacy, and then engaged himself in strengthening and training an invincible army. Thus the foundations of the Maratha kingdom were unostentatiously laid by Shivaji with remarkable diplomacy, intrepidity and versatility to avoid the wrath and vengeance of the Bijapur Sultafc. 16. Open Rebellion While Muhammad Adii Shah was lying on his death-bed, and his armies and generals were engaged in the Karnatic expeditions, Shivaji undertook the conquest of Javli ia Jan. 1656. Within eight months he Was master of the whole mountainous territory from Mahableshwar to Mahad with tb* important forts of Javli Aid Rairi. No Bijapuri army helped the Mores or proceeded to punish Shivaji. After Muhammad's de&th the throne of Bijapur was occupied by Ali of obscure origin. The Moguls, -taking advantage of the new situation, declared war against him. Aurangzeb captured Bidar and Kaliani within a few months. The Sultan submitted to the inevitable and^madfcipeacfr with Shah Jahan in Aug. 1657. The illness of the Mogul Bifap^cir -radically .changed r tfa* situation in the Deccan. The Bijapuri army began to harass the* CAUSES & CONSEQUENCES OF SHIVAJI'S SUCCESS 80? * -the Moguls and refused to cede Parenda. The operations of war continued up to January 1658. Aurangzeb was busy in collecting troops for his march to the north; Shivaji saw an opportunity to conquer the whole mountainous territory from Poona to Thana. Kalyan-Bhiwandi, Lohgad, Rajmacbi and even Mahuli were -captured by the Maratha forces within three months without any opposition. The Bijapur king and the Moguls could do nothing to prevent the cession of such extensive territories containing important "towns and formidable forts. Here ends the second period of the political career of Shivaji. During these three years he succeeded in enlarging his jagir of Poona into a petty kingdom covering territory from Purandar and Mahableshwar to Supa, Chakan and thence to Kalyan, Tala, Ghosala and Mahad along the sea coast. Further south he got possession of Chaul and brought the Savants -of Wadi under his suzerainty. 17. Defensive and offensive wars During the next period Tomantic successes shed glory upon Sbivaji and brought him an undying reputation. The murder of Afzal, the defeats of Rustam 3aman and Fazal Khan, the marvellous escape from Panhala and the heroic defence of the pass of Kbelna, and the capture of several port towns in the Konkan compelled the Bijapur king to come to terms with the Maratha conqueror. The discomfiture of Shaista, the rape of Surat, and the retreat of the famous Rathore Raja jaswant from Kondana dealt mortal blows upon the prestige and power of the Mogul emperor. ShivajTs submission to Jaisingh by the cession of 23 forts, his introduction to Aurangzeb in the gorfrefeus Hall of Audience at Agra, his wonderful escape through the Muslim guards, his miraculous journey through the Mogul Empire to hi* capital Rajgad brought him into the lime-light of Indian histd&y. Aurangzeb again planned a new policy of -capturing Shivaji and his chief officers through conciliation and: frimdifcip. * He conferred the tide of Rrja upon him, granted the rank of 5,000 horse to bis son ^Sambhaji aad a jagir to meet its After tome time he ordered the detention erf the chief bat tfae^ too got ot of bis clutches* SraVAji THE GREAT He 'advised his son Muazzam to feign rebellion and invfte Sblvajt to join him during his march to Agra, but the wary Maratha leader refused to personally meet th6 Prince, so that even this secret plot came to - nothing. Then the Great Mogul began his policy of persecuting the Hindus. Shivaji could not tolerate the treachery and religious intolerance of the ' Ornament of the Peacock Throne/ and therefore declared War upon him. Thus ended the third period during which a rebellious chieftain successfully measured swords with the powerful kingdom of Bijapur and the richest empire in Asia. During this period -Shivaji stood forth as the defender of the Hindu religion. He carried fire and sword into the Portuguese territory since they did not desist from proselytizing Hindus* He conquered and annexed the district of Bardes from the already shrivelled-up kingdom of Goa and enriched himself by an immense loot amounting to li crores of gold Hons. 18. Conquest* by the uncrowned king The fourth period covers only six years, but it was full of wars against the Moguls* the Bijapuris and the Siddis. The Marathas captured all the forts which they had ceded to the Mogul in 1665. The capture of Sinhgad, Panhala and Purandar from the Mogul armies has produced thrilling romances of extraordinary interest. The consummate generals and veteran Mogul soldiers were defeated in pitched battles. They could not prevent the lightning raids of the Maratha horse, nor could they equal their guerilla tactics. Rich cities, like Surat, Chhapra, Karanja, Hubli and some Konkaa towns, were thoroughly sacked. During this period Shivaji was not fighting a defensive war, but led plundering and conquering Expeditions into the Mogul territory on one side and the Bijapur kingdom on the other.

The Bijapur kingdom was fern up by the factions of the Deccani and foreign nobility. SUv* immediately took advantage of this mortal weakness by conqofcriog the Kamatic and the south of India which formed part of the aid Vijayanagar Empire, but was now either under Bijapur or independent Hindu kings. Within the short period of less than two years he was master of the major part of die defunct Vijayanagar Empire. Thus his kingdom extended from the Western to the Eastern sea and from Nasik to Rameshwarau Contemporary writers being dazzled by these quick and easy conquests, compared him to Sertorius, Caesar, Hannffe*!, Alexander, Adolphus. He could be favourably compared to Muhmudt Changiz, Timur, Babur and Napoleon. There was apt a single general, statesman, or diplomat equal to him either in the Bij^puri service or in the Mogul Empire of his time. He spent thirty-five years In desparately struggling against overwhelming odds, and finally succeeded in carving out a kingdom which has survived to this day in India. 20. Now we can not be oblivious of the vital contribution made by the ertraerdittry psnenslity ef Shitaji to his success. The main factors have been explained by us in Chapter I. Summing up these in a passionate passage Justice Ranade rightly concluded that with the help of these wonderful qualities the Maratha too could immortalize his name in Indian history. " Religious fervour, almost at white heat, bordering on the verge of self-abnegation, a daring and adventurous spirit born of a confidence that a higher power than man's protected him and his work, the magnetism of superior genius, which binds men together and leads them to victory, a rare iasigist Into the real needs of the times, and a steadfastness of purpose, which no adverse turn of fortune cMM conquer, a readiness and resourcefulness rarely met with either ta European or Indian history, true patriotism, which wfcs far 'ill advance of the times a*d a sense of justice tempered with meicyrthese wfes* th* warces if the seeds of a power wtuch 210 - SmvAji THE . GREAT accomplished in the hands of 'his successors all tnat He nad planned out,, and enabled his- race to write a chapter in Indian history to some purpose." 1 Sir E. Sullivan has also laid great emphasis on the remarkable qualities of the hero. "Shivaji is certainly one of the greatest princes of Hindu history; he revived the ancient glory of a race, that centuries of subjection had tended to debase; and during the very height and power of the Mogul dynasty he founded and raised to empire the most powerful native kingdom yet seen in Hindusthan. He possessed every quality requisite for success in the disturbed age in which he lived.*' 21. Shivaji'f achievements These may be considered as the main causes of his success in founding the Maratha kingdom. We will now turn to summarize his memorable achievements which have already been sketched in detail in the previous parts. Here we will bring them to a focus to take a clear view of exhibiting the greatness of Shivaji. These were not mere emblems of his glory, but were directly or indirectly contributory to his success* (l) In his early career Shivaji had clearly realized that the revival of the Hindu religion against the onslaughts of Muslims would make the strongest appeal to the masses in Maharashtra* He soon succeeded in magnetizing the people with the crusading spirit, so that thousands flocked to his banners to avenge the oppressions of centuries. (2) He stood forth as the champion of the Hindu faith, and the protector of cows, Brahmans, and gods. Whenever his co-religionists were persecuted and oppressed by the Moguls, the Siddis, or the Portuguese, he declared war upon them and carried fire and sword into their territories to wreak vengeance for their repressive acts. Thereby all Muslim and Christain powers were effectively restrained in their persecuting and proselytizing zeal. Moreover, he not only checked the outflow from Hinduism, but brought back the apostafcs into the Hindu fotd through Shuddhi or reclamation. He patronized thousands of Brahmans, scholars, educational institutions, and . I. Kade,Ri^ erf the Mba Powr, pp. 57-38. CAUSES & CONSEQUENCES OF SHIVAJI'S SUCCESS monasteries. Thus learning and literature were encouriged ill various ways. Protection, propagation and unification of the Hindu religion in Maharashtra were due to him. He and his successors stemmed the tide of conversion and persecution by Aurangzeb by keeping him and his armies engaged in the south from the year of his accession to the day of his death. (3) His mystic trances, his deep reverence for saints, his liberal donations, his pilgrimages, his religious fervour in private devotions and public ceremonies made him dear to the people. They looked upon him as an incarnation of God born to liberate them from the foreign yoke. ' Such a belief was the chief source of his strength and his hold on the people, and it represented a strength which no prudent calculation of chances could ever confer.' l The confirmatory evidence of Elphinstone is worth reading. " It required a genius like his to avail himself as he did of the mistakes of Aurangzeb, by kindling a zeal for religion, and through that, a national spirit among the Marathas. It was by these feelings that his government was upheld after it had passed into feeble bands, and was kept together, in spite of numerous internal disorders, until it had established its supremacy over the greater part of India." Owen has very aptly expressed the same fact. " A halo of heroism, patriotism, and religious zeal invested their proceedings, and induced them to regard the son of Shahaji as a predestined, divinely favoured, indeed as an inspired deliverer. On the whole, both Shivaji and his original followers might well hold, and did hold, that in waging war after their own fashion with the Mussalmans they were doing both God and man good service, covering themselves with glory, and gaining not only welcome, but creditably retributive spoils/' 9 (4) In spite of his intense love for Hinduism, he followed the noble policy of toleration in an age wheja it was being trample^ mnder foot by Muslim rulers and by European' rnonarchs. " He 1. Rise of the M. Fower, p. 53. 2. India on the Ere of British Cdoqant, 5. J.Owen, pp; 129-30. SHCTAJI THE G*BAT corned to retaliate on the Muslims the cruel persecution which they had inflicted on the followers of his faith." * Consequently^ be stands out as one of the greatest nation-builders. (5) tie was the destroyer of the feudal system and the founder of the national state. He consolidated the kingdom by putting down the feudal nobles by partially depriving them of their powers arid incomes, and by razing down their castles. (6) He was the creator of an invincible national army, and the father of the Maratha navy. He encouraged maritime commerce by various means. (7) He reformed the administrative system by creating a cabinet and allotting various departments to the eight ministers. His administrative, financial, revenue, military reforms place him in the rank of the greatest statesmen. He quickened the pace of the reformation and renaissance through his inspiration and generous patronage. (8) His foreign policy compels admiration, (a) He maintained friendly relations with the European nations for the defence of his navy and* merchant-shipping, for the protection of his coast, for encouraging maritime trade, and for obtaining war-materials* (V He was extremely far-sighted in his policy towards the two Muslim states of the Deccan. He protected them from the inroads of the Mogul by invading the imperial territory, and often rendered military Assistance to the Deccan rulers whenever they were threatened by the Moguls. Thus the latter were unable to conquer either the Muslim suites or the newly created Maratha kingdom on account of fab military power, foresight and diplomacy. (9) He was the introducer 6f die Chauth system which latsr oa became so universal as an indication of Maratha supremacy.

CAUSES & CONSEQUENCES OF SHIVAJI'S SUCCESS they Kved in constant lear of destruction of their crops and devastation of their towns and villages by the Maratha looters. Thus this system struck a mortal blow at the allegiance of the Mogul subjects and the integrity of the empire. (10) Shivaji was highly religious, devotional to the point of renunciation, stoically simple, reverential to Brahmans, saints and - scholars. He was free from all the vices of wealth and power. He was a most devoted son, a loving husband, a compassionate iather and a benevolent brother. He was not only chivalrous to women, but championed their honour throughout his life. In short, his piety, benevolence and wisdom captivated the hearts Of all. Mr. Kincaid has emphasized the nobility of his personal -character as the main cause of his signal success. "Such was the "Liberator" of the Maratha nation a man of talents so varied, of life so regular, of disposition so tolerant, that it is little wonder that his countrymen came to regard him not as one of themselves but as the incarnation of God. His kingdom has long passed away; but the Maratha people still worship his image at Rajgad and Malwan; just as the Athenians, long after their empire had ceased to exist, continued to worship with pathetic devotion the memory of Theseus." 1 (11) He had a charming personality which compelled admira- tion and devotion of all those who came into his magnetic circle, so that they were ever ready to sacrifice their lives for him and his -sacred cause. The magic of his personality is excellently proved by the fact that not a single officer or general betrayed him. His men could not be corrupted by the wily Aurangzeb, while the Maratha hero was constantly corrupting the Mogul generals. Even when Shivaji and his son .were prisoners at Agra or when he was absent for more than a year in the Karnatic, there was not a single person who turned traitor to the country.

He awakened such a patriotic spirit and created such a deep sense of splendid unity among the people that with leonine- courage and grim determination they took up the great challenge to their independence, a challenge embodied in the ghastly tangible reality of the vast Mogul armies, continuously pouring into Maharashtra for twenty years, and fighting under the personal guidance of the mighty Emperor himself. Hundreds of consummate- commanders, brilliant statesmen, master politicians, undaunted soldiers trained in the school of Shivaji foiled all the Herculean efforts of the Great Mogul by such deeds of heroism, sacrifice, loyalty, political sagacity, patriotism as are scarcely equalled in the annals of the world. They emerged triumphant from this titanic struggle, and shook the majestic fabric of the extensive empire of the Great Mogul to its very foundations. (13) His greatness lies in creating a new Hindu kingdom against innumerable odds. From the fall of the Yadavas of Devagiri, the Hindus of Maharashtra had been .under Muslim^ domination for three hundred years. The foreign rule became more and more deeply rooted, and threatened to swallow the whole of the Southern Peninsula by the disintegration of the Hindu Empire of Vijayanagar. The Hindus of the Deccan made no efforts for three centuries to throw off the Muslim yoke. In Northern India several Hindu kingdoms survived in Rajputana but all of them had become vassals of the Delhi Empire. Even, the Solar Dynasty of Udaipur bowed to the inevitable and accepted the suzerainty of the Great Mogul. The large ^resources of Jodhpur, Jaipur and many other Rajput states were utilized in subjugating the Deccan, in destroying Shivaji, and in swallowing the Muslim states. Thus the Maratha rebel had.no predecessor to show him an example of an independent kingdom, nor had he any assistance from the Hindu rulers of the day. 'On the cbiittrary, every important Hindu ruler of southern and northern India allied with his enemies to cgosh him. Undetf swcH ; CAUSES & CONSEQUENCES OF SHIVAJI'S, SUCCESS 215 the creation of Hindu Swaraj appeared to be an extraordinary feat -of a superhuman genius. " His native genius, alone and unaided, enabled him to found a compact kingdom, an invincible army, and a grand and beneficent system of administration." ' The Hindus naturally looked upon this founder of the Maratha empire, the restorer of their religion, the defender of their ancient culture as a superman, or an incarnation of God. Many heroes are deified and paid divine honours after their death, but here was a man who in his lifetime was looked upon by his people as God incarnate. The Sabhasad Chronicle, written -only ten years after his death, may be considered to be contemporary. The evidence of Tukaram and Ramdas is concerned with the threshold of his career. The saints propagated this belief among the masses to help the national movement of Swaraj and Swadharma. No one can doubt the crucial importance of the saintly assertions to deify Shivaji in his early career. The young rebel must have captured the imagination of the saints and the masses with his noble ideals of freeing Maharashtra from the foreign yoke and of relieving the Hindu religion from Muslim oppression. Shivaji, the liberator of Maharashtra from the Muslim rule, the deliverer of the Hindus from the oppressions of their rulers, the saviour of the Hindu religion, the apostle of religious freedom, the founder of the Maratha kingdom, the successor of the Vijayanagar Emperors, the father of the Maratha navy, the creator -of reformation in the Deccan, has rightly been the idol of every Hindu home. This political prophet, this grand rebel against Mogul domination, this lion of Maharashtra, this creator of Indian nationalism, this pole-star of India's freedom will for ever remain a source of inspiration to all. Such a remarkable personality does not belong to any one nation and time. He occupies a high place in the galaxy of the great conquerors of the world, of remarkable nation-builders, of the greatest patriots, and of the immortal fighters lor the independence of their mother-lands. 1.
