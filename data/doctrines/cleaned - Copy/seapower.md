" I ^HE definite object proposed in this work is an ex- amination of the general history of Europe and America with particular reference to the effect of sea power upon the course of that history. Historians generally have been unfamiliar with the conditions of the sea, having as to it neither special interest nor special knowledge ; and the profound determining in- fluence of maritime strength upon great issues has con- sequently been overlooked. This is even more true of particular occasions than of the general tendency of sea power. It is easy to say in a general way, that the use and control of the sea is and has been a great factor in the history of the world ; it is more troublesome to seek out and show its exact bearing at a particular juncture. Yet, unless this be done, the acknowledgment of general importance remains vague and unsubstantial ; not resting, as it should, upon a collection of special instances in which the precise effect has been made clear, by an analysis of the conditions at the given moments. A curious exemplification of this tendency to slight the bearing of maritime power upon events may be 863243 iv PREFACE. drawn from two writers of that English nation which more than any other has owed its greatness to the sea. " Twice," says Arnold in his History of Eome, " Has there been witnessed the struggle of the highest indi- vidual genius against the resources and institutions of a great nation, and in both cases the nation was victo- rious. For seventeen years Hannibal strove against Rome, for sixteen years Napoleon strove against Eng- land ; the efforts of the first ended in Zama, those of the second in Waterloo." Sir Edward Creasy, quoting this, adds : " One point, however, of the similitude be- tween the two wars has scarcely been adequately dwelt on ; that is, the remarkable parallel between the Roman general who finally defeated the great Carthaginian, and the English general who gave the last deadly over- throw to the French emperor. Scipio and Wellington both held for many years commands of high importance, but distant from the main theatres of warfare. The same country was the scene of the principal military career of each. It was in Spain that Scipio, like Wel- lington, successively encountered and overthrew nearly all the subordinate generals of the enemy before being opposed to the chief champion and conqueror himself. Both Scipio and Wellington restored their countrymen's confidence in arms when shaken by a series of reverses, and each of them closed a long and perilous war by a complete and overwhelming defeat of the chosen leader and the chosen veterans of the foe." Neither of these Englishmen mentions the yet more striking coincidence, that in both cases the mastery of the sea rested with the victor. The Roman control of PRE FA CE. V the water forced Hannibal to that long, perilous inarch throuQ-h Gaul in which more than half his veteran troops wasted away ; it enabled the elder Scipio, while sending his army from the Rhone on to Spain, to inter- cept Hannibal's communications, to return in person and face the invader at the Trebia. Throus!:hout the war the legions passed by water, unmolested and un- wearied, between Spain, wdiich was Hannibal's base, and Italy ; while the issue of the decisive battle of the Me- taurus, hinging as it did upon the interior position of the Roman armies with reference to the forces of Has- drubal and Hannibal, was ultimately due to the fact that the younger brother could not bring his succor- ing reinforcements by sea, but only by the land route through Gaul. Hence at the critical moment the two Carthaginian armies were separated by the length of Italy, and one was destroyed by the combined action of the Roman o-enerals. On the other hand, naval historians have troubled themselves little about the connection between general history and their own particular topic, limiting them- selves generally to the duty of simple chroniclers of naval occurrences. This is less true of the French than of the English ; the genius and training of the former people leading them to more careful inquir}^ into the causes of particular results and the mutual relation of events. There is not, however, within .the knowledge of the author any work that professes the particular object here sought : namely, an estimate of the effect of sea power upon the course of history and the prosperity of vi PREFACE. nations. As other histories deal with the wars, politics, social and economical conditions of countries, touching upon maritime matters only incidentall}'' and generally unsympathetically, so the present work aims at putting maritime interests in the foreground, without divorcing them, however, from their surroundings of cause and effect in general history, but seeking to show how they modified the latter, and were modified hy them. The period embraced is from 1660, when the sailing- ship era, with its distinctive features, had fairly begun, to 1783, the end of the American Revolution. While the thread of general history upon which the successive maritime events is strung is intentionally slight, the effort has been to present a clear as well as accurate outline. "Writing as a naval officer in full sympath}'- with his profession, the author has not hesitated to di- gress freely on questions of naval policy, strategy, and tactics ; but as technical language has been avoided, it is hoped that these matters, simply presented, will be found of interest to the unprofessional reader.

Rodney's Victory, April 12, 1782 486 INFLUENCE SEA POWER UPON HISTORY. INTRODUCTORY. nnHE history of Sea Power is largely, though by no means -^ solely, a narrative of contests between nations, of mu- tual rivalries, of violence frequently culminating in war. The profound influence of sea commerce upon the wealth and strength of countries was clearly seen long before the true principles which governed its growth and prosperity were detected. To secure to one's own people a disproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to exclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of mo- nopoly or prohibitory regulations, or, when these failed, by direct violence. The clash of interests, the angry feelings roused by conflicting attempts thus to appropriate the larger share, if not the whole, of the advantages of commerce, and of distant unsettled commercial regions, led to wars. On the other hand, wars arising from other causes have been greatly modified in their conduct and issue by the control of the sea. Therefore the history of sea power, while embracing in its broad sweep all that tends to make a people great upon the sea or by the sea, is largely a military history ; and it is in this aspect that it will be mainly, though not exclusively, regarded in the following pages. A study of the military history of the past, such as this, is enjoined by great military leaders as essential to correct ideas 1 2 INTRODUCTOllY. and to the skilful conduct of war in the future. Napoleon names among the campaigns to be studied by the aspiring soldier, those of Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar, to whom gunpowder was unknown ; and there is a substantial agree- ment among professional writers that, while many of the con- ditions of war vary from age to age with the progress of weapons, there are certain teachings in the school of history which remain constant, and being, therefore, of universal ap- plication, can be elevated to the rank of general principles. For the same reason the study of the sea historj'' of the past will be found instructive, by its illustration of the general principles of maritime war, notwithstanding the great chances that have been brought about in naval weapons by the scien- tific advances of the past half century, and by the introduction of steam as the motive power. It is doubly necessary thus to study critically the history and experience of naval warfare in the days of sailing-ships, because while these will be found to afford lessons of present application and value, steam navies have as yet made no his- tory which can be quoted as decisive in its teaching. Of the one we liave much experimental knowledge ; of the other, practically none. Hence theories about the naval warfare of the future are almost wholly presumptive ; and although the attempt has been made to give them a more solid basis by dwelling upon the resemblance between fleets of steamsliips and fleets of galleys moved by oars, which have a long and well-known history, it will be well not to be carried away by this analogy until it has been thoroughly tested. The resem- blance is indeed far from superficial.. The feature which the steamer and the galley have in common is the ability to move in any direction independent of the wind. Such a power makes a radical distinction between those classes of vessels and the sailing-ship ; for the latter can follow only a limited number of courses when the wind blows, and must remain motionless when it fails. But while it is wise to observe things that are alike, it is also wise to look for things that differ ; for when the imagination is carried away by the de~ INTRODUCTORY. 3 tection of points of resemblance, — one of the most pleasing of mental pursuits, — it is apt to be impatient of any divergence in its new-found parallels, and so may overlook or refuse to recognize such. Thus the galley and the steamship have in common, though unequally developed, the important charac- teristic mentioned, but in at least two points tliey differ ; and in an appeal to the history of the galley for lessons as to fighting steamships, the differences as well as the likeness must be kept steadily in view, or false deductions may be made. The motive power of the galley when in use neces- sarily and rapidly declined, because human strength could not long maintain such exhausting efforts, and consequently tactical movements could continue but for a limited time ; ^ and again, during the galley period offensive weapons were not only of short range, but were almost wholly confined to hand-to-hand encounter. These two conditions led almost necessarily to a rush upon each other, not, ho\vever, without some dexterous attempts to turn or double on the enemy, fol- lowed by a hand-to-hand melee. In such a rush and such a meUe a great consensus of respectable, even eminent, naval opinion of the present day finds the necessary outcome of modern naval weapons, — a kind of Donnybrook Fair, in which, as the history of melees shows, it will be hard to know friend from foe. Whatever may prove to be the worth of this opin- ion, it cannot claim an historical basis in the sole fact that galley and steamship can move at any moment directly upon the enemy, and carry a beak upon their prow, regardless of the points in which galley and steamship differ. As yet this opinion is only a presumption, upon which final judgment may well be deferred until the trial of battle has given fur- ther light. Until that time there is room for the opposite ^ Thus Hermocrates of S3-r.'icuse, advocating the policy of thwarting the Atlienian expedition against his city (b.c. 413) by going bohlly to meet it, and keeping on the flank of its h'ne of advance, said : "As their advance must be slow, we shall have a thousand opportunities to attack them ; but if they clear their ships for action and in a body bear down expeditiously upon us, they must ply hard at their oars, and when spent icith toil we can fall upon them." 4 INTRODUCTORY. view, — that a melee between numerically equal fleets, in which skill is reduced to a minimum, is not the best that can be done with the elaborate and mighty weapons of this age. The surer of himself an admiral is, the finer the tactical develop- ment of his fleet, the better his captains, the more reluctant must he necessarily be to enter into a melee with equal forces, in which all these advantages will be thrown away, chance reign supreme, and his fleet he placed on terms of equality with an assemblage of ships which have never before acted together.! History has lessons as to when melees are, or are not, in order. The galley, then, has one striking resemblance to the steamer, but differs in other important features which are not so im- mediately apparent and are therefore less accounted of. In the sailing-ship, on the contrary, the striking feature is the difference between it and the more modern vessel ; the points of resemblance, though existing and easy to find, are not so obvious, and therefore are less heeded. ■ This impression is enhanced by the sense of utter weakness in the sailing-ship as compared with the steamer, owing to its dependence upon the wind ; forgetting that, as the former fought with its equals, the tactical lessons are valid. The galley was never reduced to impotence by a calm, and hence receives more respect in our day than the sailing-ship ; yet the latter dis- placed it and remained supreme until the utilization of steam. The powers to injure an enemy from a great distance, to manoeuvre for an unlimited length of time without wearing out the men, to devote the greater part of the crew to the offensive weapons instead of to the oar, are common to the sailing vessel and the steamer, and are at least as important, tactically considered, as the power of the galley to move in a calm or against the wind. 1 The writer must guard himself from appearing to advocate elaborate tactical movements issuing in barren demonstrations. He believes that a fleet seeking a decisive result must close with its enemy, but not until some advantage has been obtained for the collision, wliich will usually be gained by manoeuvring, and will fall to the best drilled and managed fleet. In truth, barren results have as often followed upon headlong, close encounters as upon the most timid tactical trifling. INTRODUCTORY. 5 In tracing resemblances there is a tendency not only to overlook points of difference, but to exaggerate points of like- ness,— to be fanciful. It may be so considered to point out that as the sailing-ship had guns of long range, with compar- atively great penetrative power, and carronades, which were of shorter range but great smashing effect, so the modern steamer has its batteries of long-range guns and of torpedoes, the latter being effective only within a limited distance and then injuring by smashing, while the gun, as of old, aims at penetration. Yet these are distinctly tactical considerations, which must affect the plans of admirals and captains ; and the analogy is real, not forced. So also both the sailing-ship and the steamer contemplate direct contact with an enemy's vessel, — the former to carry her by boarding, the latter to sink her by ramming ; and to both this is the most difficult of their tasks, for to effect it tlie ship must be carried to a single point of the field of action, whereas projectile weapons may be used from many points of a wide area. The relative positions of two sailing-ships, or fleets, with reference to the direction of the wind involved most important tactical questions, and were perhaps the chief care of the seamen of that age. To a superficial glance it may appear that since this has become a matter of such indifference to the steamer, no analogies to it are to be found in present con- ditions, and the lessons of history in this respect are value- less. A more careful consideration of the distinguishing characteristics of the lee and the weather " gage," ^ directed to their essential features and disregarding secondary details, will show that this is a mistake. The distinguishing feature of the weather-gage was that it conferred the power of giving 1 A ship was said to have the weather-gage, or " the advantage of the wind," or "to be to windward," when the wind allowed her to steer for her opponent, and did not let the latter head straight for her. The extreme case was when the wind blew direct from one to the other ; but there was a large space on either side of this line to which the term " weather-gage " applied. If the lee ship be taken as the centre of a circle, there were nearly three eighths of its area in which the other might be and still keep the advantage of the wind to a greater or less degree. Lee is the opposite of weatlier. 6 INTRODUCTORY. or refusing battle at will, which in turn carries the usual advantage of an offensive attitude in the choice of the method of attack. This advantage was accompanied by certain drawbacks, such as irregularity introduced into the order, exposure to raking or enfilading cannonade, and the sacrifice of part or all of the artillery-fire of the assailant, — all which were incurred in approaching the enemy. The ship, or fleet, with the lee-gage could not attack ; if it did not wish to re- treat, its action was confined to the defensive, and to receiv- ing battle on the enemy's terms. This disadvantage was compensated by the comparative ease of maintaining the order of battle undisturbed, and by a sustained artillery-fire to which the enemy for a time was unable to reply. Histori- cally, these favorable and unfavorable characteristics have their counterpart and analogy in the offensive and defensive operations of all ages. The offence undertakes certain risks and disadvantages in order to reach and destroy the enemy ; the defence, so long as it remains such, refuses the risks of advance, holds on to a careful, well-ordered position, and avails itself of the exposure to which the assailant submits himself. These radical differences between the weather and the lee gage were so clearly recognized, through the cloud of lesser details accompanying them, that the former was ordi- narily chosen by the English, because their steady policy was to assail and destroy their enemy ; whereas the French sought the lee-gage, because by so doing they were usually able to cripple the enemy as he approached, and thus evade decisive encounters and preserve their ships. The French, with rare exceptions, subordinated the action of the navy to other military considerations, grudged the money spent upon it, and therefore sought to economize their fleet by assuming a de- fensive position and limiting its efforts to the repelling of assaults. For this course the lee-gage, skilfully used, was admirably adapted so long as an enemy displayed more cour- age than conduct ; but when Rodney showed an intention to use the advantage of the wind, not merely to attack, but to make a formidable concentration on a part of the enemy's INTRODUCTORY. 7 line, his wary opponent, De Guichen, changed his tactics. In the first of tlieir three actions the Frenchman took the lee- gage ; hut after recognizing Rodney's purpose he manoeuvred for the advantage of the wind, not to attack, but to refuse action except on his own terms. The power to assume the offensive, or to refuse battle, rests no longer with the wind, but with the party which has the greater speed ; which in a fleet will depend not only upon the speed of the individual ships, but also upon their tactical uniformity of action. Henceforth the ships which have the greatest speed will have the weather-gage. It is not therefore a vain expectation, as many think, to look for useful lessons in the history of sailing-ships as well as in that of galleys. Both have their points of resemblance to the modern ship ; both have also points of essential differ- ence, which make it impossible to cite their experiences or modes of action as tactical precedents to be followed. But a precedent is different from and less valuable than a principle. The former may be originally faulty, or may cease to apply through change of circumstances ; the latter has its root in the essential nature of things, and, however various its application as conditions change, remains a standard to which action must conform to attain success. War has such prin- ciples ; their existence is detected by the study of the past, which reveals them in successes and in failures, the same from age to age. Conditions and weapons change ; but to cope with the one or successfully wield the others, respect must be had to these constant teachings of history in the tactics of the battlefield, or in those wider operations of war which are comprised under the name of strategy. It is however in these wider operations, which embrace a whole theatre of war, and in a maritime contest may cover a large portion of the globe, that the teachings of history have a more evident and permanent value, because the conditions remain more permanent. The theatre of war may be larger or smaller, its difficulties more or less pronounced, the con- tending armies more or less great, the necessary movements 8 INTRODUCTORY. more or less easy, but these are simply differences of scale, of degree, not of kind. As a wilderness gives place to civilization, as means of communication multiply, as roads are opened, rivers bridged, food- resources increased, the operations of war become easier, more rapid, more exten- sive ; but the principles to which they must be conformed remain the same. When the march on foot was replaced by carrying troops in coaches, when the latter in turn gave place to railroads, the scale of distances was increased, or, if you will, the scale of time diminished ; but the principles which dictated the point at which the army should be concentrated, the direction in which it should move, the part of the enemy's position which it should assail, the protection of communi- cations, were not altered. So, on the sea, the advance from the galley timidly creeping from port to port to the sailing- ship launching out boldly to the ends of the earth, and from the latter to the steamship of our own time, has increased the scope and the rapidity of naval operations without neces- sarily changing the principles which should direct them ; and the speech of Hermocrates twenty-three hundred years ago, before quoted, contained a correct strategic plan, which is as applicable in its principles now as it was then. Before hos- tile armies or fleets arc brought into contact (a word which perhaps better than any other indicates the dividing line between tactics and strategy), there are a number of ques- tions to be decided, covering the whole plan of operations throughout the theatre of war. Among these are the proper function of the navy in the war ; its true objective ; the point or points upon which it should be conceiitrated ; the establishment of depots of coal and supplies ; the main- tenance of communications between these depots and the home base ; the military value of commerce-destroying as a decisive or a secondary operation of war ; the system upon which commerce-destroying can be most efficiently conducted, whether by scattered cruisers or by holding in force some vital centre through which commercial shipping must pass. All these are strategic questions, and upon all these history INTRODUCTORY. 9 has a great deal to say. There has been of late a valuable discussion in English naval circles as to the comparative merits of the policies of two great English admirals, Lord Howe and Lord St. Vincent, in the disposition of the English navy when at war with France. The question is purely strategic, and is not of mere historical interest ; it is of vital importance now, and the principles upon which its decision rests are the same now as then. St. Vincent's policy saved England from invasion, and in the hands of Nelson and his brother admirals led straight up to Trafalgar. It is then particularly in the field of naval strategy that the teachings of the past have a value which is in no degree lessened. They are there useful not only as illustrative of principles, but also as precedents, owhig to the comparative permanence of the conditions. This is less obviously true as to tactics, when the fleets come 'into collision at the point to which strategic considerations have brought them. The unresting progress of mankind causes continual change in the weapons ; and with that must come a continual change in the manner of fighting, — in the handling and disposition of troops or ships on the battlefield. Hence arises a tendency on the part of many connected with maritime matters to think that no advantage is to be gained from the study of former experiences ; tliat time so used is wasted. This view, though natural, not only leaves wholly out of sight those broad strate- gic considerations which lead nations to put fleets afloat, which direct the sphere of their action, and so have modified and will continue to modify the history of the world, but is one- sided and narrow even as to tactics. The battles of the past succeeded or failed according as they were fought in con- formity with the principles of war ; and the seaman who care- fully studies the causes of success or failure will not only detect and gradually assimilate these principles, but will also acquire increased aptitude in applying them to the tactical use of the ships and weapons of his own day. He will observe also that changes of tactics have not only taken place after changes in weapons, wdiich necessarily is the case, but that the 10 INTR OD UC TOR Y. interval between such changes has been unduly long. This doubtless arises from the fact that an improvement of weapons is due to the energy of one or two men, while changes in tac- tics have to overcome the inertia of a conservative class ; but it is a great evil. It can be remedied only by a candid recog- nition of each change, by careful study of the powers and limitations of the new ship or weapon, and by a consequent adaptation of the method of using it to the qualities it pos- sesses, which will constitute its tactics. History shows that it is vain to hope that military men generally will be at the pains to do this, but that the one who does will go into battle with a great advantage, — a lesson in itself of no mean value. We may therefore accept now the words of a French tacti- cian, Morogues, who wrote a century and a quarter ago: " Naval tactics are based upon conditions the chief causes of which, namely the arms, may change ; which in turn causes necessarily a change in the construction of ships, in the man- ner of handling them, and so finally in the disposition and handling of fleets." His further statement, that " it is not a science founded upon principles absolutely invariable," is more open to criticism. It M^ould be more correct to say that the application of its principles varies as the weapons change. The application of the principles doubtless varies also in strategy from time to time, but the variation is far less ; and hence the recognition of the underlying principle is easier. This statement is of sufficient importance to our subject to receive some illustrations from historical events. The battle of the Nile, in 1798, was not only an overwhelm- ing victory for the English over the French fleet, but had also the decisive effect of destroying the communications between France and Napoleon's army in Egypt. In the battle itself the English admiral. Nelson, gave a most brilliant example of grand tactics, if that be, as has been defined, " the art of making good combinations preliminary to battles as well as during their progress." The particular tactical combination depended upon a condition now passed away, which was the inability of the lee ships of a fleet at anchor to come to the IN Til OD UCTOR Y. 1 1 help of the weather ones before the latter were destroyed ; but the principles which underlay the combination, namely, to choose that part of the enemy's order which can least easily be helped, and to attack it with superior forces, has not passed away. The action of Admiral Jervis at Cape St. Vincent, when with fifteen ships he won a victory over twenty-seven, was dictated by the same principle, though in this case the enemy was not at anchor, but under way. Yet men's minds are so constituted that they seem more impressed by the transiency of the conditions than by the undying principle which coped with them. In the strategic effect of Nelson's victory upon the course of the war, on the contrary, the prin- ciple involved is not only more easily recognized, but it is at once seen to be applicable to our own day. The issue of the enterprise in Egypt depended upon keeping open the com- munications with France. The victory of the Nile destroyed the naval force, by which alone the communications could be assured, and determined the final failure ; and it is at once seen, not only that the blow was struck in accordance with the principle of striking at the enemy's line of communication, but also that the same principle is valid now, and would be equally so in the days of the galley as of the sailing-ship or steamer. Nevertheless, a vague feeling of contempt for the past, sup- posed to be obsolete, combines with natural indolence to blind men even to those permanent strategic lessons which lie close to the surface of naval history. For instance, how many look upon the battle of Trafalgar, the crown of Nelson's glory and the seal of his genius, as other than an isolated event of exceptional grandeur ? How many ask themselves the stra- tegic question, "How did the ships come to be just there ?" How many realize it to be the final act in a great strategic drama, extending over a year or more, in which two of the greatest leaders that ever lived. Napoleon and Nelson, were pitted against each other ? At Trafalgar it was not Villeneuve that failed, but Napoleon that was vanquished ; not Nelson that won, but England that was saved ; and why ? Because 1 2 IN TR OB UCTOR Y. Napoleon's combinations failed, and Nelson's intuitions and activity kept the English fleet ever on the track of the enemy, and brought it up in time at the decisive moment.^ The tac- tics at Trafalgar, while open to criticism in detail, were in their main features conformable to the principles of war, and their audacity was justified as well by the urgency of the case as by the results ; but the great lessons of efficiency in prepa- ration, of activity and energy in execution, and of thought and insight on the part of the English leader during the previous months, are strategic lessons, and as such they still remain good. In these two cases events were worked out to their natural and decisive end. A third may be cited, in which, as no such definite end was reached, an opinion as to what should have been done may be open to dispute. In the war of the Ameri- can Revolution, France and Spain became allies against Eng- land in 1779. The united fleets thrice appeared in the English Channel, once to the number of sixty-six sail of the line, driving the English fleet to seek refuge in its ports be- cause far inferior in numbers. Now, the great aim of Spain was to recover Gibraltar and Jamaica ; and to the former end immense efforts both by land and sea were put forth by the allies against that nearly impregnable fortress. They . were fruitless. The question suggested — ■ and it is purely one of naval strategy — is this: Would not Gibraltar have been more surely recovered by controlling the English Channel, attacking the British fleet even in its harbors, and threatening England with annihilation of commerce and invasion at home, than by far greater efforts directed against a distant and very strong outpost of her empire ?, The English people, from long im- munity, were particulai'ly sensitive to fears of invasion, and their great confidence in their fleets, if- rudely shaken, would have left them proportionately disheartened. However de- cided, the question as a point of strategy is fair ; and it is proposed in another form by a French officer of the period, who favored directing the great effort on a West India island 1 See note at end of Introductory Chapter, page 23. INTRODUCTORY. 13 which might be exchanged against Gibraltar. It is not, how- ever, likely that England would have given up the key of the Mediterranean for any other foreign possession, though she might have yielded it to save her firesides and her capital. Napoleon once said that he would reconquer Pondicherry on the banks of the Vistula. Could he have controlled the Eng- lish Channel, as the allied fleet did for a moment in 1779, can it be doubted that he would have conquered Gibraltar on the shores of England ? To impress more strongly the truth that history both sug- gests strategic study and illustrates the principles of war by the facts which it transmits, two more instances will be taken, which are more remote in time than the period specially con- sidered in this work. How did it happen that, in two great / contests between the powers of the East and of the West in the Mediterranean, in one of which the empire of the known world was at stake, the opposing fleets met on spots so near each other as Actium and Lepanto ? Was this a mere coin- cidence, or was it due to conditions that recurred, and may recur again ? ^ If the latter, it is worth while to study out the reason ; for if there should again arise a great eastern power of the sea like that of Antony or of Turkey, the strategic questions would be similar. At present, indeed, it seems that the centre of sea power, resting mainly with England and France, is overwhelmingly in the West ; but should any chance add to the control of tlie Black Sea basin, which Rus- sia now has, the possession of the entrance to the Mediterra- nean, the existing strategic conditions affecting sea power would all be modified. Now, were the West arrayed against the East, England and France would go at once unopposed to the Levant, as they did in 1854, and as England alone went in 1878 ; in case of the change suggested, the East, as twice before, would meet the West half-way. At a very conspicuous and momentous period of the world's history. Sea Power had a strategic bearing and weight which ^ The battle of Navarino (1827) between Turkey and the Western Powers was foutjht in tliis neighborhood. 14 INTRODUCTORY. lias received scant recognition. There cannot now be had the full knowledge necessary for tracing in detail its influence upon the issue of the second Punic War ; but the indications which remain are sufficient to warrant the assertion that it was a determining factor. An accurate judgment upon this point cannot be formed by mastering only such facts of the particular contest as have been clearly transmitted, for as usual the naval transactions have been slightingly passed over ; there is needed also familiarity with the details of gen- eral naval history in order to draw, from slight indications, correct inferences based upon a knowledge of what has been possible at periods whose history is well known. The con- trol of the sea, however real, does not imply that an enemy's single ships or small squadrons cannot steal out of port, cannot cross more or less frequented tracts of ocean, make harassing descents upon unprotected points of a long coast- line, enter blockaded harbors. On the contrarj', history has shown that such evasions are always possible, to some ex- tent, to the weaker party, however great the inequality of naval strength. It is not therefore inconsistent with the gen- eral control of the sea, or of a decisive part of it, by the Roman fleets, that the Carthaginian admiral Bomilcar in the fourth year of the war, after the stunning defeat of Cannse, landed four thousand men and a body of elephants in south Italy ; nor that in the seventh year, flying from the Roman fleet off Syracuse, he again appeared at Tarentum, then in Hannibal's hands ; nor that Hannibal sent despatch vessels to Carthage ; nor even that, at last, he withdrew in safety to Africa with his wasted army. None of these things prove that the govern- ment in Carthage could, if it wished, have sent Hannibal the constant support which, as a matter of fact, he did not receive ; but they do tend to create a natural impression that such help could have been given. Therefore the statement, that the Roman preponderance at sea had a decisive effect upon the course of the war, needs to be made good by an ex- amination of ascertained facts.

To whatever cause, or combination of causes, it be attributed, this essentially non-maritime state had in the first Punic War established over its sea-faring rival a naval supremacy, which still lasted. In the second war there was no naval battle of importance, — a circumstance which in itself, and still more in connection with otlier well- ascertained facts, indicates a superiority analogous to that which at other epochs has been marked by the same feature. As Hannibal left no memoirs, the motives are unknown which determined him to the perilous and almost ruinous march through Gaul and across the Alps. It is certain, how- ever, that his fleet on the coast of Spain was not strong enough to contend with that of Rome. Had it been, he might still have followed the road he actually did, for reasons that weiglicd with him ; but had he gone by the sea, he would not have lost thirty-three thousand out of the sixty thousand veteran soldiers with whom he started. While Hannibal was making this dangerous march, the Romans were sending to Spain, under the two elder Scipios, one part of their fleet, carrying a consular army. This made the voyage without serious loss, and the army established itself successfully north of the Ebro, on Hannibal's line of communications. At the same time another squadron, with an army commanded by the other consul, was sent to Sicily. The two together numbered two hundred and twenty ships. On its station each met and defeated a Carthaginian squad- ron with an ease which may be inferred from the slight mention made of the actions, and which indicates the actual superiority of the Roman fleet. After the second year the war assumed the following shape : Hannibal, having entered Italy by the north, after a series of successes had passed southward around Rome and fixed himself in southern Italy, living off the country, — a condition which tended to alienate the people, and was es- pecially precarious when in contact Avith the mighty politi- cal and military system of control which Rome had there 16 INTRODUCTOR Y. ' established. It was therefore from tlie first urgently neces- sary that he sliould establish, between himself and some reliable base, that stream of supplies and reinforcements which in terms of modern war is called " communications." There were three friendly regions which might, each or all, serve as such a base, — Carthage itself, Macedonia, and Spain. With the first two, communication could be had only by sea. From Spain, where his firmest support was found, he could be reached by both land and sea, unless an enemy barred the passage ; but the sea route was the shorter and easier. In the first years of the war, Rome, by her sea power, con- trolled absolutely the basin between Italy, Sicily, and Spain, known as the Tyrrhenian and Sardinian Seas. The sea- coast from the Ebro to the Tiber was mostly friendly to her. In the fourth year, after tlie battle of Cannse, Syracuse for- sook the Roman alliance, the revolt spread through Sicily, and Macedonia also entered into an offensive league with Hannibal. These changes extended the necessary operations of tlie Ro- man fleet, and taxed its strength. What disposition was made of it, and how did it thereafter influence the struggle ? The indications are clear that Rome at no time ceased to control the Tyrrhenian Sea, for her squadrons passed un- molested from Italy to Spain. On the Spanish coast also she had full sway till the younger Scipio saw fit to lay up the fleet. In the Adriatic, a squadron and naval station were established at Brindisi to check Macedonia, which per- formed their task so well that not a soldier of the phalanxes ever set foot in Italy. " The want of a war fleet," says Mommsen, " paralyzed Philip in all his movements." Here the effect of Sea Power is not even a matter of inference. In Sicily, the struggle centred about Syracuse. The fleets of Carthage and Rome met there, but the superiority evi- dently lay with the latter ; for though the Carthaginians at times succeeded in throwing supplies into the city, they avoided meeting the Roman fleet in battle. With Lilybaeum, Palermo, and Messina in its liands, the latter was well based in the north coast of the island. Access bv the south was INTRODUCTORY. I7 left open to the Carthaginians, and they were thus able to maintain the insurrection. Putting these facts together, it is a reasonable inference, and supported by the whole tenor of the history, that the Roman sea power controlled the sea north of a line drawn from Tarragona in Spain to Lilybaeum (the modern Mar- sala), at the west end of Sicily, thence round by the north side of the island through the straits of Messina down to Syracuse, and from there to Brindisi in the Adriatic. This control lasted, unshaken, throughout the war. It did not exclude maritime raids, large or small, such as have been spoken of ; but it did forbid the sustained and secure com- munications of which Hannibal was in deadly need. On the other hand, it seems equally plain that for the first ten years of the war the Roman fleet was not strong enough for sustained operations in the sea between Sicily and Car- thage, nor indeed much to the south of the line indicated. When Hannibal started, he assigned such ships as he had to maintaining the communications between Spain and Africa, which the Romans did not then attempt to disturb. The Roman sea power, therefore, threw Macedonia wholly out of the war. It did not keep Carthage from maintaining a useful and most harassing diversion in Sicily ; but it did pre- vent her sending troops, when they would have been most use- ful, to her great general in Italy. How was it as to Spain ? Spain was the region upon which the father of Hannibal and Hannibal himself had based their intended invasion of Italy. For eighteen years before this began they had occu- pied the country, extending and consolidating their power, both political and military, with rare sagacity. They had raised, and trained in local wars, a large and now veteran army. Upon his own departure, Hannibal intrusted the government to his younger brother, Hasdrubal, who pre- served toward him to the end a loyalty and devotion which he had no reason to hope from the faction-cursed mother-city in Africa. At the time of his starting, the Carthaginian power in 2 18 INTRODUCTORY. Spain was secured from Cadiz to the river Ebro. The re- gion between this river and the Pyrenees was inhabited by tribes friendly to the Romans, but unable, in the absence of the latter, to oppose a successful resistance to Hannibal. He put them down, leaving eleven thousand soldiers under Hanno to keep military possession of the country, lest the Romans should establish themselves there, and thus disturb his communications with his base. Cnasus Scipio, however, arrived on the spot by sea the same year with twenty thousand men, defeated Hanno, and occupied both the coast and interior north of the Ebro. The Romans thus held ground by which they entirely closed the road between Hannibal and reinforcements from Hasdrubal, and whence they could attack the Carthaginian power in Spain ; while their own communications with Italy, being by water, were secured by their naval supremacy. They made a naval base at Tarragona, confronting that of Hasdrubal at Cartagena, and then invaded the Carthaginian dominions. The war in Spain went on under the elder Scipios, seem- ingly a side issue, with varying fortune for seven years ; at the end of which time Hasdrubal inflicted upon them a crushing defeat, the two brothers were killed, and the Car- thaginians nearly succeeded in breaking through to the Pyrenees with reinforcements for Hannibal. The attempt, however, was checked for the moment ; and before it could be renewed, the fall of Capua released twelve thousand veteran Romans, who were sent to Spain under Claudius Nero, a man of exceptional ability, to whom was due later the most decisive military movement made by any Roman general during the Second Punic War. This seasonable reinforcement, which again assured the shaken grip on Hasdrubal's line of march, came by sea, — a way which, though most rapid and easy, was closed to the Carthaginians by the Roman navy. Two years later the younger Publius Scipio, celebrated afterward as Africanus, received the command in Spain, and captured Cartagena by a combined military and naval attack ; INTRODUCTORY. 19 after which he took the most extraordinary step of breaking up his fleet and transferring the seamen to the army. Not contented to act merely as the " containing " ^ force against Hasdrubal by closing the passes of the Pyrenees, Scipio pushed forward into southern Spain, and fought a severe but indecisive battle on the Guadalquivir ; after which Hasdrubal slipped away from him, hurried north, crossed the Pyrenees at their extreme west, and pressed on to Italy, where liannibal's position was daily growing weaker, the natural waste of his array not being replaced. The war had lasted ten years, when Hasdrubal, having met little loss on the way, entered Italy at the north. The troops he brought, could they be safely united with those under the command of the unrivalled Hannibal, might give a decisive turn to the war, for Rome herself was nearly exhausted ; the iron links which bound her own colonies and the allied States to her were strained to the utmost, and some had already snapped. But the military position of the two brothers was also perilous in the extreme. One being at the river Metaurus, the other in Apulia, two hundred miles apart, each was confronted by a superior enemy, and both these Roman armies were between their separated opponents. This false situation, as well as the long delay of Hasdrubal's coming, was due to the Roman control of the sea, which throughout the war limited the mutual support of the Carthaginian brothers to the route through Gaul. At the very time that Hasdrubal was making his long and dangerous circuit by land, Scipio had sent eleven thousand men from Spain by sea to reinforce the army opposed to him. The upshot was that messengers from Hasdrubal to Hannibal, having to pass over so wide a belt of hostile country, fell into the hands of Clau- dius Nero, commanding the southern Roman array, who thus learned the route which Hasdrubal intended to take. Nero correctly appreciated the situation, and, escaping the vigilance 1 A " containing " force is one to which, in a military combination, is assigned the duty of stopping, or delaying the advance of a portion of the enemy, while the main effort of the army or armies is being exerted in a different quarter. 2 0 INTR OD UC TOR Y. of Hannibal, made a rapid march with eight thousand of his best troops to join the forces in the north. The junction being effected, the two consuls fell upon Hasdrubal in over- whelming numbers and destroyed his army ; the Carthaginian leader himself falling in the battle. Hannibal's first news of the disaster was by the head of his brother being thrown into his camp. He is said to have exclaimed that Rome would now be mistress of the world ; and the battle of Metaurus is generally accepted as decisive of the struggle between the two States. The military situation which finally resulted in the battle of the Metaurus and the triumph of Rome may be summed up as follows : To overthrow Rome it was necessary to attack her in Italy at the heart of her power, and shatter the strongly linked confederacy of which she was the head. This was the objective. To reach it, the Carthaginians needed a solid base of operations and a secure line of communications. The for- mer was established in Spain by the genius of the great Barca family ; the latter was never achieved. There were two lines possible, — the one direct by sea, the other circuitous through ^aul. The first was blocked by the Roman sea power, the second imperilled and finally intercepted through the occupa- tion of northern Spain by the Roman army. This occupation was made possible through the control of the sea, which the Carthaginians never endangered. With respect to Hannibal and his base, therefore, Rome occupied two central positions, Rome itself and northern Spain, joined by an easy interior line of communications, the sea ; by which mutual support was continually given. Had the Mediterranean been a level desert of land, in which the Romans held strong mountain ranges in Corsica and Sardinia, fortified posts at Tarragona, Lilybasum, and JMcssina, the Italian coast-line nearly to Genoa, and allied fortresses in Marseilles and other points ; had they also possessed an armed force capable by its character of traversing that desert at will, but in which their opponents were very inferior and therefore compelled to a great circuit in order to concentrate their INTRODUCTORY. 21 troops, the military situation would have been at once recog- nized, and no words would have been too strong to express the value and effect of that peculiar force. It would have been perceived, also, that the enemy's force of the same kind might, however inferior in strength, make an inroad, or raid, upon the territory thus held, might burn a village or waste a few miles of borderland, might even cut off a convoy at times, without, in a military sense, endangering the communications. Such predatory operations have been carried on in all ages by the weaker maritime belligerent, but they by no means warrant the inference, irreconcilable with the known facts, " that neither Rome nor Carthage could be said to have undisputed mastery of the sea," because " Roman fleets sometimes visited the coasts of Africa, and Carthaginian fleets in the same way appeared off the coast of Italy." In the case under consideration, the navy played the part of such a force upon the supposed desert ; but as it acts on an element strange to most writers, as its members have been from time immemorial a sti'ange race apart, without prophets of their own, neither themselves nor their calling understood, its immense determining influence upon the history of that era, and consequently upon the history of the world, has been overlooked. If the preceding argument is sound, it is as defective to omit sea power from the list of principal factors in the result, as it would be absurd to claim for it an exclusive influence. Instances such as have been cited, drawn from widely separated periods of time, both before and after that specially treated in this work, serve to illustrate the intrinsic interest of the subject, and the character of the lessons which history has to teach. As before observed, these come more often under the head of strategy than of tactics ; they bear rather upon the conduct of campaigns than of battles, and hence are fraught with more lasting value. To quote a great authority in this connection, Jomini says : " Happening to be in Paris near the end of 1851, a distinguished person did me the honor to ask my opinion as to whether recent improvements in lire- 22 INTRODUCTORY. arms would cause any great modifications in the way of mak- ing war. I replied that they would probably have an influence upon the details of tactics, but that in great strategic operations and the grand combinations of battles, victory would, now as ever, result from the application of the principles which had led to the success of great generals in all ages ; of Alexander and Caesar, as well as of Frederick and Napoleon." This study has become more than ever important now to navies, because of the great and steady power of movement possessed by the mod- ern steamer. The best-planned schemes might fail through stress of weather in the days of the galley and the sailing-ship ; but this difficulty has almost disappeared. The principles which should direct great naval combinations have been applicable to all ages, and are deducible from history ; but the power to carry them out with little regard to the weather is a recent gain. The definitions usually given of the word " strategy " con- fine it to military combinations embracing one or more fields of operations, either wholly distinct or mutually dependent, but always regarded as actual or immediate scenes of war. How- ever this may be on shore, a recent French author is quite right in pointing out that such a definition is too narrow for naval strategy. " This," he says, " differs from military strategy in that it is as necessary in peace as in war. Indeed, in peace it may gain its most decisive victories by occupying in a country, either by purchase or treaty, excellent positions which would perhaps hardly be got by war. It learns to profit by all opportunities of settling on some chosen point of a coast, and to render definitive an occupation which at first was only transient." A generation that has seen England within ten years occupy successively Cyprus and Egypt, under terms and conditions on their face transient, but which have not yet led to the abandonment of the positions taken, can readily agree with this remark ; which indeed receives con- stant illustration from the quiet persistency with which all the great sea powers are seeking position after position, less noted and less noteworthy than Cyprus and Egypt, in the different seas to which their people and their ships penetrate. INTRODUCTORY. 23 " Naval strategy has indeed for its end to found, support, and increase, as well in peace as in war, the sea i)ower of a country;" and therefore its study has an interest and value for all citizens of a free country, but especially for those who are charged with its foreign and military relations. The general conditions that either are essential to or powerfully affect the greatness of a nation upon the sea will now be examined ; after which a more particular considera- tion of the various maritime nations of Europe at the middle of tiie seventeenth century, where the historical survey begins, will serve at once to illustrate and give precision to the conclusions upon the general subject. XoTE. — The brilliancy of Xelson's fame, dimmint; as it does that of all his contemporaries, and the implicit trust felt by England in him as the one man able to save her from the schemes of Xapoleon, should not of course obscure the fact that only one portion of the field was, or could be, oc- cupied by him. Napoleon's aim, in the campaign which ended at Trafal- gar, was to unite in the West Indies the French fleets of Brest, Toulon, and Rochefort, together with a strong body of Spanish ships, thus forming an overwhelming force which he intended should return together to the English Channel and cover the crossing of the French army. He naturally ex- pected that, Tv-ith England's interests scattered all over the world, confusion and distraction would arise from ignorance of the destination of the French squadrons, and the English navy be drawn away from his objective point. The portion of the field committed to Nelson was the Mediterranean, where he watched the great arsenal of Toulon and the highways alike to the East and to the Atlantic. This was inferior in consetj^uence to no other, and as- sumed additional importance in the eyes of Nelson from his conviction that the former attempts on Egypt would be renewed. Owing to this persuasion he took at first a false step, which delayed his pursuit of the Toulon fleet when it sailed under the command of A'illeneuve ; and the latter was further favored by a long continuance of fair winds, while the English had head winds. But while all this is true, while the failure of Napoleon's combinations must be attributed to the tenacious grip of the English blockade off Brest, as well as to Nelson's energetic pursuit of the Toulon fleet when it escaped to the West Indies and again on its hasty returti to Europe, the latter is fairly entitled to- the eminent distinction which history has accorded it, and which is asserted in the text. Nelson did not, indeed, fathom the intentions of N;ipoleon. This may have been owing, as some have said, to lack of insight; but it may be more simply laid to the usual disadvantage under which the 24 INTRODUCTORY. defence lies before the blow has fallen, of ignorance as to the point threat- ened by the offence. It is insight enough to fasten on the key of a situation ; and this Xelson rightly saw was the fleet, not the station. Consequently, his action has afforded a striking instance of how tenacity of purpose and untiring energy in execution can repair a first mistake and baffle deeply laid plans. His Mediterranean command embraced many duties and cares ; but amid and dominating them all, he saw clearly the Toulon fleet as the controlling factor there, and an important factor in any naval combination of the Emperor. Hence his attention was unwaveringly fixed upon it ; so much so that he called it " his fleet," a phrase which has somewhat vexed the sensibilities of French critics. This simple and accurate view of the military situation strengthened him in taking the fearless resolution and bearing the immense responsibility of abandoning his station in order to follow "his fleet." Determined thus on a pursuit the undeniable wisdom of which should not obscure the greatness of mind that undertook it, he followed so vigorously as to reach Cadiz on his return a week before Villeneuve entered Ferrol, despite unavoidable delays arising from false in- formation and uncertainty as to the enemy's movements. The same untir- ing ardor enabled him to bring up his own ships from Cadiz to Brest in time to make the fleet there superior to Yilleneuve's, had the latter persisted in his attempt to reach the neighborhood. The English, very inferior in aggregate number of vessels to the allied fleets, were by this seasonable re- inforcement of eight veteran ships put into the best possible position strate- gically, as will be pointed out in dealing with similar conditions in the war of the American Revolution. Their forces were united in one great fleet in the Bay of Biscay, interposed between the two divisions of the enemy in Brest and Ferrol, superior in number to either singly, and with a strong probability of being able to deal with one before the other could come up. This was due to able action all round on the part of the English authori- ties ; but above all other factors in the result stands Nelson's single-minded pursuit of " his fleet." This interesting series of strategic movements ended on the 14th of August, when Villeneuve, in despair of reaching Brest, headed for Cadiz, where he anchored on the 20th. As soon as Napoleon heard of this, after an outburst of rage against the admiral, he at once dictated the series of movements which resulted in Ulm and Austerlitz, abandoning his purposes against England. The battle of Trafalgar, fought October 21, was there- fore separated by a space of two months from the extensive movements of which it was nevertheless the outcome. Isolated from them in point of time, it was none the less the seal of Nelson's genius, affixed later to the record he had made in the near past. With equal truth it is said that England was saved at Trafalgar, though the Emperor had then given up his intended invasion ; the destruction there emphasized and sealed the strategic triumph which had noiselessly foiled Napoleon's plans. CHAPTER I. Discussion of the Elements of Sea Power. "^ I ^HE first and most obvious light in which the sea presents itself from the political and social point of view is that of a great highway ; or better, perhaps, of a wide common, over which men may pass in all directions, but on which some well-worn paths show that controlling reasons have led them to choose certain lines of travel rather than others. These lines of travel are called trade routes ; and the reasons which have determined them are to be sought in the history of the world. Notwithstanding all the familiar and unfamiliar dangers of the sea, both travel and traffic by water have always been easier and cheaper than by land. The commercial greatness of Holland was due not only to her shipping at sea, but also to the numerous tranquil water-ways which gave such cheap and easy access to her own interior and to that of Germany. This advantage of carriage by water over that by land was yet more marked in a period when roads were few and very bad, wars frequent and society unsettled, as was the case two hundred years ago. Sea traffic then went in peril of robbers, but was nevertheless safer and quicker than that by land. A Dutch writer of that time, estimating the chances of his coun- try in a war with England, notices among other things that the water-ways of England failed to penetrate the country suf- ficiently ; therefore, the roads being bad, goods from one part of the kingdom to the other must go by sea, and be exposed to capture by the way. As regards purely internal trade, this danger has generally disappeareil at the present day. In most civilized countries, now, the destruction or disappearance of 26 DlSCUSSIOy OF THE the coasting trade would only be an inconvenience, although water transit is still the cheaper. Nevertheless, as late as the wars of the French Republic and the First Empire, those who are familiar with the history of the period, and the light naval literature that has grown up around it, know how constant is the mention of convoys stealing from point to point along the French coast, although the sea swarmed with English cruisers and there were good inland roads. Under modern conditions, however, home trade is but a part of the business of a country bordering on the sea. For- eign necessaries or luxuries must be brought to its ports, either in its own or in foreign ships, which will return, bearing in exchange the products of the country, whether they be the fruits of the earth or the works of men's hands ; and it is the wish of every nation that this shipping business should be done by its own vessels. The ships that thus sail to and fro must have secure ports to which to return, and must, as far as possible, be followed by the protection of their country throughout the voyage. This protection in time of war must be extended liy armed shipping. The necessity of a navy, in the restricted sense of tlie word, springs, therefore, from the existence of a peaceful shipping, and disappears with it, except in the case of a nation which has aggressive tendencies, and keeps up a navy merely as a branch of the military establishment. As the United States has at present no aggressive purposes, and as its mer- chant service has disappeared, the dwindling of the armed fleet and general lack of interest in it are strictly logical con- sequences. When for any reason sea trade is again found to pay, a large enough shipping interest will reappear to compel tlie revival of the war fleet. It is possible that when a canal route through the Central-American Isthmus is seen to be a near certainty, the aggressive impulse may be strong enough to lead to the same result. This is doubtful, however, be- cause a peaceful, gain-loving nation is not far-sighted, and far-sightedness is needed for adequate military preparation, especially in these days. ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 27 Asa nation, with its unarmed and armed shipping, launches fortli from its own shores, the need is soon felt of points upon which the ships can rely for peaceful trading, for refuge and supplies. In the present day friendly, though foreign, ports are to be found all over the world ; and their shelter is enough while peace prevails. It was not always so, nor does peace always endure, though the United States have been favored by so long a continuance of it. In earlier times the merchant seaman, seeking for trade in new and unexplored regions, made his gains at risk of life and liberty from suspicious or hostile nations, and was under great delays in collecting a full and profitable freight. He therefore intuitively sought at the far end of his trade route one or more stations, to be given to him by force or favor, where he could fix himself or his agents in reasonable security, where his ships could lie in safety, and where the merchantable products of the land could be con- tinually collecting, awaiting the arrival of the home fleet, which should carry them to the mother-country. As there was im- mense gain, as well as much risk, in these early voyages, such establishments naturally multiplied and grew until they became colonies ; whose ultimate development and success depended upon the genius and policy of the nation from which they sprang, and form a very great part of the history, and particu- larly of the sea history, of the world. All colonies had not the simple and natural birth and growth above described. Many were more formal, and purely political, in their concep- tion and founding, the act of the rulers of the people rather than of private individuals ; but the trading-station with its after expansion, the work simply of the adventurer seeking gain, was in its reasons and essence the same as the elabo- rately organized and chartered colony. In both cases the mother-country had won a foothold in a foreign land, seeking a new outlet for what it had to sell, a new sphere for its ship- ping, more employment for its people, more comfort and wealth for itself. The needs of commerce, however, were not all provided for when safety had been secured at the far end of the road. 28 DISCUSSION OF THE The voyages were long and dangerous, the seas often beset with enemies. In the most active days of colonizing there prevailed on the sea a lawlessness the very memory of which is now almost lost, and the days of settled peace between maritime nations were few and far between. Thus arose the demand for stations along the road, like the Cape of Good Hope, St. Helena, and Mauritius, not primarily for trade, but for defence and war ; the demand for the possession of posts like Gibral- tar, Malta, Louisburg, at the entrance of the Gulf of St. Law- rence, — posts whose value was chiefly strategic, though not necessarily wholly so. Colonies and colonial posts were sometimes commercial, sometimes military in their character ; and it was exceptional that the same position was equally important in both points of view, as New York was. Ill these three thhjj^s — production, with the necessity of ex- changing products, shipping, whereby the exchange is carried on, and colonies, which facilitate and enlarge the operations of shipping and tend to protect it by multiplying points of safety — is to be found the key to much of the historvj^as^well as of the policy, of nations bordering u_pon the sea. The policy has varied botlirwith the spirit of the age and with the char- acter and clear-sightedness of the rulers ; but the history of the seaboard nations has been less determined by the shrewd- ness and foresight of governments than by conditions of posi- tion, extent, configuration, number and character of their people, — by what are called, in a word, natural conditions. It must however be admitted, and will be seen, that the wise or unwise action of individual men has at certain periods had a great modifying influence u])on the growth of sea power in the broad sense, which includes not only the military strength afloat, that rules the sea or any part of it by force of arms, but also the peaceful commerce and shipping from which alone a military fleet naturally and healthfully springs, and on which it securely rests. The principal conditions affecting the sea power of nations may be enumerated as follows : I. Geographical Position. II. Physical Conformation, including, as connected therewith, ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 29 natural productions and climate. III. Extent of Territory. IV. Number of Population. V. Character of the People. VI. Character of the Government, including therein the national institutions. I. Geographical Position. — It may be pointed out, in the first place, that if a nation be so situated that it is neither forced to defend itself by land nor induced to seek extension of its territory by way of the land, it has, by the very unity of its aim directed upon the sea, au advantage as compared with a people one of whose boundaries is continental. Tliis has been a great advantage to England over both France and Holland as a sea power. The strength of the latter was early exhausted by the necessity of keeping up a large army and carrying on expensive wars to preserve her independence; while the policy of France was constantly diverted, sometimes wisely and sometimes most foolishly, from the sea to projects of continental extension. These military efforts expended wealth ; whereas a wiser and consistent use of her geographical position would have added to it. The geographical position may be such as of itself to pro- mote a concentration, or to necessitate a dispersion, of the naval forces. Here again the British Islands have an advan- tage over France. The position of the latter, touching the Mediterranean as well as the ocean, while it has its advan- tages, is on the whole a source of military weakness at sea. The eastern and western French fleets have only been able to unite after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar, in at- tempting which tliey have often risked and sometimes suffered loss. The position of the United States upon the two oceans would be either a source of great weakness or a cause of enor- mous expense, had it a large sea commerce on both coasts. England, by her immense colonial empire, has sacrificed much of this advantage of concentration of force around her own shores ; but the sacrifice was wisely made, for the gain was greater than the loss, as the event proved. With the growth of her colonial system her war fleets also grew, but 30 DISCUSSION OF THE her merchant shipping and wealth grew yet faster. Still, in the wars of the American Revolution, and of the French Re- public and Empire, to use the strong expression of a French author, " England, despite the immense development of her navy, seemed ever, in the midst of riches, to feel all the em- barrassment of poverty." Tlie might of England was suffi- cient to keep alive the heart and the members ; whereas the equally extensive colonial empire of Spain, through her maritime weakness, but offered so many points for insult and injury. The geographical position of a country may not only favor the concentration of its forces, but give the further strategic advantage of a central position and a good base for hostile operations against its probable enemies. This again is the case with England ; on the one hand she faces Holland and the northern powers, on the other France and the Atlantic. When threatened with a coalition between France and the naval powers of the North Sea and the Baltic, as she at times was, her fleets in the Downs and in the Channel, and even that off Brest, occupied interior positions, and thus were readily able to interpose their united force against either one of the enemies which should seek to pass through the Channel to effect a junction with its ally. On either side, also, Nature gave her better ports and a safer coast to approach. Formerly this was a very serious element in the passage through the Channel ; but of late, steam and the improvement of her har- bors have lessened the disadvantage under which France once labored. In the days of sailing-ships, the English fleet operated against Brest making its base at Torbay and Ply- mouth. The plan was simply this : in easterly or moderate weather the blockading fleet kept its position without diffi- culty ; but in westerly gales, when too severe, they bore up for English ports, knowing that the French fleet could not get out till the wind shifted, which equally served to bring them back to their station. The advantage of geographical nearness to an enemy, or to the object of attack, is nowhere more apparent than in that ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 31 form of warfare which has lately received the name of com- merce-destroying, which the French call guerre de course. This operation of war, being directed against peaceful mer- chant vessels which are usually defenceless, calls for ships of small military force. Such ships, having little power to defend themselves, need a refuge or point of support near at hand ; which will be found either in certain parts of the sea controlled by the fighting ships of their country, or in friendly harbors. The latter give the strongest support, because they are always in the same place, and the approaches to them are more familiar to the commerce-destroyer than to his enemy. The nearness of France to England has thus greatly facilitated her guerre de course directed against the latter. Having ports on the North Sea, on the Channel, and on the Atlantic, her cruisers started from points near the focus of English trade, both coming and going. The distance of these ports from each other, disadvantageous for regular military combinations, is an advantage for this irregular secondary operation ; for the essence of the one is concentra- tion of effort, Avhereaa for commerce-destroying diffusion of effort is the rule. Commerce-destroyers scatter, that they may see and seize more prey. These truths receive illustra- tion from the history of the great French privateers, whose bases and scenes of action were largely on the Channel and North Sea, or else were found in distant colonial regions, where islands like Guadaloupe and Martinique afforded simi- lar near refuge. The necessity of renewing coal makes the cruiser of the present day even more dependent than of old on his port. Public opinion in the United States has great faith in war directed against an enemy's commerce ; but it must be remembered that the Republic has no ports very near the great centres of trade abroad. Her geographical position is therefore singularly disadvantageous for carrying on suc- cessful commerce-destroying, unless she find bases in the ports of an ally. If, in addition to facility for offence. Nature has so placed a country that it has easy access to the high sea itself, while at 32 DISCUSSION OF THE the same time it controls one of the great thoroughfares of the world's traffic, it is evident that the strategic value of its position is very high. Such again is, and to a greater degree was, the position of England. The trade of Holland, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, and that which went up the great rivers to the interior of Germany, had to pass through the Channel close by her doors ; for sailing-ships hugged the English coast. This northern trade had, moreover, a peculiar bearing upon sea power ; for naval stores, as they are commonly called, were mainly drawn from the Baltic countries. But for the loss of Gibraltar, the position of Spain would have been closely analogous to that of England. Looking at once upon the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, with Cadiz on the one side and Cartagena on the other, the trade to the Levant must have passed under her hands, and that round the Cape of Good Hope not far from her doors. But Gibraltar not only deprived her of the control of the Straits, it also imposed an obstacle to the easy junction of the two divisions of her fleet. At the present day, looking only at the geographical posi- tion of Italy, and not at the other conditions affecting her sea power, it would seem that with her extensive sea-coast and good ports she is very well placed for exerting a decisive influence on the trade route to the Levant and by the Isthmus of Suez. This is true in a degree, and would be much more so did Italy now hold all the islands naturally Italian ; but with Malta in the hands of England, and Corsica in those of France, the advantages of her geographical position are largely neutralized. From race affinities and situation those two islands are as legitimately objects of desire to Italy as Gibral- tar is to Spain. If the Adriatic were a great highway of com- merce, Italy's position would be still more influential. These defects in her geographical completeness, combined with other causes injurious to a full and secure development of sea power, make it more than doubtful whether Italy can for some time be in the front rank among the sea nations. As the aim here is not an exhaustive discussion, but merely ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 33 Tm attempt to show, by illustration, how vitally the situation of a country may aft'ect its career ui)on the sea, this division of the subject may be dismissed for the present ; the more so as instances which will further bring out its importance will continually recur in the historical treatment. Two remarks, however, are here appropriate. Circumstances have caused the Mediterranean Sea to play a greater part in the history of the world, both in a com- mercial and a military point of view, than any other sheet of water of the same size. Nation after nation has striven to control it, and the strife still goes on. Therefore a study of the conditions upon which preponderance in its waters has rested, and now rests, and of the relative military values of different points upon its coasts, will be more instructive than the same amount of effort expended in another field. Fur- thermore, it has at the present time a very marked analogy in many respects to the Caribbean Sea, — an analogy which will be still closer if a Panama canal-route ever be completed. A study of the strategic conditions of the Mediterranean, which have received ample illustration, will be an excellent prelude to a similar study of the Caribbean, which has comparatively little history. The second remark bears upon the geographical position of the United States relatively to a Central- American canal. If one be made, and fulfil the hopes of its builders, the Carib- bean will be changed from a terminus, and place of local traffic, or at best a broken and imperfect line of travel, as it now is, into one of the great highways of the world. Along this path a great commerce will travel, bringing the interests of the other great nations, the European nations, close along our shores, as they have never been before. With this it will not be so easy as heretofore to stand aloof from international complications. The position of the United States with refer- ence to this route will resemble that of England to the Chan- nel, and of the Mediterranean countries to the Suez route. As regards influence and control over it, depending upon geograph- ical position, it is of course plain that the centre of the national 34 DTSCUSSTON OF THE power, the permanent base,^ is much nearer than that of other great nations. The positions now or hereafter occupied by them on island or mainland, however strong, will be but out- posts of their power ; while in all the raw materials of mili- tary strength no nation is superior to the United States. She is, however, weak in a confessed unpreparedncss for war ; and her geographical nearness to the point of contention loses some of its value by the character of the Gulf coast, which is deficient in ports combining security from an enemy with facility for repairing war-ships of the first class, without which ships no country can pretend to control any part of the sea. In case of a contest for supremacy in the Caribbean, it seems evident from the depth of the South Pass of the Mississippi, the nearness of New Orleans, and the advantages of the Mis- sissippi Valley for water transit, that the main effort of the country must pour down that valley, and its permanent base of operations be found there. The defence of the entrance to the Mississippi, however, presents peculiar difficulties ; while the only two rival ports. Key West and Pensacola, have too little depth of water, and are much less advantageously placed with reference to the resources of the country. To get the full benefit of superior geographical position, these defects must be overcome. Furthermore, as her distance from the Isthmus, though relatively less, is still considerable, the United States will have to obtain in tlie Caribbean stations fit for contingent, or secondary, bases of operations ; which by their natural advantages, susceptil)ility of defence, and nearness to the central strategic issue, will enable her fleets to remain as near the scene as any opponent. With ingress and egress from the Mississippi sufficiently protected, with such outposts in her hands, and with the communications between them and the home base secured, in short, with proper military preparation, for which she has all necessary means, the preponderance of the United States on this field ^ By a base of permanent operations " is understood a country whence come all the resources, where are united the great lines of communication by land and water, where are the arsenals and armed posts." ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 35 follows, from her geographical position and her power, with mathematical certainty. II. Physical Conformation. — The peculiar features of the Gulf coast, just alluded to, come properly under the head of Physical Conformation of a country, which is placed second for discussion among the conditions which affect the develop- ment of sea power. The seaboard of a country is one of its frontiers ; and the easier the access offered by the frontier to the region beyond, in this case the sea, the greater will be the tendency of a people toward intercourse with the rest of the world by it. If a country be imagined having a long seaboard, but entirely without a harbor, such a country can have no sea trade of its own, no shipping, no navy. This was practically the case with Belgium when it was a Spanish and an Austrian province. The Dutch, in 1648, as a condition of peace after a successful war, exacted that the Scheldt should be closed to sea com- merce. This closed the harbor of Antwerp and transferred the sea trade of Belgium to Holland. The Spanish Nether- lands ceased to be a sea power. Numerous and deep harbors are a source of strength and wealth, and doubly so if they are the outlets of navigable streams, which facilitate the concentration in them of a coun- try's internal trade ; but by their very accessibility they be- come a source of weakness in war, if not properly defended. The Dutch in 1667 found little difficulty in ascending the Thames and burning a large fraction of the English navy within sight of London ; whereas a few years later the com- bined fleets of England and France, when attempting a land- ing in Holland, were foiled by the difficulties of the coast as much as by the valor of the Dutch fleet. In 1778 the harbor of New York, and with it undisputed control of the Hudson River, would have been lost to the English, who were caught at disadvantage, but for the hesitancy of the French admiral. With that control, New Eugland would have been restored to close and safe communication with New York, New Jersey, 36 DISCUSSION OF THE and Pennsylvania ; and this blow, following so closely on Burgoyne's disaster of the year before, would probably have led the English to make an earlier peace. The Mississippi is a mighty source of wealth and strength to the United States ; but the feeble defences of its mouth and the number of its subsidiary streams penetrating the country made it a weak- ness and source of disaster to the Southern Confederacy. And lastly, in 1814, the occupation of the Chesapeake and the destruction of Washington gave a sharp lesson of the dangers incurred through the noblest water-ways, if their approaches be undefended ; a lesson recent enough to be easily recalled, but which, from the present appearance of the coast defences, seems to be yet more easily forgotten. Nor should it be thought that conditions have changed ; circumstances and de- tails of offence and defence have been modified, in these days as before, but the great conditions remain the same. Before and during the great Napoleonic wars, France had no port for ships-of-the-line east of Brest. How great the advantage to England, which in the same stretch has two great arsenals, at Plymouth and at Portsmouth, besides other harbors of refuge and supply. This defect of conformation has since been remedied by the works at Cherbourg. Besides the contour of the coast, involving easy access to the sea, there are other physical conditions which lead people to the sea or turn them from it. Although France was deficient in military ports on the Channel, she had both there and on the ocean, as well as in the Mediterranean, excellent harbors, favorably situated for trade abroad, and at the outlet of large rivers, which would foster internal traffic. But when Richelieu had put an end to civil war. Frenchmen did not take to the sea with the eagerness and success of the English and Dutch. A principal reason for this has been plausibly found in the physical conditions which have made France a pleasant land, with a delightful climate, producing within itself more than its people needed. England, on the other hand, received from Nature but little, and, until her manufactures were developed, had little to export. Their ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 37 many wants, combined with their restless activity and other conditions that favored maritime enterprise, led lier people abroad ; and they there found lands more pleasant and richer than their own. Their needs and genius made them merchants and colonists, then manufacturers and producers ; and between products and colonies shipping is the inevitable link. So their sea power grew. But if England was drawn to the sea, Hol- land was driven to it ; without the sea England languished, but Holland died. In the height of her greatness, when she was one of the chief factors in European politics, a competent native authority estimated that the soil of Holland could not support more than one eighth of her inliabitants. The manu- factures of the country were then numerous and important, but they had been much later in their growth than the ship- ping interest. The poverty of the soil and the exposed nature of the coast drove the Dutch first to fishing. Then the dis- covery of the process of curing the fish gave them material for export as avcU as home consumption, and so laid the corner-stone of their wealth. Thus they had become traders at the time that the Italian republics, under the pressure of Turkish power and the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, were beginning to decline, and they fell heirs to the great Italian trade of the Levant. Further favored by their geographical position, intermediate between the Baltic, France, and the Mediterranean, and at the mouth of the German rivers, they quickly absorbed nearly all the carrying-trade of Europe. The wheat and naval stores of the Baltic, the trade of Spain with her colonies in the New World, the wines of France, and the French coasting-trade were, little more than two hundred years ago, transported in Dutch shipping. Much of the carrying-trade of England, even, was then done in Dutch bottoms. It will not be pretended that all this prosperity proceeded only from the poverty of Hol- land's natural resources. Something does not grow from nothing. What is true, is, that by the necessitous condition of her people they were driven to the sea, and were, from their mastery of the shipping business and the size of their 38 DISCUSSION OF THE fleets, in a position to profit by the sudden expansion of com- merce and the spirit of exploration which followed on the dis- covery of America and of the passage round the Cape. Other causes concurred, but their whole prosperity stood on the sea power to which their poverty gave birth. Their food, their clothing, the raw material for their manufactures, the very timber and hemp with which they built and rigged their ships (and they built nearly as many as all Europe besides), were imported ; and when a disastrous war with England in 1653 and 1654 had lasted eighteen months, and their shipping business was stopped, it is said •' the sources of revenue which had always maintained the riches of the State, such as fisheries and commerce, were almost dry. Work- shops were closed, work was suspended. The Zuyder Zee became a forest of masts ; the country was full of beggars ; grass grew in the streets, and in Amsterdam fifteen hundred houses were untenanted." A humiliating peace alone saved them from ruin. This sorrowful result shows the weakness of a country de- pending wholly upon sources external to itself for the part it is playing in the world. With large deductions, owing to differences of conditions which need not here be spoken of, the case of Holland then has strong points of resemblance to that of Great Britain now ; and they are true prophets, though they seem to be having small honor in their own country, who warn her that the continuance of her prosperity at home depends primarily upon maintaining her power abroad. Men may be discontented at the lack of political privilege ; they will be yet more uneasy if they come to lack bread. It is of more interest to Americans to note that the result to France, regarded as a power of the sea, caused by the extent, delightfulness, and richness of the land, has been reproduced in the United States. In the beginning, their forefathers held a narrow strip of land upon the sea, fertile in parts though little developed, abounding in harbors and near rich fishing-grounds. These physical conditions com- bined with an inborn love of the sea, the pulse of that English ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 39 blood which still beat in their veins, to keep alive all those tendencies and pursuits upon -which a healthy sea power depends. Almost every one of the original colonies was on the sea or on one of its great tributaries. All export and import tended toward one coast. Interest in the sea and an intelligent appreciation of the part it played in the public welfare were easily and widely spread ; and a motive more influential than care for the })ublic interest was also active, for the abundance of ship-building materials and a relative fewness of other investments made shipping a prolitable private interest. How changed the present condition is, all know. The centre of power is no longer on the seaboard. Books and newspapers vie with one another in describing the wonderful growth, and the still undeveloped riches, of the interior. Capital there finds its best investments, labor its largest opportunities. The frontiers are neglected and politi- cally weak ; the Gulf and Pacific coasts actually so, the At- lantic coast relatively to the central Mississippi Valley. When the day comes that shipping again pays, when the three sea frontiers find that they are not only militarily weak, but poorer for lack of national shipping, their united efforts may avail to lay again the foundations of our sea power. Till then, those who follow the limitations which lack of sea power placed upon the career of France may mourn that their own country is being led, by a like redundancy of home wealth, into the same neglect of that great instrument. Among modifying physical conditions may be noted a form like that of Italy, — a long peninsula, with a central range of mountains dividing it into two narrow strips, along which the roads connecting the different ports necessarily run. Only an absolute control of the sea can wholly secure such commu- nications, since it is impossible to know at what point an enemy coming from beyond the visible horizon may strike ; but still, with an adequate naval force centrally posted, there will be good hope of attacking his fleet, which is at once his base and line of communications, before serious damage has been done. The long, narrow peninsula of Florida, with Key 40 DISCUSSION OF THE West at its extremity, though flat and thinly populated, pre- sents at first sight conditions like those of Italy. The resem- blance may be only superficial, but it seems probable that if the chief scene of a naval war were the Gulf of Mexico, the communications by land to the end of the peninsula might be a matter of consequence, and open to attack. When the sea not only borders, or surrounds, but also sepa- rates a country into two or more parts, the control of it becomes not only desirable, but vitally necessary. Such a physical condition either gives birth and strength to sea power, or makes the country powerless. Such is the condi- tion of the present kingdom of Italy, witli its islands of Sar- dinia and Sicily ; and hence in its youth and still existing financial weakness it is seen to put forth such vigorous and intelligent efforts to create a military navy. It has even been argued that, with a navy decidedly superior to her enemy's, Italy could better base her power upon her islands than upon her mainland ; for the insecurity of the lines of commu- nication in the peninsula, already pointed out, would most seriously embarrass an invading army surrounded by a hostile people and threatened from the sea. The Irish Sea, separating the British Islands, rather resem- bles an estuary than an actual division ; but history has shown the danger from it to the United Kingdom. In the days of Louis XIY., when the French navy nearly equalled the -com- bined English and Dutch, the gravest complications existed in Ireland, which passed almost wholly under the control of the natives and the French. Nevertheless, the Irish Sea was rather a danger to the English — a weak point in their com- munications — than an advantage to the French. The latter did not venture their ships-of-the-line in its narrow waters, and expeditions intending to land were directed upon the ocean ports in the south and west. At the supreme moment the great French fleet was sent upon the south coast of Eng- land, wdiere it decisively defeated the allies, and at the same time twenty-five frigates were sent to St. George's Channel, against the English communications. In the midst of a hos- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 41 tile people, the English army in Ireland was seriously imper- illed, bat was saved by the battle of the Boyne and the flight of James II. This movement against the enemy's communi- cations was strictly strategic, and would be just as dangerous to England now as in 1690. Spain, in the same century, afforded an impressive lesson of the weakness caused by such separation when the parts are not knit together by a strong sea power. She then still retained, as remnants of her past greatness, the Netherlands (now Belgium), Sicily, and other Italian possessions, not to speak of her vast colonies in the New World. Yet so low had the Spanish sea power fallen, that a well-informed and sober- minded Hollander of the day could claim that " in Spain all the coast is navigated by a few Dutch ships ; and since the peace of 1648 their ships and seamen are so few that they have publicly begun to hire our ships to sail to the Indies, whereas they were formerly careful to exclude all foreigners from there. ... It is manifest," he goes on, " that the West Indies, being as the stomach to Spain (for from it nearly all the revenue is drawn), must be joined to the Spanish head by a sea force ; and that Naples and the Netherlands, being like two arms, they cannot lay out their strength for Spain, nor receive anything thence but by shipping, — all which may easily be done by our shipping in peace, and by it obstructed in war." Half a century before. Sully, the great minister of Henry lY., had characterized Spain " as one of those States whose legs and arms are strong and powerful, but the heart infinitely weak and feeble." Since his day the Spanish navy had suffered not only disaster, but annihilation ; not only humiliation, but degradation. The consequences briefly were that shipping was destroyed ; manufactures perished with it. The government depended for its support, not upon a wide- spread healthy commerce and industry that could survive many a staggering blow, but upon a narrow stream of silver trickling through a few treasure-ships from America, easily and frequently intercepted by an enemy's cruisers. The loss of half a dozen galleons more than once paralyzed its move- 42 DISCUSSION OF THE ments for a year. While the war in the Netherlands lasted, the Dutch control of the sea forced Spain to send her troops by a long and costly journey overland instead of by sea ; and the same cause reduced her to such straits for necessaries that, by a mutual arrangement which seems very odd to mod- ern ideas, her wants were supplied by Dutch ships, which thus maintained the enemies of their country, but received in return specie which was welcome in the Amsterdam ex- change. In America, the Spanish protected themselves as best they might behind masonry, unaided from home ; while in the Mediterranean they escaped insult and injury mainly through the indifference of the Dutch, for the French and English had not yet begun to contend for mastery there. In the course of history tlie Netherlands, Naples, Sicily, Minorca, Havana, Manila, and Jamaica were wrenched away, at one time or another, from this empire without a shipping. In short, while Spain's maritime impotence may have been pri- marily a symptom of her general decay, it became a marked factor in precipitating her into the abyss from which she has not yet wholly emerged. Except Alaska, the United States has no outlying posses- sion,— no foot of ground inaccessible by land. Its contour is such as to present few points specially weak from their sa- liency, and all important parts of the frontiers can be readily attained, — cheaply by water, rapidly by rail. The weakest frontier, the Pacific, is far removed from the most dangerous of possible enemies. The internal resources are boundless as compared with present needs ; we can live off ourselves indefi- nitely in " our little corner," to use the expression of a French officer to the author. Yet should that little corner be invaded by a new commercial route through the Isthmus, the United States in her turn may have the rude awakening of those who have abandoned their share in the common birthright of all people, the sea. III. Extent of Territory. — The last of the conditions affecting the development of a nation as a sea power, and ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 43 touching the country itself as distinguished from the people who dwell there, is Extent of Territory. This may be dismissed with comparatively few words. As regards the development of sea power, it is not the total number of square miles which a country contains, but the length of its coast-line and the character of its harbors that are to be considered. As to tiiese it is to be said that, the geographical and physical conditions being the same, extent of sea-coast is a source of strength or weakness according as the population is large or small. A country is in this like a fortress ; the garrison must be proportioned to the enceinte. A recent familiar instance is found in the American War of Secession. Had the South had a people as numerous as it was warlike, and a navy commensurate to its other resources as a sea power, the great extent of its sea-coast and its nu- merous inlets would have been elements of great strength. The people of the United States and the Government of that day justly prided themselves on the effectiveness of the block- ade of the whole Southern coast. It was a great feat, a very great feat ; but it would have been an impossible feat had the Southerners been more numerous, and a nation of seamen. What was there shown was not, as has been said, how such a blockade can be maintained, but that such a blockade is possible in the face of a population not only unused to the sea, but also scanty in numbers. Those who recall how the blockade was maintained, and the class of ships that block- aded during great part of the war, know that the plan, correct under the circumstances, could not have been carried out in the face of a real navy. Scattered unsupported along the coast, the United States ships kept their places, singly or in small detachments, in face of an extensive network of inland water communications which favored secret concentration of the enemy. Behind tiie first line of water communications were long estuaries, and here and there strong fortresses, upon either of which the enemy's ships could always fall back to elude pursuit or to receive protection. Had there been a Southern navy to profit by such advantages, or by the 44 DISCUSSION OF THE scattered condition of the United States ships, the latter could not have been distributed as they were ; and being forced to concentrate for mutual support, many small but useful approaches would have been left open to commerce. But as the Southern coast, from its extent and many inlets, might have been a source of strength, so, from those very characteristics, it became a fruitful source of injury. Tlie great story of the opening of the Mississippi is but the most striking illustration of an action that was going on inces- santly all over the South. At every breach of tlie sea fron- tier, war-ships were entering. The streams that had carried the wealth and supported the trade of the seceding States turned against them, and admitted their enemies to their hearts. Dismay, insecurity, paralysis, prevailed in regions that might, under happier auspices, have kept a nation alive through the most exhausting war. Never did sea power play a greater or a more decisive part than in the contest which determined that the course of the world's history would be modified by the existence of one great nation, instead of several rival States, in the North xVmerican continent. But while just pride is felt in the well-earned glory of those days, and the greatness of the results due to naval preponderance is admitted, Americans who understand the facts should never fail to remind the over-confidence of their countrymen that the South not only had no navy, not only was not a seafaring people, but that also its population was not proportioned to the extent of the sea-coast which it had to defend. IV. Numher of Population. — After the consideration of the natural conditions of a country should follow an exami- nation of the characteristics of its population as affecting the development of sea power ; and first among these will be taken, because of its relations to the extent of the territorj", which has just been discussed, the number of the people who live in it. It has been said that in respect of dimensions it is not merely the number of square miles, but the extent and character of the sea-coast that is to be considered with refer- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 45- ence to sea power ; and so, in point of population, it is not only the grand total, but the number following the sea, or at least readily available for employment on ship-board and for the creation of naval material, that must be counted. For example, formerly and up to the end of the great wars following the French Revolution, the population of France was much greater than that of England ; but in respect of sea power in general, peaceful commerce as well as military efficiency, France was much inferior to England. In the matter of military efficiency this fact is the more remarkable because at times, in point of military preparation at the out- break of war, France had the advantage; but she was not able to keep it. Thus in 1778, when war broke out, France, through her maritime inscription, was able to man at once fifty ships-of-the-line. England, on the contrary, by reason of the dispersal over the globe of that very shipping on which her naval strength so securely rested, had much trouble in manning forty at home ; but in 1782 she had one hun- dred and twenty in commission or ready for commission, while France had never been able to exceed seventy-one. Again, as late as 1840, when the two nations were on the verge of war in the Levant, a most accomplished French offi- cer of the day, while extolling the high state of efficiency of the French fleet and tlie eminent qualities of its admiral, and expressing confidence in the results of an encounter with an equal enemy, goes on to say : " Behind the squadron of twenty-one ships-of-the-line which we could then assemble, there was no reserve ; not another ship could have been com- missioned within six montlis." And this was due not only to lack of ships and of proper equipments, though both were wanting. " Our maritime inscription," he continues, " was so exhausted by what we had done [in manning twenty-one ships], that the permanent levy established in all quarters did not supply reliefs for the men, who were already more than three years on cruise." A cojitrast such as this shows a difference in what is called staying power, or reserve force, which is even greater than 46 DISCUSSION OF THE appears on the surface ; for a great shipping afloat neces- sarily employs, besides the crews, a large ninnber of people engaged in the various handicrafts which facilitate the mak- ing and repairing of naval material, or following other callings more or less closely connected with the water and with craft of all kinds. Such kindred callings give an undoubted aptitude for the sea from the outset. There is an anecdote showing curious insight into this matter on the part of one of Eng- land's distinguished seamen, Sir Edward Pellew. When the Avar broke out in 1793, the usual scarceness of seamen was met. Eager to get to sea and unable to fill his complement otherwise than with landsmen, he instructed his officers to seek for Cornish miners ; reasoning from the conditions and dangers of their calling, of which he had personal knowledge, that they would quickly fit into the demands of sea life. The result showed his sagacity, for, thus escaping an otherwise unavoidable delay, he was fortunate enough to capture the first frigate taken in the war in single combat ; and what is especially instructive is, that although but a few weeks in commission, while his opponent had been over a year, the losses, heavy on both sides, were nearly equal. It may be urged that such reserve strength has now nearly lost the importance it once had, because modern ships and weapons take so long to make, and because modern States aim at developing the whole power of their armed force, on the outbreak of war, with such rapidity as to strike a dis- abling blow before the enemy can organize an equal effort. To use a familiar phrase, there will not be time for the whole resistance of the national fabric to come into play ; the blow will fall on the organized military fleet, and if that yield, the solidity of the rest of the structure will avail nothing. To a certain extent this is true; but then it has always been true, though to a less extent formerly than now. Granted the meeting of two fleets which represent practically tlie whole present strength of their two nations, if one of them be de- stroyed, while the other remains fit for action, there will be much less hope now than formerly that the vanquished can ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 47 restore his navy for that war ; and the result will be disas- trous just in proportion to the dependence of the nation upon her sea power. A Trafalgar would have been a much more fatal blow to England than it was to France, had the English fleet then represented, as the allied fleet did, the bulk of the nation's power. Trafalgar in such a case would have been to England what Austerlitz was to Austria, and Jena to Prus- sia ; an empire would have been laid prostrate by the destruc- tion or disorganization of its military forces, which, it is said, were the favorite objective of Napoleon. But does the consideration of such exceptional disasters in the past justify the putting a low value upon that reserve strength, based upon the number of inhabitants fitted for a certain kind of military life, which is here being considered ? The blows just mentioned were dealt by men of exceptional genius, at the head of armed bodies of exceptional training, eaprit-de-corps, and prestige, and were, besides, inflicted upon opponents more or less demoralized by conscious inferiority and previous defeat. Austerlitz had been closely preceded by Ulm, where thirty thousand Austrians laid down their arms without a battle ; and the history of the previous years had been one long record of Austrian reverse and French success, Trafalgar followed closely upon a cruise, justly called a cam- paign, of almost constant failure ; and farther back, but still recent, were the memories of St. Vincent for the Spaniards, and of the Nile for the French, in the allied fleet. Except the case of Jena, these crushing overthrows were not single disasters, but final blows ; and in the Jena campaign there was a disparity in numbers, equipment, and general prepara- tion for war, which makes it less applicable in considering what may result from a single victory. England is at the present time the greatest maritime nation in the world ; in steam and iron she has kept the superiority she had in the days of sail and wood. France and England are the two powers that have the largest military navies ; and it is so far an open question which of the two is the more powerful, that they may be regarded as practically of equal 48 DISCUSSION OF THE strength in material for a sea war. In the case of a collision can there be assumed sucli a difference of jjersonnel, or of preparation, as to make it probable that a decisive inequality will result from one battle or one campaign ? If not, the reserve strength will begin to tell ; organized reserve first, then reserve of seafaring population, reserve of mechanical skill, reserve of wealth. It seems to have been somewhat forgotten that England's leadership in mechanical arts gives her a reserve of mechanics, who can easily familiarize them- selves with the appliances of modern iron-clads ; and as her commerce and industries feel the burden of the war, the sur- plus of seamen and mechanics will go to the armed sliipping. The whole question of the value of a reserve, developed or undeveloped, amounts now to this : Have modern conditions of warfare made it probable that, of two nearly equal adver- saries, one will be so prostrated in a single campaign that a decisive result will be reached in that time ? Sea warfare has given no answer. The crushing successes of Prussia against Austria, and of Germany against France, appear to have been those of a stronger over a much weaker nation, whether the weakness were due to natural causes, or to offi- cial incompetency. How would a delay like that of Plevna have affected the fortune of war, had Turkey had any reserve of national power upon which to call ? If time be, as is everywhere admitted, a supreme factor in war, it behooves countries whose genius is essentially not military, whose people, like all free people, object to pay for large military establishments, to see to it that they are at least strong enough to gain the time necessary to turn the spirit and capacity of their subjects into the new activities which war calls for. If the existing force by land or sea is strong enough so to hold out, even though at a disadvantage, the country may rely upon its natural resources and strength coming into play for whatever they are worth, — its numbers, its wealth, its capacities of every kind. If, on the other hand, what force it has can be overthrown and crushed quickly, the most magnificent possibilities of natural power will not save ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 49 it from humiliating conditions, nor, if its foe be wise, from guarantees which will postpone revenge to a distant future. The story is constantly repeated on the smaller fields of war : " If so-and-so can hold out a little longer, this can be saved or that can be done ; " as in sickness it is often said : " If the patient can only hold out so long, the strength of his constitution may pull him through." England to some extent is now such a country. Holland was such a country ; she would not pay, and if she escaped, it was but by the skin of her teeth. " Never in time of peace and from fear of a rupture," wrote their great states- man, De Witt, " will they take resolutions strong enough to lead them to pecuniary sacrifices beforehand. The character of the Dutch is such that, unless danger stares them in the face, they are indisposed to lay out money for their own de- fence. I have to do with a people who, liberal to profusion where they ought to economize, are often sparing to avarice where they ought to spend." That our own country is open to the same reproach, is pa- tent to all the world. The United States has not that shield of defensive power behind which time can be gained to develop its reserve of strength. As for a seafaring population ade- quate to her possible needs, where is it ? Such a resource, proportionate to her coast-line and population, is to be found only in a national merchant shipping and its related industries, which at present scarcely exist. It will matter little whether the crews of such ships are native or foreign born, provided they are attached to the flag, and her power at sea is sufficient to enable the most of them to get back in case of war. "When foreigners by thousands are admitted to the ballot, it is of little moment that they are given fighting-room on board ship. Though the treatment of the subject has been somewhat discursive, it may be admitted that a great population follow- ing callings related to the sea is, now as formerly, a great element of sea power ; that the United States is deficient in that element ; , and that its foundations can be laid only in a large commerce under her own flag. 4 50 DISCUSSION OF THE Y. National Character. — The effect of national character and aptitudes upon the development of sea power will next be considered. If sea power be really based upon a peaceful and extensive commerce, aptitude for commercial pursuits must be a dis- tinguishing feature of the nations that have at one time or another been great upon the sea. History almost without exception affirms that this is true. Save the Romans, there is no marked instance to the contrary. All men seek gain and, more or less, love money ; but the way in which gain is sought will have a marked effect upon the commercial fortunes and the history of the people inhabit- ing a country. If history may be believed, the way in which tlie Spaniards and their kindred nation, the Portuguese, sought wealth, not only brought a blot upon the national character, but was also fatal to the growth of a healthy commerce ; and so to the industries upon which commerce lives, and ultimately to that national wealth which was sought by mistaken paths. The desire for gain rose in them to fierce avarice ; so they sought in tlie new-found worlds which gave such an impetus to the commercial and maritime devejopment of the countries of Europe, not new fields of industry, not even the healthy excitement of exploration and adventure, but gold and silver. They had many great qualities ; they were bold, enterprising, temperate, patient of suffering, enthusiastic, and gifted with intense national feeling. When to these qualities are added the advantages of Spain's position and well-situated ports, the fact that she was first to occupy large and rich portions of the new worlds and long remained without a competitor, and that for a hundred years after the discovery of America she was the leading State in Europe, she might have been ex- pected to take the foremost place among the sea powers. Exactly the contrary was the result, as all know. Since the battle of Lepanto in 1571, though engaged in many wars, no sea victory of any consequence shines on the pages of Spanish history ; and the decay of her commerce sufficiently accounts ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 51 for the painful and sometimes ludicrous inaptness shown on the decks of her ships of war. Doirbtless such a result is not to be attributed to one cause only. Doubtless the govern- ment of Spain was in many ways such as to cramp and blight a free and healthy development of private enterprise ; but the character of a great people breaks through or shapes the character of its government, and it can hardly be doubted that had the bent of the people been toward trade, the action of government would have been drawn into the same current. The great field of the colonies, also, was remote from the centre of that despotism which blighted the growth of old Spain. As it was, thousands of Spaniards, of the working as well as the upper classes, left Spain ; and the occupa- tions in which they engaged abroad sent home little but specie, or merchandise of small bulk, requiring but small tonnage. The mother-country herself produced little but wool, fruit, and iron ; her manufactures were naught ; her industries suffered ; her population steadily decreased. Both she and her colonies depended upon the Dutch for so many of the necessaries of life, that the products of their scanty in- dustries could not suffice to pay for them. "So that Holland merchants," writes a contemporary, " who carry money to most parts of the world to buy commodities, must out of this single country of Europe carry home money, which they receive in payment of their goods." Thus their eagerly sought emblem of wealth passed quickly from their hands. Tt has already been pointed out how weak, from a military point of view, Spain was from this decay of her shipping. Ilcr wealth being in small bulk on a few ships, following more or less regular routes, was easily seized by an enemy, and the sinews of war paralyzed ; whereas the wealth of England and Holland, scattered over thousands of ships in all parts of the world, received many bitter blows in many exhausting wars, without checking a growth wdiich, though painful, was steady. The fortunes of Portugal, united to Spain during a most critical period of her history, followed the same downward path ; although foremost in the begin- 52 DISCUSSION OF THE ning of the race for development by sea, she fell utterly behind. " The mhies of Brazil were the ruin of Portugal, as those of Mexico and Peru had been of Spain ; all manufac- tures fell into insane contempt ; ere long the English sup- plied the Portuguese not only with clothes, but with all mer- chandise, all commodities, even to salt-fish and grain. After their gold, the Portuguese abandoned their very soil ; the vineyards of Oporto were finally bought by the English with Brazilian gold, which had only passed through Portugal to be spread throughout England." We are assured that in fifty years, five hundred millions of dollars were extracted from " the mines of Brazil, and that at the end of the time Portugal had but twenty -five millions in specie," — a striking example of the difference between real and fictitious wealth. The Englisli and Dutch were no less desirous of gain than the southern nations. Each in turn has been called " a na- tion of shopkeepers ; " but the jeer, in so far as it is just, is to the credit of their wisdom and uprightness. They were no less bold, no less enterprising, no less patient. Indeed, they were more patient, in that they sought riches not by the sword but by labor, which is the reproach meant to be implied by the epithet ; for thus they took the longest, instead of what seemed the shortest, road to wealth. But these two peoples, radically of the same race, had other qualities, no less impor- tant than those just named, which combined with their sur- roundings to favor their development by sea. They were by nature business-men, traders, producers, negotiators. There- fore both in their native country and abroad, whether settled in the ports of civilized nations, or of barbarous eastern rulers, or in colonies of their own foundation, they every- where strove to draw out all the resources of the land, to develop and increase them. The quick instinct of the born trader, shopkeeper if you will, sought continually new articles to exchange ; and this search, combined with the industrious character evolved through generations of labor, made them necessarily producers. At home they became great as manu- facturers ; abroad, where they controlled, the land grew richer ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 53 continually, products multiplied, and the necessary exchange between home and the settlements called for more ships. Their shipping therefore increased with these demands of trade, and nations with less aptitude for maritime enterprise, even France herself, great as she has been, called for their products and for the service of their ships. Thus in many ways they advanced to power at sea. This natural tendency and growth were indeed modified and seriously checked at times by the interference of other governments, jealous of a prosperity which their own people could invade only by the aid of artificial support, — a support which will be considered under the head of governmental action as affecting sea power. The tendency to trade, involving of necessity the produc- tion of something to trade with, is the national characteristic most important to the development of sea power. Granting it and a good seaboard, it is not likely that the dangers of the sea, or any aversion to it, will deter a people from seeking wealth by the paths of ocean commerce. Where wealth is sought by other means, it may be found; but it will not ne- cessarily lead to sea power. Take France. France has a fine country, an industrious people, an admirable position. The French navy has known periods of great glory, and in its lowest estate has never dishonored the military reputation so dear to the nation. Yet as a maritime State, securely resting upon a broad basis of sea commerce, France, as compared with other historical sea-peoples, has never held more than a respectable position. The chief, reason for this, so far as national character goes, is the way in which wealth is sought. As Spain and Portugal sought it by digging gold out of the ground, the temper of the French people leads them to seek it by thrift, economy, hoarding. It is said to be harder to keep than to make a fortune. Possibly ; but the adventurous temper, which risks what it has to gain more, has much in common with the adventurous spirit that conquers worlds for commerce. The tendency to save and put aside, to venture timidly and on a small scale, may lead to a general diffusion 54 DISCUSSION OF THE of wealth on a like small scale, but not to the risks and de- velopment of external trade and shipping interests. To illus- trate,— and the incident is given only for what it is worth, — a French officer, speaking to the author about the Panama Canal, said : " I have two shares in it. In France we don't do as you, where a few people take a great many shares each. With us a large number of people take one share or a very few. When these were in the market my wife said to me, ' You take two shares, one for you and one for me.' " As regards the stability of a man's personal fortunes this kind of prudence is doubtless wise ; but when excessive prudence or financial timidity becomes a national trait, it must tend to hamper the expansion of commerce and of the nation's ship- ping. The same caution in money matters, appearing in an- other relation of life, has checked the production of children, and keeps the population of France nearly stationary. The noble classes of Europe inherited from tlie Middle Ages a supercilious contempt for peaceful trade, which has exer- cised a modifying influence upon its growth, according to the national character of different countries. The pride of the Spaniards fell easily in with this spirit of contempt, and co- operated with that disastrous unwillingness to work and wait for wealth which turned them away from commerce. In France, the vanity which is conceded even by Frenchmen to be a national trait led in the same direction. The numbers and brilliancy of the nobility, and the consideration enjoyed by them, set a seal of inferiority upon an occupation which they despised. Rich mercliants and manufacturers sighed for the honors of nobility, and upon obtaining them, abandoned their lucrative professions. Tlierefore, while the industry of the people and the fruitfulness of the soil saved commerce from total decay, it was pursued under a sense of humiliation which caused its best representatives to escape from it as soon as they could. Louis XIV., under the influence of Colbert, put forth an ordinance " authorizing all noblemen to take an interest in merchant ships, goods and merchandise, without being considered as having derogated from nobility, ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 55 provided they did not sell at retail ; " and the reason given for this action was, " that it imports the good of our subjects and our own satisfaction, to efface the relic of a public opin- ion, universally prevalent, that maritime commerce is incom- patible with nobility." But a prejudice involving conscious and open superiority is not readily effaced by ordinances, especially when vanity is a conspicuous trait in national char- acter ; and many years later Montesquieu taught that it is contrary to the spirit of monarchy that the nobility should engage in trade. In Holland there was a nobility ; but the State was repub- lican in name, allowed large scope to personal freedom and enterprise, and the centres of power were in the great cities. The foundation of the national greatness was money — or rather wealth. Wealth, as a source of civic distinction, car- ried with it also power in the State ; and with power there went social position and consideration. In England the same result obtained. The nobility were proud ; but in a repre- sentative government the power of wealth could be neither put down nor overshadowed. It was patent to the eyes of all, it was honored by all ; and in England, as well as Holland, the occupations which were the source of wealth shared in the honor given to wealth itself. Thus, in all the countries named, social sentiment, the outcome of national character- istics, had a marked influence upon the national attitude toward trade. In yet another way does the national genius affect the growth of sea power in its broadest sense ; and that is in so far as it possesses the capacity for planting healthy colonies. Of colonization, as of all other growtlis, it is true that it is most healthy when it is most natural. Therefore colonies that spring from the felt wants and natural impulses of a whole people will have the most solid foundations ; and their sub- sequent growth will be surest when they are least trammelled from home, if the people have the genius for independent action. Men of the past three centuries have keenly felt the value to the mother-country of colonies as outlets for the 56 DISCUSSION OF THE home products and as a nursery for commerce and shipping ; but efforts at colonization have not had tlie same general origin, nor have different systems all had the same success. The efforts of statesmen, however far-seeing and careful, liave not been able to supply the lack of strong natural im- pulse ; nor can the most minute regulation from home pro- duce as good results as a happier neglect, when the germ of self-development is found in the national character. There has been no greater display of wisdom in the national ad- ministration of successful colonies than in that of unsuc- cessful. Perhaps there has been even less. If elaborate system and supervision, careful adaptation of means to ends, diligent nursing, could avail for colonial growth, the genius of England has less of this systematizing faculty than the genius of France ; but England, not France, has been the great colonizer of the world. Successful colonization, with its consequent effect upon commerce and sea power, depends essentially upon national character ; because colonies grow best when they grow of themselves, naturally. The char- acter of the colonist, not the care of the home government, is the principle of the colony's growth. This truth stands out the clearer because the general atti- tude of all the home governments toward their colonies was entirely selfish. However founded, as soon as it was recog- nized to be of consequence, the colony became to the home country a cow to be milked ; to be cared for, of course, but chiefly as a piece of property valued for the returns it gave. Legislation was directed toward a monopoly of its external trade ; the places in its government afforded posts of value for occupants from the mother-country ; and the colony was looked upon, as the sea still so often is, as a fit place for those who were ungovernable or useless at home. The mili- tary administration, however, so long as it remains a colony, is the proper and necessary attribute of the home government. The fact of England's unique and wonderful success as a great colonizing nation is too evident to be dwelt upon ; and the reason for it appears to lie chiefly in two traits of the ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 57 national character. The English colonist naturally and readily settles down in his new country, identifies his interest with it, and though keeping an affectionate remembrance of the home from which he came, has no restless eagerness to re- turn. In the second place, the Englishman at once and in- stinctively seeks to develop the resources of the new country in the broadest sense. In the former particular he differs from the French, who were ever longingly looking back to the delights of their pleasant land ; in the latter, from the Spaniards, whose range of interest and ambition was too narrow for the full evolution of the possibilities of a new country. The character and the necessities of the Dutch led them naturally to plant colonies ; and by the year 1650 they had in the East Indies, in Africa, and in America a large number, only to name which would be tedious. They were then far ahead of England in this matter. But though the origin of tliese colonies, purely commercial in its character, was natural, there seems to have been lacking to them a principle of growth. " In planting them they never sought an extension of empire, but merely an acquisition of trade and commerce. They attempted conquest only when forced by the pressure of circumstances. Generally they were content to trade under the protection of the sovereign of the country." This placid satisfaction with gain alone, unaccompanied by political ambi- tion, tended, like the despotism of Fr .k 3 and Spain, to keep the colonies mere commercial dependencies upon the mother- country, and so killed the natural principle of growth. Before quitting this head of tlie inquiry, it is well to ask how far the national character of Americans is fitted to de- velop a great sea power, should other circumstances become favorable. It seems scarcely necessary, however, to do more than appeal to a not very distant past to prove that, if legislative hindrances be removed, and more remunerative fields of enterprise filled up, the sea power will not long delay its appearance. The instinct for commerce, bold enterprise in 58 DISCUSSION OF THE the pursuit of gain, and a keen scent for the trails that lead to it, all exist ; and if there be in the future any fields calling for colonization, it cannot be doubted that Americans will carry to them all their inherited aptitude for self-government and independent growth. VL Character of the Government. — In discussing the ef- fects upon the development of a nation's sea power exerted by its government and institutions, it will be necessary to avoid a tendency to over-philosophizing, to confine attention to obvious and immediate causes and their plain results, without prying too far beneath the surface for remote and ultimate influences. Nevertheless, it must be noted that particular forms of government with their accompanying institutions, and the character of rulers at one time or another, have exercised a very marked influence upon the development of sea power. The various traits of a country and its people which have so far been considered constitute the natural characteristics with which a nation, like a man, begins its career ; the con- duct of the government in turn corresponds to the exercise of the intelligent will-power, which, according as it is wise, energetic and persevering, or the reverse, causes success or failure in a man's life or a nation's history. It would seem probable that a government in full accord with the natural bias of its people would most successfully advance its growth icl every respect ; and, in the matter of sea power, the most brilliant successes have followed where there has been intelligent direction by a government f«lly imbued with the spirit of the people and conscious of its true general bent. Such a government is most certainly secured when the will of the people, or of their best natural exponents, has some large share in making it ; but such free govern- ments have sometimes fallen short, while on the other hand despotic power, wielded with judgment and consistency, has created at times a great sea commerce and a brilliant navy with greater directness than can be reached by the slower processes of a free people. The difficulty in the latter case ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 59 is to insure perseverance after the death of a particular despot. England having undoubtedly reached the greatest height of sea power of any modern nation, the action of her government first claims attention. In general direction this action has been consistent, though often far from praiseworthy. It has aimed steadily at the control of the sea. One of its most arrogant expressions dates back as far as the reign of James I., when she had scarce any possessions outside her own islands ; before Vii-ginia or Massachusetts was settled. Here is Richelieu's account of it : — " The Duke of Sully, minister of Henry IV. [one of the most chivalrous princes that ever lived], having embarked at Calais in a French ship wearing the French Hag at the main, was no sooner in the Channel than, meeting an English despatch-boat which was there to receive him, the commander of the latter ordered the French ship to lower her flag. The Duke, considering that his quality fi-eed him from such an affront, boldly refused ; but this refusal was followed by three cannon-shot, which, piercing his ship, pierced the heart like- wise of all good Frenchmen. Might forced him to yield what right forbade, and for all the complaints he made he could get no better reply from the English captain than this : ' That just as his duty obliged him to honor the ambassador's rank, it also obliged him to exact the honor due to the flag of his master as sovereign of the sea.' If the words of King James himself were more polite, they neverthe- less had no other effect than to compel the Duke to take counsel of his prudence, feigning to be satisfied, while his wound was all the time smarting and incurable. Henry the Great had to practise mod- eration on this occasion ; but with the resolve another time to sustain the rights of his crown by the force that, with the aid of time, he should be able to put upon the sea." This act of unpardonable insolence, according to modern ideas, was not so much out of accord with the spirit of nations in that day. It is chiefly noteworthy as the most striking, as well as one of the earliest indications of the purpose of Eng- land to assert herself at all risks upon the sea ; and the insult was offered under one of her most timid kinffs to an ambassa- 60 DISCUSSION OF THE dor immediately representing the bravest and ablest of French sovereigns. This empty honor of the flag, a claim insignifi- cant except as the outward manifestation of the purpose of a government, was as rigidly exacted under Cromwell as under the kings. It was one of the conditions of peace yielded by the Dutch after tlieir disastrous war of 1654. Cromwell, a despot in everything but name, was keenly alive to all that concerned England's honor and strength, and did not stop at barren salutes to promote them. Hardly yet possessed of power, the English navy sprang rapidly into a new life and vigor under his stern rule. England's rights, or reparation for her wrongs, were demanded by her fleets throughout the world, — in the Baltic, in the Mediterranean, against tlie Bar- bary States, in the West Indies ; and under liim the conquest of Jamaica began that extension of her empire, by force of arms, which has gone on to our own days. Nor were equally strong peaceful measures for the growth of English trade and shipping forgotten. Cromwell's celebrated Navigation Act de- clared that all imports into England or her colonics must be conveyed exclusively in vessels belonging to England herself, or to the country in which the products carried were grown or manufactured. This decree, aimed specially at the Dutch, the common carriers of Europe, was resented throughout the com- mercial world ; but the benefit to England, in those days of national strife and animosity, was so apparent that it lasted long under the monarchy. A century and a quarter later we find Nelson, before his famous career had begun, showing his zeal for the welfare of England's shipping by enforcing this same act in the West Indies against American merchant-ships. When Cromwell was dead, and Charles II. sat on the throne of his father, this king, false to the English people, was yet true to England's greatness and to the traditional policy of her government on the sea. In his treacherous intrigues with Louis XIV., by which he aimed to make himself independent of Parliament and people, he wrote to Louis : " There are two impediments to a perfect union. The first is the great care France is now taking to create a commerce and to be an im- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 61 posing maritime power. This is so great a cause of suspicion with us, who can possess importance only by our commerce and our naval force, that every step which France takes in this direction will perpetuate the jealousy between the two nations." In the midst of the negotiations which preceded the detestable attack of the two kings upon the Dutch repub- lic, a warm dispute arose as to who should command the united fleets of France and England. Charles was inflexible on this point. " It is the custom of the English," said he, " to command at sea ; " and he told the French ambassador plainly that, were he to yield, his subjects would not obey him. In the projected partition of the United Provinces he reserved for England the maritime plunder in positions tliat controlled the mouths of the rivers Scheldt and Meuse. The navy under Charles preserved for some time the spirit and discipline impressed on it by Cromwell's iron rule; thougli later it shared in the general decay of morale which marked this evil reign. Monk, having by a great strategic blunder sent off a fourth of his fleet, found himself in 1666 in pres- ence of a greatly superior Dutch force. Disregarding the odds, he attacked without hesitation, and for three days main- tained the fight with honor, though with loss. Such conduct is not war ; but in the single eye that looked to England's naval prestige and dictated his action, common as it was to England's people as well as to her government, has lain the secret of final success following many blunders through the centuries. Charles's successor, James IL, was himself a seaman, and had commanded in two great sea-fights. When William III. came to the throne, the governments of England and Holland were under one hand, and continued united in one purpose against Louis XIV. until the Peace of Utrecht in 1713 ; that is, for a quarter of a century. The English government more and more steadily, and with con- scious purpose, pushed on the extension of her sea dominion and fostered the growth of her sea power. While as an open enemy she struck at France upon the sea, so as an artful friend, many at least believed, she sapped the power of Hoi- 62 DISCUSSION OF THE land afloat. The treaty between the two countries provided that of the sea forces Holland should furnish three eighths, England five eighths, or nearly double. Such a provision, coupled with a further one which made Holland keep up an army of 102,000 against England's 40,000, virtually threw the land war on one and the sea war on the other. The tendency, whether designed or not, is evident ; and at the peace, while Holland received compensation by land, Eng- land obtained, besides commercial privileges in France, Spain, and the Spanish West Indies, the important maritime concessions of Gibraltar and Port Mahon in the Mediterra- nean ; of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Hudson's Bay in North America. The naval power of France and Spain had disappeared ; that of Holland thenceforth steadily declined. Posted thus in America, the West Indies, and the Medi- terranean, the English government thenceforth moved firmly forward on the path which made of the English kingdom the British Empire. For the twenty-five years following the Peace of Utrecht, peace was the chief aim of the ministers who directed the policy of the two great seaboard nations, France and England ; but amid all the fluctuations of conti- nental politics in a most unsettled period, abounding in petty wars and shifty treaties, the eye of England was steadily fixed on the maintenance of her sea power. In the Baltic, her fleets checked the attempts of Peter the Great upon Sweden, and so maintained a balance of power in that sea, from which she drew not only a great trade but the chief part of her naval stores, and which the Czar aimed to make a Russian lake. Denmark endeavored to establish an East India company aided by foreign capital ; England and Holland not only forbade their subjects to join it, but threatened Denmark, and thus stopped an enterprise they thought adverse to their sea interests. In the Netherlands, which by the Utrecht Treaty had passed to Austria, a similar East India company, having Ostend for its port, was formed, with the emperor's sanction. This step, meant to restore to the Low Countries the trade lost to them through their natural outlet of the Scheldt, was opposed by ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 63 the sea powers England and Holland ; and their greediness for the monopoly of trade, helped in this instance by France, stifled this company also after a few years of struggling life. In the Mediterranean, the Utrecht settlement was disturbed by the emperor of Austria, England's natural ally in the then existing state of European politics. Backed by England, he, having already Naples, claimed also Sicily in exchange for Sardinia. Spain resisted ; and her navy, just beginning to revive under a vigorous minister, Alberoni, was cruslied and annihilated by the English fleet off Cape Passaro in 1718 ; while the following year a French army, at the bidding of England, crossed the Pyrenees and completed the work by destroying the Spanish dock-yards. Thus England, in addi- tion to Gibraltar and Mahon in her own hands, saw Naples and Sicily in those of a friend, while an enemy was struck down. In Spanish America, the limited privileges to English trade, wrung from the necessities of Spain, were abused by an extensive and scarcely disguised smuggling system ; and when the exasperated Spanish government gave way to excesses in the mode of suppression, both the minister who counselled peace and the opposition which urged war defended their opinions by alleging the effects of either upon England's sea power and honor. While England's policy thus steadily aimed at widening and strengthening the bases of her sway upon the ocean, the other governments of Europe seemed blind to the dangers to be feared from her sea growth. The miseries re- sulting from the overweening power of Spain in days long gone by seemed to be forgotten ; forgotten also the more re- cent lesson of the bloody and costly wars provoked by the ambition and exaggerated power of Louis XIV. Under the eyes of the statesmen of Europe there was steadily and visibly being built up a third overwhelming power, destined to be used as selfishly, as aggressively, though not as cruelly, and much more successfully than any that had preceded it. This was the power of the sea, whose workings, because more silent than the clash of arms, are less often noted, though lying clearly enough on the surface. It can scarcely be denied 64 DISCUSSION OF THE that England's uncontrolled dominion of the seas, during almost the whole period chosen for our subject, was by long odds the chief among the military factors that determined the final issue. ^ So far, however, was this influence from being foreseen after Utrecht, that France for twelve years, moved by personal exigencies of her rulers, sided with England against Spain ; and when Pleuri came into power in 1726, though this policy was reversed, the navy of France received no attention, and the only blow at England was the establish- ment of a Bourbon prince, a natural enemy to her, upon the throne of the two Sicilies in 1736. When war broke out with Spain in 1739, the navy of England was in numbers more than equal to the combined navies of Spain and France ; and during the quarter of a century of nearly uninterrupted war that followed, this numerical disproportion increased. In these wars England, at first instinctively, afterward with con- scious purpose under a government that recognized her oppor- tunity and the possibilities of her great sea power, rapidly built up that mighty colonial empire whose foundations were already securely laid in the characteristics of her colonists and the strength of her fleets. In strictly European affairs her wealth, the outcome of her sea power, made her play a conspicuous part during the same period. The system of subsidies, which began half a century before in the wars of Marlborough and received its most extensive development half a century later in the Napoleonic wars, maintained the efforts of her allies, which would have been crippled, if not paralyzed, without them. Who can deny that the government which with one hand strengthened its fainting allies on the continent with the life-blood of money, and with the other drove its own enemies off the sea and out of their chief possessions, Canada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Havana, Manila, gave to its country 1 An interesting proof of the weight attributed to the naval power of Great Britain by a great military authority will be found in the opening chapter of Joniini's " History of the Wars of the French Kevolution." He lays down, as a fundamental principle of European policy, that an unlimited expansion of naval force should not be permitted to any nation which cannot be approached by laud, — a description which can apply only to Great Britain. ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 65 the foremost role in European politics ; and who can fail to see that the power which dwelt in that government, with a land narrow in extent and poor in resources, sprang directly from the sea ? The policy in which the English government carried on the war is shown by a speech of Pitt, the master- spirit during its course, though he lost office before bringing it to an end. Condemning the Peace of 1763, made by his political opponent, he said : " France is chiefly, if not exclu- sively, formidable to us as a maritime and commercial power. What we gain in this respect is valuable to us, above all, through the injury to her which results from it. You have left to France the possibility of reviving her navy." Yet Eng- land's gains were enormous ; her rule in India was assured, and all North America east of the Mississippi in her hands. By this time the onward path of her government was clearly marked out, had assumed the force of a tradition, and was consistently followed. The war of the American Revolution was, it is true, a great mistake, looked at from the point of view of sea power ; but the government was led into it in- sensibly by a series of natural blunders. Putting aside polit- ical and constitutional considerations, and looking at the question as purely military or naval, the case was this : The American colonies were large and growing communities at a great distance from England. So long as they remained at- tached to the mother-country, as they tlien were enthusiasti- cally, they formed a solid base for her sea power in that part of the world ; but theii'' extent and population were too great, when coupled with the distance from England, to afford any hope of holding them by force, if any powerful nations were willing to help them. This " if," however, involved a noto- rious probability ; the humiliation of France and Spain was so bitter and so recent that they were sure to seek revenge, and it was well known that France in particular had been care- fully and rapidly building up her navy. Had the colonies been thirteen islands, the sea power of England would quickly have settled the question ; but instead of such a physical bar- rier they were separated only by local jealousies which a com- 5 66 DISCUSSION OF THE mon danger sufficiently overcame. To enter deliberately on such a contest, to try to hold by force so extensive a territory, with a large hostile population, so far from home, was to renew the Seven Years' War with France and Spain, and with the Americans, against, instead of for, England. The Seven Years' War had been so heavy a burden that a wise govern- ment would have known that the added weight could not be borne, and have seen it was necessary to conciliate the colo- nists. The government of the day was not wise, and a large element of England's sea power was sacrificed ; but by mis- take, not wilfully ; through arrogance, not through weakness. This steady keeping to a general line of policy was doubt- less made specially easy for successive English governments by the clear indications of the country's conditions. Single- ness of purpose was to some extent imposed. The firm main- tenance of her sea power, the haughty determination to make it felt, the wise state of preparation in which its military ele- ment was kept, were yet more due to that feature of her political institutions which practically gave the government, during the period in question, into the hands of a class, — a landed aristocracy. Such a class, whatever its defects other- wise, readily takes up and carries on a sound political tradition, is naturally proud of its country's glory, and comparatively insensible to the sufferings of the community by which that glory is maintained. It readily lays on the pecuniary burden necessary for preparation and for endurance of war. Being as a body rich, it feels those burdens less. Not being com- mercial, the sources of its own wealth are not so immediately endangered, and it does not share that political timidity which characterizes those whose property is exposed and business threatened, — the proverbial timidity of capital. Yet in Eng- land this class was not insensible to anything that touched her trade for good or ill. Both houses of Parliament vied in careful watclifulness over its extension and protection, and to the frequency of their inquiries a naval historian attributes the increased efficiency of the executive power in its manage- ment of the navy. Such a class also naturally imbibes and ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 67 keeps up a spirit of military honor, which is of the first im- portance in ages when mihtary institutions have not yet pro- vided the sufficient substitute in what is called esprit-de-corps. But although full of class feeling and class prejudice, which made themselves felt in the navy as well as elsewhere, their practical sense left open the way of promotion to its highest honors to the more humbly born ; and every age saw admirals who had sprung from the lowest of the people. In this the temper of the English upper class differed markedly from that of the French. As late as 1789, at the outbreak of the Revo- lution, the French Navy List still bore the name of an official whose duty was to verify the proofs of noble birth on the part of those intending to enter the naval school. Since 1815, and especially in our own day, the government of England has passed very much more into the hands of the people at large. Whether her sea power will suffer there- from remains to be seen. Its broad basis still remains in a great trade, large mechanical industries, and an extensive colonial system. Whether a democratic government will have the foresight, the keen sensitiveness to national position and credit, the willingness to insure its prosperity by adequate outpouring of money in times of peace, all which are necessary for military preparation, is yet an open question. Popular governments are not generally favorable to military expendi- ture, however necessary, and there are signs that England tends to drop behind. It has already been seen that the Dutch Republic, even more than the English nation, drew its prosperity and its very life from the sea. The character and policy of its gov- ernment were far less favorable to a consistent support of sea power. Composed of seven provinces, with the political name of the United Provinces, the actual distribution of power may be roughly described to Americans as an exaggerated example of States Rights. Each of the maritim.e provinces had its own fleet and its own admiralty, with consequent jealousies. This disorganizing tendency was partly counteracted by the great preponderance of the Province of Holland, which alone con- 68 DISCUSSION OF THE tributed five sixths of the fleet and fifty-eight per cent of the taxes, and consequently had a proportionate share in directing the national policy. Although intensely patriotic, and capa- ble of making the last sacrifices for freedom, the commercial spirit of the people penetrated the government, which indeed might be called a commercial aristocracy, and made it averse to war, and to the expenditures which are necessary in prepar- ing for war. As has before been said, it was not until danger stared them in the face that the burgomasters were willing to pay for their defences. While the republican government lasted, however, this economy was practised least of all upon the fleet ; and until the death of John De Witt, in 1672, and the peace with England in 1674, the Dutch navy was in point of numbers and equipment able to make a fair show against the combined navies of England and France. Its efficiency at this time undoubtedly saved the country from the destruction planned by the two kings. With De Witt's death the repub- lic passed away, and was followed by the practically monarchi- cal government of William of Orange. The life-long policy of this prince, then only eighteen, was resistance to Louis XIY. and to the extension of French power. This resistance took shape upon the land rather than the sea, — a tendency pro- moted by England's withdrawal from the war. As early as 1676, Admiral De Ruyter found the force given him unequal to cope with the French alone. With the eyes of the govern- ment fixed on the land frontier, the navy rapidly declined. In 1688, when William of Orange needed a fleet to convoy him to England, the burgomasters of Amsterdam objected that the navy was incalculably decreased in strength, as well as deprived of its ablest commanders. When king of Eng- land, William still kept his position as stadtholder, and with it his general European policy. He found in England the sea power he needed, and used the resources of Holland for the land war. This Dutch prince consented that in the allied fleets, in councils of war, the Dutch admirals should sit below the junior English captain; and Dutch interests at sea were sacrificed as readily as Dutch pride to the demands of Eng- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. Q'J laud. When William died, his policy was still followed by the government which succeeded him. Its aims were wholly centred upon the land, and at the Peace of Utrecht, which closed a series of wars extending over forty years, Holland, having established no sea claim, gained nothing in the way of sea resources, of colonial extension, or of commerce. Of the last of these wars an English historian says : " The economy of the Dutch greatly hurt their reputation and their trade. Their men-of-war in the Mediterranean were always victualled short, and their convoys were so weak and ill- provided that for one ship that we lost, they lost five, which begat a general notion that we were the safer carriers, which certainly had a good effect. Hence it was that our trade rather increased than diminished in this war." From that time Holland ceased to have a great sea power, and rapidly lost the leading position among the nations which that power had built up. It is only just to say that no pol- icy could have saved from decline this small, though deter- mined, nation, in face of the persistent enmity of Louis XIV. The friendship of France, insuring peace on her landward frontier, would have enabled her, at least for a longer time, to dispute with England the dominion of the seas ; and as allies the navies of the two continental States might have checked the growth of the enormous sea power which has just been considered. Sea peace between England and Holland was only possible by the virtual subjection of one or the other, for both aimed at the same object. Between France and Holland it was otherwise ; and the fall of Holland proceeded, not necessarily from her inferior size and numbers, but from faulty policy on the part of the two governments. It does not concern us to decide which was the more to blame. France, admirably situated for the possession of sea power, received a definite policy for the guidance of her government from two great rulers, Henry lY. and Richelieu. With cer- tain well-defined projects of extension eastward upon the land were combined a steady resistance to the House of Austria, which then ruled in both Austria and Spain, and an equal 70 DISCUSSION OF THE purpose of resistance to England upon the sea. To further this latter end, as well as for other reasons, Holland was to be courted as an ally. Commerce and fisheries as the basis of sea power were to be encouraged, and a military navy was to be built up. Richelieu left what he called his political will, in which he pointed out the opportunities of France for achieving sea power, based upon her position and resources ; and Frencli writers consider him the virtual founder of tlie navy, not merely because he equipped ships, but from the breadth of his views and his measures to insure sound in- stitutions and steady growth. After his death, Mazarin inher- ited his views and general policy, but not his lofty and martial spirit, and during his rule the newly formed navy disappeared. When Louis XIV. took the government into his own hands, in 1661, there were but thirty ships of war, of which only three had as many as sixty guns. Then began a most as- tonishing manifestation of the work which can be done by absolute government ably and systematically wielded. That part of the administration which dealt with trade, manufac- tures, shipping, and colonies, was given to a man of great practical genius, Colbert, who had served with Richelieu and had drunk in fully his ideas and policy. He pursued his aims in a spirit thoroughly French. Everything was to be organ- ized, the spring of everything was in the minister's cabinet. " To organize producers and merchants as a powerful army, subjected to an active and intelligent guidance, so as to secure an industrial victory for France by order and unity of efforts, and to obtain the best products by imposing on all workmen the processes recognized as best by competent men. ... To organize seamen and distant commerce in large bodies like the manufactures and internal commerce, and to give as a support to the commercial power of France a navy established on a firm basis and of dimensions hitherto unknown," — such, we are told, were the aims of Colbert as regards two of the three links in the chain of sea power. For the third, the col- onies at the far end of the line, the same governmental direction and organization were evidently purposed ; for the ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 71 government began by buying back Canada, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the French West India Islands from the parties who then owned them. Here, then, is seen pure, ab- solute, uncontrolled power gathering up into its liands all the reins for the guidance of a nation's course, and proposing so to direct it as to make, among other things, a great sea power. To enter into the details of Colbert's action is beyond our purpose. It is enough to note the chief part played by the government in building up the sea power of the State, and that this very great man looked not to any one of the bases on "which it rests to the exclusion of the others, but embraced them all in his wise and provident administration. Agricul- ture, which increases the products of the earth, and manufac- tures, which multiply the products of man's industry ; internal trade routes and regulations, by wliich the exchange of prod- ucts from the interior to the exterior is made easier ; ship- ping and customs regulations tending to throw the carrying- trade into French hands, and so to encourage the building of French shipping, by which the home and colonial products should be carried back and forth ; colonial administration and development, by which a far-off market might be continually growing up to be monopolized by the home trade ; treaties with foreign States favoring French trade, and imposts on foreign ships and products tending to break down that of rival nations, — all these means, embracing countless details, were employed to build up for France (1) Production ; (2) Shipping; (3) Colonies and Markets, — in a word, sea power. The study of such a work is simpler and easier when thus done by one man, sketched out by a kind of logical process, than when slowly wrought by conflicting interests in a more com- plex government. In the few years of Colbert's administra- tion is seen the whole theory of sea power put into practice in the systematic, centralizing French waj' ; w'hile the illus- tration of the same theory in English and Dutch history is spread over generations. Such growth, however, w^as forced, and depended upon the endurance of the absolute power which watched over it ; and as Colbert was not king, his con- 72 DISCUSSION OF THE trol lasted only till lie lost the king's favor. It is, however, most interesting to note the results of his labors in the proper field for governmental action — in the navy. It has been said that in 1661, when he took office, there were but thirty armed ships, of which three only had over sixty guns. In 1666 there were seventy, of which fifty were ships of the line and twenty were fire-ships ; in 1671, from seventy the number had increased to one hundred and ninety-six. In 1683 there were one hundred and seven ships of from twenty-four to one hun- dred and twenty guns, twelve of which carried over seventy- six guns, besides many smaller vessels. The order and system introduced into the dock-yards made them vastly more efficient than the English. An English captain, a pris- oner in France while the effect of Colbert's work still lasted in the hands of his son, writes : — " When I was first brought prisoner thither, I lay four months in a hospital at Brest for care of my wounds. While there I was aston- ished at the expedition used in manning and fitting out their ships, which till then I thought could be done nowhere sooner than in Eng- land, •where we have ten times the shipping, and consequently ten times the seamen, they have in France ; but there I saw twenty sail of ships, of about sixty guns each, got ready in twenty days' time ; they were brought in and the men were discharged ; and upon an order from Paris they were careened, keeled up, rigged, victualled, manned, and out again in the said time with the greatest ease imagi- nable. I likewise saw a ship of one hundred guns that had all her guns taken out in four or five hours' time ; which I never saw done in England in twenty-four hours, and this with the greatest ease and less hazarcT than at home. This I saw under my hospital window." A French naval historian cites certain performances which are simply incredible, such as that the keel of a galley was laid at four o'clock, and that at nine she left port, fully armed. These traditions may be accepted as pointing, with the more serious statements of the English officer, to a remarkable de- gree of system and order, and abundant facilities for work. Yet all this wonderful growth, forced by the action of the government, withered away like Jonah's gourd when the gov- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 73 ernment's favor was withdrawn. Time was not allowed for its roots to strike down deep into the life of the nation. Col- bert's work was in the direct line of Richelieu's policy, and for a time it seemed there would continue the course of action which would make France great upon the sea as well as pre- dominant upon the land. For reasons which it is not yet necessary to give, Louis came to have feelings of bitter enmity against Holland ; and as these feelings were shared by Charles II., the two kings determined on the destruction of the United Provinces. This war, which broke out in 1672, though more contrary to natural feeling on the part of Eng- land, was less of a political mistake for her than for France, and especially as regards sea power. France was helping to destroy a probable, and certainly an indispensable, ally ; England was assisting in the ruin of her greatest rival on the sea, at this time, indeed, still her commercial superior. France, staggering under debt and utter confusion in her finances when Louis mounted tlie throne, was just seeing her way clear in 1672, under Colbert's reforms and their happy results. The war, lasting sis years, undid the greater part of his work. Tiie agricultural classes, manufactures, commerce, and the colonies, all were smitten by it ; the establishments of Colbert languished, and the order he had established in the finances was overthrown. Thus the action of Louis — and he alone was the directing government of France — struck at tlie roots of her sea power, and alienated her best sea ally. The territory and the military power of France were increased, but the springs of commerce and of a peaceful shipping had been exhausted in the process ; and although the military * navy was for some years kept up with splendor and effi- ciency, it soon began to dwindle, and by the end of the reign had practically disappeared. The same false policy, as re- gards the sea, marked the rest of this reign of fifty-four years. Louis steadily turned his back upon the sea interests of France, except the fighting-ships, and either could not or would not see that the latter were of little use and uncertain life, if the peaceful shipping and the industries, by which they 74 DISCUSSION OF THE were supported, perished. His policy, aiming at supreme power ill Europe by military strength and territorial exten- sion, forced England and Holland into an alliance, which, as has before been said, directly drove France off the sea, and indirectly swamped Holland's power thereon. Colbert's navy . perished, and for the last ten years of Louis' life no great French fleet put to sea, though there was constant war. The simplicity of form in an absolute monarchy thus brought out strongly how great the influence of government can be upon both the growth and the decay of sea power. The latter part of Louis' life thus witnessed that power fail- ing by the weakening of its foundations, of commerce, and of the wealth that commerce brings. The government that fol- lowed, likewise absolute, of set purpose and at the demand of England, gave up all pretence of maintaining an effective navy. The reason for this was that the new king was a minor ; and the regent, being bitterly at enmity with the king of Spain, to injure him and preserve his own power, entered into alliance with England. He aided her to estab- lish Austria, the hereditary enemy of France, in Naples and Sicily to the detriment of Spain, and in union with her de- stroyed the Spanish navy and dock-yards. Here again is found a personal ruler disregarding the sea interests of France, ruining a natural ally, and directly aiding, as Louis XIV. indirectly and unintentionally aided, the growth of a mistress of the seas. This transient phase of policy passed away with the death of the regent in 1726 ; but from that time until 1760 the government of France continued to dis- regard her maritime interests. It is said, indeed, that owing to some wise modifications of her fiscal regulations, mainly in the direction of free trade (and due to Law, a minister of Scotch birth), commerce with the East and West Indies won- derfully increased, and that the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique became very rich and thriving ; but both com- merce and colonies lay at the mercy of England when war came, for the navy fell into decay. In 1756, when things were no longer at their worst, France had but forty-five ships- ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 75 of-the4ine, England nearly one hundred and thirty ; and when the forty-five were to be armed and equipped, there was found to be neither material nor rigging nor supplies ; not even enough artillery. Nor was this all. " Lack of system in the government," says a French writer, " brought about indifference, and opened the door to disorder and lack of discipline. Never had unjust promotions been so frequent ; so also never had more universal discontent been seen. Money and intrigue took the place of all else, and brought in their train commands and power. Nobles and upstarts, with influence at the capital and self- sufficiency in the seaports, thought themselves dispensed with merit. Waste of the revenues of the State and of the dock-yards knew no bounds. Honor and modesty were turned into ridicule. As if the evils were not thus great enough, the ministry took pains to efface the heroic traditions of the past which had escaped the general wreck. To the energetic fights of the great reign succeeded, by order of the court, 'affairs of circumspection.' To preserve to the wasted material a few armed ships, increased opportunity was given to the enemy. From this unhappy principle we were bound to a defensive as advan- tageous to the enemy as it was foreign to the genius of our people. This circumspection before the enemy, laid down for us by orders, betrayed in the long run the national temper ; and the abuse of the system led to acts of indiscipline and defection under fire, of which a single instance would vainly be sought in the previous century." A false policy of continental extension swallowed up the resources of the country, and was doubly injurious because, by leaving defenceless its colonies and commerce, it exposed the greatest source of wealth to be cut off, as in fact hap- pened. The small squadrons that got to sea were destroyed by vastly superior force ; the merchant shipping was swept away, and the colonies, Canada, Martinique, Guadeloupe, India, fell into England's hands. If it did not take too much space, interesting extracts might be made, showing the woful misery of France, the country that had abandoned the sea, and the growing wealth of England amid all her sacrifices and exertions. A contemporaiy writer has thus expressed his view of the policy of France at this period : — 7G DISCUSSION OF THE " France, by engaging so heartily as she has done in the German war, has drawn away so much of her attention and her revenue from her navy that it enabled us to give such a blow to her maritime strength as possibly she may never be able to recover. Her engage- ment in the German war has likewise drawn her from the defence of her colonies, by which means we have conquered some of the most considerable she possessed. It has withdrawn her from the protec- tion of her trade, by which it is entirely destroyed, while that of England has never, in the profoundest peace, been in so flourishing a condition. So that, by embarking in this German war, France has suffered herself to be undone, so far as regards her particular and immediate quarrel with England." In the Seven Years' War France lost thirty-seven ships-of- the-lino and fifty-six frigates, — a force three times as numer- ous as the whole navy of the United States at any time in the days of sailing-ships. " For the first time since the Middle Ages," says a French historian, speaking of the same war, " England had conquered France single-handed, almost with- out allies, France having powerful auxiliaries. She had con- quered solely by the superiority of her government." Yes ; but it was by the superiority of her government using the tremen- dous weapon of her sea power, — the reward of a consistent policy perseveringly directed to one aim. The profound Immiliation of France, which reached its depths between 1760 and 1763, at which latter date she made peace, has an instructive lesson for the United States in this our period of commercial and naval decadence. We have been spared her humiliation ; let us hope to profit by her subsequent example. Between the same years (1760 and 1763) the French people rose, as afterward in 1793, and declared they would have a navy. " Popular feeling, skilfully directed by the government, took up the cry from one end of France to the other, 'The navy must be restored.' Gifts of ships were made by cities, by corporations, and by private subscriptions. A prodigious activity sprang up in the lately silent ports ; everywhere ships were building or repairing." This activity was sustained ; the arsenals were replenished, the material ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 77 of every kind was put on a satisfactory footing, the artillery reorganized, and ten thousand trained gunners drilled and maintained. The tone and action of the naval officers of the day in- stantly felt the popular impulse, for which indeed some lof- tier spirits among them had been not only waiting but working. At no time was greater mental and professional activity found among French naval officers than just then, when their ships had been suffered to rot away by governmental inaction. Thus a prominent French officer of our own day writes : — " The sad condition of the navy in the reign of Louis XV., by closing to officers the brilliant career of bold enterprises and success- ful battles, forced them to fall back upon themselves. They drew from study the knowledge they were to put to the proof some years later, thus putting into practice that fine saying of Montesquieu, ' Adversity is our mother. Prosperity our step-mother.' . . . By the year 17G9 was seen in all its splendor that brilliant galaxy of officers whose activity stretched to the ends of the earth, and who embraced in their works and in their investigations all the branches of human knowledge. The Academie de Marine, founded in 1752, was re- organized." ^ The Academic's first director, a post-captain named Bigot de Morogues, wrote an elaborate treatise on naval tactics, the first original work on the subject since Paul Hoste's, which it was designed to supersede. Morogues must have been study- ing and formulating his problems in tactics in days when France had no fleet, and was unable so much as to raise her head at sea under the blows of her enemy. At the same time England had no similar book ; and an English lieutenant, in 1762, was just translating a part of Hoste's great work, omit- ting by far the larger part. It was not until nearly twenty years later that Clerk, a Scotch private gentleman, published an ingenious study of naval tactics, in which he pointed out to English admirals the system by which the French had thwarted their thoughtless and ill-combined attacks.^ " The ' Gougeard: La Marine de Guerre; Eichelieu et Colbert. 2 ^Yhateve^ may be thought of Clerk's claim to originality in constructing a system of naval tactics, and it has been seriously impugned, there can be no doubt 78 DISCUSSION OF THE researches of the Acaclemie de Marine, and the energetic im- pulse which it gave to the labors of officers, were not, as we hope to show later, without influence upon the relatively prosperous condition in which the navy was at the beginning of the American war." It has already been pointed out that the American War of Independence involved a departure from England's traditional and true policy, by committing her to a distant land war, while powerful enemies were waiting for an opportunity to attack her at sea. Like France in the then recent German wars, like Napoleon later in the Spanish war, England, through undue self-confidence, was about to turn a friend into an enemy, and so expose the real basis of her power to a rude proof. The French government, on the other hand, avoided the snare into which it had so often fallen. Turning her back on the European continent, having the probability of neutrality there, and the certainty of alliance with Spain by her side, France advanced to the contest with a fine navy and a brilliant, though perhaps relatively inexperienced, body of officers. On the other side of the Atlantic she had the sup- port of a friendly people, and of her own or allied ports, both in the West Indies and on the continent. The wisdom of this policy, the happy influence of this action of the government upon her sea power, is evident ; but the details of the war do not belong to this part of the subject. To Americans, the -^p-"^ chief interest of that war is found upon the land ; but to naval / officers upon the sea, for it was essentially a sea war. The intelligent and systematic efforts of twenty years bore their due fruit ; for though the warfare afloat ended with a great disaster, the combined efforts of the French and Spanish fleets undoubtedly bore down England's strength alid robbed her of her colonies. In the various naval undertakings and battles the honor of France was upon the whole maintained ; though it is difficult, upon consideration of the general that his criticisms on the past were sound. So far as the author knows, he in this respect deserves credit for an originality remarkable in one who had the training neither of a seaman nor of a military man. ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 79 subject, to avoid the conclusion that the inexperience of French seamen as compared with English, the narrow spirit of jealousy shown by the noble corps of officers toward those of different antecedents, and above all, the miserable tradi- tions of three quarters of a century already alluded to, the miserable policy of a government which taught them first to save their ships, to economize the material, prevented French admirals from reaping, not the mere glory, but the positive advantages that more than once were within their grasp. When Monk said the nation that would rule upon the sea must always attack, he set the key-note to England's naval policy ; and had the instructions of the French government consistently breathed tlie same spirit, the war of 1778 might have ended sooner and better than it did. It seems ungra- cious to criticise the conduct of a service to which, under God, our nation owes tliat its birth was not a miscarriage ; but writers of its own country abundantly reflect the spirit of the remark. A French officer who served afloat during this war, in a work of calm and judicial tone, says: — " What must the young officers have thought who were at Sandy Hook with D'Estaing, at St. Christopher with De Grasse, even those who arrived at Rhode Island with De Ternay, when they saw that these officers were not tried at their return ? " ^ Again, another French officer, of much later date, justifies tlie opinion expressed, when speaking of the war of the American Revolution in the following terms : — " It was necessary to get rid of the unhappy prejudices of the days of the regency and of Louis XV. ; but the mishaps of which they were full were too recent to be forgotten by our ministers. Thanks to a wretched hesitation, fleets, which had rightly alarmed England, became reduced to ordinary proportions. Intrenching themselves in a false economy, the ministry claimed that, by reason of the excessive expenses necessary to maintain the fleet, the admirals must be ordered to maintain the ' greatest circumspection^^ as though in war half measures have not always led to disasters. So, too, the orders given to our squadron chiefs were to keep the sea as long as possible, with- 1 La Serre : Essais Hist, et Crit. sur la M.irine Fran9,ii3e. 80 DISCUSSION OF THE out engaging in actions which might cause tlie loss of vessels difficult to replace ; so that more than once complete victories, which would have crowned the skill of our admirals and tlie courage of our cap- tains, were changed into successes of little importance. A system which laid down as a principle that an admiral should not use the force in his hands, which sent him against the enemy with the fore- ordained purpose of receiving rather than making the attack, a sys- tem which sapjjed moral power to save material resources, must have unhapjiy results. ... It is certain that this deplorable system was one of the causes of the lack of discipline and startling defections which marked the periods of Louis XVI., of the [first] Republic, and of the [first] Empire." ^ Within ten years of the peace of 1783 came the French Revolution ; but that great upheaval which shook the founda- tions of States, loosed the ties of social order, and drove ont of the navy nearly all the trained officers of the monarchy who were attached to the old state of things, did not free the French navy from a false system. It was easier to overturn the form of government than to uproot a deep-seated tradition. Hear again a third French officer, of the highest rank and literary accomplishments, speaking of the inaction of Ville- neuve, the admiral who commanded the French rear at the battle of the Nile, and who did not leave his anchors while the head of the column was being destroyed : — " A day was to come [Trafalgar] in which Villeneuve in his turn, like De Grasse before him, and like Duchayla, would complain of being abandoned by part of his fleet. We have come to suspect some secret reason for this fatal coincidence. It is not natural that among so many honorable men there should so often be found ad- mirals and captains incurring such a reproach. If the name of some of them is to this very day sadly associated with the memory of our disasters, we may be sure the fault is not wholly their own. We must rather blame the nature of the operations in which they were engaged, and that system of defensive war prescribed by the French government, which Pitt, in the English Parliament, proclaimed to be the forerunner of certain ruin. That system, when we wished to renounce it, had already penetrated our habits; it had, so to say, 1 Lapeyrouse-Bonfils : Hist, de la Marine Fran9aise. ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 81 weakened our arms and paralyzed our self-reliance. Too often did our squadrons leave port with a special mission to fulfil, and with the intention of avoiding the enemy ; to fall in with him was at once a piece of bad luck. It was thus that our ships went into action ; they submitted to it instead of forcing it. . . . Fortune would have hesi- tated longer between the two fleets, and not have borne in the end so heavily against ours, if Brueys, meeting Nelson half way, could have gone out to fight him. This fettered and timid war, which Yillaret and Martin had carried on, had lasted long, thanks to the circumspec- tion of some English admirals and the traditions of the old tactics. It was with these traditions that the battle of the Nile had broken ; the hour for decisive action had come." ^ Some years later came Trafalgar, and again the government of France took up a new policy with the navy. The author last quoted speaks again : — " The emperor, whose eagle glance traced plans of campaign for his fleets as for his armies, was wearied by these unexpected reverses. He turned his eyes from the one field of battle in which fortune was faithless to him, and decided to pursue England elsewhere than upon the seas ; he undertook to rebuild his navy, but without giving it any part in the struggle which became more furious than ever. . . . Never- theless, far from slackening, the activity of our dock-yards redoubled. Every year ships-of-the-line were either laid down or added to the fleet. Venice and Genoa, under his control, saw their old splendors rise again, and from the shores of the Elbe to the head of the Adriatic all the ports of the continent emulously seconded the creative thought of the emperor. Numerous squadrons were assembled in the Scheldt, in Brest Roads, and in Toulon. . . . But to the end the emperor refused to give this navy, full of ardor and self-reliance, an oppor- tunity to measure its strength with the enemy. . . . Cast down by constant reverses, he had kept up our armed ships only to oblige our enemies to blockades whose enormous cost must end by exhausting their finances." When the empire fell, France had one hundred and three ships-of-the-line and fifty-five frigates. To turn now from the particular lessons drawn from the history of the past to the general question of the influence of 1 Jurien de la Graviere : Guerres Maritimes. 6 82 DISCUSSION OF THE government npon the sea career of its people, it is seen that that influence can work in two distinct but closely related ^ways. First, in peace : The government by its policy can favor the natural growth of a people's industries and its tendencies to seek adventure and gain by way of the sea ; or it can try to develop such industries and such sea-going bent, when they do not naturally exist ; or, on the other hand, the government may by mistaken action check and fetter the progress which the people left to themselves would make. In any one of these ways the influence of the government will be felt, mak- ing or marring the sea power of the country in the matter of peaceful commerce ; upon which alone, it cannot be too often insisted, a thoroughly strong navy can be based. \Secondly, for war : The influence of the government will be felt in its most legitimate manner in maintaining an armed navy, of a size commensurate with the growth of its shipping and the importance of the interests connected with it. More important even than the size of the navy is the question of its institutions, favoring a healthful spirit and activity, and providing for rapid development in time of war by an adequate reserve of men and of ships and by measures for drawing out that general reserve power which has before been pointed to, when considering the character and pursuits of the people. Undoubtedly under this second head of war- like preparation must come the maintenance of suitable naval stations, in those distant parts of the world to which the armed shipping must follow the peaceful vessels of commerce. The protection of such stations must depend either upon direct military force, as do Gibraltar and Malta, or upon a surrounding friendly population, such as the American colo- nists once were to England, and, it may be presumed, the Australian colonists now are. Such friendly surroundings and backing, joined to a reasonable military provision, are the best of defences, and when combined with decided pre- ponderance at sea, make a scattered and extensive empire, like that of England, secure ; for while it is true that an ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 83 unexpected attack may cause disaster in some one quarter, the actual superiority of naval power prevents such disaster from being general or irremediable. History has sufficiently proved this. England's naval bases have been in all parts of the world ; and her fleets have at once protected them, kept open the communications between them, and relied upon them for shelter. Colonies attached to the mother-country afford, therefore, the surest means of supporting abroad the sea power of a country. In peace, the influence of the government should be felt in promoting by all means a warmth of attachment and a unity of interest which will make the welfare of one the welfare of all, and the quarrel of one the quarrel of all ; and in war, or rather for war, by inducing such measures of organization and defence as shall be felt by all to be a fair distribution of a burden of which each reaps the benefit. Such colonies the United States has not and is not likely to have. As regards purely military naval stations, the feeling of her people was probably accurately expressed by an historian of the English navy a hundred years ago, speak- ing then of Gibraltar and Port Mahon. " Military govern- ments," said he, " agree so little with the industry of a trading people, and are in themselves so repugnant to the genius of the British people, that I do not wonder that men of good sense and of all parties have inclined to give up these, as Tangiers was given up." Having therefore no foreign es- tablishments, either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war, will be like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting-places for them, where they can coal and repair, would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the develop- ment of the power of tbe nation at sea. As the practical object of this inquiry is to draw from the lessons of history inferences applicable to one's own country and service, it is proper now to ask how far the conditions of the United States involve serious danger, and call for action on the part of the government, in order to build again her 84 DISCUSSION OF THE sea power. It will not be too much to say that the action of the government since the Civil War, and up to this day, has been effectively directed solely to what has been called the first link in the chain which makes sea power. Internal development, great production, with the accompanying aim and boast of self-sufficingness, such has been the object, such to some extent the result. In this the government has faith- fully reflected the bent of the controlling elements of the country, though it is not always easy to feel that such con- trolling elements are truly representative, even in a free country. However that may be, there is no doubt that, besides having no colonies, the intermediate link of a peaceful shipping, and the interests involved in it, are now likewise lacking. In short, the United States has only one link of the three. The circumstances of naval war have changed so much within the last hundred years, that it may be doubted whether such disastrous effects on the one hand, or such brilliant prosperity on the other, as were seen in the wars between England and France, could now recur. In her secure and haughty sway of the seas England imposed a yoke on neu- trals which will never again be borne ; and the principle that the flag covers the goods is forever secured. The commerce of a belligerent can therefore now be safely carried on in neutral ships, except when contraband of war or to blockaded ports ; and as regards the latter, it is also certain that there will be no more paper blockades. Putting aside therefore the question of defending her seaports from capture or contribu- tion, as to which there is practical unanimity in theory and entire indifference in practice, what need has the United States of sea power ? Her commerce is even now carried on by others ; why should her people desire that which, if pos- sessed, must be defended at great cost ? So far as this ques- tion is economical, it is outside the scope of this work ; but conditions which may entail suffering and loss on the country by war are directly pertinent to it. Granting therefore that the foreign trade of the United States, going and coming, is ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 85 on board ships which an enemy cannot touch except when bound to a blockaded port, what will constitute an efficient blockade ? The present definition is, that it is such as to constitute a manifest danger to a vessel seeking to enter or leave the port. This is evidently very elastic. Many can re- member that during the Civil War, after a night attack on the United States fleet off Charleston, the Confederates next morn- ing sent out a steamer with some foreign consuls on board, who so far satisfied themselves that no blockading vessel Avas in sight that they issued a declaration to that effect. On the strength of this declaration some Southern authorities claimed that the blockade was technically broken, and could not be technically re-established without a new notification. Is it necessary, to constitute a real danger to blockade- runners, that the blockading fleet should be in sight ? Half a dozen fast steamers, cruising twenty miles off-shore between the New Jersey and Long Island coast, would be a very real danger to ships seeking to go in or out by the principal entrance to New York ; and similar positions might effec- tively blockade Boston, the Delaware, and the Chesapeake. The main body of the blockading fleet, prepared not only to capture merchant-ships but to resist military attempts to break the blockade, need not be within sight, nor in a posi- tion known to the shore. The bulk of Nelson's fleet was fifty miles from Cadiz two days before Trafalgar, with a small detachment watching close to the harbor. The allied fleet began to get under way at 7 a.m., and Nelson, even under the conditions of those days, knew it by 9.30. The English fleet at that distance was a very real danger to its enemy. It seems possible, in these days of submarine telegraphs, that the blockading forces in-shore and off-shore, and from one port to another, might be in telegraphic communication with one another along the whole coast of the United States, readily giving mutual support ; and if, by some fortunate military combination, one detachment were attacked in force, it could warn the others and retreat upon them. Granting that such a blockade off one port were broken on one day, by 8G DISCUSSION OF THE fairly driving away the ships maintaining it, the notification of its being re-established could be cabled all over the vs^orld the next. To avoid such blockades there must be a military force afloat that will at all times so endanger a blockading fleet that it can by no means keep its place. Then neutral ships, except those laden with contraband of war, can come and go freely, and maintain the commercial relations of the country with the world outside. It may be urged that, wdth the extensive sea-coast of the United States, a blockade of the whole line cannot be effec- tively kept up. Xo one will more readily concede this than officers who remember how the blockade of the Southern coast alone was maintained. But in the present condition of the navy, and, it may be added, with any additions not ex- ceeding those so far proposed by the government,^ the attempt to blockade Boston, New York, the Delaware, the Chesapeake, and the Mississippi, in other words, the great centres of export and import, would not entail upon one of the large maritime nations efforts greater than have been made before. England has at the same time blockaded Brest, the Biscay coast, Toulon, and Cadiz, when there were powerful squadrons lying within the harbors. It is true that commerce in neutral ships can then enter other ports of the United States than those named ; but what a dislocation of the carrying traffic of the country, what failure of supplies at times, what inadequate means of transport by rail or water, of dockage, of lighterage, of warehousing, will be involved in such an enforced change of the ports of entry ! Will there be no money loss, no suffering, consequent upon this ? And when with much pain and expense these evils have been partially remedied, the enemy may be led to stop the new inlets as he did the old. The people of the United States will certainly not starve, but they may suffer grievously. As for supplies which are con- traband of war, is there not reason to fear that the United 1 Since the above was written, the secretary of the navy, in his report for 1889, has recommended a fleet which would make such a blockade as here sug- gested very hazardous. ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 87 States is not now able to go alone if an emergency should arise ? The question is eminently one in which the influence of the government should make itself felt, to build up for the nation a navy which, if not capable of reaching distant countries, shall at least be able to keep clear the chief approaches to its own. The eyes of the country have for a quarter of a cen- tury been turned from the sea ; the results of such a policy and of its o})posite will be shown in the instance of France and of England. Without asserting a narrow parallelism be- tween the case of the United States and either of these, it may safely be said that it is essential to the welfare of tlie whole country that the conditions of trade and commerce should remain, as far as possible, unaffected by an external war. In order to do this, the enemy must be kept not only out of our ports, but far away from our coasts.^ Can this navy be had without restoring the merchant ship- ^ Tlie word " defence " in war iuvolves two ideas, which for tlie sake of pre- cision in thouglit should be kept separated in the miud. There is defence pure and simple, which strengthens itself and awaits attack. This may be called passive defence. Ou the other hand, there is a view of defence which asserts that safety for one's self, the real object of defensive preparation, is best secured by attacking the enemy. In the matter of sea-coast defence, the former method is exemplified by stationary fortifications, submarine mines, and generally all immobile works destined simply to stop an enemy if he tries to enter. The second method comprises all those means and weapons which do not wait for attack, but go to meet the enemy's fleet, whether it be but for a few miles, or whether to his own shores. Such a defence may seem to be really offensive war, but it is not ; it becomes offensive only when its object of attack is changed from the enemy's fleet to the enemy's country. England defended her own coasts and colonies by stationing her fleets off the French ports, to fight the French fleet if it came out. The United States in the Civil War stationed her fleets off the Southern ports, not because she feared for her own, but to break down the Confederacy by isolation from the rest of the world, and ultimately by attacking the ports. The methods were the same ; but the purpose in one case was defensive, in the other offensive. The confusion of the two ideas leads to much unnecessary wrangling as to the proper sphere of army and navy in coast-defence. Passive defences belong to the army ; everything that moves in the water to the navy, which has the prerogative of the offensive defence. If seamen are used to garrison forts, they become part of the land forces, as surely as troops, when embarked as part of the complement, become part of the sea forces. 88 DISCUSSION OF THE ping? It is doubtful. History has proved that such a purely military sea power can be built up by a despot, as was done by Louis XIV. ; but though so fair seeming, experience showed that his navy was like a growth which having no root soon withers away. But in a representative government any military expenditure must have a strongly represented in- terest behind it, convinced of its necessity. Such an interest in sea power does not exist, cannot exist here without action by the government. How such a merchant shipping should be built up, whether by subsidies or by free trade, by constant administration of tonics or by free movement in the open air, is not a military but an economical question. Even had -the United States a great national shipping, it may be doubted whether a sufficient navy would follow ; the distance which separates her from other great powers, in one way a protec- tion, is also a snare. The motive, if any there be, which will give the United States a navy, is probably now quickening in the Central American Isthmus. Let us hope it will not come to the birth too late. Here concludes the general discussion of the principal elements which affect, favorably or unfavorably, the growth of sea power in nations. The aim has been, first to consider those elements in their natural tendency for or against, and then to illustrate by particular examples and by the ex- perience of the past. Such discussions, while undoubtedly embracing a wider field, yet fall mainly within the province of strategy, as distinguished from tactics. The considera- tions and principles which enter into them belong to the unchangeable, or unchanging, order of things, remaining the same, in cause and effect, from age to age. They belong, as it were, to the Order of Nature, of whose stability so much is heard in our day ; whereas tactics, using as its instruments the weapons made by man, shares in the change and progress of the race from generation to generation. From time to time the superstructure of tactics has to be altered or wholly torn down ; but the old foundations of strategy so far remain, as though laid upon a rock. There ELEMENTS OF SEA POWER. 89 will next be examined the general history of Europe and America, with particular reference to the effect exercised upon that histoiy, and upon the welfare of the people, by sea power in its broad sense. From time to time, as occasion offers, the aim will be to recall and reinforce the general teaching, already elicited, by j)articular illustrations. The general tenor of the study will therefore be strategical, in that broad definition of naval strategy which has before been quoted and accepted : '• Naval strategy has for its end to found, support, and increase, as well in peace as in war, the sea power of a country." In the matter of particular battles, while freely admitting that the change of details has made obsolete much of their teaching, the attempt will be made to point out where the application or neglect of true general principles has produced decisive effects ; and, other things being equal, those actions will be preferred which, from their association with the names of the most distinguished officers, may be presumed to show how far just tactical ideas obtained in a particular age or a particular service. It will also be desirable, where analogies between ancient and modern weapons appear on the surface, to derive such probable lessons as they offer, without laying undue stress upon the points of resemblance. Finally, it must be remembered that, among all changes, the nature of man remains much the s.ame ; the personal equation, though uncertain in quantity and quality in the particular instance, is sure always to be found. CHAPTER II. State of Europe ix 1660. — Second Anglo-Dutch "War, 1665-16C7. Sea Battles of Lowestoft and of The Four Days. '' I ^HE period at which our historical survey is to begin has -^ been loosely stated as the middle of the seventeenth century. The year 1660 will now be taken as the definite date at which to open. In May of that year Charles II. was restored to the English throne amid the general rejoic- ing of the people. In March of the following year, upon the death of Cardinal Mazarin, Louis XIY. assembled his ministers and said to them : " I have summoned you to tell you that it has pleased me hitherto to permit my affairs to be governed by the late cardinal ; I shall in future be my own prime minister. I direct that no decree be sealed except by my orders, and I order the secretaries of State and the superintendent of the finances to sign nothing with- out my command." The personal government thus assumed was maintained, in fact as well as in name, for over half a century. Within one twelvemonth then are seen, setting forward upon a new stage of national life, after a period of confusion more or less prolonged, the two States which, amid whatever in- equalities, have had the first places in the sea history of modern Europe and America, indeed, of the world at large. Sea history, however, is but one factor in that general advance and decay of nations which is called their history ; and if sight be lost of the other factors to which it is so closely related, a dis- torted view, either exaggerated or the reverse, of its im- portance will be formed. It is with the belief that that importance is vastly underrated, if not practically lost sight STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. 91 of, by people unconnected with the sea, and particularly by the people of the United States in our own day, tiiat this study has been undertaken. The date taken, 1660, followed closely another which marked a great settlement of European affairs, setting the seal of treaty upon the results of a general war, known to history as the Tliirty Years' War. This other date was that of the Treaty of Westphalia, or Munster, in 1648. In this the independence of the Dutch United Provinces, long before practically assured, was formally acknowledged by Spain ; and it being followed in 1659 by the Treaty of the Pyrenees be- tween France and Spain, the two gave to Europe a state of general external peace, destined soon to be followed by a series of almost universal wars, which lasted as long as Louis XIV. lived, — wars which were to induce profound changes in the map of Europe ; during which new States were to arise, others to decay, and all to undergo large modifications, either in extent of dominion or in political power. In these results maritime power, directly or indi- rectly, had a great share. We must first look at the general condition of European States at the time from which the narrative starts. In the struggles, extending over nearly a century, whose end is marked by the Peace of Westphalia, the royal family known as the House of Austria had been the great overwhelm- ing power which all others feared. During the long reign of the Emperor Charles V., who abdicated a century before, the head of that house had united in his own person the two crowns of Austria and Spain, which carried with them, among other possessions, the countries we now know as Hol- land and Belgium, together with a preponderating influence in Italy. After his abdication the two great monarchies of Austria and Spain were separated ; but though ruled by different persons, they were still in the same family, and tended toward that unity of aim and sympathy which marked dynastic connections in that and the following century. To this bond of union was added that of a common religion. 92 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. During the century before the Peace of Westphalia, the ex- tension of family power, and the extension of the religion professed, were the two strongest motives of political action. This was the period of the great religious wars which arrayed nation against nation, principality against principality, and often, in the same nation, faction against faction. Religious persecution caused the revolt of the Protestant Dutch Prov- inces against Spain, which issued, after eighty years of more or less constant war, in the recognition of their independ- ence. Religious discord, amounting to civil war at times, distracted France during the greater part of the same period, profoundly affecting not only her internal but her external policy. These were the days of St. Bartholomew, of the religious murder of Henry IV., of the siege of La Rochelle, of constant intriguing between Roman Catholic Spain and Roman Catholic Frenchmen. As the religious motive, acting in a sphere to which it did not naturally belong, and in which it had no rightful place, died away, the political necessities and interests of States began to have juster weight ; not that they had been wholly lost sight of in the mean time, but the religious animosities had either blinded the eyes, or fettered the action, of statesmen. It was natural that in France, one of the greatest sufferers from religious passions, owing to the number and character of the Protestant minority, this reaction should first and most markedly be seen. Placed between Spain and the German States, among which Austria stood foremost with- out a rival, internal union and checks upon the power of the House of Austria were necessities of political existence. Happily, Providence raised up to her in close succession two great rulers, Henry IV. and Richeli.eu, — men in whom religion fell short of bigotry, and who, when forced to recognize it in the sphere of politics, did so as masters and not as slaves. Under them French statesmanship received a guidance, which Richelieu formulated as a tradition, and which moved on the following general lines, — (1) Internal union of the kingdom, appeasing or putting down religious strife and centralizing STATE OF EUROPE IX 1660. 93 authority in the king ; (2) Resistance to the power of the House of Austria, which actually and necessarily carried with it alliance with Protestant German States and with Holland ; (3) Extension of the boundaries of France to the eastward, at the expense mainly of Spain, wliich then possessed not only the present Belgium, but other provinces long since incorporated with France ; and (4) The creation and development of a great sea power, adding to the wealth of the kingdom, and intended specially to make head against France's hereditary enemy, Eng- land ; for which end again the alliance with Holland was to be kept in view. Such were the broad outlines of policy laid down by statesmen in the front rank of genius for the guid- ance of that country whose people have, not without cause, claimed to be the most complete exponent of European civilization, foremost in the march of progress, combining political advance with individual development. This tradi- tion, carried on by Mazarin, was received from him by Louis XIY. ; it will be seen how far he was faithful to it, and what were the results to France of his action. Mean- while it may be noted that of these four elements necessary to the greatness of France, sea power was one ; and as the second and third were practically one in the means employed, it may be said that sea power was one of the two great means by which France's external greatness was to be maintained. England on the sea, Austria on the land, indicated the direction that French effort was to take. As regards the condition of France in 1660, and her readi- ness to move onward in the road marked by Richelieu, it may be said that internal peace was secured, the power of the nobles wholly broken, religious discords at rest ; the tolerant edict of Nantes was still in force, while the remaining Prot- estant discontent had been put down by the armed hand. All power was absolutely centred in the throne. In other respects, though the kingdom was at peace, the condition was less satisfactory. There was practically no navy ; commerce, internal and external, was not prosperous ; the finances were in disorder ; the army small. 94 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. Spain, the nation before which all others had trembled less than a century before, was now long in decay and scarcely formidable ; the central weakness had spread to all parts of the administration. In extent of territory, however, she was still great. The Spanish Netherlands still belonged to her ; she held Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia ; Gibraltar had not yet fallen into English hands ; her vast possessions in Amer- ica — with the exception of Jamaica, conquered by England a few years before — w^ere still untouched. The condition of her sea power, both for peace and war, has been already alluded to. Many years before, Richelieu had contracted a temporary alliance with Spain, by virtue of which she placed forty ships at his disposal ; but the bad condition of the ves- sels, for the most part ill armed and ill commanded, com- pelled their withdrawal. The navy of Spain was then in full decay, and its weakness did not escape the piercing eye of the cardinal. An encounter which took place between the Span- ish and Dutch fleets in 1639 shows most plainly the state of degradation into Avhicli this once proud navy had fallen. " Her navy at this time," says the narrative quoted, " met one of those shocks, a succession of which during this war degraded her from her high station of mistress of the seas in both hemispheres, to a contemptible rank among maritime powers. The king was fitting out a powerful fleet to carry the war to the coasts of Sweden, and for its ecjuipment had commanded a reinforcement of men and provisions to be sent from Dunkirk. A fleet accordingly set sail, but were attacked by Von Tromp, some captured, the remainder forced to retire within the harbor again. Soon after, Tromp seized three English [neutral] ships carrying 1070 Spanish soldiers from Cadiz to Dunkirk ; he took the troops out, but let the ships go free. Leaving seventeen vessels to blockade Dunkirk, Tromp with the re- maining twelve advanced to meet the enemy's fleet on its arrival. It was soon seen entering the Straits of Dover to the number of sixty- seven sail, and having two thousand troops. Being joined by De "Witt with four more ships, Tromp with his small force made a reso- lute attack upon the enemv. The fight lasted till four p.m., when the Spanish admiral took refuge in the Downs. Tromp determined to engage if they should come out; but Oquendo with his powerful STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. 95 fleet, many of which carried from sixty to a hundred guns, suffered himself to be blockaded ; and the English admiral told Tromp he was ordered to join the Spaniards if hostilities began. Tromp sent home for instructions, and the action of England onl}' served to call out the vast maritime powers of the Dutch. Tromp was rapidly rein- forced to ninety-six sail and twelve fire-ships, and ordered to attack. Leaving a detached squadron to observe the I^riglish, and to attack them if they helped the Spaniards, he began the fight embarrassed by a thick fog, under cover of which the Spaniards cut their cables to escape. Many running too close to shore went aground, and most of the remainder attempting to retreat were sunk, captured, or driven on the French coast. Never was victory more complete." ^ When a navy submits to such a hue of action, all tone and pride must have departed ; but the navy only sliared in the general decline which made Spain henceforward have an ever lessening weight in the policy of Europe. " In the midst of the splendors of her court and language," says Guizot, " the Spanish government felt itself weak, and sought to hide its weakness under its immobility. Philip IV. and his minister, weary of striving only to be conquered, looked but for the security of peace, and only sought to put aside all questions which would call for efforts of which they felt tiiemselves incapable. Divided and enervated, the house of Austria had even less ambition than power, and except when absolutely forced, a pompous inertia became the policy of the successors of Charles V." ^ Such was the Spain of that day. That part of the Spanish dominions which was then known as the Low Countries, or the Roman Catholic Netherlands (our modern Belgium), was about to be a fruitful source of variance between France and her natural ally, the Dutch Republic, This State, whose political name was the United Provinces, had now reached the summit of its influence and power, — a power based, as has already been explained, wholly upon the sea, and upon the use of that element made by the great maritime and com- mercial genius of the Dutch people. A recent French author 1 Davies : History of Holland. 2 Republique d'Angleterre. 96 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. thus describes the commercial and colonial conditions, at the accession of Louis XIV., of this people, which beyond any other in modern times, save only England, has shown how the harvest of the sea can lift up to wealth and power a country intrinsically weak and without resources : — " Holland had become the PhcEnicia of modern times. Mistresses of the Scheldt, the United Provinces closed the outlets of Antwerp to the sea, and inherited the commercial power of that rich city, which an ambassador of Venice in the fifteenth century had compared to Venice herself. They received besides in their principal cities the workingmen of the Low Countries who fled from Spanish tyranny of conscience. The manufactures of clothes, linen stuffs, etc., which employed six hundred thousand souls, opened new sources of gain to a people previously content with the trade in cheese and fish. Fish- eries alone had already enriched them. The herring fisher}' supported nearly one fifth of the population of Holland, producing three hun- dred thousand tons of salt-fish, and bringing in more than eight million francs annually. " The naval and commercial power of the repi;blic developed rapidly. The merchant fleet of Holland alone numbered 10,000 sail, 168,000 seamen, and supported 260,000 inhabitants. She had taken possession of the greater part of the European carrying-trade, and had added thereto, since the peace, all the carriage of mer chandise between America and Spain, did the same service for the French ports, and maintained an importation traffic of thirty-six million francs. The north countries, Brandenburg, Denmark, Swe- den, Muscovy, Poland, access to which was opened by the Baltic to the Provinces, were for them an inexhaustible market of exchange. They fed it by the produce they sold there, and by purchase of the products of the North, — wheat, timber, copper, hemp, and furs. The total value of merchandise yearly shipped in Dutch bottoms, in all seas, exceeded a thousand million francs. The Dutch had made themselves, to use a contemporary phrase, the wagoners of all seas." ^ It was through its colonies that the republic had been able thus to develop its sea trade. It had the monopoly of all the products of the East. Produce and spices from Asia were by her brought to Europe of a yearly value of sixteen million 1 Lefevre-Pontalis : Jean de "Witt. STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. 97 francs. The powerful East India Company, founded in 1602, liad built up in Asia an empire, with possessions taken from the Portuguese. Mistress in 1650 of the Cape of Good Hope, which guaranteed it a stopping-place for its ships, it reigned as a sovereign in Ceylon, and upon the coasts of Malabar and Coromandel. It had made Batavia its scat of government, and extended its traffic to China and Japan. Meanwhile the West India Company, of more rapid rise, but less durable, had manned eight hundred ships of war and trade. It had used them to seize the remnants of Portuguese power upon the shores of Guinea, as well as in Brazil. The United Provinces had thus become the warehouse wherein were collected the products of all nations. The colonies of the Dutch at this time were scattered throughout the eastern seas, in India, in Malacca, in Java, the Moluccas, and various parts of the vast arcliipelago lying to the northward of Australia. They had possessions on the west coast of Africa, and as yet the colony of New Amster- dam remained in tlieir hands. In South America the Dutch West India Company had owned nearly three hundred leagues of coast from Bahia in Brazil northward ; but much had recently escaped from their hands. The United Provinces owed their consideration and power to their wealth and their fleets. The sea, which beats like an inveterate enemy against tlieir shores, had been subdued and made a useful servant ; the land was to prove their destruction. A long and fierce strife had been maintained with an enemy more cruel than the sea, — the Spanish king- dom ; the successful ending, with its delusive promise of rest and peace, but sounded the knell of the Dutch Republic. So long as the power of Spain remained unimpaired, or at least great enough to keep up the terror that she had long inspired, it was to the interest of England and of France, both sufferers from Spanish menace and intrigue, that the United Prov- inces should be strong and independent. When Spain fell, — and repeated humiliations showed that her weakness was real and not seeming, — other motives took the place of fear. 7 98 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. England coveted Holland's trade and sea dominion ; France desired the Spanish Netherlands. The United Provinces had reason to oppose the latter as well as the former. Under the combined assaults of the two rival nations, the intrinsic weakness of the United Provinces was soon to be felt and seen. Open to attack by the land, few in numbers, and with a government ill adapted to put forth the united strength of a people, above all unfitted to keep up adequate preparation for war, the decline of the republic and the nation was to be more striking and rapid than the rise. As yet, however, in 1660, no indications of the coming fall were remarked. The republic was still in the front rank of the great powers of Europe. If, in 1654, the war with England had shown a state of unreadiness wonderful in a navy that had so long humbled the pride of Spain on the seas, on the other hand the Provinces, in 1657, liad effectually put a stop to the insults of France directed against her commerce ; and a year later, " by their interference in the Baltic between Denmark and Sweden, they had hindered Sweden from es- tablishing in the North a preponderance disastrous to them. They forced her to leave open the entrance to the Baltic, of which they remained masters, no other navy being able to dispute its control with them. The superiority of their fleet, the valor of their troops, the skill and firmness of their diplomacy, had caused the prestige of their government to be recognized. "Weakened and humiliated by the last English war, they had replaced themselves in the rank of great powers. At this moment Charles II. was restored." The general character of the government has been before mentioned, and need here only be recalled. It was a loosely knit confederacy, administered by what may not inaccurately be called a commercial aristocracy, with all the political timidity of that class, which has so much to risk in war. The effect of these two factors, sectional jealousy and commercial spirit, upon the military navy was disastrous. It was not kept up properly in peace, there were necessarily rivalries in a fleet which was rather a maritime coalition than a united STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. 99 navy, aud there was too little of a true military spirit among the officers. A more heroic people than tlie Dutch never existed ; the annals of Dutch sea-fights give instances of desperate enterprise and endurance certainly not excelled, perhaps never equalled, elsewhere ; but they also exhibit instances of defection and misconduct which show a lack of military spirit, due evidently to lack of professional pride and training. This professional training scarcely existed in any navy of that day, but its place was largely supplied in monarchical countries b}' the feeling of a military caste. It remains to be noted that the government, weak enough from the causes named, was yet weaker from the division of the people into two great factions bitterly hating each other. The one, which was the party of the merchants (burgomasters), and now in power, favored the confederate republic as described ; the other desired a monarchical gov- ernment under the House of Orange. The Republican party wished for a French alliance, if possible, and a strong navy ; the Orange party favored England, to whose royal house the Prince of Orange was closely related, and a powerful army. Under these conditions of government, and weak in numbers, the United Provinces in 1660, with their vast wealth and ex- ternal activities, resembled a man kept up by stimulants. Factitious strength cannot endure indefinitely ; but it is wonderful to see this small State, weaker by far in numbers than either England or France, endure the onslaught of either singly, and for two years of both in alliance, not only without being destroyed, but without losing her place in Europe. She owed this astonishing result partly to the skill of one or two men, but mainly to her sea power. The conditions of England, with reference to her fitness to enter upon the impending strife, differed from those of both Holland and France. Although monarchical in government, and with much real power in the king's hands, the latter was not able to direct the policy of the kingdom wholly at his will. He had to reckon, as Louis had not, with the temper and wishes of his people. What Louis gained for France, 100 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. he gained for himself ; tlic glory of France was his glory. Charles aimed first at his own advantage, then at that of England ; but, with the memory of the past ever before him, he was determined above all not to incur his father's fate nor a repetition of his own exile. Therefore, when danger became imminent, he gave way before the feeling of the English nation. Charles himself hated Holland ; he hated it as a republic ; he hated the existing government because opposed in internal affairs to his connections, the House of Orange ; and he hated it yet more because in the days of his exile, the republic, as one of the conditions of peace with Cromwell, had driven him from her borders. He was drawn to France by the political sympathy of a would-be absolute ruler, possibly by his Roman Catholic bias, and very largely by the money paid him by Louis, which partially freed him from the control of Parliament. In following these tenden- cies of his own, Charles had to take account of certain de- cided wishes of his people. The English, of the same race as the Dutch, and with similar conditions of situation, were declared rivals for the control of the sea and of commerce ; and as the Dutch were now leading in the race, the English were the more eager and bitter. A special cause of grievance was found in the action of the Dutch East India Company, " which claimed the monopoly of trade in the East, and had obliged distant princes with whom it treated to close their States to foreign nations, who were thus excluded, not only from the Dutch colonies, but from all the territory of the Indies." Conscious of greater strength, the English also wished to control the action of Dutch politics, and in the days of the English Republic had even sought to impose a union of the two governments. At the first, therefore, popular rivalry and enmity seconded the king's wishes ; the more so as France had not for some years been formidable on the continent. As soon, however, as the aggressive policy of Louis XIY. was generally recognized, the English people, both nobles and commons, felt the great danger to be there, as a century before it had been in Spain. The transfer of the STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. KH Spanish Netherlands (Belgium) to France would tend toward the subjection of Europe, and especially would be a blow to the sea power both of the Dutch and English ; for it was not to be supposed that Louis would allow the Scheldt and port of Antwerp to remain closed, as they then were, under a treaty wrung by the Dutch from the weakness of Spain. The re- opening to commerce of that great city would be a blow alike to Amsterdam and to London. With the revival of inherited opposition to France the tics of kindred began to tell ; the memory of past alliance against the tyranny of Spain was recalled ; and similarity of religious faith, still a powerful motive, drew the two together. At the same time the great and systematic efforts of Colbert to build up the commerce and the navy of France excited the jealousy of both the sea powers ; rivals themselves, they instinctively turned against a third party intruding upon their domain. Charles was unable to resist the pressure of his people under all these motives ; wars between England and Holland ceased, and were followed, after Charles's death, by close alliance. Although her commerce was less extensive, tlie navy of England in 1660 was superior to that of Holland, particu- larly in organization and efficiency. The stern, enthusiastic religious government of Cromwell, grounded on military strength, had made its mark both on the fleet and army. The names of several of the superior officers under the Pro- tector, among which that of Monk stands foremost, appear in the narrative of the first of the Dutch wars under Charles. This superiority in tone and discipline gradually disappeared under the corrupting influence of court favor in a licentious government ; and Holland, which upon the whole was worsted by England alone upon the sea in 1665, successfully resisted the combined navies of England and France in 1672. As regards the material of the three fleets, we are told that the French ships had greater displacement than the English relatively to the weight of artillery and stores ; hence they could keep, when fully loaded, a greater height of battery. Their hulls also had better lines. These advantages would 102 STATE OF EUROPE IN 1660. naturally follow from the thoughtful and systematic way in' which the French navy at that time was restored from a state of decay, and has a lesson of hope for us in the present analogous condition of our own navy. The Dutch ships, from the character of their coast, were flatter-bottomed and of less draught, and thus were able, when pressed, to find a refuge among the shoals ; but they were in consequence less weatherly and generally of lighter scantling than those of either of the other nations. Thus as briefly as possible have been sketched the condi- tions, degree of power, and aims which shaped and controlled the policy of the four principal seaboard States of the day, — SpaiUj France, England, and Holland. From the point of view of this history, these will come most prominently and most often into notice ; but as other States exercised a power- ful influence npon the course of events, and our aim is not merely naval history but an appreciation of the effect of naval and commercial power upon the course of general history, it is necessary to state shortly the condition of the rest of Europe. America had not yet begun to play a promi- nent part in the pages of history or in the policies of cabinets. Germany was then divided into many small governments, with the one great empire of Austria. The policy of the smaller States shifted, and it was the aim of France to com- bine as many of them as possible under her influence, in pursuance of her traditional opposition to Austria. With France thus working against her on the one side, Austria was in imminent peril on the other from the constant assaults of the Turkish Empire, still vigorous though decaying. The policy of France had long inclined to friendly relations with Turkey, not only as a check upon Austria, but also from her wish to engross the trade with the Levant. Colbert, in his extreme eagerness for the sea power of France, favored this alliance. It will be remembered that Greece and Egypt were then parts of the Turkish Empire. Prussia as now known did not exist. The foundations of POLICY OF LOUIS XIV. 103 the future kingdom were then being prepared by the Elector of Brandenburg, a powerful minor State, which was not yet able to stand quite alone, but carefully avoided a formally dependent position. The kingdom of Poland still existed, a most disturbing and important factor in European politics, because of its weak and unsettled government, which kept every other State anxious lest some unforeseen turn of events there should tend to the advantage of a rival. It was the traditional policy of France to keep Poland upright and strong. Russia was still below the horizon ; coming, but not yet come, within the circle of European States and their living interests. She and the other powers bordering upon the Baltic were naturally rivals for preponderance in that sea, in which the other States, and above all the maritime States, had a particular interest as the source from which naval stores of every kind were chiefly drawn. Sweden and Den- mark were at this time in a state of constant enmity, and were to be found on opposite sides in the quarrels that pre- vailed. For many years past, and during the early wars of Louis XIV., Sweden was for the most part in alliance with France ; her bias was that way. The general state of Europe being as described, the spring that was to set the various wheels in motion was in the hands of Louis XIY. The weakness of his immediate neighbors, the great resources of his kingdom, only waiting for development, the unity of direction resulting from his absolute power, his own practical talent and untiring industry, aided during the first half of his reign by a combination of ministers of singular ability, all united to make every government in Europe hang more or less upon his action, and be determined by, if not follow, his lead. The greatness of France was his object, and he had the choice of advancing it by either of two roads, — by the land or by the sea ; not that the one wholly forbade the otlier, but that France, overwhelmingly strong as she then was, had not power to move with equal steps on both paths. Louis chose extension by land. He had married the eldest daughter of Philip IV., the then reigning king of Spain; and 104 POLICY OF LOUIS XIV. though by the treaty of marriage she had renounced all claim to her father's inheritance, it was not difficult to find reasons for disregarding this stipulation. Technical grounds were found for setting it aside as regarded certain portions of the Netherlands and Franche Comtd, and negotiations were entered into with the court of Spain to annul it altogether. The matter was the more important because the male heir to the throne was so feeble that it was evident that the Austrian line of Spanish kings would end in him. The desire to put a French prince on the Spanish throne — either himself, thus uniting the two crowns, or else one of his family, thus putting the House of Bourbon in authority on both sides of the Pyre- nees— was the false light which led Louis astray during the rest of his reign, to the final destruction of the sea power of France and the impoverishment and misery of his people. Louis failed to understand that he had to reckon with all Europe. Tiie direct project on the Spanish throne had to wait for a vacancy ; but he got ready at once to move upon the Spanish possessions to the east of France. In order to do this more effectually, he cut off from Spain every possible ally by skilful diplomatic intrigues, the study of which would give a useful illustration of strategy in the realm of politics, but he made two serious mistakes to the injury of the sea power of France. Portugal had until twenty years before been united to the crown of Spain, and the claim to it had not been surrendered. Louis considered that were Spain to regain that kingdom she would be too strong for him easily to carry out his aims. Among other means of prevention he promoted a marriage between Charles II. and the Infanta of Portugal, in consequence of which Portu- gal ceded to England, Bombay in India, and Tangiers in the Straits of Gibraltar, which was reputed an excellent port. We see here a French king, in his eagerness for extension b}^ land, inviting England to the Mediterranean, and forwarding her alliance with Portugal. The latter was the more curious, as Louis already foresaw the failure of tlie Spanish royal house, and should rather have wished the union of the penin- ADMINISTRATION OF COLBERT. 105 sular kingdoms. As a matter of fact, Portugal became a de- pendent and outpost of England, by which she readily landed in the Peninsula down to the days of Napoleon. Indeed, if independent of Spain, she is too weak not to be under the control of the power that rules the sea and so has readiest access to her. Louis continued to support her against Spain, and secured her independence. He also interfered with the Dutch, and compelled them to restore Brazil, which they had taken from the Portuguese. On the other hand, Louis obtained from Charles 11. the cession of Dunkirk on the Channel, which had been seized and used by Cromwell. This surrender was made for money, and was inexcusable from the maritime point of view. Dun- kirk was for the English a bridge-head into France. To France it became a haven for privateers, the bane of Eng- land's commerce in the Channel and the North Sea. As the French sea power waned, England in treaty after treaty exacted the dismantling of the works of Dunkirk, which it may be said in passing was the home port of the celebrated Jean Bart and other great French privateersmen. Meanwhile the greatest and wisest of Louis' ministers, Colbert, was diligently building up that system of administra- tion, which, by increasing and solidly basing the wealth of the State, should bring a surer greatness and prosperity than the king's more showy enterprises. With those details that con- cern the internal development of the kingdom this history has no concern, beyond the incidental mention that production, both agricultural and manufacturing, received his careful attention ; but upon the sea a policy of skilful aggression upon the shipping and commerce of the Dutch and English quickly began, and was instantly resented. Great trading companies were formed, directing French enterprise to the Baltic, to the Levant, to the East and West Indies ; customs regulations were amended to encourage French manufactures, and to allow goods to be stored in bond in the great ports, by which means it was hoped to make France take Holland's place as the great warehouse for Europe, a function for 106 PROPOSITION OF LEIBNITZ. which her geographical position eminently fitted her ; while tonnage duties on foreign shipping,' direct premiums on home- built ships, and careful, rigorous colonial decrees giving French vessels the monopoly of trade to and from the colo- nies, combined to encourage the growth of her mercantile marine. England retaliated at once ; the Dutch, more seri- ously threatened because their carrying-trade was greater and their home resources smaller, only remonstrated for a time ; but after three years they also made reprisals. ' Colbert, rely- ing on the great superiority of France as an actual, and still more as a possible producer, feared not to move steadily on the grasping path marked out ; which, in building up a great merchant shipping, would lay the broad base for the military shipping, which was being yet more rapidly forced on by the measures of the State. Prosperity grew apace. At the end of twelve years everything was flourishing, everything rich in the State, which was in utter confusion when he took charge of the finances and marine. " Under him," says a French historian, " France grew by peace as she had grown by war. . . . The warfare of tariffs and premiums skilfully conducted by him tended to reduce within just limits the exorbitant growth of commercial and maritime power which Holland had arrogated at the expense of other nations; and to restrain Eng- land, which was burning to wrest this supremacy from Holland in order to use it in a manner much more dangerous to Europe. The interest of France seemed to be peace in Europe and America ; a mysterious voice, at once the voice of the past and of the future, called for her warlike activity on other shores." ^ This voice found expression through the mouth of Leibnitz, one of the world's great men, who pointed out to Louis that to turn the arms of France against Egypt would give her, in the dominion of the Mediterranean and the control of Eastern trade, a victory over Holland greater than the most success- ful campaign on land ; and while insuring a much needed peace within his kingdom, would build up a power on the sea that would insure preponderance in Europe.

A century later a greater man than Louis sought to exalt himself and France by the path pointed out by Leibnitz ; but Napoleon did not have, as Louis had, a navy equal to the task proposed. This project of Leibnitz will be more fully referred to when the narrative reaches the momentous date at which it was broached ; when Louis, w4th his kingdom and navy in the highest pitch of efficiency, stood at the point where the roads parted, and then took the one which settled that France should not be the power of the sea. This decision, which killed Colbert and ruined the pros- perity of France, was felt in its consequences from generation to generation afterward, as the great navy of England, in war after war, swept the seas, insured the growing wealth of the island kingdom through exhausting strifes, while drying up the external resources of French trade and inflicting consequent misery. The false line of policy that began with Louis XIV. also turned France away from a promisiug career in India, in the days of his successor. Meanwhile the two maritime States, England and Holland, though eying France distrustfully, had greater and growing grudges against each other, which under the fostering care of Charles II. led to war. The true cause was doubtless commer- cial jealousy, and the conflict sprang immediately from colli- sions between the trading companies. Hostilities began on the west coast of Africa ; and an English squadron, in 1664, after subduing several Dutch stations there, sailed to New Amsterdam (now New York), and seized it. All these affairs took place before the formal declaration of war in February, 1665. This war was undoubtedly popular in England ; the in- stinct of the people found an expression by the lips of Monk, who is reported to have said, " What matters this or that reason ? What we want is more of the trade which the Dutch now have." There is also little room to doubt that, despite the pretensions of the trading companies, the government of 108 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. the United Provinces would gladly have avoided the war ; the able man who was at their head saw too clearly the delicate position in which they stood between England and France. They claimed, however, the support of the latter in virtue of a defensive treaty made in 1662. Louis allowed the claim, but unwillingly ; and the still young navy of France gave practically no help. The war between the two sea States was wholly maritime, and had the general characteristics of all such wars. Three great battles were fought, — the first off Lowestoft, on the Norfolk coast, June 13, 1665 ; the second, known as the Four Days' Battle in the Straits of Dover, often spoken of by French writers as that of the Pas de Calais, lasting from the 11th to the 14th of June, 1666 ; and the third, off the North Foreland, August 4 of the same year. In the first and last of these the English had a decided success ; in the sec- ond the advantage remained with the Dutch. This one only will be described at length, because of it alone has been found such a full, coherent account as will allow a clear and accurate tactical narrative to be given. There are in these fights points of interest more generally applicable to the present day than are the details of somewhat obsolete tactical movements. In the first battle off Lowestoft, it appears that the Dutch commander, Opdam, who was not a seaman but a cavalry officer, had very positive orders to fight ; the discretion proper to a commander-in-chief on the spot was not intrusted to him. To interfere thus with the commander in the field or afloat is one of the most common temptations to the government in the cabinet, and is generally disastrous. Tourville, the greatest of Louis XIV. 's admirals, was forced thus to risk the whole French navy against his own judg- ment ; and a century later a great Frencli fleet escaped from the English admiral Keith, through his obedience to impera- tive orders from his immediate superior, who was sick in port. In the Lowestoft fight the Dutch van gave way ; and a little later one of the junior admirals of the centre, Opdam's own squadron, being killed, the crew was seized with a panic, BATTLE OF LOWESTOFT. 109 took tlic command of the ship from her officers, and carried her out of action. This movement was followed by twelve or thirteen other ships, leaving a great gap in the Dutch line. The occurrence shows, what has before been pointed out, that the discipline of the Dutch fleet and the tone of the officers were not high, despite the fine fighting qualities of the nation, and although it is probably true that there were more good seamen among the Dutch than among the English captains. The natural steadfastness and heroism of the Hollanders could not wholly supply that professional pride and sense of military honor which it is the object of sound military institutions to encourage. Popular feeling in the United States is pretty much at sea in this matter ; there is with it no intermediate step between personal courage with a gun in its hand and entire military efficiency. Opdam, seeing the battle going against him, seems to have yielded to a feeling approaching despair. He sought to grap- ple the English commander-in-chief, who on this day was the Duke of York, the king's brother. He failed in this, and in the desperate struggle which followed, his ship blew up. Shortly after, three, or as one account says four, Dutch ships ran foul of one another, and this group was burned by one fire-ship ; three or four others singly met the same fate a little later. The Dutch fleet was now in disorder, and retreated under cover of the squadron of Van Tromp, son of the famous old admiral who in the days of the Commonwealth sailed through the Channel with a broom at his masthead. Fire-ships are seen here to have played a very conspicuous part, more so certainly than in the war of 1653, though at both periods they formed an appendage to the fleet. There is on the surface an evident resemblance between the role of the fire-ship and the part assigned in modern warfare to the torpedo-cruiser. The terrible character of the attack, the comparative smallness of the vessel making it, and the large demands upon the nerve of the assailant, are the chief points of resemblance ; the great points of difference are the com- parative certainty with which the modern vessel can be 110 FIRE-SHIPS. handled, whicli is partly met by the same advantage in the iron-clad over the old ship-of-the-line, and the instantaneous- ness of the injury by torpedo, whose attack fails or succeeds at once, "vvhercas that of the fire-ship required time for effect- ing the object, which in both cases is total destruction of the hostile ship, instead of crippling or otherwise reducing it. An appreciation of the character of fire-ships, of the circumstances under which they attained their greatest usefulness, and of the causes which led to their disappearance, may perhaps help in the decision to which nations must come as to whether the torpedo-cruiser, pure and simple, is a type of weapon destined to survive in fleets. A French officer, who has been examining the records of the French navy, states that the fire-ship first appears, incor- porated as an arm of the fleet, in 1636. " Whether specially built for the purpose, or whether altered from other purposes to be fitted for their particular end, they received a special equipment. The command was given to officers not noble, with the grade of captain of fire-ship. Five subordinate officers and twenty-five seamen made up the crew. Easily known by grappling- irons which were always fitted to their yards, the fire-ship saw its role growing less in the early years of the eighteenth century. It was finally to disappear from the fleets whose speed it delayed and whose evolutions were hy it complicated. As the ships-of-war grew larger, their action in concert with fire-ships became dailj' more difficult. On the other hand, there had already been abandoned the idea of com- bining them with the fighting-ships to form a few groups, each pro- vided with all the means of attack and defence. The formation of the close-hauled line-of-battle, by assigning the fire-ships a place in a second line placed half a league on the side farthest from the enemy, made them more and more unfitted to fulfil their office. The official plan of the battle of Malaga (1704), drawn up immediately after the battle, shows the fire-ship in this position as laid down by Paul Hoste. Finally the use of shells, enabling ships to be set on fire more surely and quickly, and introduced on board at the period of which we are now treating, though the general use did not obtain until much later, was the last blow to the fire-ship." ^ 1 Gougeard : Marine de Guerre. FIRE-SHIPS AND TORPEDO-CRUISERS. HI Those who are familiar with the theories and discussions of our own day on the subject of fleet tactics and weapons, will recognize in this short notice of a long obsolete type cer- tain ideas which are not obsolete. The fire-ship disappeared from fleets "whose speed it delayed." In heavy weather small bulk must always mean comparatively small speed. In a moderate sea, we are now told, the speed of the torpedo-boat falls from twenty knots to fifteen or less, and the seventeen to nineteen knot cruiser can either run away from the pursuing boats, or else hold them at a distance under fire of machine and heavy guns. These boats are sea-going, " and it is thought can keep the sea in all weathers ; but to be on board a 110-foot torpedo-boat, when the sea is lively, is said to be far from agreeable. The heat, noise, and rapid vibrations of the engines are intense. Cooking seems to be out of the question, and it is said that if food were well cooked few would be able to appreciate it. To obtain necessary rest under these con- ditions, added to the rapid motions of the boat, is most diffi- cult." Larger boats are to be built ; but the factor of loss of speed in rough weather will remain, unless the size of the torpedo-cruiser is increased to a point that will certainly lead to fitting them with something more than torpedoes. Like fire-ships, small torpedo-cruisers will delay the speed and com- plicate the evolutions of the fleet with which they are asso- ciated.^ The disappearance of tb.e fire-ship was also hastened, we are told, by the introduction of shell firing, or incendiary projectiles ; and it is not improbable that for deep-sea fight- ing the transfer of the torpedo to a class of larger ships will put an end to the mere torpedo-cruiser. The firi?-ship con- tinued to be used against fleets at anchor down to the days of the American Civil War ; and the torpedo-boat will always be useful within an easy distance of its port. A third phase of naval practice two hundred years ago, men- tioned in the extract quoted, involves an idea very familiar ' Since the above was written, the experience of the English autumn manoeu- vres of 1888 has verified this statement ; not indeed that any such experiment was needed to establish a self-evident fact. 112 GROUP FORMATIONS. to modern discussions ; namely, the group formation. " The idea of combining fire-ships with the fighting-ships to form a few groups, each provided with all the means of attack and defence," was for a time embraced ; for we are told that it was later on abandoned. The combining of the ships of a fleet into groups of two, three, or four meant to act specially together is now largely favored in England ; less so in France, where it meets strong opposition. No question of this sort, ably advocated on either side, is to be settled by one man's judgment, nor until time and experience have applied their infallible tests. It may be remarked, however, that in a well- organized fleet there are two degrees of command which are in themselves both natural and necessary, that can be neither done away nor ignored ; these are the command of the whole fleet as one unit, and the command of each ship as a unit in itself. When a fleet becomes too large to be handled by one man, it must be subdivided, and in the heat of action become practically two fleets acting to one common end ; as Nelson, in his noble order at Trafalgar, said, " The second in com- mand will, after my intentions are made known to hini " (mark the force of the " after," which so well protects the functions both of the commander-in-chief and the second), " have the entire direction of his line, to make the attack upon the enemy, and to follow up the blow until they are captured or destroyed." The size and cost of the individual iron-clad of the present day makes it unlikely that fleets will be so numerous as to require subdivision ; but whether they are or not does not affect the decision of the group question. Looking simply to the principle underlying the theory, and disregarding the seeming tactical clumsiness of the special groups proposed, the question is : Shall there be introduced between the natu- ral commands of the admiral and of the captains of indi- vidual ships a third artificial contrivance, which on the one hand will in effect partly supersede the supreme authority, and on the other will partly fetter the discretion of com- manders of ships ? A further difficulty springing from the FIRE-SHIPS. 113 narrow principle of support specially due to particular ships, on which the group system rests, is this : that when signals can no longer be seen, the duty of the captain to his own ship and to the fleet at large will be complicated by his duty to ob- serve certain relations to particular ships ; which particular ships must in time come to have undue prominence in his views. The group formation had its day of trial in old times, and disappeared before the test of experience ; whether in its restored form it will survive, time will show. It may be said, before quitting the subject, that as an order of sailing, corre- sponding to the route-step of an army in march, a loose group formation has some advantages; maintaining some order with- out requiring tliat rigid exactness of position, to observe which by day and night must be a severe strain on captain and deck- officers. Such a route- order should not, however, be permitted until a fleet has reached high tactical precision. To return to the question of fire-ships and torpedo-boats, the role of the latter, it is often said, is to be found in that melee which is always to succeed a couple of headlong passes between the opposing fleets. In the smoke and confusion of that hour is the opportunity of the torpedo-boat. This cer- tainly sounds plausible, and the torpedo vessel certainly has a power of movement not possessed by the fire-ship. A melee of the two fleets, however, was not tlie condition most favor- able for the fire-ship. I shall quote here from another French officer, whose discussion of these Anglo-Dutch sea-fights, in a late periodical, is singularly clear and suggestive. He says: " Far from impeding the direct action of the fire-ship, which was naught or nearly so during the confused battles of the war of 1652, the regularity and ensemble newly attained in the movements of squadrons seem rather to favor it. The fire-ships played a very important part at the battles of Lowestoft, Pas de Calais, and the North Foreland. Thanks to the good order preserved by the ships- of the line, these incendiary ships can indeed be better protected by the artillery ; much more efficiently directed than before toward a distinct and determined end." ^ 1 Chabaud- Arnault : Revue ^lar. et Col. 1885. 8 114 FIRE-SHIPS. In the midst of the confused melees of 1652 the firc-ship " acted, so to speak, alone, seeking by chance an enemy to grapple, running the risk of a mistake, without protection against the guns of the enemy, nearly sure to be sunk by him or else burned uselessly. All now, in 1665, has become different. Its prey is clearly pointed out ; it knows it, fol- lows it easily into the relatively fixed position had by it in the enemy's line. On the other hand, the ships of his own division do not lose sight of the fire-ship. They accompany it as far as possible, cover it with their artillery to the end of its course, and disengage it before burning, if the fruitless- ness of the attempt is seen soon enough. Evidently under such conditions its action, always uncertain (it cannot be otherwise), nevertheless acquires greater chances of success." These instructive comments need perhaps the qualifying, or additional, remark that confusion in the enemy's order at the time that your own remains good gives the best open- ing for a desperate attack. The writer goes on to trace the disappearance of the fire-ship : — " Here then we see the fire-ship at the point of its highest impor- tance. That importance will decrease, the lire-ship itself will end by disappearing from engagements in the open sea, when naval artillery becoming more perfect shall have greater range, be more accurate and more rapid ; ^ when ships receiving better forms, greater steering power, more extensive and better balanced sail power, shall be able, thanks to quicker speed and handling, to avoid almost certainly the fire-ships sent against them ; when, finally, fleets led on principles of tactics as skilful as they were timid, a tactics which will i)redominate a century later during the whole war of American Independence, when these fleets, in order not to jeopardize the perfect regularity of their order of battle, will avoid coming to close quarters, and will leave to the cannon alone to decide the fate of an action." In this discussion the writer has in view the leading feature which, while aiding the action of the fire-ship, also gives this 1 The recent development of rapid-firing and machine guns, with the great increase of their calibre and consequent range and penetration, reproduces this same step in the cycle of progress. ORDERS OF BATTLE. 115 war of 1665 its peculiar interest in the histor}'- of naval tac- tics. In it is found for the first time the close-hauled line-of- battle undeniably adopted as the fighting order of the fleets. It is plain enough that when those fleets numbered, as thej often did, from eighty to a hundred ships, such lines would be very imperfectly formed in every essential, both of line and interval ; but the general aim is evident, amid whatever imper- fections of execution. The credit for this development is generally given to the Duke of York, afterward James TI. ; but the question to whom the improvement is due is of little importance to sea-officers of the present day when compared with the instructive fact that so long a time elapsed between the appearance of the large sailing-ship, with its broadside battery, and the systematic adoption of the order which was best adapted to develop the full power of the fleet for mutual support. To us, having the elements of the problem in our hands, together with the result finally reached, that result seems simple enough, almost self-evident. Why did it take so long for the capable men of that day to reach it? The rea- son — and herein lies the lesson for the officer of to-day — was doubtless the same that leaves the order • of battle so uncertain now ; namely, that the necessity of war did not force men to make up their minds, until the Dutch at last met in the English their equals on the sea. The sequence of ideas which resulted in the line-of-battle is clear and logical. Though familiar enough to seamen, it will be here stated in the words of the writer last quoted, because they have a neat- ness and precision entirely French : — " With the increase of power of the ship-of-war, and with the per- fecting of its sea and warlike qualities, there has come an equal progress in the art of utilizing them. . . . As naval evolutions become more skilful, their importance grows from day to day. To these evolutions there is needed a base, a point from which they de- part and to which they return. A fleet of war-ships must be always ready to meet an enemy ; logically, therefore, this point of departure for naval evolutions must be the order of battle. Now, since the disappearance of galleys, almost all the artillery is found upon the 116 ORDERS OF BATTLE. sides of a ship of war. Hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics. In order that this order of battle, this long thin line of guns, may not be in- jured or broken at some point weaker than the rest, there is at the same time felt the necessity of putting in it only ships which, if not of equal force, have at least equally strong sides. Logically it follows, at the same moment in which the line ahead became definitively the order for battle, there was established the distinction between the ships ' of the line,' alone destined for a place therein, and the lighter shijjs meant for other uses." If to these we add the considerations which led to making the line-of-battlo a close-hauled line, we have the problem fully worked out. But the chain of reasoning was as clear two hun- dred and fifty years ago as it is now ; why then was it so long in being worked out ? Partly, no doubt, because old traditions — in those days traditions of galley-fighting — had hold of and confused men's minds ; chiefly because men are too indolent to seek out the foundation truths of the situation in their day, and develop the true theory of action from its base up. As a rare instance of clear-sightedness, recognizing such a funda- mental change in conditions and predicting results, words of Admiral Labrousse of the French navy, written in 1840, are most instructive. " Thanks to steam," he wrote, " ships will be able to move in any direction with such speed that the effects of collision may, and indeed must, as they formerly did, take the place of projectile weapons and annul the calculations of the skilful manceuvrer. The ram will be favorable to speed, without destroying the nautical qualities of a ship. As soon as one power shall have adopted this terrible weapon, all others must accept it, under pain of evident inferiority, and thus combats will become combats of ram against ram." While forbearing the unconditional adhesion to the ram as BATTLE OF THE FOUR DAYS. 117 the controlling weapon of the day, which the French navy has yielded, tl>e above brief argument may well be taken as an in- stance of the way in which researches into the order of battle of the future should be worked out. A French writer, com- menting on Labrousse's paper, says : — " Twenty -seven years were scarce enough for our fathers, counting from 1G38, the date of building the 'Couronne,' to 1665, to pass from the tactical order of the line abreast, the order for galleys, to that of the line ahead. "We ourselves needed twenty-nine years from 1830, when the first steamship was brought into our fleet, to 1859, when the application of the principle of ram-fighting was affirmed by laying down the ' Solferino ' and the ' Magenta' to work a revolution in the contrary direction ; so true it is that truth is always slow in get- ting to the liglit. . . . This transformation was not sudden, not only because the new material required time to be built and armed, but above all, it is sad to say, because the necessary consequences of the new motive power escaped most minds." ^ "We come now to the justly celebrated Four Days' Battle of June, 1666, which claims special notice, not only on account of the great number of ships engaged on either side, nor yet only for the extraordinary physical endurance of the men who kept up a hot naval action for so many successive days, but also because the commanders-in-chief on either side. Monk and De Ruyter, were the most distinguished seamen, or rather sea-commanders, brought forth by their respective countries in the seventeenth century. Monk was possibly inferior to Blake in the annals of the English navy ; but there is a gen- eral agreement that De Ruyter is the foremost figure, not only in the Dutch service, but among all the naval officers of that age. The account about to be given is mainly taken from a recent number of the " Revue Maritime et Coloniale," ^ and is there published as a letter, recently discovered, from a Dutch gentleman serving as volunteer on board De Ruyter's ship, to a friend in France. The narrative is delightfully clear and probable, — qualities not generally found in the description of 1 Gougeard : Marine de Guerre. 2 Vol. Ixxxii. p. 137. 118 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. those long-ago fights ; and the satisfaction it gave was in- creased by finding in the Memoirs of the Count de Guiche, who also served as volunteer in the fleet, and was taken to De Ruyter after his own vessel had been destroyed by a fire-ship, an account confirming the former in its principal details.^ This additional pleasure was unhappily marred by recognizing certain phrases as common to both stories ; and a comparison showed that the two could not be accepted as independent narratives. There are, however, points of internal difference which make it possible that the two accounts are by different eye-witnesses, who compared and corrected their versions be- fore sending them out to their friends or writing tliem in their journals. The numbers of the two fleets were : English about eighty ships, the Dutch about one hundred ; but the inequality in numbers was largely compensated by the greater size of many of the English. A great strategic blunder by the government in London immediately preceded the fight. The king was informed that a French squadron was on its way from the Atlantic to join the Dutch. He at once divided his fleet, sending twenty ships under Prince Rupert to the westward to meet the French, while the remainder under Monk were to go east and oppose the Dutch. A position like that of the English fleet, threatened with an attack from two quarters, presents one of the subtlest tempta- tions to a commander. The impulse is very strong to meet both by dividing his own numbers as Charles did ; but unless in possession of overwhelming force it is an error, exposing both divisions to be beaten separately, which, as we are about to see, actually happened in this case. The result of the first two days was disastrous to the larger English division under Monk, which was then obliged to retreat toward Rupert ; and probably the opportune return of the latter alone saved the English fleet from a very serious loss, or at the least from being shut up in their own ports. A hundred and forty years 1 Me'moires du Cte. de Guiche. A Londres, chez P. Changuion. 1743. pp. 234-264. ^ / h > / / .,-/ ■^ t. tA ^[ ^5o Ph IM to BATTLE OF THE FOUR DAYS. 119 later, in the exciting game of strategy that was played in the Bay of Biscay before Trafalgar, the English admiral Corn- wallis made precisely the same blunder, dividing his fleet into two equal parts out of supporting distance, which Napoleon at the time characterized as a glaring piece of stupidity. The lesson is the same in all ages. The Dutch had sailed for the English coast with a fair easterly wind, but it changed later to southwest with thick weather, and freshened, so that De Ruyter, to avoid being driven too far, came to anchor between Dunkirk and the Downs.i The fleet then rode with its head to the south-south- west and the van on the right ; while Tromp, who commanded the rear division in the natural order, was on the left. For some cause this left was most to windward, the centre squad- ron under Ruyter being to leeward, and the right, or van, to leeward again of the centre.^ Tliis was the position of the Dutch fleet at daylight of June 11, 1666 ; and although not expressly so stated, it is likely, from the whole tenor of the narratives, that it was not in good order. Tlie same morning Monk, who was also at anchor, made out the Dutch fleet to leeward, and although so inferior in numbers determined to attack at once, hoping that by keeping the advantage of the wind he would be able to commit himself only so far as might seem best. He therefore stood along the Dutch line on the starboard tack, leaving the right and centre out of cannon-shot, until he came abreast of the left, Tromp's squadron. Monk then had thirty-five ships well in hand ; but the rear had opened and was straggling, as is apt to be the case with long columns. With the thirty-five he then put his helm up and ran down for Tromp, whose squadron cut their cables ajid made sail on the same tack (V) ; the two engaged 1 See Map of English Channel and North Sea, page 107. 2 Plate I., June II, 1666, Fig. 1. V, van ; C, centre; R, rear: in this part of the action the Dutch order was inverted, so that the actual van was the proper rear. Tlie great number of ships engaged in the fleet actions of these Anglo- Dutch wars make it impossible to represent each ship and at the same time pre- serve clearness in the plans. Each figure of a ship therefore represents a group, more or less numerous. 120 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. lines thus standing over toward the French coast, and the breeze heeling the ships so that the English could not use their lower-deck guns (Fig. 2, V). The Dutch centre and rear also cut (Fig. 1, C), and followed the movement, but being so far to leeward, could not for some time come into action. It was during this time that a large Dutch ship, becoming separated from her own fleet, was set on fire and burned, doubtless the ship in which was Count de Guiche. As they drew near Dunkirk the English went about, prob- ably all together ; for in the return to the northward and westward the proper English van fell in with and was roughly handled by the Dutch centre under Ruyter himself (Fig. 2, C). This fate would be more likely to befall the rear, and indicates that a simultaneous movement had reversed the order. The engaged ships had naturally lost to leeward, thus enabling Ruyter to fetch up with them. Two English flag- ships were here disabled and cut off; one, the " Swiftsure," hauled down her colors after the admiral, a young man of only twenty-seven, was killed. " Highly to be admired," says a contemporary writer, " was the resolution of Vice- Admiral Berkeley, who, though cut off from the line, sur- rounded by enemies, great numbers of his men killed, his ship disabled and boarded on all sides, yet continued fighting almost alone, killed several with his own liand, and would accept no quarter ; till at length, being shot in the throat with a musket-ball, he retired into the captain's cabin, where he was found dead, extended at his full length upon a table, and almost covered with his own blood." Quite as heroic, but more fortunate in its issue, was the conduct of the other English admiral thus cut off ; and the incidents of his strug- gle, though not specially instructive otherwise, are worth quoting, as giving a lively picture of the scenes which passed in the heat of the contests of those days, and afford coloring to otherwise dry details. "Being in a short time completely disabled, one of the enemy's fire-ships grappled him on the starboard quarter ; he was, however, freed by the almost incredible exertions of his lieutenant, who, hav- BATTLE OF THE FOUR DAY'S. 121 ing in the midst of the flames loosed the grappling-irons, swung back on board his own ship unhurt. The Dutch, bent on the destruction of this unfortunate ship, sent a second which grappled her on the larboard side, and with greater success than the former ; for the sails instantly taking fire, the crew were so terrified that nearly fifty of them jumped overboard. The admiral, Sir John Ilarman, seeing this confusion, ran with his sword drawn among those who remained, and threatened with instant death the first man who should attempt to quit the ship, or should not exert himself to quench the flames. The crew then returned to their duty and got the fire under ; but the rigging being a good deal burned, one of the topsail yards fell and broke Sir John's leg. In the midst of this accumulated distress, a third fire-ship prepared to grapple him, but was suuk by the guns before she could effect her purpose. The Dutch vice-admiral, Evertzen, now bore down to him and offered quarter ; but Sir John replied, ' No, no, it is not come to that yet,' and giving him a broad- side, killed the Dutch commander; after which the other enemies sheered off." ^ It is therefore not surprising that the account we have been following reported two English flag- ships lost, one by a fire- ship. " The English chief still continued on the port tack, and," says the writer, " as night fell we could see him proudly leading his line past tlie squadron of North Holland and Zea- land [the actual rear, but proper van] , which from noon up to that time hod not been able to reach the enemy [Fig. 2, R''] from their leewardly position." The merit of Monk's attack as a piece of grand tactics is evident, and bears a strong re- semblance to that of Nelson at the Nile. Discerning quickly the weakness of the Dutch order, he had attacked a vastly superior force in such a way that only part of it could come' into action ; and though the English actually lost more heavily, they carried off a brilliant prestige and must have left considerable depression and heart-burning among the Dutch. The eye-witness goes on : " The affair continued until ten P. m., friends and foes mixed together and as likely to receive injury from one as from the other. It will be re- marked that the success of the day and the misfortunes of 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 122 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. the English came from their being too much scattered, too extended in their line ; but for which we could never have cut off a corner of them, as we did. The mistake of Monk was in not keeping his ships better together ; " that is, closed up. The remark is just, the criticism scarcely so ; the open- ing out of the line was almost unavoidable in so long a column of sailing-ships, and was one of the chances taken by Monk when he offered battle. The English stood off on the port tack to the west or west- northwest, and next day returned to the fight. The Dutch were now on the port tack in natural order, the right leading, and were to windward ; but the enemy, being more weatherly and better disciplined, soon gained the advantage of the wind. The English this day had forty-four ships in action, the Dutch about eighty ; many of the English, as before said, larger. The two fleets passed on opposite tacks, the English to windward ; ^ but Tromp, in the rear, seeing that the Dutch order of battle was badly formed, the ships in two or three lines, overlapping and so masking each other's fire, went about and gained to windward of the enemy's van (R^ '■> which he was able to do from the length of the line, and because the English, running parallel to the Dutch order, were off the wind. "At this moment two flag-officers of the Dutch van kept broad off, presenting their sterns to the English (V)* Ruyter, greatly astonished, tried to stop them, but in vain, and therefore felt obliged to imitate the manoeuvre in order to keep his squad- ron together ; but he did so with some order, keeping some ships around him, and was joined by one of the van ships, dis- gusted with the conduct of his immediate superior. Tromp was now in great danger, separated [by his own act first and then by the conduct of the van] from his own fleet by the English, and would have been destroyed but for Ruyter, who, seeing the urgency of the case, hauled up for him," the van and centre thus standing back for the rear on the oppo- site tack to that on which they entered action. This pre- vented the English from keeping up the attack on Tromp, lest 1 Plate I., June 12, Fig. 1, V, C, R. BATTLE OF THE FOUR DAYS. 123 Ruyter should gain the wind of them, which they could not afford to yield because of their very inferior numbers. Both the action of Tromp and that of the junior flag-officers in the van, though showing very different degrees of warlike ardor, bring out strongly the lack of subordination and of military feeling which has been charged against the Dutch officers as a body ; no signs of which appear among the English at this time. How keenly Ruyter felt the conduct of his lieutenants was manifested when " Tromp, immediately after this partial ac- tion, went on board his flagship. The seamen cheered him ; but Ruyter said, ' This is no time for rejoicing, but rather for tears.' Indeed, our position was bad, each squadron acting differently, in no line, and all the ships huddled together like a flock of sheep, so packed that the English might have sur- rounded all of them with their forty ships [June 12, Fig. 2]. The English were in admirable order, but did not push their advantage as they should, whatever the reason." The reason no doubt was the same that often prevented sailing-ships from pressing an advantage, — disability from crippled spars and rigging, added to the inexpediency of such inferior num- bers risking a decisive action. Ruyter was thus able to draw his fleet out into line again, although much maltreated by the English, and the two fleets passed again on opposite tacks, the Dutch to leeward, and Ruyter's ship the last in his column. As he passed the English rear, he lost his maintopmast and mainyard. After another partial rencounter the English drew away to the northwest toward their own shores, the Dutch following them ; the wind being still from southwest, but light. The English were now fairly in retreat, and the pursuit continued all night, Ruyter's own ship dropping out of sight in the rear from her crippled state. The third day Monk continued retreating to the westward. He burned, by the English accounts, three disabled ships, sent ahead those that were most crippled, and himself brouglit up the rear with those that were in fighting condition, which arc 124 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. variously stated, again by the English, at twenty-eight and sixteen in number (Plate II., June 13). One of the largest and finest of the English fleet, the " Royal Prince," of ninety guns, ran aground on the Galloper Shoal and was taken by Tromp (Plate II. a) ; but Monk's retreat was so steady and orderly that he was otherwise unmolested. This shows that the Dutch had suffered very severely. Toward evening Ru- pert's squadron was seen ; and all the ships of the English fleet, except those crippled in action, were at last united. The next day the wind came out again very fresh from the southwest, giving the Dutch the weather-gage. The English, instead of attempting to pass upon opposite tacks, came up from astern relying upon the speed and handiness of their ships. So doing, the battle engaged all along the line on the port tack, the English to leeward.^ The Dutch fire-ships were badly handled and did no harm, whereas the English burned two of their enemies. The two fleets ran on thus, exchang- ing broadsides for two hours, at the end of which time the bulk of the English fleet had passed through the Dutch line.^ All regularity of order was henceforward lost. " At this mo- ment," says the eye-witness, " the lookout was extraordinary, for all were separated, the English as well as we. But luck would have it that the largest of our fractions surrounding the admiral remained to windward, and the largest fraction of the English, also with their admiral, remained to leeward [Figs. 1 and 2, C and C']. This was the cause of our victory and their ruin. Our admiral had with him thirty-five or forty ships of his own and of other squadrons, for the squadrons were scattered and order much lost. The rest of the Dutch ships had left him. The leader of the van. Van Ness, had gone off' with fourteen ships in chase of three or four English ships, which under a press of sail had gained to windward of the Dutch van [Fig. 1, V]. Van Tromp with the rear squad- 1 Plate II., June 14, Fig. 1, E, D. 2 Fig. 1 , V, C, R. This result was probably due simply to the greater weather- liness of the English ships. It would perhaps be more accurate to say that the Dutch had sagged to leeward so that they drifted through the English line. ,11 *2 5 Ul d 15 2 QJ • 1 " »» ?» ' ? i 1 1 ? 1 i 1 1 9 1 j. « 1 ' .!> .

De Ruyter and the English main body kept up a sharp action, beating to windward all the time. Tromp, having carried sail, overtook Van Ness, and returned bringing the van back with him (V, R') ; but owing to the constant plying to windward of the English main body he came up to leeward of it and could not rejoin Ruyter, who was to wind- ward (Fig. 3, V", R "). Ruyter, seeing this, made signal to the ships around him, and the main body of the Dutch kept away before the wind (Fig 3, C "), which was then very strong. " Thus in less than no time we found ourselves in the midst of the English ; who, being attacked on both sides, were thrown into confusion and saw their whole order de- stroyed, as well by dint of the action, as by the strong wind that was then blowing. This was the hottest of the fight [Fig. 3]. We saw the high admiral of England separated from his fleet, followed only by one fire-ship. With that he gained to windward, and passing tlirough the North Holland squadron, placed himself again at the head of fifteen or twenty ships that rallied to him." Thus ended this great sea-fight, the most remarkable, in some of its aspects, that has ever been fought upon the ocean. Amid conflicting reports it is not possible to do more than estimate the results. A fairly impartial account says: "The States lost in these actions three vice-admirals, two thousand men, and four ships. The loss of the English was five thou- sand killed and three thousand prisoners ; and they lost besides seventeen ships, of which nine remained in the hands of the victors." 1 There is no doubt that the English had much the worst of it, and that this was owing wholly to the original blunder of weakening the fleet by a great detachment sent in another direction. Great detachments are sometimes neces- sary evils, but in this case no necessity existed. Granting the approach of the French, the proper course for the English 1 Lefcvre-Pontalis : Jean de "Witt. 126 SECOND ANGLO-DUTCH WAR. was to fall with their whole fleet upon the Dutch before their allies could come up. This lesson is as applicable to-day as it ever was. A second lesson, likewise of present application, is the necessity of sound military institutions for implanting correct military feeling, pride, and discipline. Great as was the first blunder of the English, and serious as was the disas- ter, there can be no doubt that the consequences would have been much worse but for the high spirit and skill with which the plans of Monk were carried out by his subordinates, and the lack of similar support to Ruyter on the part of the Dutch subalterns. In the movements of the English, we hear noth- ing of two juniors turning tail at a critical moment, nor of a third, with misdirected ardor, getting on the wrong side of the enemy's fleet. Their drill also, their tactical precision, was remarked even then. The Frenchman De Guiche, after witnessing this Four Days' Fight, wrote : — " Nothing equals the beautiful order of the English at sea. Never was a line drawn straighter than that formed by their ships ; thus they bring all their fire to bear upon those who draw near them. . . . They fight like a line of cavalry which is handled according to rule, and applies itself solely to force back those who oppose ; whereas the Dutch advance like cavalry whose squadrons leave their ranks and come separate!}" to the charge." ^ The Dutch government, averse to expense, unmilitary in its tone, and incautious from long and easy victory over the degenerate navy of Spain, had allowed its fleet to sink into a mere assembly of armed merchantmen. Things were at their worst in the days of Cromwell. Taught by the severe lessons of that war, the United Provinces, under an able ruler, had done much to mend matters, but full efficiency had not yet been gained. "In 1666 as in 1653," says a French naval writer, "the fortune of war seemed to lean to the side of the English. Of the three great battles fought two were decided victories ; and the third, though adverse, had but increased the glory of her seamen. This was due to the intelligent boldness of Monk and Rupert, the talents of part 1 Memoires, pp. 249, 251, 266, 267. SOLDIERS COMMANDING SHIPS. 127 of the admirals and captains, and the skill of the seamen and soldiers under them. The wise and vigorous efforts made by the government of the United Provinces, and the undeniable superiority of Ruyter in experience and genius over any one of his opponents, could not com- pensate for the weakness or incapacity of part of the Dutch officers, and the manifest inferiority of the men under their orders." ^ England, as has been said before, still felt the impress of Cromwell's iron hand upon her military institutions ; but that impress was growing weaker. Before the next Dutch w^ar Monk was dead, and was poorly replaced by the cavalier Rupert. Court extravagance cut down the equipment of the navy as did the burgomaster's parsimony, and court corrup- tion undermined discipline as surely as commercial indiffer- ence. The effect was evident when the fleets of the two countries met again, six years later. There was one well-known feature of all the military navies of that day which calls for a passing comment ; for its correct bearing and value is not always, perhaps not -generally, seen. The command of fleets and of single vessels was often given to soldiers, to military men unaccustomed to the sea, and ignorant how to handle the ship, that duty being intrusted to another class of officer. Looking closely into the facts, it is seen that this made a clean division between the direction of the fighting and of the motive power of the ship. This is the essence of the matter ; and the principle is the same whatever the motive power may be. The inconvenience and inefficiency of such a system was obvious then as it is now, and the logic of facts gradually threw the two functions into the hands of one corps of officers, the result being the modern naval officer, as that term is generally understood.^ Unfortunately, in this process of blending, the less important function was allowed to get the upper hand ; the naval officer came to feel more 1 Chabaud-Arnault : Eevue Mar. et Col. 1885 2 The true significance of this change lias often been misunderstood, and hence erroneous inferences as to the future have been drawn. It was not a case of the new displacing the old, but of the military element in a military organization asserting its necessarv and inevitable control over all other functions. 128 MILITARY QUALITIES OF proud of his dexterity in managing the motive power of his ship tlian of his skill in developing her military efficiency. The bad effects of this lack of interest in military science became most evident when the point of handling fleets was reached, because for that military skill told most, and previous study was most necessary ; but it was felt in the single ship as well. Hence it came to pass, and especially in the English navy, that the pride of the seaman took the place of the pride of the military man. The English naval officer thought more of that which likened him to the merchant captain than of that which made him akin to the soldier. In the French navy this result was less general, owing probably to the more mili- tary spirit of the government, and especially of the nobility, to whom the rank of officer was reserved. It was not possible that men whose whole association was military, all of whose friends looked upon arms as the one career for a gentleman, could think more of the sails and rigging than of the guns or the fleet. The English corps of officers was of different origin. There was more than the writer thought in Ma- caulay's well-known saying : " There were seamen and there were gentlemen in the navy of Charles II.; but the seamen were not gentlemen, and the gentlemen were not seamen." The trouble was not in the absence or presence of gentlemen as such, but in the fact that under the conditions of that day the gentleman was pre-eminently the military element of society ; and that the seaman, after the Dutch wars, gradually edged the gentleman, and with him the military tone and spirit as distinguished from simple courage, out of the service. Even " such men of family as Herbert and Russell, William III.'s admirals," says the biographer of Lord Hawke, " were sailors indeed, but only able to hold their own by adopting the boisterous manners of the hardy tarpaulin." The same national traits which made the French inferior as seamen made them superior as military men ; not in courage, but in skill. To this day the same tendency obtains ; the direction of the motive power has no such consideration as the military functions in the navies of the Latin nations. The studious FRENCH AND ENGLISH OFFICERS. 129 and systematic side of the French character also inclined the French officer, when not a trifler, to consider and develop tactical questions in a logical manner ; to prepare himself to handle fleets, not merely as a seaman but as a military man. The result showed, in the American Revolutionary War, that despite a mournful history of governmental neglect, men who were first of all military men, inferior tliough they were in opportunities as seamen to their enemies, could meet them on more than equal terms as to tactical skill, and were j^ractically their superiors in handling fleets. The false theory has already been pointed out, which directed the action of the French fleet not to crushing its enemy, but to some ulterior aim ; but this does not affect the fact that in tactical skill the military men were superior to the mere seamen, though their tactical skill was applied to mistaken strategic ends. The source whence the Dutch mainly drew their officers does not certainly appear ; for while the English naval historian in 1666 says that most of the captains of their fleet were sons of rich burgomasters, placed there for political reasons by the Grand Pensionary, and without experience, Duquesne, the ablest French admiral of the day, comments in 1676 on the precision and skill of the Dutch captains in terms very disparaging to his own. It is likely, from many indications, tliat they were generally merchant seamen, with little original military feel- ing ; but the severity with which the delinquents were pun- ished both by the State and by popular frenzy, seems to have driven these officers, who were far from lacking the highest personal courage, into a sense of what military loyalty and subordination required. They made a very different record in 1672 from that of 1666. Before finally leaving the Four Days' Fight, the conclu- sions of another writer may well be quoted : — " Such was that bloody Battle of the Four Days, or Straits of Calais, the most memorable sea-fight of modern days ; not, indeed, by its results, but by the aspect of its different phases ; by the fury of the combatants ; by the boldness and skill of the leaders ; and by the new character which it gave to sea warfare. More than any other 9 130 CHANGES IN TACTICS. this fight marks clearly the passage from former methods to the taciics of the end of the seventeenth century. P^or the first time we can fol- low, as though traced upon a plan, the principal movements of the contending fleets. It seems quite clear that to the Dutch as well as to the Britisli have been given a tactical book and a code of sig- nals ; or, at the least, written instructions, extensive and precise, to serve instead of such a code. We feel that each admiral now has his squadron in hand, and that even the commander-in-chief disposes at his will, during the fight, of the various subdivisions of his fleet. Compare this action with those of 1652, and one plain fact stares you in the face, — that between the two dates naval tactics have under- gone a revolution. "Such were the changes that distinguish the war of 1665 from that of 1652. As in the latter epoch, the admiral still thinks the weather- gage an advantage for his fleet ; but it is no longer, from the tactical point of view, the principal, we might almost say the sole, preoccu- pation. Now he wishes above all to keep his fleet in good order and compact as long as possible, so as to keep the power of comhinhig., during the action, the movements of the different squadrons. Look at Ruyter, at the end of the Four Days' Fight ; with great difficulty he has kept to windward of the English fleet, yet he does not hesitate to sacrifice this advantage in order to unite the two parts of his fleet, which are separated by the enemy. If at the later flght off the North Foreland great intervals exist between the Dutch squadrons, if the rear afterward continues to withdraw from the centre, Ruyter deplores such a fault as the chief cause of his defeat. He so deplores it in his otBcial report ; he even accuses Trorap [who was his personal enemy] of treason or cowardice, — an unjust accusation, but which none the less shows the enormous importance thenceforth attached, during action, to the reunion of the fleet into a whole strictly and regularly maintained." ^ This commentary is justified in so far as it points out gen- eral aims and tendencies ; but the results were not as com- plete as might be inferred from it. The English, notwithstanding their heavy loss in the Four Days' Battle, were at sea again within two months, much to the surprise of the Dutch ; and on the 4th of August 1 Chabaud-Arnault : Eevue Mar. et Col. 1885. RUYTER IN THE THAMES. 131 another severe fight was fought off the North Foreland, end- ing in the complete defeat of the latter, who retired to their own coasts. The English followed, and effected an entrance into one of the Dutch harbors, where they destroyed a large fleet of merchantmen as well as a town of some importance. Toward the end of 1666 both sides were tired of the war, which was doing great harm to trade, and weakening both navies to the advantage of the growing sea power of France. Negotiations looking toward peace were opened ; but Charles II., ill disposed to the United Provinces, confident that the growing pretensions of Louis XIV. to the Spanish Nether- lands would break up the existing alliance between Holland and France, and relying also upon the severe reverses suf- fered at sea by the Dutch, was exacting and haughty in his demands. To justify and maintain tliis line of conduct he should have kept up his fleet, the prestige of which had been so advanced by its victories. Instead of that, poverty, the result of extravagance and of his home policy, led him to per- mit it to decline ; ships in large numbers were laid up ; and he readily adopted an opinion which chimed in with his penury, and which, as it has had advocates at all periods of sea history, should be noted and condemned here. This opinion, warmly opposed by Monk, was : — " That as the Dutch were chiefly supported by trade, as the supply of their navy depended upon trade, and, as experience showed, nothing provoked the people so much as injuring their trade, his Majesty should therefore apply himself to this, which would effectually hum- ble them, at the same time that it would less exhaust the English than fitting out such mighty fleets as had hitherto kept the sea every sum- mer. . . . Upon these motives the king took a fatal resolution of laying up his great ships and keeping only a few frigates on the cruise." ^ In consequence of this economical theory of carrying on a war, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, De Witt, who had the year before caused soundings of the Thames to be made, ^ Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 132 PEACE OF BREDA. sent into the river, under De Ruyter, a force of sixty or seventy ships-of-the-line, which on the 14th of June, 1667, went up as high as Gravescnd, destroying ships at Chatham and in the Medway, and taking possession of Sheerness. The light of the fires could be seen from London, and the Dutch fleet remained in possession of the mouth of the river until the end of the month. Under this blow, following as it did upon the great plague and the great fire of London, Charles consented to peace, which was signed July 31, 1667, and is known as the Peace of Breda. The most lasting result of the war was the transfer of New York and New Jersey to Eng- land, thus joining her northern and southern colonies in North America. Before going on again with the general course of the history of the times, it will be well to consider for a moment the theory which worked so disastrously for England in 1667 ; that, namely, of maintaining a sea-war mainly by preying upon the enemy's commerce. This plan, which involves only the maintenance of a few swift cruisers and can be backed by the spirit of greed in a nation, fitting out privateers without direct expense to the State, possesses the specious attractions which economy always presents. The great injury done to the wealth and prosperity of the enemy is also undeniable ; and although to some extent his merchant-ships can shelter them- selves ignobly under a foreign flag while the war lasts, this guerre de course, as the French call it, this commerce-destroy- ing, to use our own phrase, must, if in itself successful, greatly embarrass the foreign government and distress its people. Such a war, however, cannot stand alone ; it must be sup- ported, to use the military phrase ; unsubstantial and evanes- cent in itself, it cannot reach far from its base. That base must be either home ports, or else some solid outpost of the national power, on the shore or the sea ; a distant dependency or a powerful fleet. Failing such support, the cruiser can only dash out hurriedly a short distance from home, and its blows, though painful, cannot be fatal. It was not tlie policy of 1667, but Cromwell's powerful fleets of ships-of-the-line in COMMERCE-DESTROYING WAR. 133 lGo2, that shut the Dutch merchantmen in their ports and caused the grass to grow in the streets of Amsterdam. When, instructed by the suffering of that time, the Dutch kept large fleets afloat through two exhausting wars, though their com- merce suffered greatly, they bore up the burden of the strife against England and France united. Forty years later, Louis XIV. was driven, by exhaustion, to the policy adopted by Charles II. through parsimony. Then were the days of the great French privateers, Jean Bart, Forbin, Duguay-Trouin, Du Casse, and others. The regular fleets of the French navy were practically withdrawn from the ocean during the great War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1712). The French naval historian says : — " Unable to renew the naval armaments, Louis XIV. increased the number of cruisers ujion the more frequented seas, especially the Chan- nel and the German Ocean [not far from home, it will be noticed]. In these different spots the cruisers were always in a position to in- tercept or hinder the movements of transports laden with troops, and of the numerous convoys carrying supplies of all kinds. In these seas, in the centre of the commercial and political world, there is always work for cruisers. Notwithstanding the difficulties they met, owing to the absence of large friendly fleets, they served advanta- geously the cause of the two peoples [French and Spanish]. These cruisers, in the face of the Anglo-Dutch power, needed good luck, boldness, and skill. These three conditions were not lacking to our seamen ; but then, what chiefs and what captains they had I " ^ The English historian, on the other hand, while admitting how severely the people and commerce of England suffered from the cruisers, bitterly reflecting at times upon the admin- istration, yet refers over and over again to the increasing prosperity of the whole country, and especially of its commer- cial part. In the preceding war, on the contrary, from 1689 to 1697, when France sent great fleets to sea and disputed the supremacy of the ocean, how different the result ! The same English writer says of that time : — * Lapeyrouse-Bonfils : Hist, de la Marine Fran^aise. 134 MILITARY VALUE OF " "With respect to our trade it is certain that we suffered infinitely more, not merely than the French, for that was to be expected from the greater number of our merchant-ships, but than we ever did in any former war. , . . This proceeded in great measure from the vigi- lance of the French, who carried on the war in a piratical way. It is out of all doubt that, taking all together, our traffic suffered exces- sively ; our merchants were many of them ruined." ^ Macaulay says of this period : " During many months of 1693 the English trade with the Mediterranean had been in- terrupted almost entirely. There was no chance that a mer- chantman from London or Amsterdam would, if unprotected, reach the Pillars of Hercules without being boarded by a French privateer ; and the protection of armed vessels was not easily obtained." Why ? Because the vessels of Eng- land's navy were occupied watching the French navy, and this diversion of them from the cruisers and privateers con- stituted the support which a commerce-destroying war must have. A French historian, speaking of the same period in England (1696), says : " The state of the finances was deplora- ble ; money was scarce, maritime insurance thirty per cent, the Navigation Act was virtually suspended, and the English, shipping reduced to the necessity of sailing under the Swedish and Danish flags." ^ Half a century later the French govern- ment was again reduced, by long neglect of the navy, to a cruising warfare. With what results ? First, the French historian says : " From June, 1756, to June, 1760, French pri- vateers captured from the English more than twenty -five hun- dred merchantmen. In 1761, though France had not, so to speak, a single ship-of-the-line at sea, and though the English had taken two hundred and forty of our privateers, their comrades still took eight hundred and twelve vessels. But," he goes on to say, " the prodigious growth of the English shipping explains the number of these prizes." ^ In other words, the suffering involved to England in such numerous ' Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 2 Martin : History of France. ' Martin : History of France. COMMERCE-DESTROYING. 135 captures, which must have caused great individual injury and discontent, did not really prevent the growing prosperity of the State and of the community at large. The English naval historian, speaking of the same period, says : " While the commerce of France was nearly destroyed, the trading-fleet of England covered the seas. Every year her commerce was increasing ; the money which the war carried out was returned by the produce of her industry. Eight thousand merchant vessels were employed by the English merchants." And again, summing up the results of the war, after stating the immense amount of specie brought into the kingdom by for- eign conquests, he says : " The trade of England increased gradually every year, and such a scene of national prosperity, while waging a long, bloody, and costly war, was never before shown by any people in the world." On the other hand, the historian of the French navy, speaking of an earlier phase of the same wars, says : " The English fleets, having nothing to resist them, swept the seas. Our 'privateers and single cruis- ers, having no fleet to keep down the abundance of their ene- mies, ran short careers. Twenty thousand French seamen lay in English prisons." ^ When, on the other hand, in the War of the American Revolution France resumed the policy of Colbert and of the early reign of Louis XIV., and kept large battle-fleets afloat, the same result again followed as in the days of Tourville. " For the first time," says the Annual Register, forgetting or ignorant of the experience of 1693, and remembering only the glories of the later wars, " English merchant-ships were driven to take refuge under foreign flags." 2 Finally, in quitting this part of the subject, it may be remarked that in the island of Martinique the French had a powerful distant dependency upon which to base a cruising warfare ; and during the Seven Years' War, as afterward during the First Empire, it, with Guadeloupe, was the refuge of numerous privateers. " The records of the English admi- ralty raise the losses of the English in the West Indies during the first years of the Seven Years' War to fourteen hundred 1 LapeyrouseBonfils. '^ Annual Reg., voL xxvii. p. 10. 136 MILITARY VALUE OF merchantmen taken or destroyed." The English fleet was therefore directed against tlie islands, both of which fell, in- volving a loss to the trade of France greater than all the dep- redations of her cruisers on the English commerce, besides breaking up the system ; but in the war of 1778 the great fleets protected the islands, which were not even threatened at any time. So far we have been viewing the effect of a purely cruising warfare, not based upon powerful squadrons, only upon that particular part of the enemy's strength against which it is theo- retically directed, — upon his commerce and general wealth ; upon the sinews of war. The evidence seems to show that even for its own special ends such a mode of war is inconclu- sive, worrying but not deadly ; it might almost be said that it causes needless suffering. What, however, is the effect of this policy upon the general ends of the war, to which it is one of the means, and to which it is subsidiary ? How, again, does it react upon the people that practise it ? As the his- torical evidences will come up in detail from time to time, it need here only be summarized. The result to England in the days of Charles II. has been seen, — her coast insulted, her shipping burned almost within sight of her capital. In the War of the Spanish Succession, when the control of Spain was the military object, while the French depended upon a cruis- ing war agamst commerce, the navies of England and Hol- land, unopposed, guarded the coasts of the peninsula, blocked the port of Toulon, forced the French succors to cross the Pyrenees, and by keeping open the sea highway, neutralized the geographical nearness of France to the seat of war. Their fleets seized Gibraltar, Barcelona, and Minorca, and co- operating with the Austrian army failed by little of reducing Toulon. In the Seven Years' War the English fleets seized, or aided in seizing, all the most valuable colonies of France and Spain, and made frequent descents on the French coast. The War of the American Revolution affords no lesson, the fleets being nearly equal. The next most striking instance to Americans is the War of 1812. Everybody knows how our COMMERCE-DESTROYING. 137 privateers swarmed Qver the seas, and that from the smuU- ness of our navy the war was essentially, indeed solely, a cruising" war. Except upon the lakes, it is doubtful if more than two of our ships at any time acted together. The injury done to English commerce, thus unexpectedly attacked by a distant foe which had been undervalued, may be fully con- ceded ; but on the one hand, the American cruisers were powerfully supported by the French fleet, which being assem- bled in larger or smaller bodies in the many ports under the emperor's control from Antwerp to Venice, tied the fleets of England to blockade duty ; and on the other hand, when the fall of the emperor released them, our coasts were insulted in every direction, the Chesapeake entered and controlled, its shores wasted, the Potomac ascended, and Washington burned. The Northern frontier was kept in a state of alarm, though there squadrons, absolutely weak but relatively strong, sus- tained the general defence ; while in the South the Mississippi was entered unopposed, and New Orleans barely saved. When negotiations for peace were opened, the bearing of the English toward the American envoys was not that of men who felt their country to be threatened with an unbearable evil. The late Civil War, with the cruises of the " Alabama " and " Sumter " and their consorts, revived the tradition of com- merce-destroying. In so far as this is one means to a gen- eral end, and is based upon a navy otherwise powerful, it is well ; but we need not expect to see the feats of tliosc ships repeated in the face of a great sea power. In tlie first place, those cruises were powerfully supported by the determination of the United States to blockade, not only the chief centres of Southern trade, but every inlet of the coast, thus leaving few ships available for pursuit ; in the second place, had there been ten of those cruisers where there was one, they would not have stopped the incursion in Southern waters of the Union fleet, which penetrated to every point accessible from the sea ; and in the third place, the undeniable injury, direct and indirect, inflicted upon individuals and upon one branch of the nation's industry (and how high that shipping 138 POWER OF GREAT NAVIES. industry stands in the writer's estimation need net be re- peated), did not in the least influence or retard the event of the war. Such injuries, unaccompanied by others, are more irritating than weakening. On the other hand, will any refuse to admit that the work of the great Union fleets powerfully modified and hastened an end which was probably inevita- ble in any case ? As a sea power the South then occupied the place of France in the wars we have been considering, while the situation of the North resembled that of England; and, as in France, the sufferers in the Confederacy were not a class, but the government and the nation at large. It is not the taking of individual ships or convoys, be they few or many, that strikes down the money power of a nation ; it is the possession of that overbearing power on the sea which drives the enemy's flag from it, or allows it to appear only as a fugitive ; and which, by controlling the great common, closes the highways by which commerce moves to and from the enemy's shores. This overbearing power can only be exer- cised by great navies, and by them (on the broad sea) less efficiently now than in the days when the neutral flag had not its present immunity. It is not unlikely that, in the event of a war between maritime nations, an attempt may be made by the one having a great sea power and wishing to break down its enemy's commerce, to interpret the phrase " effective blockade " in the manner that best suits its interests at the time ; to assert that the speed and disposal of its ships make the blockade effective at much greater distances and with fewer ships than formerly. The determination of such a ques- tion will depend, not upon the weaker belligerent, but upon neutral powers ; it will raise the issue between belligerent and neutral rights; and if the belligerent have a vastly overpower- ing navy he may carry his point, just as England, when pos- sessing the mastery of the seas, long refused to admit the doctrine of the neutral flag covering the goods. CHAPTER III. War of England axd France in Alliance against the United Provinces, 1C72-1G74. — Finally, of France against Combined Europe, 1G74-1678. — Sea Battles of Solebay, the Texel, and Stromboli. SHORTLY before the conclusion of the Peace of Breda, Louis XIV. made his first step toward seizing parts of the Spanish Netherlands and Tranche Comt^. At the same time that his armies moved forward, he sent out a State paper setting forth his claims upon the territories in question. This paper showed unmistakably the ambitious character of the young king, roused the anxiety of Europe, and doubtless increased the strength of the peace party in England. Under the leader- ship of Holland, but with the hearty co-operation of the Eng- lish minister, an alliance was formed between the two countries and Sweden, hitherto the friend of France, to check Louis' advance before his power became too great. The attack first on the Netherlands in 1667, and then on Franche Comte in 1668, showed the hopeless weakness of Spain to defend her possessions ; they fell almost without a blow. The policy of the United Provinces, relative to the claims of Louis at this time, was summed up in the phrase that " France Avas good as a friend, but not as a neighbor." They were unwilling to break their traditional alliance, but still more unwilling to have her on their border. The policy of the Eng- lish people, though not of their king, turned toward the Dutch. In the increased greatness of Louis they saw danger to all Europe ; to themselves more especially if, by a settled prepon- derance on the continent, his hands were free to develop his sea power. " Flanders once in the power of Louis XIV.," wrote the 140 • TRIPLE ALLIANCE BETWEEN English ambassador Temple, " the Dutch feel that their coun- try will be only a maritime province of France ; " and shar- ing that opinion, " he advocated the policy of resistance to the latter country, whose domination in the Low Countries he con- sidered as a threatened subjection of all Europe. He never ceased to represent to his government how dangerous to Eng- land would be the conquest of the sea provinces by France, and he urgently pointed out the need of a prompt understand- ing with the Dutch. ' This would be the best revensce,' said he, ' for the trick France has played us in involving us in the last war with the United Provinces.' " These considerations brought the two countries together in that Triple Alliance with Sweden which has been mentioned, and which for a time checked the onward movement of Louis. But the wars be- tween the two sea nations were too recent, the humiliation of England in the Thames too bitter, and the rivalries that still existed too real, too deeply seated in the nature of things, to make that alliance durable. It needed the dangerous power of Louis, and his persistence in a course threatening to both, to weld the union of these natural antagonists. This was not to be done without another bloody encounter. Louis was deeply angered at the Triple Alliance, and his wrath was turned mainly upon Holland, in which from the necessities of her position he recognized his most steadfast opponent. For the time, however, he seemed to yield ; the more readily because of the probable approaching failure of the Spanish royal line, and the ambition he had of getting more than merely the territory lying to the east of France, when the throne became vacant. But, though he dissembled and yielded, from that time he set his mind upon the destruc- tion of the republic. This policy was directly contrary to that laid down by Bichelieu, and to the true welfare of France. It was to England's interest, at least just then, that the United Provinces should not be trodden down by France ; but it was much more to the interest of France that they should not be subjected to England. England, free from the continent, might stand alone upon the seas contending with EXGLAXD, HOLLAND, AND SWEDEN. 141 France ; but France, hampered by her continental politics, could not hope to "wrest the control of the seas from Eng- land without an ally. This ally Louis proposed to destroy, and he asked England to help him. The final result is already known, but the outlines of the contest must now be followed. Before the royal purpose had passed into action, and while there was still time to turn the energies of France into an- other channel, a different course was proposed to the king. This was the project of Leibnitz, before s{)oken of, which has special interest for our subject because, in proposing to re- verse the lines which Louis then laid down, to make conti- nental expansion secondary and growth beyond the sea the primary object of France, the tendency avowedly and necessa- rily was to base the greatness of the country upon the control of the sea and of commerce. The immediate object offered to the France of that day, Avith the attainment of which, how- ever, she could not have stopped short, was the conquest of Egypt ; that country which, facing both the Mediterranean and Eastern seas, gave control of the great commercial route which in our own day has been completed by the Suez Canal. That route had lost much of its value by the discovery of the way round the Cape of Good Hope, and yet more by the un- settled and ])iratical conditions of the seas through which it lay ; but with a really strong naval power occupying the key of the position it might have been largely restored. Such a power posted in Egypt would, in the already decaying condi- tion of the Ottoman Empire, have controlled the trade not only of India and the far East, but also of the Levant ; but the enterprise could not liave stopped there. The necessity of mastering the Mediterranean and opening the Red Sea, closed to Christian vessels by Mohammedan bigotry, would have compelled the occupation of stations on either side of Egypt ; and France would have been led step by step, as England has been led by the possession of India, to the seizure of points like Malta, Cyprus, Aden, in short, to a great sea power. That is clear now : but it will be interestino; to hear the arguments 142 PROPOSITION OF LEIBNITZ. by which Leibnitz sought to convince the French king two hundred years ago. After pointing out the weakness of the Turkish Empire, and the readiness with which it might be further embarrassed by stirring up Austria and Poland, the latter the traditional ally of France ; after showing that France had no armed enemy in the Mediterranean, and that on the other side of Egypt she would meet the Portuguese colonies, longing to obtain protec- tion against the Dutch in India, the memorial proceeds : — " The conquest of Egypt, that Holland of the East, is infinitely easier than that of the United Provinces. France needs peace in the west, war at a distance. War with Holland will probably ruin the new Indian companies as well as the colonies and commerce lately revived by France, and will increase the burdens of the people while diminishing their resources. The Dutch will retire into their mari- time towns, stand there on the defensive in perfect safety, and assume the offensive on the sea with great chance of success. If France does not obtain a complete victory over them, she loses all her influ- ence in Europe, and by victory she endangers that influence. In Egypt, on the contrary, a repulse, almost impossible, will be of no great consequence, and victory will give the dominion of the seas, the commerce of the East and of India, the preponderance in Chi'istendom, and even the empire of the East on the ruins of the Ottoman power. The possession of Egypt opens the way to conquests worthy of Alexander ; the extreme weakness of the Orientals is no longer a secret. Whoever has Egypt will have all the coasts and islands of the Indian Ocean. It is in Egypt that Holland will be conquered ; it is there she will be despoiled of what alone renders her prosperous, the treasures of the East. She will be struck without being able to ward off the blow. Should she wish to oppose the designs of France upon Egypt, she would be overwhelmed with the universal hatred of Christians ; attacked at home, on the contrary, not only could she ward off the aggression, but she could avenge herself sustained by universal public opinion, which suspects the views of France of ambition." ^ The memorial had no effect. " All that the efforts of am- bition and human prudence could do to lay the foundations for the destruction of a nation, Louis XIV. now did. Diplo- 1 Martin : History of Trance. BARGAINS BETWEEN LOUIS AND CHARLES. 143 matic strategy on a vast scale was displayed in order to isolate and hem in Holland. Louis, wlio had been unaljle to make Europe accept the conquest of Belgium ])y France, now hoped to induce it to sec witliout trembling the fall of Holland." His efforts were in Ihe main successful. The Triple Alliance was broken ; the King of England, though contrary to the wishes of his people, made an offensive alliance with Louis ; and Holland, when the war began, found herself without an ally in Europe, except the worn-out kingdom of Spain and the Elector of Brandenburg, then by no means a first-class State. But in order to obtain the help of Charles IL, Louis not only engaged to pay him large sums of money, but also to give to England, from the spoils of Holland and Belgium, Walcheren, Sluys, and Cadsand, and even the islands of Goree and Yoorn ; the control, that is, of the mouths of the great commercial rivers the Scheldt and the Meuse. With regard to the united fleets of the two nations, it was agreed that the officer bear- ing the admiral's flag of England should command in chief. The question of naval precedence was reserved, by not sending the admiral of France afloat ; but it was practically yielded. It is evident that in his eagerness for the ruin of Holland and his own continental aggrandizement Louis was playing directly into England's hand, as to power on the sea. A French historian is justified in saying : " These negotia- tions have been wrongly judged. It has been often repeated that Charles sold England to Louis XIV. This is true only of internal policy. Charles indeed plotted the political and re- ligious subjugation of England with the help of a foreign power ; but as to external interests, he did not sell them, for the greater share in the profit from the ruin of the Dutch was to go to England." ^ During the years preceding the war the Dutch made every diplomatic effort to avert it, but the hatred of Charles and Louis prevented any concession being accepted as final. An English royal yacht was ordered to pass through the Dutch ships-of-war in the Channel, and to fire on them if they did 1 Martin : History of Frauce. 144 WAR OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN not strike their flags. In January, 1G72, England sent an ultimatum, summoning Holland to acknowledge the right of the English crown to the sovereignty of the British seas, and to order its fleets to lower tlieir flags to the smallest English man-of-war ; and demands such as these received the support of a French king. The Dutch continued to yield, but seeing at length that all concessions were useless, they in February ordered into commission seventy-five ships-of-the-line, besides smaller vessels. On tlie 23d of March the English, without declaration of war, attacked a fleet of Dutch merchantmen ; and on the 29th the king declared war. This was followed, April 6th, by the declaration of Louis XIV. ; and on the 28th of the same month he set out to take command in person of his army. The war which now began, including the third and last of the great contests between the English and Dutch upon the ocean, was not, like those before it, purely a sea war ; and it will be necessary to mention its leading outlines on the land also, not only in order to clearness of impression, but also to bring out the desperate straits to which the republic was reduced, and the final deliverance through its sea power in the hands of the great seaman De Ruyter. The naval war differs from those that preceded it in more than one respect ; but its most distinctive feature is that the Dutch, except on one occasion at the very beginning, did not send out their fleet to meet the enemy, but made what may properly be called a strategic use of their dangerous coast and shoals, upon which were based their sea operations. To this course they were forced by the desperate odds under which they were fighting ; but they did not use their shoals as a mere shelter, — the warfare they waged was the defensive- offensive. When the wind was fair for the allies to attack, Ruyter kept under cover of his islands, or at least on ground where the enemy dared not follow ; but when the wind served so that he mltiht attack in his own way, he turned and fell upon them. There are also apparent indications of tactical combinations, on his part, of a higher order than have yet ALLIANCE AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES. I45 been met ; though it is possible that the particular acts re- ferred to, consisting in partial attacks amounting to little more than demonstrations against the French contingent, may- have sprung from political motives. This solution for the undoubted fact that the Dutch attacked the French lightly has not been met with elsewhere by the writer ; but it seems possible that the rulers of the United Provinces may have wished not to increase the exasperation of their most dan- gerous enemy by humiliating his fleet, and so making it less easy to his pride to accept their offers. Tliere is, however, an equally satisfactory military explanation in the supposition that, the French being yet inexperienced, Ruyter thought it only necessary to contain them while falling in force upon the English. The latter fought throughout with their old gallantry, but less than their old discipline ; whereas the attacks of the Dutch were made with a sustained and unani- mous vigor that showed a great military advance. The action of the French was at times suspicious ; it has been alleged that Louis ordered his admiral to economize his fleet, and there is good reason to believe that toward the end of the two years that England remained in his alliance he did do so. The authorities of the United Provinces, knowing that the French fleet at Brest was to join the English in the Thames, made great exertions to fit out their squadron so as to attack the latter before the junction was made ; but the wretched lack of centralization in their naval administration caused this project to fail. The province of Zealand was so back- ward that its contingent, a large fraction of the whole, was not I'eady in time ; and it has been charged that the delay was due, not merely to mismanagement, but to disaffection to the party in control of the government. A blow at the English fleet in its own waters, by a superior force, before its ally arrived, was a correct military conception ; judging from the after-history of this war, it might well have produced a profound effect upon the whole course of the struggle. Ruyter finally got to sea and fell in with the allied fleets, but though 10 146 THE BATTLE OF SOLEBAY. fully intending to fight, fell back before them to his own coast. The allies did not follow him there, but retired, apparently in full security, to South wold Bay, on the east coast of England, some ninety miles north of the mouth of the Thames. There they anchored in three divisions, — two English, the rear and centre of the allied line, to the northward, and the van, com- posed of French ships, to the southward. Ruyter followed them, and on the early morning of June 7, 1672, the Dutch fleet was signalled by a French lookout frigate in the north- ward and eastward ; standing down before a northeast wind for the allied fleet, from which a large number of boats and men were ashore in watering parties. The Dutch order of battle was in two lines, the advanced one containing eighteen ships with fire-ships (Plate IIL, A). Their total force was ninety-one ships-of-the-line ; that of the allies one hundred and one. The wind was blowing toward the coast, which here trends nearly north and south, and the allies were in an awkward posi- tion. They had first to get under way, and they could not fall back to gain time or room to establish their order. Most of the ships cut their cables, and the English made sail on the starboard tack, heading about north-northwest, a course which forced them soon to go about ; whereas the French took the other tack (Plate III., B). The battle began therefore by the separation of the allied fleet. Ruyter sent one division to attack the French, or rather to contain them; for these opponents exchanged only a distant cannonade, although the Dutch, being to windward, had the choice of closer action if they wished it. As their commander, Bankert, was not cen- sured, it may be supposed he acted under orders ; and he was certainly in command a year later, and acting with great judg- ment and gallantry at the battle of the Texel. Meanwhile Ruyter fell furiously upon the two English divisions, and ap- parently with superior forces ; for the English naval historians claim that the Dutch were in the proportion of three to two.^ 1 Ledyard, vol. ii. p. 599 ; Campbell : Lives of the Admirals See also letter of Sir Richard Haddock, Naval Chronicle, vol. xvii. p. 121. ^^^ ^nj^g Hi CQ \ % ^^r, ^%^ %• M ^. m LU r^ O z "^ > ^ K liii to <n « — — ,»'>"' .^^^' ^' CO o X »- o S THE BATTLE OF SOLEBAY. 147 If this can be accepted, it gives a marked evidence of Ruy- ter's high qualities as a general officer, in advance of any other who appears in tliis century. The results of the battle, considered simply as an engage- ment, were indecisive ; both sides lost heavily, but the honors and the substantial advantages all belonged to the Dutch, or rather to De Ruyter. He had outgeneralled the allies by his apparent retreat, and then returning had surprised them wholly unprepared. The false move by which the English, two thirds of the whole, stood to the northward and westward, while the other third, the French, went off to the east and south, separated the allied fleet ; Ruyter threw his whole force into the gap, showing front to the French with a divi- sion probably smaller in numbers, but which, from its position to windward, had the choice of coming to close action or not, while with the remainder he fell in much superior strength upon the English (Plate III., B). Paul Hoste says ^ that Vice- Admiral d'Estr^es, commanding the French, had taken meas- ures for tacking and breaking through the Dutch division opposed to him so as to rejoin the Duke of York, the allied commander-in-chief. It may be so, for D'Estrees was a very brave man, and not enough of a seaman to appreciate the dangers of the attempt ; but no such move was begun, and both the English and Ruyter thought that the French rather avoided than sought close action. Had D'Estrees, however, gone about, and attempted to break through the line of expe- rienced Dutchmen to windward of him with the still raw sea- men of France, the result would have been as disastrous as that which overtook the Spanish admiral at the battle of St. Vincent a hundred and twenty-five years later, when he tried to reunite his broken fleet by breaking through the close order of Jervis and Nelson. (See Plate III., a.) The truth, which gradually da^vns through a mass of conflicting statements, is, that the Duke of York, though a fair seaman and a brave man, was not an able one ; that his fleet was not in good order and was thus surprised ; that his orders beforehand 1 Hoste : Naval Tactics. 148 THE BATTLE OF SOLEBAY. were not so precise as to make the French admiral techni- cally disobedient in taking the opposite tack from the com- mander-in-chief, and so separating the squadrons ; and that Ruyter profited most ably by the surprise which he had him- self prepared, and by the further opportunity given him by the ineptness of his enemies. Unless for circumstances that are not stated, the French admiral took the right tack, with a northeast wind, for it led out to sea and would give room for manoeuvring; had the Duke of York chosen the same, the allied fleet would have gone out together, with only the dis- advantage of the wind and bad order. In that case, however, Ruyter could, and probably would, have done just what he did at the Texel a year later, — check the van, the French, with a small containing force, and fall with the mass of his fleet upon the centre and rear. It is the similarity of his action in both cases, under very different conditions, that proves he intended at Southwold Bay merely to keep the French in check while he destroyed the English. In this battle, called indifferently Southwold Bay and Sole- bay, Ruyter showed a degree of skill combined with vigor which did not appear upon the sea, after his death, until the days of Suffren and Nelson. His battles of the war of 1672 were no "affairs of circumspection," though they were fought circumspectly ; his aim was no less than the enemy's total overthrow, by joining good combinations to fury of attack. At Solebay he was somewhat, tliougli not greatly, inferior to his enemies ; afterward much more so. The substantial results of Solebay fight were wholly favora- ble to the Dutch. The allied fleets were to have assisted the operations of the French army by making a descent upon the coast of Zealand. Ruyter's attack had inflicted an amount of damage, and caused an expenditure of ammunition, which postponed tlie sailing of tlie fleet for a month ; it was a diver- sion, not only important, but vital in the nearly desperate condition to which the United Provinces were reduced ashore. It may be added, as an instructive comment on the tlieory of commerce-destroying, that after this staggering check to the THE FRENCH CAMPAIGN IN HOLLAND. 149 enemy's superior forces, Riiyter met and convoyed safely to port a fleet of Dutch merchantmen. The progress of the land campaign must now be briefly described.^ Early in ^lay the French army in several corps moved forward, passing through the outskirts of the Spanish Xetherlands, and directing their attack upon nolland from the south and east. The republican party which was in power in Holland had neglected the army, and now made the mistake of scattering the force they had among many for- tified towns, trusting that each would do something toward delaying the French. Louis, however, under the advice of Turenne, simply observed the more important places, while the second-rate towns surrendered nearly as fast as they were summoned ; the army of the Provinces, as well as their territory, thus passing rapidly, by fractions, into the power of the enemy. Within a month the French were in the heart of the country, having carried all before them, and with no organized force remaining in their front sufficient of itself to stop them. In the fortnight following the battle of Solebay, terror and disorganization spread throughout the republic. On the 15th of June tlie Grand Pensionary ob- tained permission of the States-General to send a deputation to Louis XIV., begging him to name the terms on which he would grant them peace ; any humiliation to the foreigner was better in the eyes of the politician than to see the oppo- site party, the House of Orange, come into power on his downfall. While negotiations were pending, the Dutch towns continued to surrender ; and on the 20th of June a few French soldiers entered Muyden, the key to Amsterdam. They were only stragglers, though the large body to which they belonged was near at hand ; and the burghers, who had -admitted them under the influence of the panic prevailing throughout the land, seeing that they were alone, soon made them drunk and put them out. The nobler feeling that animated Amsterdam now made itself felt in Muyden ; a body of troops hurried up from the capital, and the smaller city was saved. " Situated 1 See Map, p. 107. 150 THE FRENCH CAMPAIGN IN HOLLAND. on the Zuj^der Zee, two hours distant from Amsterdam, at the junction of a number of rivers and canals, Mujden not only held the key of the principal dykes by which Amsterdam could surround herself with a protecting inundation, it also held the key of the harbor of this great city, all the ships whicli went from the North Sea to Amsterdam by the Zuyder Zee being obliged to pass under its guns. Aluyden saved and its dykes open, Amsterdam had time to breathe, and remained free to break off her communications by land and to maintain them by sea." ^ It was the turning-point of the invasion ; but what would have been the effect upon the spirit of the Dutch, oppressed by defeat and distracted in council, if in that fateful fortnight which went before, the allied fleet had attacked their coasts ? From this they were saved by the battle of Solebay. Negotiations continued. The burgomasters — the party rep- resenting wealth and commerce — favored submission ; they shrank from the destruction of their property and trade. New advances were made ; but while the envoys were still in the camp of Louis, the populace and the Orange party rose, and with them the spirit of resistance. On the 25th of June Amsterdam opened the dykes, and her example was followed by the other cities of Holland ; immense loss was entailed, but the flooded country and the cities contained therein, standing like islands amid the waters, were safe from attack by land forces until freezing weather. The revolution con- tinued. William of Orange, afterward William HI. of Eng- land, was on the 8th of July made stadtholder, and head of the army and navy ; and the two De Witts, the heads of the republican party, were murdered by a mob a few weeks later. The resistance born of popular enthusiasm and pride of country was strengthened by the excessive demands of Louis XIV. It was plain that the Provinces must conquer or be destroyed. Meanwhile the other States of Europe were wak- ing up to the danger, and the Emperor of Germany, the Elector of Brandenburg, and the King of Spain declared for Holland ; while Sweden, though nominally in alliance with 1 Martin : History of France. NAVAL BATTLES OFF SCIIOXE VELDT. 151 France, was unwilling to see the destruction of the Provinces, because that would be to the advantage of England's sea power. Nevertheless the next year, 1673, opened with prom- ise for France, and the English king was prepared to fulfil his part of the compact on the seas ; but the Dutch, under the firm leadership of William of Orange, and with their hold on the sea unshaken, now refused to accept conditions of peace which had been offered by themselves the year before. Three naval battles were fouglit in 1673, all near the coast of the United Provinces ; the first two, June 7 and June 14, off Schoneveldt, from which place they have taken their name ; the third, known as the battle of the Texel, August 21. In all three Ruyter attacked, choosing his own time, and retir- ing when it suited him to the protection of his own shores. For the allies to carry out their objects and make any diver- sion upon the seaboard, or on the other hand to cripple the sea resources of the hard-pressed Provinces, it was necessary first to deal successfully with Ruyter's fleet. The great ad- miral and his government both felt this, and took the reso- lution that "the fleet should be posted in the passage of Schoneveldt, or a little farther south toward Ostend, to ob- serve the enemy, and if attacked, or seeing the enemy's fleet disposed to make a descent upon the shores of the United Provinces, should resist vigorously, by opposing his designs and destroying his ships," ^ From this position, with good lookouts, any movement of the allies would be known. The English and French put to sea about the 1st of June, under the command of Prince Rupert, first cousin to the king, the Duke of York having been obliged to resign his office on account of the passage of the Test Act, directed against persons of the Roman Catholic faith holding any public employment. The French were under Vice- Admiral d'Estrees, the same who had commanded them at Solcbay. A force of six thousand English troops at Yarmouth was ready to embark if De Ruyter was worsted. On the 7tli of June the Dutch were made out, riding within the sands at Schoneveldt. ^ Brandt : Life of De Ruvter. 152 THE BATTLE OF THE TEXEL. A detached squadron was sent to draw tliera out, but Ruyter needed no invitation ; the wind served, and he followed the detached squadron with such impetuosity as to attack before the allied line was fairly formed. On this occasion the French occupied the centre. The affair was indecisive, if a battle can be called so in which an inferior force attacks a superior, in- flicts an equal loss, and frustrates the main object of the enemy. A week later Ruyter again attacked, with results which, though indecisive as before as to the particular action, forced tlie allied fleet to return to the English coast to refit, and for supplies. The Dutch in these encounters had fifty- five ships-of-the-line ; their enemies eighty-one, fifty-four of which were English. The allied fleets did not go to sea again until the latter part of July, and this time they carried with them a body of troops meant for a landing. On the 20th of August the Dutch fleet was seen under way between the Texel and the Meuse. Ru- pert at once got ready to fight ; but as the wind was from the northward and westward, giving the allies the weather-gage, and with it the choice of the metliod of attack, Ruyter availed himself of his local knowledge, keeping so close to the beach that the enemy dared not approach, — the more so as it was late in the day. During the night the wind shifted to east-southeast off the land, and at daybreak, to use the words of a French official narrative, the Dutch " made all sail and stood down boldly into action." The allied fleet was to leeward on the port tack, heading about south, — the French in the van, Rupert in the centre, and Sir Edward Spragge commanding the rear. De Ruyter divided his fleet into three squadrons, the leading one of which, of ten or twelve ships only, he sent against the French ; while with the rest of his force he attacked the English in the centre and rear (Plate IV., A, A', A"). If we accept the English estimate of the forces, which gives the Eng- lish sixty ships, the French thirty, and the Dutch seventy, Ruyter's plan of attack, by simply holding the French in check as at Solebay, allowed him to engage the English on CO •■c* a. n UJ x: fi THE BATTLE OF THE TEXEL. 153 equal terms. The battle took on several distinct phases, which it is instructive to follow. M. do Martcl, commanding the van of the French, and consequently the leading sub- division of the allied fleet, was ordered to stretch ahead, go about and gain to windward of the Dutch van, so as to place it between two fires. This he did (B) ; but as soon as Bankert — the same who had manoeuvred so judiciously at Solebay the year before — saw the danger, he put his helm up and ran through the remaining twenty ships of D'Estrees' squadron with his own twelve (C), — a feat as creditable to him as it was discreditable to the French ; and then wearing round stood down to De Ruyter, who was hotly engaged with Rupert (C). He was not followed by D'Estrees, who suf- fered him to carry this important reinforcement to the Dutch main attack undisturbed. This practically ended the French share in the fight. Rupert, during his action with De Ruyter, kept off con- tinually, with the object of drawing the Dutch farther away from their coast, so that if the wind shifted they might not be able to regain its shelter. De Ruyter followed him, and the consequent separation of the centre from the van (B, B') was one of the reasons alleged by D'Estrees for his delay. It does not, however, seem to have prevented Bankert from joining his chief. In the rear an extraordinary action on the part of Sir Edward Spragge increased the confusion in the allied fleet. For some reason this officer considered Tromp, who com- manded the Dutch rear, as his pei'sonal antagonist, and in order to facilitate the latter's getting into action, he hove- to (stopped) the whole English rear to wait for him. This ill-timed point of honor on Spragge's part seems to have sprung from a promise he had made to the king that he would bring back Tromp alive or dead, or else lose his own life. The stoppage, which recalls the irresponsible and insub- ordinate action of the junior Dutch flag-officers in the former war, of course separated the rear (A", B", C"), which also drifted rapidly to leeward, Spragge and Tromp carrying on a 154 THE BATTLE OF THE TEXEL. hot private action on their own account. These two junior admirals souglit each other personally, and the battle be- tween their flags was so severe that Spragge twice had to shift his own to another ship; on the second occasion the boat in which he was embarked was sunk by a shot, and he himself drowned. Rupert, thus forsaken by his van and rear, found himself alone with Ruyter (B') ; who, reinforced by his van, had the address further to cut off the rear subdivision of the allied centre, and to surround the remaining twenty ships with probably thirty or forty of his own (C). It is not creditable to the gunnery of the day that more substantial results did not follow ; but it is to be remembered that all Ruyter's skill could secure, except for probably a very short time, was an action on equal terms with the English ; his total inferi- ority in numbers could not be quite overcome. The damage to the English and Dutch may therefore have been great, and was probably nearly equal. Rupert finally disengaged himself, and seeiug that the English rear (C) was not replying well to its immediate opponents, ran down toward it, Ruyter following him ; the two opposing centres steering pai'allel courses, and within cannon-shot, but by mutual consent, induced perhaps by ammunition running short, refraining from firing. At four p. M. the centres and rears united, and toward five a fresh engagement began, which continued till seven, when Ruyter withdrew, probably because of the approach of the French, who, by their own accounts, rejoined Rupert about that time. This ended the battle, which, like all that preceded it in this w^ar, may be called a drawn fight, but as to which the verdict of the English naval historian is doubtless cor- rect : " The consequences which the Dutch, through the prudence of their admiral, drew from this battle were ex- ceedingly great ; for they opened their ports, which were entirely blocked up, and put an end to all thoughts, by re- moving the possibility, of an invasion." ^ 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. TILE BATTLE OF TLIE TEXEL. 155 The military features of the action have sufficiently ap- peared in the account that has heen given, — the skill of Do Ruyter ; the firmness and promptness of Baukert, first in checking and then in passing through the French division ; the apparent disloyalty or, at the hest, inefficiency of the lat- ter; the insubordination and military blundering of Spragge ; the seeming lack of everything but hard fighting on Rupert's part. The allies indulged in bitter mutual recriminations. Rupert blamed both D'Estrecs and Spragge ; D'Estr^iCs found fault with Rupert for running to leeward ; and D'Estrees' own second, Martel, roundly called his chief a coward, in a letter which earned him an imprisonment in the Bastille. The French king ordered an inquiry by the intendant of the navy at Brest, who made a report ^ upon which the account here given has mainly rested, and which leaves little doubt of the dishonor of the French arms in this battle. " M. d'Estrees gave it to be understood," says the French naval historian, " that the king wished his fleet spared, and that the English should not be trusted. Was he wrong in not relying upon the sincerity of the English alliance, when he was receiving from all quarters warnings that the people and the nobles were murmuring against it, and Charles II. was perhaps alone in his kingdom in wishing it ? " ^ Possibly not ; but he was surely wrong if he wished any military man, or body of men, to play the equivocal part assigned to the French admiral on this day ; the loss of the fleet would have been a lighter disaster. So evident to eye-witnesses was the bad faith or cowardice (and the latter supposition is not admissible), that one of the Dutch seamen, as they discussed among themselves why the French did not come down, said : " You fools ! they have hired the English to fight for them, and all their business here is to see that they earn their wages." A more sober- minded and significant utterance is that with which the in- tendant at Brest ends the official report before mentioned : " It would appear in all these sea-fights Ruyter has never cared to attack the French squadron, and that in this last 1 Troude : Batailles Navales de la France, year 1673. 2 w^ia]^ 156 THE BATTLE OF THE TEXEL. action he had detached ten ships of the Zealand squadron to keep it in play." ^ No stronger testimony is needed to Ruyter's opinion of the inefficiency or faithlessness of that contingent to the allied forces, Another chapter in the history of maritime coalitions was closed, on the 21st of August, 1673, by the battle of the Texel. In it, as in others, were amply justified the words with which a modern French naval officer has stamped them : " United by momentary political interests, but at bot- tom divided to the verge of hatred, never following the same path in counsel or in action, they have never produced good results, or at least results proportioned to the efforts of the powers allied against a common enemy. The navies of France, Spain, and Holland seem, at several distinct times, to have joined only to make more complete the triumph of the British arms." 2 When to this well-ascertained tendency of coalitions is added the equally well known jealousy of every country over the increasing power of a neighbor, and the consequent unwillingness to see such increase obtained by crushing another member of the family of nations, an approach is made to the measure of naval strength required by a State. It is not necessary to be able to meet all others combined, as some Englishmen have seemed to think; it is necessary only to be able to meet the strongest on favor- able terms, sure that the others will not join in destroying a factor in the political equilibrium, even if they hold aloof. England and Spain were allies in Toulon in 1793, when the excesses of Revolutionary France seemed to threaten the social order of Europe ; but the Spanish admiral told the English flatly that the ruin of the French navy, a large part of which was there in their hands, could not fail to be injurious to the interests of Spain, and a part of the French ships was saved by his conduct, which has been justly character- ized as not only full of firmness, but also as dictated by the highest political reason.^ 1 Troude : Batailles Navales de la France, year 1673. 2 Chabaud-Arnault : Revue Mar. et Col. July, 1885. 8 Jurien de la Graviere : Guerres Maritimes. DE RUYTER'S MILITARY CHARACTER. 157 The battle of the Tcxcl, closing the long scries of wars in which the Dutch and English contended on equal terras for the mastery of the seas, saw the Dutch navy in its highest effi- ciency, and its greatest ornament, De Ruyter, at the summit of his glory. Long since old in years, for he was now sixty- six, he had lost none of his martial vigor ; his attack was as furious as eight years before, and his judgment apparently had ripened rapidly through the experience of the last war, for there is far more evidence of plan and military insight than before. To him, under the government of the great Pensionary De TVitt, with whom he was in close sympathy, the increase of discipline and sound military tone now ap- parent in the Dutch navy must have been largely due. He went to this final strife of the two great sea-peoples in the fulness of his own genius, with an admirably tempered instru- ment in liis hands, and with the glorious disadvantage of immbers, to save his country. The mission was fulfilled not by courage alone, but by courage, forethought, and skill. The attack at the Texel was, in its general lines, the same as that at Trafalgar, the enemy's van being neglected to fall on the centre and rear, and as at Trafalgar the van, by fail- ing to do its duty, more than justified the conception; but as the odds against De Ruyter were greater than those against Nelson, so was his success less. The part played by Bankert at Solebay was essentially the same as that of Xelson at St. Vincent, when he threw himself across the path of the Span- ish division with his single ship (see Plate III., c, c') ; but Nelson took his course without orders from Jervis, while Bankert was carrying out Ruyter's plan. Once more, still himself in his bearing, but under sadly altered surroundings, will this simple and heroic man come before us ; and here, in contrast with his glory, seems a proper place to insert a little description by the Comte de Guiche^ of his bearing in the Four Days' Fight, wliich brings out at once the homely and the heroic sides of his character. " I never saw him [during those last three days] other than even- tempered ; and when victory was assured, saying always it was the 1 Me'moires. 158 COALITION AGAINST FRANCE. good God that gives it to us. Amid the disorders of the fleet and the api^earance of loss, he seemed to be moved only by the misfor- tune to his country, but always submissive to the will of God. Finally, it may be said that he has something of the frankness and lack of polisli of our patriarchs ; and, to conclude what I have to say of him, I will relate that the day after the victory I found him sweeping his own room and feeding his chickens." Nine days after the battle of the Texel, on the 30tli of August, 1673, a formal alliance was made between Holland on the one hand, and Spain, Lorraine, and the emperor of Germany on the other, and the French ambassador was dismissed from Vienna. Louis almost immediately offered Holland comparatively moderate terms ; but the United Provinces, with their new allies by their sides and with their backs borne firmly upon the sea which had favored and sup- ported them, set their face steadily against him. In England the clamor of the people and Parliament became louder ; the Protestant feeling and the old enmity to France were daily growing, as was the national distrust of the king. Charles, though he had himself lost none of his hatred of the republic, had to give way. Louis, seeing the gathering storm, made up his mind, by the counsel of Turenne, to withdraw from his dangerously advanced position by evacuating Hol- land, and to try to make peace with the Provinces separately while continuing the war with the House of Austria in Spain and Germany. Thus he returned to Richelieu's policy, and Holland was saved. February 19, 1671, peace was signed' between England and the Provinces. The latter recognized the absolute supremacy of the English flag from Cape Finis- terre in Spain to Norway, and paid a war indemnity. The withdrawal of England, which remained neutral during the remaining four years of the war, necessarily made it less maritime. The King of France did not think his navy, either in numbers or efficiency, able to contend alone with that of Holland ; he therefore withdrew it from the ocean and con- fined liis sea enterprises to the Mediterranean, with one or two half-privateering expeditions to the West Indies. The United Provinces for their part, being freed from danger on the side REVOLT OF SICILY AGAINST SPAIN. 159 of the sea, and not liavino:, except for a short time, any serious idea of operating against the French coast, diminished their own fieets. The war became more and more conti- nental, and drew in more and more the other powers of Europe. Gradually the German States cast their lot with Austria, and on May 28, 1674, the Diet proclaimed war against France. The great work of French policy in the last generations was undone, Austria had resumed her supremacy in Germany, and Holland had not been destroyed. On the Baltic, Denmark, seeing Sweden inclining toward France, hastened to make common cause with the German Empire, sending fifteen thousand troops. There remained in Germany only Bavaria, Hanover, and Wurtemberg faithful still to their French alliance. The land war had thus drawn in nearly all the powers of Europe, and, from the nature of the case, the principal theatre of the conflict was beyond the eastern boundary of France, toward tlie Rhine, and in the Spanish Netherlands ; but while this was raging, a maritime episode was introduced by the fact of Denmark and Sweden being engaged on opposite sides. Of this it will not be neces- sary to speak, beyond mentioning that the Dutch sent a squadron under Trorap to join the Danes, and that the united fleets won a great victory over the Swedes in 1676, taking from them ten ships. It is therefore evident that the sea superiority of Holland detracted greatly from Sweden's value as an ally to Louis XIV. Another maritime strife arose in the Mediterranean by the revolt of the Sicilians against the Spanish rule.^ The help they asked from France was granted as a diversion against Spain, but the Sicilian enterprise never became more than a side issue. Its naval interest springs from bringing Ruyter once more on the scene, and that as the antagonist of Duquesne, the equal, and by some thought even the superior, of Tourville, whose name has always stood far above all others in the French navy of that day. Messina revolted in July, 1674, and the French king at 1 See Map of Mediterranean, p. 15. 160 THE BATTLE OF STROM BOLT. once took it under his protection. The Spanish navy through- out seems to have behaved badly, certainly inefficiently ; and early in 1675 the French were safely established in the city. During the year their naval power in the Mediterranean was much increased, and Spain, unable to defend the island herself, applied to the United Provinces for a fleet, the expenses of which she would bear. The Provinces, " fatigued by the war, involved in debt, suffering cruelly in their commerce, exhausted by the necessity of paying the emperor and all the German princes, could no longer fit out the enormous fleets which they had once opposed to France and England." They however hearkened to Spain and sent De Ruyter, with a squadron of only eighteen ships and four fire-ships. The admiral, who had noted the growth of the French navy, said the force was too small, and departed op[)ressed in spirit, but with the calm resignation which was habitual to him. He reached Cadiz in September, and in the mean time the French had further strengthened themselves by the capture of Agosta, a port commanding the southeast of Sicily. De Ruyter was again delayed by the Spanish government, and did not reach the north coast of the island until the end of December, when head winds kept him from entering the Straits of Messina. He cruised between Messina and the Lipari Islands in a position to intercept the French fleet convoying troops and supplies, which was expected under Duquesne. On the 7th of January, 1676, the French came in sight, twenty ships-of-the-line and six fire-ships ; the Dutch had but nineteen ships, one of which was a Spaniard, and four fire- ships ; and it must be remembered that, although there is no detailed account of the Dutch ships in this action, they were as a rule inferior to those of England, and yet more to those of France. The first day was spent in manoeuvring, the Dutch having the weather-gage ; but during that night, which was squally and drove the Spanish galleys accompanying the Dutch to take refuge under Lipari, the wind shifted, and com- ing out at west-southwest, gave the French the weather-gage K^ K LiJ X u 00 in Ph i^ !:: o o o o ^o ■9 <f ^^^ ^ ^ 0 _l ^ O ^D <oV OMB( N. 8.167 i\ J3 J3 (T < ^ •< 1- "^ ^< ^^ t>9 <7<;? V < < < Ph THE BATTLE OF STROM BOLL Id and the power to attack. Duquesne resolv'ed to use it, and sending the convoy ahead, formed his line on the starboard tack standing south ; the Dutch did the same, and waited for him (Plate V., A, A, A). An emotion of surprise must be felt at seeing the great Dutch admiral surrender the choice of attack on the 7th. At daybreak of that day he saw the enemy and steered for him ; at three p. m., a French account says, he hauled his wind on the same tack as themselves, but out of cannon-shot to windward. How account for the seeming reluctance of the man who three years before had made the desperate attacks of Solebay and the Texel ? His reasons have not been handed down ; it may be that the defensive advantages of the lee-gage had been recognized by this thoughtful seaman, especially when pre- paring to meet, with inferior forces, an enemy of impetuous gallantry and imperfect seamanship. If any such ideas did influence him they were justified by the result. The battle of Stromboli presents a partial anticipation of the tactics of the French and English a hundred years later; but in this case it is the French who seek the weather-gage and attack with fury, while the Dutch take the defensive. The results were very much such as Clerk pointed out to the English in his celebrated work on naval tactics, the accounts here followed being entirely French.^ The two fleets being drawn up in line-of-battle on the star- board tack, heading south, as has been said, De Ruyter awaited the attack which he had refused to make. Being be- tween the French and their port, he felt they must fight. At nine a. m. the French line kept away all together and ran down obliquely upon the Dutch, a manoeuvre difficult to be per- formed with accuracy, and during which the assailant re- ceives his enemy's fire at disadvantage (A', A", A'"). In doing this, two ships in the French van were seriously dis- abled. " M. de la Fayette, in the ' Prudente,' began the action ; but having rashly thrown himself into the midst of the enemy's van, he was dismantled and forced to haul off " (a). 1 LapejTouse, Bonfils : Hist, de la Marine Frannaise. 11 162 THE TACTICS AT STROMBOLI. Confusion ensued in the French line, from the difficult char- acter of the manoeuvre. " Vice-Admiral de Preuilli, com- manding the van, in keeping away took too little room, so that in coming to the wind again, the ships, in too close order, lapped and interfered with one another's fire [A']. The absence of M. de la Fayette from the line threw the ' Parfait ' into peril. Attacked by two ships, she lost her maintopmast and had also to haul off for repairs." Again, the French came into action in succession instead of all together, a usual and almost inevitable result of the manoeuvre in question. " In the midst of a terrible cannonade," that is, after part of his ships were engaged, " Duquesne, commanding the centre, took post on the beam of Ruyter's division." The French rear came into action still later, after the centre (A^', A'"). " Lan- geron and Bethune, commanding leading ships of the French centre, are crushed by superior forces." How can this be, seeing the French had the more ships? It was because, as the narrative tells us, " the French had not yet repaired the disorder of the first movement." However, all at last got into action (B, B, B), and Duquesne gradually restored order. The Dutch, engaged all along the line, resisted everywhere, and there was not one of their ships which was not closely engaged ; more cannot be said for the admiral and captains of the inferior fleet. The remaining part of the fight is not very clearly related. Ruyter is said to have given way con- tinually with his two leading divisions ; but whether this was a confession of weakness or a tactical move does not appear. The rear was separated (C), in permitting which either Euyter or the immediate commander was at fault ; but the attempts made by the French to surround and isolate it failed, probably because of damaged spars, for one French ship did pass entirely around the separated division. The action ended at 4.30 p. m., except in the rear, and the Span- ish galleys shortly after came up and towed the disabled Dutch ships away. Their escape shows how injured the French must have been. The positions, C, C, are intended to show the Dutch rear far separated, and the disorder in CLERK'S NAVAL TACTICS. 1G3 ■which a fleet action under sail necessarily ended from loss of spars. Those who are familiar with Clerk's work on naval tac- tics, published about 1780, will recognize in this account of the battle of Stromboli all the features to which he called the attention of English seamen in his thesis on the methods of action employed by them and their adversaries in and be- fore his time. Clerk's thesis started from the postulate that English seamen and officers were superior in skill or spirit, or both, to the French, and their ships on the whole as fast ; that they were conscious of this superiority and therefore eager to attack, while the French, equally conscious of in- feriority, or for other reasons, were averse to decisive engage- ments. With these dispositions the latter, feeling they could rely on a blindly furious attack by the English, had evolved a crafty plan by which, while seeming to fight, they really avoided doing so, and at the same time did the enemy much harm. This plan was to take the lee-gage, the characteristic of which, as has before been pointed out, is that it is a defen- sive position, and to await attack. The English error, accord- ing to Clerk, upon which the French had learned by experience that they could always count, was in drawing up their line parallel to the enemy, or nearly so, and then keeping away all together to attack, ship for ship, each its opposite in the hostile line. By standing down in this manner the assailant lost the use of most of his artillery, while exposed to the full fire of his opponent, and invariably came up in confusion, be- cause the order of attack was one difficult to maintain at any time, and much more so in the smoke under fire, with torn sails and falling masts. This was precisely the attack made by Duquesne at Stromboli, and it there had precisely the consequences Clerk points out, — confusion in the line, the van arriving first and getting the brunt of the fire of the defence, disabled ships in the van causing confusion in the rear, etc. Clerk further asserts, and he seems to be right, that as the action grew warm, the French, by running off to leeward, in their turn, led the English to repeat the same mode of at- 164 TACTICS OF DUQUESNE AND RUYTER. tack ;i and so we find, at Stromboli, Ruyter giving ground in the same way, though his motive does not appear. Clerk also points out that a necessary corollary of the lee-gage, assumed for tactical reasons, is to aim at the assailant's spars, his motive power, so that his attack cannot be pushed far- ther than the defendant chooses, and at Stromboli the crip- pled condition of the French is evident ; for after Ruyter had fallen to leeward, and could no longer help his separated rear, it was practically unmolested by the French, although none of these had been sunk. While therefore there cannot with certainty be attributed to Ruyter the deliberate choice of the lee-gage, for which there was as yet no precedent, it is evident that he reaped all its benefits, and that the character of the French officers of his day, inexperienced as seamen and of impetuous valor, oiTered just the conditions that gave most advantage to an inferior force standing on the defensive. The qualities and characteristics of the enemy are among the 1 This movement, according to Clerk, was not made by the whole of a French line together, but in a way much more scientific and military. A group of two or three ships withdrew at a time, being covered by the smoke and the con- tinued fire of the rest of their line. In time a second line was partly formed, which in its turn protected the ships which had remained on the first, as they executed the somewhat exposed movement of falling back. In Plan V., Dutch ships at b, b, b, are represented as thus withdrawing. English official reports of the eighteenth century often speak of French ships acting thus; the English oificers attributing to their superior valor a movement which Clerk more plau- sibly considers a skilful military manoeuvre, well calculated to give the defence several opportunities of disabling the assailants as they bore down on a course which impeded the use of their artillery. In 1812 the frigate "United States," commanded by Decatur, employed the same tactics in her fight with the " Mace- donian ; " and the Confederate gunboats at Mobile by the same means inflicted on Farragut's flag-ship the greater part of the heavy loss which she sustained. In its essential features the same line of action can now be followed by a defendant, having greater speed, when the ardor of the attack, or the necessities of the case, force the assailant to a direct approach. An indirect cause of a lee line falling farther to leeward has never been noticed. When a ship in that line (as at c) found itself without an opponent abeam, and its next ahead perhaps heavily engaged, the natural impulse would be to put up the helm so as to l)ring the broadside to bear. This advantage would be gained by a loss of ground to leeward and consequent disorder in the line ; which, if the act were repeated by several ships, could only be restored by the whole line keeping away. DE nUYTER KILLED OFF AGOSTA. 1G5 principal factors wliicli a man of genius considers, and it was to this as much as to any other one trait that Nelson owed his dazzling successes. On the other hand, the French ad- miral attacked in a wholly unscientific manner, ship against ship, without an attempt to concentrate on a part of the enemy, or even trying to keep him in play until the French squadron of eight sliips-of-the-line in Messina, near by, could join. Such tactics cannot be named beside that of Sole- bay or the Texel ; but as Duquesne was the best French officer of the century, with the possible exception of Tour- ville, this battle has a value of its own in the history of tac- tics, and may by no means be omitted. The standing of the commander-in-chief is the warrant that it marks the highest point to which French naval tactics has as yet attained. Before quitting this discussion, it may be noted that the remedy Clerk proposed was to attack the rear ships of the enemy's line, and preferably to leeward ; the remainder of the fleet must then either abandon them or stand down for a general action, which according to his postulate was all that the English seamen desired. After the fight De Ruyter sailed to Palermo, one of his ships sinking on the way. Duquesne Avas joined outside Messina by the French division that had been lying there. The remaining incidents of the Sicilian war are unimportant to the general subject. On the 22d of April, De Ruyter and Duquesne met again off Agosta. Duquesne had twenty-nine ships, the allied Spaniards and Dutch twenty-seven, of which ten were Spanish. Unfortunately the Spaniard commanded in chief, and took the centre of the line with the ships of his country, contrary to the advice of Ruyter, who, know- ing how inefficient his allies were, wished to scatter them through the line and so support them better. Ruyter himself took the van, and the allies, having the wind, attacked : but the Spanish centre kept at long cannon range, leaving the brunt of the battle to fall on the Dutch van. The rear, following the commander-in-chiefs motions, was also but slightly engaged. In this sorrowful yet still glorious fulfil- ment of hopeless duty, De Ruyter, who never before in his 166 ENGLAND BECOMES HOSTILE TO FRANCE. long career had been struck by an enemy's shot, received a mortal wound. He died a week later at Syracuse, and with him passed away the last hope of resistance on the sea. A month later the Spanish and Dutch fleets were attacked at anchor at Palermo, and many of them destroyed ; while a division sent from Holland to reinforce the Mediterranean fleet was met by a French squadron in the Straits of Gib- raltar and forced to take refuge in Cadiz. The Sicilian enterprise continued to be only a diversion, and the slight importance attached to it shows clearly how entirely Louis XIV. was bent on the continental war. How differently would the value of Sicily have impressed him, had his eyes been fixed on Egypt and extension by sea. As the years passed, the temper of the English people became more and more excited against France ; the trade rivalries with Holland seemed to fall into the shade, and it became likely that England, which had entered the war as the ally of Louis, would, before it closed, take up arms against him. Li addi- tion to other causes of jealousy she saw the French navy increased to a number superior to her own. Charles for a while resisted the pressure of Parliament, but in January, 1678, a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, was made between the two sea countries ; the king recalled the English troops which until now had been serving as part of the French army, and when Parliament opened again in Feb- ruary, asked for money to equip ninety ships and thirty thousand soldiers. Louis, who was expecting this result, at once ordered the evacuation of Sicily. He did not fear Eng- land by land, but on the sea he could not yet hold his own against the union of the two sea powers. At the same time he redoubled his attacks on the Spanish Netherlands. As long as there was a hope of keeping the ships of England out of the fight, he had avoided touching the susceptibilities of the English people on the subject of the Belgian sea-coast ; but now that they could no longer be conciliated, he thought best to terrify Holland by the sharpness of his attack in the quarter where she dreaded him most. The United Provinces were in truth the mainspring of the SUFFERINGS OF THE UNITED PROVINCES. 167 coalition. Though among the smallest in extent of the coun- tries arrayed against Louis, they were strungcst in the char- acter and purpose of their ruler, the Prince of Orange, and in the wealth which, while supporting the armies of the con- federates, also kept the poor and greedy German princes faithful to their alliance. Almost alone, by dint of mighty sea power, by commercial and maritime ability, tliey bore the burden of the war ; and though they staggered and com- plained, they still bore it. As in later centuries England, so at the time we are now speaking of Holland, the great sea power, supported the war against the ambition of France ; but her sufferings were great. Her commerce, preyed upon by French privateers, lost heavily ; and there was added an immense indirect loss in the transfer of the carrying-trade between foreign countries, which had contributed so much to' the prosperity of the Dutch. When the flag of England be- came neutral, this rich business went to her ships, which crossed the seas the more securely because of the eager desire of Louis to conciliate the English nation. This desire led him also to make very large concessions to English exigencies in the matter of commercial treaties, undoing much of the work of protection upon which Colbert sought to nourish the yet feeble growth of French sea power. These sops, however, only stayed for a moment the passions which were driving England ; it was not self-interest, but stronger motives, which impelled her to a break with France. Still less was it to the interest of Holland to prolong the war, after Louis showed a wish for peace. A continental war could at best be but a necessary evil, and source of weak- ness to her. The money she spent on her own and the allied armies was lost to her navy, and the sources of her prosperity on the sea were being exhausted. How far the Prince of Orange was justified, by the aims of Louis XIV., in that unyielding attitude of opposition toward him which he always maintained, may be uncertain, and there is here no need to decide the question ; but there can be no doubt that the strife sacrificed the sea power of Holland through sheer 168 PEACE OF NIMEGUEN. exhaustion, and with it destroyed her position among the nations of the world. " Situated between France and Eng- land," says a historian of Holland, " by one or other of them were the United Provinces, after they had achieved their independence of Spain, constantly engaged in wars, which exhausted their finances, annihilated their navy, and caused the rapid decline of their trade, manufactures, and commerce ; and thus a peace-loving nation found herself crushed by the weight of unprovoked and long-continued hostilities. Often, too, the friendship of England was scarcely less harmful to Holland than her enmity. As one increased and the other lessened, it became the alliance of the giant and the dwarf." ^ Hitherto we have seen Holland the open enemy or hearty rival of England ; henceforward she appears as an ally, — in both cases a sufferer from her smaller size, weaker numbers, and less favored situation. The exhaustion of the United Provinces and the clamor of their merchants and peace party on the one hand, aided on the other by the sufferings of France, the embarrassment of her finances, and the threatened addition of England's navy to her already numerous enemies, inclined to peace the two principal parties to this long war. Louis had long been will- ing to make peace with Holland alone ; but the States had been withheld, at first by fidelity to those who had joined them in their hour of trouble, and latterly by the firm pur- pose of William of Orange. Difficulties were gradually smoothed away, and the Peace of Nimeguen between the United Provinces and France was signed August 11, 1678. The other powers shortly afterward acceded to it. The principal suf^^erer, as was natural, was the overgrown but feeble monarchy whose centre was Spain, which gave up to France Franche Comte and a number of fortified towns in the Spanish Netherlands, thus extending the boundaries of France to the east and northeast. Holland, for whose de- struction Louis began the war, lost not a foot of ground in Europe ; and beyond the seas only her colonies on the west ^ Davies : History of Holland. EFFECTS UPON FRANCE OF THE WAR. 169 coast of Africa and in Guiana, She owed her safety at first, and the final successful issue, to her sea power. That de- livered her in the hour of extreme danger, and enabled her afterward to keep alive the general war. It may be said to have been one of the chief factors, and inferior to no other one singly, in determining the event of the great war which was formally closed at Nimeguen. The effort none the less sapped her strength, and being followed by many years of similar strain broke her down. But what was the effect upon the vastly greater state, the extreme ambition of whose king was the principal cause of the exhausting wars of this time ? Among the many activi- ties which illustrated the brilliant opening of the reign of the then youthful king of France, none was so important, none so intelligently directed, as those of Colbert, who aimed first at restoring the finances from the confusion into which they had fallen, and then at establishing them upon a firm foundation of national wealth. This wealth, at that time utterly beneath the possibilities of France, was to be developed on the lines of production encouraged, trade stimulated to healthful ac- tivity, a large merchant shipping, a great navy, and colonial extension. Some of these are sources, others the actual con- stituents, of sea power ; which indeed may be said in a sea- board nation to be the invariable accompaniment, if it be not the chief source, of its strength. For nearly twelve years all went well ; the development of the greatness of France in all these directions went forward rapidly, if not in all with equal strides, and the king's revenues increased by bounds. Then came the hour in which he had to decide whether the exertions which his ambition naturally, perhaps properly, prompted should take the direction which, while imposing great efforts, did nothing to sustain but rather hindered the natural activities of his people, and broke down commerce by making control of the sea uncertain ; or whether he should launch out in pursuits which, while involving expense, would keep peace on his borders, lead to the control of the sea, and by the impulse given to trade, and all upon which trade de- 170 EFFECTS UPON FRANCE OF THE WAR. pends, would bring in money nearly if not quite equal to that which the State spent. This is not a fanciful picture ; by his attitude toward Holland, and its consequences, Louis gave the first impulse to England upon the path which realized to her, within his own day, the results which Colbert and Leibnitz had hoped for France. He drove the Dutch carry- ing-trade into the ships of England ; allowed her to settle peacefully Pennsylvania and Carolina, and to seize New York and New Jersey ; and he sacrificed, to gain her neutrality, the growing commerce of France. Not all at once, but very rapidly, England pressed into the front place as a sea power ; and however great her sufferings and the sufferings of individual Englishmen, it remained true of her that even in war her prosperity was great. Doubtless France could not forget her continental position, nor wholly keep free from continental wars ; but it may be believed that if she had chosen the path of sea power, she might both have escaped many conflicts and borne those that were unavoid- able with greater ease. At the Peace of Nimeguen the injuries were not irreparable, but " the agricultural classes, commerce, manufactures, and the colonies had alike been smitten by the war ; and the conditions of peace, so advan- tageous to the territorial and military power of France, were much less so to manufactures, the protective tariffs having been lowered in favor of England and Holland," ^ the two sea powers. The merchant shipping was stricken, and the splendid growth of the royal navy, that excited the jealousy of England, was like a tree without roots ; it soon withered away under the blast of war. Before finally quitting this war with Holland, a short notice of the Comte d'Estrees, to whom Louis committed the charge of the French contingent of the allied fleet, and who com- manded it at Solebay and the Texel, will throw some light upon the qualifications of the French naval officers of the day before experience had made seamen of many of them. D'Es- trees went to sea for the first time in 1667, being then a man 1 Martin ; History of France. NOTICE OF THE COMTE D'ESTR^ES. 171 of mature years ; but in 1672 we find him in the chief com- mand of an important squadron, liaving under him Duquesne, who was a seaman, and had been so for nearly forty years. In 1677, D'Estrees obtained from the king a body of eight ships which he undertook to maintain at his own expense, upon the condition of receiving half the prizes made. With this squadron he made an attack upon the then Dutch island of Tobago, with a recklessness which showed that no lack of courage prompted his equivocal conduct at the Texel. The next year he went out again and contrived to run the whole squadron ashore on the Aves Islands. The account given by the flag-captain of this transaction is amusing as well as instructive. In his report he says : — " The day that the squadron was lost, the sun having been taken by the pilots, the vice-admiral as usual had them put down the posi- tion in his cabin. As I was entering to learn what was going on, I met the third pilot, Bourdaloue, who was going out crying. I asked him what the matter was, and he answered : ' Because I find more drift than the other pilots, the admiral is threatening me and abusing me, as usual ; yet I am only a poor lad who does the best he can.' When I had entered the cabin, the admiral, who was very angry, said to me, ' That scoundrel of a Bourdaloue is always coming to me with some nonsense or other ; I will drive him out of the ship. He makes us to be running a course, the devil knows where, I don't.' As I did not know which was right," says the captain of the ship, rather naively, " I did not dare to say anything for fear of bringing down a like storm on my own head." ^ Some hours after this scene, which, as the French oflRcer from whom the extract is taken says, "appears now almost grotesque, but which is only an exact portrayal of the sea manners of the day, the whole squadron was lost on a group of rocks known as the Aves Islands. Such were the officers." The flag-captain, in another part of his report, says : " The shipwreck resulted from the general line of conduct held by Vice-Admiral d'Estr(ies. It was always the opinion of his servants, or others than the proper officers of the ship, which 1 Gougeard : Mariue de Guerre. 172 NOTICE OF THE COMTE D'ESTRMES. prevailed. This manner of acting may be understood in tlie Comte d'Estrees, wlio, without tlie necessary knowledge of a profession he had embraced so late, always had with him obscure counsellors, in order to appropriate the opinions they gave him so as to blind the ship's company as to his capacity." ^ D'Estrees had been made vice-admiral two years after he first went aboard ship. 1 Troude : Batailles Navales. CHAPTER IV. English Revolution. — War of the League of Augsburg, 1688- 1697. — Sea Battles of Beachy Head and La Hougue. ''P^IIE Peace of Nimeguen was followed by a period of ten -^ years in which no extensive war broke out. They were, however, far from being years of political quiet. Louis XIY. was as intent upon pushing on his frontiers to the east- ward in peace as in war, and grasped in quick succession fragments of territory which had not been given him by the peace. Claiming this and that in virtue of ancient feudal ties ; this and that other as implicitly surrendered by the treaty, because dependent upon something else that had been explicitly surrendered ; purchasing at one time, using bare force in other cases, and backing up all the so-called peaceful methods of obtaining his asserted rights by the presence of armed power, he carried on this process of extension between 1679 and 1682. The aggression most startling to Europe, and above all to the German Empire, was the seizure of the then imperial city of Strasburg on the 30th of September, 1681 ; and on the, same day Casale, in Italy, was sold to him by the Duke of Mantua, showing that his ambitions were directed that way as well as to the north and east. Both of these were positions of great strategic importance, threaten- ing, the one Germany, the other Italy, in case of war. The excitement throughout Europe was very great ; in every direction Louis, serenely trusting to his power, was making new enemies and alienating former friends. The king of Sweden, directly insulted, and injured in his duchy of Deux-Ponts, turned against him, as did the Italian States; and the Pope himself sided with the enemies of a king 174 AGGRESSIONS OF LOUIS XIV. who was already showing his zeal for the conversion of the Protestants, and was preparing for the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. But the discontent, though deep and general, had to be organized and directed ; the spirit necessary to give it form and final effective expression was found again in Holland, in William of Orange. Time, however, was needed to mature the work. " No one yet armed himself ; but every one talked, wrote, agitated, from Stockholm to Madrid. . . . The war of the pen preceded by many years the war of the sword ; incessant appeals were made to Euro- pean opinion by indefatigable publicists ; under all forms was diffused the terror of the New Universal Monarchy," which was seeking to take the place once filled by the House of Austria. It was known that Louis sought to make himself or his son emperor of Germany. But complications of differ- ent kinds, private interests, lack of money, all combined to delay action. The United Provinces, despite William's wishes, were yet unwilling to act again as banker for a coalition, and the emperor was so threatened on his eastern frontier by the rebel Hungarians and the Turks that he dared not risk a western war. Meanwhile the armed navy of France was daily growing in strength and efficiency under Colbert's care, and acquiring the habit of war by attacks upon the Barbary pirates and their ports. During the same years the navies both of Eng- land and of Holland were declining in numbers and efficiency. It has already been said that in 1688, when William needed Dutch ships for his expedition to England, it was objected that the navy was in a far different condition from 1672, " being incalculably decreased in strength and deprived of its most able commanders." In England, the decline of discipline had been followed by an economical policy as to material, grad- ually lessening the numbers and injuring the condition of the fleet ; and after the little flare-up and expected war with France in 1678, the king gave the care of the navy to a new body of men, concerning whom an English naval historian savs : " This new administration lasted five years, and if ACCESSION OF JAMES II. 175 it had continued five years longer would in all probability have remedied even the numerous and mighty evils it had introduced, by wearing out the whole royal navy, and so leaving no room for future mistakes. However, a just sense of this induced the king, in 1684, to resume the management of the fleet into his own hands, restoring most of the old officers ; but before any great progress in the work of res- toration could be made, his Majesty died,"^ — in 1685. The change of sovereigns was of vast importance, not merely to the English navy, but from the ultimate effect it was to have upon the designs of Louis XIV. and the fortune of the gen- eral war which his aggressions were preparing. James II. was peculiarly interested in the navy, being himself a sea- man, and having commanded in chief at Lowestoft and South- wold Bay. He knew its actual depressed condition ; and the measures he at once took to restore it, both in numbers and efficiency, were thoughtful and thorough. In the three years of his reign y^ry much indeed was done to prepare a weapon which was first proved against himself and his best friend. The accession of James II., which promised fairly for Louis, precipitated the action of Europe against him. The House of Stuart, closely allied to the King of France, and sympathizing with his absolutist rule, had used the still great power of the sovereign to check the political and re- ligious enmity of the English nation to France. James II. added to the same political sympathies a strength of Roman Cathoh'c fervor which led him into acts peculiarly fitted to revolt the feeling of the English people, with the final result of driving him from the throne, and calling to it, by the voice of Parliament, his daughter Mary, whose husband was William of Orange. In the same year that James became king, a vast diplo- matic combination against France began. This movement had two sides, religious and political. The Protestant States were enraged at the increasing persecutions of the French 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 176 LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. Protestants, and their feelings became stronger as the policy of James of England showed itself more and more bent toward Rome. The Protestant northern States, Holland, Sweden, and Brandenburg, drew together in alliances ; and they counted for support upon the Emperor of Austria and Germany, upon Spain and other Roman Catholic States whose motives were political apprehension and anger. The emperor had latterly been successful against the Turks, thus freeing his hands for a move against France. July 9, 1686, there was signed at Augsburg a secret agreement between the emperor, the kings of Spain and Sweden, and a number of German princes. Its object was at first defensive only against France, but it could readily be turned into an of- fensive alliance. This compact took the name of the League of Augsburg, and from it the general war which followed two years later was called tlie War of the League of Augsburg. The next year, 1687, saw yet greater successes of the Empire over the Turks and Hungarians. It was evident that France could expect no more from diversions in that quarter. At the same time the discontent of the English and the ambitions of the Prince of Orange, who hoped from his accession to the throne of England no ordinary personal aggrandizement, but the fulfilment of his strongest politi- cal wish and conviction, in curbing forever the power of Louis XIV., became more and more plain. But for his expedition into England, William needed ships, money, and men from the United Provinces ; and they hung back, know- ing tliat the result would be war with the French king, who proclaimed James his ally. Their action was at last decided by the course of Louis, who chose this moment to revoke concessions made at Nimeguen to Dutch trade. The serious injury thus done to Holland's material interests turned the wavering scale. " This violation of the conventions of Nime- guen," says a French historian,^ " by giving a severe blow to Dutch commerce, reducing her European trade more than one fourth, removed the obstacle that religious passions still 1 Martin : History of France. ENGLISH REVOLUTION. 177 encountered in material interests, and put all Holland at the disposition of William, none having reason longer to concili- ate France." This was in November, 1687. In the summer of the following year the birth of an heir to the English throne brought things to an issue. English loyalty might have put up with the reign of the father, now advanced in years, but could not endure the prospect of a continued Roman Catholic royalty. Matters had at last reached the crisis to which they had been tending for years. Louis and William of Orange, long- standing enemies, and at tlie moment the two chief figures in European politics, alike from their own strong personali- ties and the cause which either represented, stood on the brink of great actions, whose effects were to be felt through many generations. William, despotic in temper himself, stood on the shores of Holland looking hopefully toward free England, from which he was separated by the narrow belt of water that was the defence of the island kingdom, and might yet be an impassable barrier to his own high aims ; for the French king at that inoment could control the sea if he would. Louis, holding all the power of France in his single grasp, facing eastward as before, saw the continent gathering against him ; while on his flank was England heartily hostile, longing to enter on the strife against him, but as yet without a leader. It still remained with him to decide whether he would leave the road open for the head to join the waiting body, and to bring Holland and England, the two sea powers, under one rule. If he attacked Holland by land, and sent his superior navy into the Channel, he might well keep William in his own country ; the more so as the English navy, beloved and petted by tbe king, was likely to have more than the usual loyalty of seamen to their chief. Faithful to the bias of his life, perhaps unable to free himself from it, he turned toward the continent, and September 24, 1688, declared war against Germany and moved his armies toward the Rhine. William, overjoyed, saw removed the last ob- stacle to his ambition. Delayed for some weeks by contrary 12 178 V/ILLIAM LANDS IN ENGLAND. winds, he finally set sail from Holland on the 30th of October. More than five hundred transports, with fifteen thousand troops, escorted by fifty men-of-war, formed the expedition ; and it is typical of its mingled political and religious char- acter, that the larger part of the army officers were French Protestants who had been driven from France since the last war, the commander-in-chief under William being the Hu- guenot Schomberg, late a marshal of France. The first start was foiled by a violent storm ; but sailing again on the 10th of November, a fresh, fair breeze carried the ships through the Straits and the Channel, and William landed on the 15th at Torbay. Before the end of the year, James had fled from his kingdom. On the 21st of the following April, William and Mary were proclaimed sovereigns of Great Britain, and Eng- land and Holland were united for the war, which Louis had declared against the United Provinces as soon as he heard of William's invasion. During all the weeks that the expedi- tion was preparing and delayed, the French ambassador at the Hague and the minister of the navy were praying the king to stop it with his great sea power, — a power so great that the French fleet in the first years of the war outnum- bered those of England and Holland combined ; but Louis would not. Blindness seems to have struck the kings of England and France alike ; for James, amid all his apprehen- sions, steadily refused any assistance from the French fleet, trusting to the fidelity of the English seamen to his person, although his attempts to have Mass celebrated on board the ships had occasioned an uproar and mutiny which nearly ended in the crews throwing the priests overboard. France thus entered the War of the League of Augsburg without a single ally. " What her policy had most feared, what she had long averted, was come to pass. England and Holland were not only allied, but united under the same chief ; and England entered the coalition with all the eager- ness of passions long restrained by the Stuart policy." As regards the sea war, the different battles have much less tactical value than those of De Ruyter. The chief points WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 179 of strategic interest are the failure of Louis, having a de- cided superiority at sea, properly to support James 11. in Ireland, which remained faithful to him, and the gradual disappearance from the ocean of the great French fleets, which Louis XIV. could no longer maintain, owing to the expense of that continental policy which he had chosen for himself. A third point of rather minor interest is the pe- culiar character and large proportions taken on by the commerce-destroying and privateering warfare of the French, as their large fleets were disappearing. This, and the great effect produced by it, will appear at first to contradict what has been said as to the general inadequacy of such a warfare when not supported by fleets ; but an examination of the conditions, which will be made later on, will show that the contradiction is rather apparent than real. Taught by the experience of the last conflict, the chief effort of the French king, in the general war he had brought upon himself, should have been directed against the sea pow- ers, — against William of Orange and the Anglo-Dutch alli- ance. The weakest point in William's position was L-eland ; though in England itself not only were there many parti- sans of the exiled king, but even those who had called in William fenced his kingship about with jealous restrictions. His power was not secure so long as Ireland was not sub- dued. James, having fled from England in January, 1G89, landed in Ireland in the following March, accompanied by French troops and a French squadron, and was enthusias- tically welcomed everywhere but in the Protestant Xorth. He made Dublin his capital, and remained in the country until July of the next year. During these fifteen months the French were much superior at sea ; they landed troops in Ireland on more than one occasion ; and the English, at- tempting to prevent this, were defeated in the naval battle of Bantry Bay.^ But although James was so well estab- lished, and it was of the utmost importance to sustain him ; although it was equally important to keep William from get- 1 See Map of English Channel, etc., p. 107. 180 OPERATIONS IN IRELAND. ting a foothold till James was further strengthened and Lon- donderry, then passing through its famous siege, reduced ; and although the French were superior to the united Eng- lish and Dutch on the seas in 1689 and 1690 ; nevertheless, the English admiral Rooke was able, unmolested, to throw succors and troops into Londonderry, and afterward landed Marshal Schomberg, with a small army, near Carrickfergus. Rooke stopped intercourse between Ireland and Scotland, where were many Stuart partisans, and then with his small squadron passed along the east coast of Ireland, attempted to burn the shipping in Dublin harbor, failing only through lack of wind, and finally came off Cork, then occupied by James, took possession of an island in the harbor, and re- turned in safety to the Downs in October. These services, which raised the siege of Londonderry and kept open the com- munications between England and Ireland, extended through- out the summer months ; nor was any attempt made by the French to stop them. There can be little doubt than an effective co-operation of the French fleet in the summer of 1689 would have broken down all opposition to James in Ireland, by isolating that country from England, with cor- responding injury to William's power. The following year the same strategic and political mis- take was made. It is the nature of an enterprise such as James's, dependent upon a weaker people and foreign help, to lose strength if it does not progress; but the chances were still in his favor, provided France co-operated heartily, and above all, with her fleet. It is equally the nature of a merely military navy like that of France to be strongest at the begin- ning of hostilities ; whereas that of the allied sea powers grew daily stronger, drawing upon the vast resources of their mer- chant shipping and their wealth. The disparity of force was still in favor of France in 1690, but it was not as great as the year before. The all-important question was where to direct it. There were two principal courses, involving two views of naval strategy. The one was to act against the allied fleet, whose defeat, if sufficiently severe, might involve the fall of WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 181 "William's throne in England ; the other was to make the fleet subsidiary to tlie Irish campaign. The French king decided upon the former, which was undoubtedly the proper course ; but there was no reason for neglecting, as he did, the impor- tant duty of cutting off the communications between the two islands. As early as March he had sent a large fleet with six thousand troops and supplies of war, which were landed with- out any trouble in the southern ports of Ireland ; but after performing that service, the ships employed returned to Brest, and there remained inactive during May and June while the grand fleet under the Comte de Tourville was assembling. During those two months the English were gathering an army on their west coast, and on the 21st of June, William em- barked his forces at Chester on board two hundred and eighty- eight transports, escorted by only six men-of-war. On the 24th he landed in Carrickfergus, and the ships-of-war were dismissed to join the English grand fleet, which, however, they were not able to do; Tourville's ships having in the mean time got to sea and occupied the channel to the east- ward. There is nothing more striking than the carelessness shown by both the contending parties, during the time that Ireland was in dispute, as to the communications of their opponents with the island ; but this was especially strange in the French, as they had the larger forces, and must have re- ceived pretty accurate information of what was going on from disaffected persons in England. It appears that a squadron of twenty-five frigates, to be supported by ships-of-the-line, were told off for duty in St. George's Channel ; but they never reached their station, and only ten of the frigates had got as far as Kinsale by the time James had lost all at the battle of the Boyne. The English communications were not even threatened for an hour. Tourville's fleet, complete in numbers, having seventy-eight ships, of which seventy were in the line-of-battle, with twenty- two fire-ships, got to sea June 22, the day after William cm- barked. On the 30th the French were off the Lizard, to the dismay of the English admiral, who was lying off the Isle 182 BATTLE OF BE ACHY HEAD. of Wight in such an unprepared attitude that he had not even lookout ships to the westward. He got under way, standing off-shore to the southeast, and was joined from time to time, during the next ten days, by other English and Dutcli ships. The two fleets continued moving to the eastward, sighting each other from time to time. The political situation in England was critical. The Jaco- bites were growing more and more open in their demonstra- tions, Ireland had been in successful revolt for over a year, and William was now there, leaving only the queen in Lon- don. The urgency of the case was such that the council decided the French fleet must be fought, and orders to that effect were sent to the Euglish admiral, Herbert. In obedi- ence to his instructions he went out, and on the 10th of July, being to windward, with the wind at northeast, formed his line- of-battle, and then stood down to attack the French, who waited for him, with their foretopsails aback ^ on the star- board tack, heading to the northward and westward. The fight that followed is known as the battle of Beachy Head. The ships engaged were, French seventy, English and Dutch according to their own account fifty-six, according to the French sixty. In the allied line of battle the Dutch were in the van ; tlie English, commanded in person by Herbert, in the centre ; and the rear was made up partly of English and partly of Dutch ships. The stages of the battle were as follows : — 1. The allies, being to windward, bore down together in line abreast. As usual, this manoeuvre was ill performed, and as also generally happens, the van came under fire be- fore the centre and rear, and bore the brunt of the injury. 2. Admiral Herbert, though commander-in-chief, failed to attack vigorously with the centre, keeping it at long range. The allied van and rear came to close action (Plate VI., A). Paul Hoste's ^ account of this manceuvre of the allies is that the admiral intended to fall mainly on the French rear. To that end he closed the centre to the rear and kept it to wind- ^ That is, nearly motionless. 2 jjoste : Naval Tactics. • v„ ■* lU -\, ^ ^ ^ .tf> ^ ^ < > o 1 ! ^ >? ^ n: — 1 1 O l^ I :£ -1 o UJ O t- tr Z 3 ^ . - (D ~> U.

If that were his purpose, his plan, though tolerably conceived in the main, was faulty in detail, for this manccuvre of the centre left a great gap between it and the van. He should rather have attacked, as Ruyter did at the Texel, as many of the rear ships as he thought he could deal with, and refused his van, assigning to it the part of checking the French van. It may be conceded that an admiral who, from inferior numbers, can- not spread as long and close a line as his enemy, should not let the latter overlap the extremities of his fleet ; but he should attain his end not, as Herbert did, by leaving a great opening in the centre, but by increasing each interval between the ships refused. The allied fleet was thus exposed to be doubled on at two points, both van and centre ; and both points were attacked. 3. The commander of the French van, seeing the Dutch close to his line and more disabled than himself, pressed six of his leading ships ahead, where they went about, and so put the Dutch between two fires (Plate YI. B). At the same time Tourville, finding himself without adver- saries in the centre, having beaten off the leading division of the enemy's centre, pushed forward his own leading ships, which Herbert's dispositions had left without opponents ; and these fresh ships strengthened the attack upon the Dutch in the van (B). This brought about a melee at the head of the lines, in which the Dutch, being inferior, suffered heavily. Luckily for the allies the wind fell calm ; and while Tourville him- self and other French ships got out their boats to tow into action again, the allies were shrewd enough to drop anchor with all sail set, and before Tourville took in the situation the ebb-tide, setting southwest, had carried his fleet out of action. He finally anchored a league from his enemy. At nine P. M., when the tide changed, the allies weighed and stood to the eastward. So badly had many of them been 184 SLUGGISH PURSUIT BY THE FRENCH. mauled, that, by English accounts, it was decided rather to destroy the disabled ships than to risk a general engagement to preserve them. Tourville pursued ; but instead of ordering a general chase, he kept the line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the slower ships. The occasion was precisely one of those in which a melee is permissible, indeed, obligatory. An enemy beaten and in flight should be pursued with ardor, and with only so much regard to order as will prevent the chas- ing vessels from losing mutual support, — a condition which by no means implies such relative bearings and distances as are required in the beginning or middle of a well-contested action. The failure to order such general pursuit indicates the side on which Tourville's military character lacked completeness ; and the failure showed itself, as is apt to be the case, at the supreme moment of his career. He never had such another opportunity as in this, the first great general action in which he commanded in chief, and which Hoste, who was on board the flag-ship, calls the most complete naval victory ever gained. It was so indeed at that time, — the most complete, but not the most decisive, as it perhaps might have been. The French, according to Hoste, lost not even a boat, much less a ship, which, if true, makes yet more culpable the sluggishness of the pursuit; while the allies fled, casting sixteen of their ships ashore and burning them in sight of the enemy, who pursued as far as the Downs. The English indeed give the allied loss as only eight ships, — an estimate probably full as much out one way as the French the other. Herbert took his fleet to the Thames, and baffled the enemy's further pursuit by remov- ing the buoys.^ Tourville's is the only great historical name among the seamen of this war, if we except the renowned privateersmen at whose head was Jean Bart. Among the English, extraor- dinary merit cannot be claimed for any one of the gallant and enterprising men who commanded squadrons. Tourville, ^ Ledyard says the order to remoA-e the buoys was not carried out (Naval History, vol. ii. p. 636). TOURVILLE'S MILITARY CHARACTER. 185 who by this time had served afloat for nearly thirty years, was at once a seaman and a military man. With su[)erb courage, of which he had given dazzling examples in his youth, he had seen service wherever the French fleets had fought, — in the Anglo-Dutch war, in the Mediterranean, and against the Barbary pirates. Reaching the rank of admiral, he commanded in person all the largest fleets sent out during the earlier years of this war, and he brought to the command a scientific knowledge of tactics, based upon both theory and experience, joined to that practical acquaintance with the seaman's business which is necessary in order to apply tac- tical principles upon the ocean to the best advantage. But with all these high qualities he seems to have failed, where so many warriors fail, in the ability to assume a great re- sponsibility.^ The caution in his pursuit of tlie allies after Beachy Head, though so different in appearance, came from the same trait which impelled him two years later to lead his fleet into almost certain destruction at La Hougue, be- cause he had the king's order in his pocket. He was brave enough to do anything, but not strong enough to bear the heaviest burdens. Tourville was in fact the forerunner of the careful and skilful tacticians of the coming era, but with the savor still of the impetuous hard-fighting which characterized the sea commanders of the seventeenth cen- tury. He doubtless felt, after Beachy Head, that he had done very well and could be satisfied ; but he could not have acted as he did had he felt, to use Nelson' s words, that " if we had taken ten ships out of the enemy's eleven, and let the eleventh escape, being able to take her, I could never call such a good day." The day after the sea fight off Beachy Head, with its great but still partial results, the cause of James IT. was lost ashore in Ireland. The army which William had been allowed to transport there unmolested was superior in number and quality to that of James, as William himself was superior as a leader 1 Seignelay, the French minister of marine of the day, called him " poltron de tete, mais pas de cuiur." 186 CAMPAIGN IN IRELAND. to the ex-king. The counsel of Louis XIY. was that James should avoid decisive action, retiring if necessary to the Shan- non, in the midst of a country wholly devoted to him. It was, however, a good deal to ask, this abandonment of the capital after more than a year's occupancy, with all the consequent moral effect; it would have been much more to the purpose to stop William's landing. James undertook to cover Dublin, taking up the line of the river Boyne, and there on the lltli of July the two armies met, with the result that James was wholly defeated. The king himself fled to Kinsale, where he found ten of those frigates that had been meant to control St. George's Channel. He embarked, and again took refuge in France, begging Louis to improve the victory at Beachy Head by landing him with another French army in England itself. Louis angrily refused, and directed that the troops still remaining in Ireland should be at once withdrawn. The chances of a rising in favor of James, at least upon the shores of the Channel, if they existed at all, were greatly exaggerated by his own imagination. After the safe retreat of the allied fleet to the Thames, Tourville, in accordance with his instructions, made several demonstrations in the south of England ; but they were wholly fruitless in drawing out any show of attachment to the Stuart cause. In Ireland it was different. The Irish army with its French contingent fell back, after the battle of the Boyne, to the Shannon, and there again made a stand ; while Louis, receding from his first angry impulse, continued to send reinforcements and supplies. But the increasing urgency of the continental war kept him from affording enough support, and the war in Ireland came to a close a little over a year later, by the defeat at Aghrim and capitulation of Limerick. The battle of the Boyne, which from its peculiar religious coloring has obtained a somewhat factitious celebrity, may be taken as the date at which the English crown was firmly fixed on William's head. Yet it would be more accurate to say that the success of William, and with it the success of WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 187 Europe against Louis XIV. in the War of the League of Augs- burg, was due to the mistakes and failure of the French naval campaign in 1690 ; though in that campaign was won the most conspicuous single success the French have ever gained at sea over the English. As regards the more strik- ing military operations, it is curious to remark that Tourville sailed the day after William left Chester, and won Beachy Head the day before the battle of the Boyne ; but the real failure lay in permitting William to transport that solid body of men without hindrance. It might have been favorable to French policy to let him get into Ireland, but not with such a force at his back. The result of the Irish campaign w^as to settle William safely on the English throne and estab- lish the Anglo-Dutch alliance ; and the union of the two sea peoples under one crown was the pledge, through their commercial and maritime ability, and the wealth they drew from the sea, of the successful prosecution of the war by their allies on the continent. The year 1691 M^as distinguished by only one great mari- time event. This was ever afterward known in France as Tourville's " deep-sea " or " ofT-shore " cruise ; and the mem- ory of it as a brilliant strategic and tactical display remains to this day in the French navy. That staying power, which has already been spoken of as distinctive of nations whose sea power is not a mere military institution, but based upon the character and pursuits of the people, had now come into play with the allies. Notwithstanding the defeat and loss of Beachy Head, the united fleets took the sea in 1691 with one hundred ships-of-the-line under the command of Admiral Russell. Tourville could only gather seventy -two, the same number as the year before. " With these he left Brest June 25. As the enemy had not yet appeared upon the coasts of the Channel, he took up his cruising ground at the entrance, sending lookout ships in all directions. In- formed that the allies had stationed themselves near the Scilly Islands to cover the passage of a convoy expected from the Levant, Tourville did not hesitate to steer for the English 188 BATTLE OF LA HOUGUE. coasts, where the approaching arrival of another merchant fleet from Jamaica was equally expected. Deceiving the Eng- lish cruisers by false courses, he reached the latter fleet, took from it several ships, and dispersed it before Russell could come up to fight him. When at last Tourville was in pres- ence of the allied fleet, he manoeuvred so skilfully, always keeping the weather-gage, that the enemy, drawn far out into the ocean, lost fifty days without finding an opportunity to engage. During this time French privateers, scattered throughout the Channel, harassed the enemy's commerce and protected convoys sent into Ireland. Worn out by fruit- less efforts, Russell steered for the Irish coast. Tourville, after having protected the return of the French convoys, anchored again in Brest Roads." Tlie actual captures made by Tourville's own fleet were insignificant, but its service to the commerce-destroying war- fare of the French, by occupying the allies, is obvious ; never- theless, the loss of English commerce was not as great tliis year as the next. The chief losses of the allies seem to have been in the Dutch North Sea trade. The two wars, continental and maritime, that were being waged, though simultaneous, were as yet independent of each other. It is unnecessary in connection with our subject to mention the operations of the former. In 1692 there oc- curred the great disaster to the French fleet which is known as the battle of La Hougue. In itself, considered tactically, it possesses little importance, and the actual results have been much exaggerated ; but popular report has made it one of the famous sea battles of the world, and therefore it can- not be wholly passed by. Misled by repoi-ts from England, and still more by the rep- resentations of James, who fondly nursed his belief that the attachment of many English naval officers to his person was greater than their love of country or faithfulness to their trust, Louis XIV. determined to attempt an invasion of the south coast of England, led by James in person. As a first step thereto, Tourville, at the head of between fifty and sixty BATTLE OF LA HOUGUE. 189 ships-of-tlic-line, thirteen of which were to come from Toulon, was to engage the English fleet ; from which so many deser- tions were expected as would, with the consequent demorali- zation, yield the French an easy and total victory. The first hitch was in the failure of the Toulon fleet, delayed by con- trary winds, to join ; and Tourvillc went to sea with only forty-four ships, but with a peremptory order from the king to fight when he fell in witli the enemy, were they few or many, and come what might. On the 29th of May, Tourville saw the allies to the north- ward and eastward ; they numbered ninety-nine sail-of-the- line. The wind being southwest, he had the choice of en- gaging, but first summoned all the flag-officers on board his own ship, and put the question to them whether he ought to fight. They all said not, and he then handed them the order of the king.^ No one dared dispute that ; though, had they known it, light vessels with contrary orders were even then searching for the fleet. The other officers then returned to their ships, and the whole fleet kept away together for the allies, who waited for them, on the starboard tack, heading south-southeast, the Dutch occupying the van, the English the centre and rear. When they were within easy range, the French hauled their wind on the same tack, keeping the weather-gage. Tourville, being so inferior in numbers, could not wholly avoid the enemy's line extending to the rear of 1 The author has followed in the text the traditional and generally accepted account of Tourville's orders and the motives of his action. A French writer, M. de Crisenoy, in a very interesting paper upon the secret history preceding and accompanying the event, traverses many of these traditional statements. According to him, Louis XIV. was not under any illusion as to the loyalty of the English officers to their flag ; and the instructions given to Tourville, while peremptory under certain conditions, did not compel him to fight in the situa- tion of the French fleet on the day of the hattle. The tone of the instructions, however, implied dissatisfaction with the admiral's action in previous cruises, probably in the pursuit after Beachy Head, and a consequent doubt of his vigor in the campaign then beginning. Mortification therefore impelled him to the desperate attack on the allied fleet ; and, according to M. de Crisenoy, the coun- cil of war in the admiral's cabin, and the dramatic production of the king's orders, had no existence in fact. 190 DESTRUCTION OF FRENCH SHIPS. his own, which was also necessarily weak from its extreme length ; but he avoided Herbert's error at Beachy Head, keeping his van refused with long intervals between the ships, to check the enemy's van, and engaging closely with his centre and rear QPlate YP. A, A, A). It is not neces- sary to follow the phases of this unequal fight ; the extraor- dinary result was that when the firing ceased at night, in consequence of a thick fog and calm, not a single French ship had struck her colors nor been sunk. No higher proof of military spirit and efficiency could be given by any navy, and Tourville's seamanship and tactical ability contributed largely to the result, whicli it must also be confessed was not creditable to the allies. The two fleets anchored at night- fall (B, B, B), a body of English ships (B') remaining to the southward and westward of the French. Later on, these cut their cables and allowed themselves to drift through the French line in order to rejoin their main body ; in doing w^hich they were roughly handled. Having amply vindicated the honor of his fleet, and shown the uselessness of further fighting, Tourville now tliought of retreat, which was begun at midnight witli a light northeast wind and continued all the next day. The allies' pursued, the movements of the French being much embarrassed by the crippled condition of the flag-ship " Royal Sun," the finest ship in the Frencli navy, which the admiral could not make up his mind to destroy. The direction of tlie main retreat was toward the Channel Islands, thirty-five ships being with the admiral ; of them twenty passed with the tidal current through the dangerous passage known as the Race of Alder- ney, between the island of that name and the mainland, and got safe to St. Malo. Before the remaining fifteen could follow, tlie tide changed ; and the anchors which had been dropped dragging, these ships were carried to the eastward and to leeward of the enemy. Three sought refuge in Cher- bourg, which had then neither breakwater nor port, the re- maining twelve at Cape La Hougue ; and they were all burned either by their own crews or by the allies. The WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 101 French thus lost fifteen of the finest ships in their navy, the least of which carried sixty guns ; but this was little more than the loss of the allies at Beachy Head. The impression made upon the public mind, accustomed to the glories and successes of Louis XIV., was out of all proportion to the results, and blotted out the memory of the splendid self- devotion of Tourvillc and his followers. La Hougue was also the last general action fought by the French fleet, which did rapidly dwindle away in the following years, so that this disaster seemed to be its death-blow. As a matter of fact, however, Tourville w^ent to sea the next year with seventy ships, and the losses were at the time repaired. The decay of the French navy was not due to any one defeat, but to the exhaustion of France and the great cost of the continental war ; and this war was mainly sustained by the two sea peoples whose union was secured by the success of William in the Irish campaign. Without asserting that the result would have been different had the naval operations of France been otherwise directed in 1690, it may safely be said that their misdirection was the immediate cause of things turning out as they did, and the first cause of the decay of the French navy. The five remaining years of the War of the League of Augsburg, in which all Europe was in arms against France, are marked by no great sea battles, nor any single maritime event of the first importance. To appreciate the effect of the sea power of the allies, it is necessary to sum up and condense an account of the quiet, steady pressure which it brought to bear and maintained in all quarters against France. It is thus indeed that sea power usually acts, and just because so quiet in its working, it is the more likely to be unnoticed and must be somewhat carefully pointed out. The head of the opposition to Louis XIY. was William III., and his tastes being military rather than naval combined with the direction of Louis' policy to make the active war continental rather than maritime ; while the gradual with- drawal of the great French fleets, by leaving the allied 192 ACTION OF THE ALLIED NAVIES. navies without enemies on the sea, worked in the same way. Furthermore, the efficiency of the English navy, which was double in numbers that of the Dutch, was at this time at a low pitch; the demoralizing effects of the reign of Charles IT. could not be wholly overcome during the three years of his brother's rule, and there was a yet more serious cause of trouble growing out of the political state of England. It has been said that James believed the naval officers and seamen to be attached to his person ; and, whether justly or unjustly, this thought was also in the minds of the present rulers, causing doubts of the loyalty and trustworthiness of many officers, and tending to bring confusion into the naval administration. We are told that " the complaints made by the merchants were extremely well supported, and showed the folly of preferring unqualified men to that board which directed the naval power of England ; and yet the mischief could not be amended, because the more experienced people who had been long in the service were thought disaffected, and it appeared the remedy might have proved worse than the disease." ^ Suspicion reigned in the cabinet and the city, factions and irresolution among the officers ; and a man who was unfortunate or incapable in action knew that the yet more serious charge of treason might follow his mis- adventure. After La Hougue, the direct military action of the allied navies was exerted in three principal ways, the first being in attacks upon the French ports, especially those in the Channel and near Brest. These had rarely in view more than local injury and the destruction of shipping, particularly in the ports whence the French privateers issued ; and although on some occasions the number of troops embarked was large, William proposed to himself little more than the diversion which such threats caused, by forcing Louis to take troops from the field for coast defence. It may be said generally of all these enterprises against the French coast, in this and later wars, that they effected little, and even as a diversion 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 193 did not weaken the French armies to any great extent. If the French ports had been less well defended, or French water-ways open into the heart of the country, like our own Chesapeake and Delaware bays and the Southern sounds, the result might have been different. In the second place, the allied navies were of great direct military value, though they fought no battles, when Louis XIY. decided in 1694 to make his war against Spain offensive. Spain, though so weak in herself, was yet troublesome from her position in the rear of France; and Louis finally con- cluded to force her to peace by carrying the war into Cata- lonia, on the northeast coast. The movement of his armies was seconded by his fleet under Tourville ; and the reduction of that difficult province went on rapidly until the approach of the allied navies in largely superior force caused Tourville to retire to Toulon. This saved Barcelona ; and from that time until the two sea nations had determined to make peace, they kept their fleets on the Spanish coast and arrested the French advance. When, in 1697, "William had become dis- posed to peace and Spain refused it, Louis again invaded, the allied fleet did not appear, and Barcelona fell. At the same time a French naval expedition was successfully di- rected against Cartagena in South America, and under the two blows, both of which depended upon the control of the sea, Spain yielded. Tlie third military function of the allied navies was the protection of their sea commerce ; and herein, if history may be trusted, they greatly failed. At no time has war against commerce been conducted on a larger scale and with greater results than during this period ; and its operations were widest and most devastating at the very time that the great French fleets were disappearing, in the years immediately after La Hougue, apparently contradicting the assertion that such a warfare must be based on powerful fleets or neighboring seaports. A somewhat full discussion is due, inasmuch as the distress to commerce wrought by the pri- vateers was a large factor in bringing the sea nations to wish 13 194 COMMER CE-DES TR 0 YING. for peace ; just as the subsidies, which their commerce en- abled them to pay the continental armies, besides keeping up their own, were tlie chief means by which the war was pro- longed and France brought to terms. The attack and defence of commerce is still a living question. In the first place it is to be observed that the decay of the French fleet was gradual, and that the moral effect of its ap- pearance in the Channel, its victory at Beachy Head, and gal- lant conduct at La Hougue remained for some time impressed on the minds of the allies. This impressicm caused their ships to be kept together in fleets, instead of scattering in pur- suit of the enemy's cruisers, and so brought to the latter a support almost equal to an active warfare on the seas. Again, the efficiency of the English navy, as has been said, was low, and its administration perhaps worse ; while treason in England gave the French the advantage of better information. Thus in the year following La Hougue, the French, having received accurate information of a great convoy sailing for Smyrna, sent out Tourville in May, getting him to sea before the allies were ready to blockade him in Brest, as they had intended. This delay was due to bad administration, as was also the further misfortune that the English government did not learn of Tourville's departure until after its own fleet had sailed with the trade. Tourville surprised tlie convoy near the Straits, destroyed or captured one hundred out of four hundred ships, and scattered the rest. This is not a case of simple cruising warfare, for Tourville's fleet was of seventy-one ships ; but it shows the incompetency of the English administration. In truth, it was immediately after La Hougue that the depre- dations of cruisers became most ruinous ; and the reason was twofold : first, the allied fleet was kept together at Spithead for two months and more, gathering troops for a landing on the continent, thus leaving the cruisers unmolested ; and in the second place, the French, not being able to send their fleet out again that summer, permitted the seamen to take service in private ships, thus largely increasing the num- bers of the latter. The two causes working; together gave WAR OF THE LEAGUE OF AUGSBURG. 195 an impunity and extension to commerce-destroying which caused a tremendous outcry in England. " It must be con- fessed," says the English naval chronicler, "that our commerce suffered far less the year before, when the French were masters at sea, than in this, when their grand fleet was blocked up in port." But the reason was that the French having little commerce and a comparatively large number of seamen, mainly employed in the fleet, were able, when this lay by, to release them to cruisers. As the pressure of the war became greater, and Louis continued to reduce the number of his ships in commission, another increase was given to the commerce-destroyers. " The ships and officers of the royal navy were loaned, under certain conditions, to private firms, or to companies who wished to undertake privateering enterprises, in which even the cabinet ministers did not disdain to take shares ; " indeed, they were urged to do so to please the king. The conditions generally pro- vided that a certain proportion of the profits should go to the king, in return for the use of the ships. Such employ- ment would be demoralizing to any military service, but not necessarily all at once ; and the conditions imparted for the time a tone and energy to privateering that it cannot always have. In truth, the public treasury, not being able to main- tain the navy, associated with itself private capital, risking only material otherwise useless, and looking for returns to rob- bing the enemy. The commerce-destroying of this war, also, was no mere business of single cruisers ; squadrons of three or four up to half a dozen ships acted together under one man, and it is only just to say that under seamen like Jean Bart, Forbin, and Duguay-Trouin, they were even more ready to fight than to pillage. The largest of these private expeditions, and the only one that went far from the French shores, was directed in 1697 against Cartagena, on the Spanish Main. It numbered seven ships-of-the-line and six frigates, besides smaller vessels, and carried twenty-eight hundred troops. The chief object was to lay a contribution on the city of Cartagena ; but its effect on the policy of Spain was marked. 196 EFFECTS OF SEA POWER. and led to peace. Such a temper and concert of action went far to supply the place of supporting fleets, but could not wholly do so ; and although the allies continued to keep their large fleets together, still, as the war went on and efficiency of administration improved, commerce-destroying was brought within bounds. At the same time, as an evidence of how much the unsupported cruisers suffered, even under these favorable conditions, it may be mentioned that the English report fifty-nine ships-of-war captured against eighteen ad- mitted by the French during the war, — a difference which a French naval historian attributes, with much probability, to the English failing to distinguish between ships-of-war properly so called, and those loaned to private firms. Cap- tures of actual privateers do not appear in the list quoted from. " The commerce-destroying of this war, therefore, was marked by the particular characteristics of cruisers acting together in squadron, not far from their base, while the enemy thought best to keep his fleet concentrated elsewhere ; not- withstanding which, and the bad administration of the Eng- lish navy, the cruisers were more and more controlled as the great French fleets disappeared." The results of the war of 1689-1697 do not therefore vitiate the general conclusion that " a cruising, commerce-destroying warfare, to be destructive, must be seconded by a squadron warfare, and by divisions of ships-of-the-line; which, forcing the enemy to unite his forces, permit the cruisers to make fortunate attempts upon his trade. Without such backing the result will be simply the capture of the cruisers." Toward the end of this war the real ten- dency was becoming manifest, and was still more plainly seen in the next, when the French navy had sunk to a yet lower state of weakness. Notwithstanding their losses, the sea nations made good their cause. The war, which began with the French taking the offensive, ended by reducing them everywhere to the defensive, and forced Louis to do violence at once to his strongest prejudices and his most reasonable political wishes, by recognizing as king of England him whom he looked upon PEACE OF RYSWICK, I97 as a usurper as well as his own inveterate enemy. On its surface, and taken as a whole, this war will appear almost wholly a land struggle, extending from the Spanish Nether- lands down the line of the Rhine, to Savoy in Italy and Catalonia in Spain. The sea fights in the Channel, the Irish struggle receding in the distance, look like mere episodes ; while the underlying action of trade and commerce is wholly disregarded, or noticed only as their outcries tell of their sufferings. Yet trade and shipping not only bore the burden of suffering, but in the main paid the armies that were fight- ing the French ; and this turning of the stream of wealth from both sea nations into the coffers of their allies was perhaps determined, certainly hastened, by the misdirection of that naval supremacy with which France began the war. It was then possible, as it will usually be possible, for a really fine military navy of superior force to strike an overwhelming blow at a less ready rival ; but the opportunity was allowed to slip, and the essentially stronger, better founded sea power of the allies had time to assert itself. The peace signed at Ryswick in 1697 was most disadvanta- geous to France ; she lost all that had been gained since the Peace of Nimeguen, nineteen years before, with the single important exception of Strasburg. All that Louis XIY. had gained by trick or force during the years of peace was given up. Immense restitutions were made to Germany and to Spain. In so far as the latter were made in the Netherlands, they were to the immediate advantage of the United Provinces, and indeed of all Europe as well as of Spain. To the two sea nations the terms of the treaty gave commercial benefits, which tended to the increase of their own sea power and to the consequent injury of that of France. France had made a gigantic struggle ; to stand alone as she did then, and as she has since done more than once, against all Europe is a great feat. Yet it may be said that as the United Provinces taught the lesson that a nation, however active and enterprising, cannot rest upon external resources alone, if intrinsically, weak in numbers and territory, so 198 CONDITION OF FRANCE. France in its measure shows that a nation cannot subsist in- definitely off itself, however powerful in numbers and strong in internal resources. It is said that a friend once found Colbert looking dreamily from his windows, and on questioning him as to the subject of his meditations, received this reply : " In contemplating the fertile fields before my eyes, I recall those which I have seen elsewhere ; what a rich country is France ! " This con- viction supported him amid the many discouragements of his official life, when struggling to meet the financial difficulties arising from the extravagance and wars of the king ; and it has been justified by the whole course of the nation's history since his days. France is rich in natural resources as well as in tlie industry and thrift of her people. But neither indi- vidual nations nor men can thrive when severed from natural intercourse with their kind ; whatever the native vigor of con- stitution, it requires healthful surroundings, and freedom to draw to itself from near and from far all that is conducive to its growth and strength and general welfare. Not only must the internal organism work satisfactorily, the processes of decay and renewal, of movement and circulation, go on easily, but, from sources external to themselves, both mind and body must receive healthful and varied nourishment. With all her natural gifts France wasted away because of the want of that lively intercourse between the different parts of her own body and constant exchange with other people, w^hich is known as commerce, internal or external. To say that war was the cause of these defects is to state at least a partial truth ; but it does not exhaust the matter. War, with its many acknowl- edged sufferings, is above all harmful when it cuts a nation off from others and throws it back upon itself. There may indeed be periods when such rude shocks have a bracing effect, but they are exceptional, and of short duration, and they do not invalidate the general statement. Such isolation was the lot of France during the later wars of Louis XIV., and it well- nigh destroyed her ; whereas to save her from the possibility of such stagnation was the great aim of Colbert's life. CONDITION OF FRANCE. I99 War alone could not entail it, if only war could be post- poned until the processes of circulation within and without the kingdom were established and in vigorous operation. They did not exist when he took office ; they had to be both created and firmly rooted in order to withstand the blast of war. Time was not given to accomplish this great work, nor did Louis XIV. support the schemes of his minister by turning the budding energies of his docile and devoted subjects into paths favor- able to it. So when the great strain came upon the powers of the nation, instead of drawing strength from every quar- ter and through many channels, and laying the whole outside world under contribution by the energy of its merchants and seamen, as England has done in like straits, it was thrown back upon itself, cut off from the world by the navies of Eng- land and Holland, and the girdle of enemies which surrounded it upon the continent. The only escape from this process of gradual starvation was by an effectual control of the sea ; the creation of a strong sea power which should insure free play for the wealth of the land and the industry of the people. For this, too, France had great natural advantages in her three seaboards, on the Channel, the Atlantic, and the Mediterra- nean; and politically she had had the fair opportunity of join- ing to her own maritime power that of the Dutch in friendly alliance, hostile or at least wary toward England. In the pride of his strength, conscious of absolute control in his kingdom, Louis cast away this strong reinforcement to his power, and proceeded to rouse Europe against him by repeated aggres- sions. In the period which we have just considered, France justified his confidence by a magnificent, and upon the whole successful, maintenance of his attitude against all Europe ; she did not advance, but neither did she greatly recede. But this display of power was exhausting ; it ate away the life of the nation, because it drew wholly upon itself and not upon the outside world, with which it could have been kept in con- tact by the sea. In the war that next followed, the same energy is seen, but not the same vitality ; and France was everywhere beaten back and brought to the verge of ruin. 200 CONDITION OF FRANCE. The lesson of both is the same ; nations, like men, however strong, decay when cut off from the external activities and resources which at once draw out and support their internal powers. A nation, as we have already shown, cannot live indefinitely off itself, and the easiest way by which it can communicate with other peoples and renew its own strength is the sea. CHAPTER V. "War of the Spanish Succession, 1702-1713. — Sea Battle op Malaga. DURING the last thirty years of the seventeenth century, amid all the strifes of arms and diplomacy, there had been clearly foreseen the coming of an event which would raise new and great issues. This was the failure of the direct royal line in that branch of the House of Austria which was then on the Spanish throne; and the issues to be determined when the present king, infirm both in body and mind, should die, were whether the new monarch was to be taken from the House of Bourbon or from the Austrian family in Germany ; and whether, in either event, the sovereign thus raised to the throne should succeed to the entire inheritance, the Empire of Spain, or some partition of that vast inheritance be made in the interests of the balance of European power. But this balance of power was no longer understood in the narrow sense of continental possessions ; the effect of the new arrangements upon com- merce, shipping, and the control both of the ocean and the Mediterranean, was closely looked to. The influence of the two sea powers and the nature of their interests were becom- ing more evident. It is necessary to recall the various countries that were ruled by Spain at that time in order to understand the strate- gic questions, as they may fairly be called, now to be settled. These were, in Europe, the Netherlands (now Belgium) ; Naples and the south of Italy ; Milan and other provinces in the north ; and, in the Mediterranean, Sicily, Sardinia, and the Balearic Isles. Corsica at that time belonged to Genoa. In the west- ern hemisphere, besides Cuba and Porto Rico, Spain then 202 ^y^i-it OF THE ;sPAyiiiH succession. held all that part of the continent now divided among the Spanish American States, a region whose vast commercial possibilities were coming to be understood ; and in the Asian archipelago there were large possessions that entered less mto the present dispute. The excessive weakness of this empire, owing to the decay of the central kingdom, had hitherto caused other nations, occupied as they were with more immediate interests, to regard with indifference its enormous extent. This indifference could not last when there was a prospect of a stronger administration, backed possibly by alliances with one of tiic great powers of Europe. It would be foreign to our subject to enter into the details of diplomatic arrangement, which, by shifting about peoples and territories from one ruler to anotlier, sought to reach a political balance peacefully. Tbe cardinal points of each nation's policy may be shortly stated. The Spanish cabinet and people objected to any solution which dismembered the empire. The English and tbe Dutch objected to any exten- sion of France in the Spanish Netherlands, and to the mo- nopoly by the French of the trade with Spanish America, both which they feared as the results of placing a Bourbon on the Spanish throne. Louis XIV. wanted Naples and Sicily for one of his sons, in case of any partition ; thus giving France a strong Mediterranean position, but one which would be at the mercy of the sea powers, — a fact which induced William III. to acquiesce in this demand. The Emperor of Austria particularly objected to these Mediterranean positions going away from his family, and refused to come into any of the partition treaties. Before any arrangement was perfected, the actual king of Spain died, but before his death was induced by his ministers to sign a will, bequeathing all his States to the grandson of Louis XIV., then Duke of Anjou, known afterward as Philip V. of Spain. By this step it was hoped to preserve the whole, by enlisting in its defence the nearest and one of the most powerful States in Europe, — near- est, if are excepted the powers ruling the sea, which are always near any country whose ports are open to their ships. LOUIS XIV. INVADES THE NETHERLANDS. 203 Louis XIV. accepted the bequest, and in so doing felt bound in honor to resist all attempts at partition. The union of the two kingdoms under one family promised important advan- tages to France, henceforth delivered from that old enemy in the rear, which had balked so many of her efforts to extend her frontiers eastward. As a matter of fact, from that time, with rare breaks, there existed between the two kingdoms an alliance, the result of family ties, which only the weakness of Spain kept from being dangerous to the rest of Europe. The other countries at once realized the situation, and nothinsr could have saved war but some backward step on the part of the French king. The statesmen of England and Holland, the two powers on whose wealth the threatened war must depend, proposed that the Italian States should be given to the son of the Austrian emperor, Belgium be occupied by themselves, and that the new king of Spain should grant no commercial privileges in the Indies to France above other nations. To the credit of their wisdom it must be said that this compromise was the one which after ten years of war was found, on the whole, best ; and in it is seen the growing sense of the value of extension by sea. Louis, however, would not yield ; on the contrary, he occupied, by connivance of the Spanish governors, towns in the Netherlands which had been held by Dutch troops under treaties with Spain. Soon after, in February, 1701, the English Parliament met, and denounced any treaty which promised France the dominion of the Medi- terranean. Holland began to arm, and tlie Emperor of Austria puvshed his troops into northern Italy, where a campaign fol- lowed, greatly to the disadvantage of Louis. In September of the same year, 1701, the two sea powers and the Emperor of Austria signed a secret treaty, which laid down the chief lines of the coming war, with the ex- ception of that waged in the Spanish peninsula itself. By it the allies undertook to conquer the Spanish Netherlands in order to place a barrier between France and the LTnited Provinces ; to conquer Milan as a security for the emperor's other provinces ; and to conquer Naples and Sicily for the 204 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. same security, and also for the security of the navigation and commerce of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United Provinces. The sea powers should have the right to conquer, for the utility of the said navigation and commerce, the countries and towns of the Spanish Indies ; and all that they should be able to take there should be for them and re- main theirs. The war begun, none of the allies could treat without the others, nor without having taken just measures — first, to prevent the kingdoms of France and Spain from ever being united under the same king ; second, to prevent the French from ever making themselves masters of the Spanish Indies, or from sending ships thither to engage, directly or indirectly, in commerce ; third, to secure to the subjects of his Britannic Majesty and of the United Provinces the com- mercial privileges which they enjoyed in all the Spanish States under the late king. It will be noticed that in these conditions there is no sug- gestion of any intention to resist the accession of the Bourbon king, who was called to the throne by the Spanish govern- ment and at first acknowledged by England and Holland; but, on the other hand, the Emperor of Austria does not withdraw the Austrian claim, which centred in his own person. The voice of the sea powers was paramount in the coalition, as the terms of the treaty safeguarding their commercial interests show, though, as they were about to use German armies for the land war, German claims also had to be considered. As a French historian points out : — " This was really a new treaty of partition. . . . William III., who had conducted all, had taken care not to exhaust England and Holland, in order to restore the Spanish monarchy, intact, to the emperor ; his final condition was to reduce the new king, Philip Y., to Spain jjroper, and to secure to England and Holland at once the commercial use of all the regions that had been under the Spanish monarchy, together with important military and maritime positions against France." ^ But though war was imminent, the countries about to en- gage hesitated. Holland would not move without England, 1 Martin : History of France. DECLARATIONS OF WAR. 205 and despite the strong feeling of the latter country against France, the manufacturers and merchants still remembered the terrible sufferings of the last war. Just then, as the scales were wavering, James II. died. Louis, yielding to a sentiment of sympathy and urged by his nearest intimates, formally rec- ognized the son of James as king of England; and the English people, enraged at what they looked on as a threat and an in- sult, threw aside all merely prudential considerations. The House of Lords declared that " there could be no security till the usurper of the Spanish monarchy was brought to reason;" and the House of Commons voted fifty thousand soldiers and thirty-five thousand seamen, besides subsidies for German and Danish auxiliaries. William III. died soon after, in March, 1702 ; but Queen Anne took up his policy, which had become that of the English and Dutch peoples. Louis XIY. tried to break part of the on-coming storm by forming a league of neutrals among the other German States ; but the emperor adroitly made use of the German feeling, and won to his side the Elector of Brandenburg by acknowledging him as king of Prussia, thus creating a North-German Protes- tant royal house, around which the other Protestant States naturally gathei"cd, and which was in the future to prove a formidable rival to Austria. The immediate result was that France and Spain, whose cause was thenceforth known as that of the two crowns, went into the war without any ally save Bavaria. War was declared in May by Holland against the kings of France and Spain ; by England against France and Spain, Anne refusing to recognize Philip V. even in de- clariug war, because he had recognized James III. as king of England ; while the emperor was still more outspoken, declar- ing against the King of France and the Duke of Anjou. Thus began the great War of the Spanish Succession. It is far from easy, in dealing with a war of such propor- tions, lasting for more than ten years, to disentangle from the general narrative that part which particularly touches our subject, without at the same time losing sight of the relation of the one part to the whole. Such a loss, however, 206 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. is fatal to the end in view, which is not a mere clironicle of naval events, nor even a tactical or strategic discussion of certain naval problems divorced from their surroundings of cause and effect in general liistory, but an appreciation of the effect of sea power upon the general result of the war and upon the prosperity of nations. It will conduce to clearness, however, to point out again that the aim of William III. was not to dispute the claim of Philip V. to the throne, — a matter of comparative indifference to the sea powers, — ^but to seize, to the benefit of their commerce and colonial empire, such portions of the Spanish American possessions as he could, and at the same time to impose such conditions upon the new monarchy as would at least prevent any loss, to English and Dutch commerce, of the privileges they had had under the Austrian line. Such a policy would not direct the main effort of the sea nations upon the Spanish peninsula, but upon America; and the allied fleets might not have entered the Straits. Sicily and Naples were to go, not to England, but to Austria. Subsequent causes led to an entii'e change in this general plan. A new candidate, a son of the Emperor of Germany, was set up in 1703 by the coalition under the name of Carlos III., and the peninsula became the scene of a doubtful and bloody war, keeping the Anglo-Dutch fleets hovering round the coasts ; with the result, as regards the sea powers, that nothing of decisive importance was done in Spanish America, but that England issued from the strife with Gibraltar and Port Mahon in her hands, to be thence- forth a Mediterranean power. At the same time that Carlos III. was proclaimed, a treaty was negotiated with Portu- gal, known as the Methucn Treaty, which gave England the practical monopoly of Portuguese trade, and sent the gold of Brazil by way of Lisbon to London, — an advantage so great that it aided materially in keeping up the war on the continent as well as in maintaining the navy. At the same time the efficiency of the latter so increased that the losses by French cruisers, though still heavy, were at no time unendurable. When the war broke out, in pursuance of the original CAPTURE OF GALLEONS AT VIGO. 207 policy, Sir George Rookc, with a fleet of fifty sliips-of-the- line and transports carrying fourteen thousand troops, was sent against Cadiz, which was the great European centre of the Spanish-American trade ; there came the specie and products of the West, and thence they were dispersed through Europe. It had been the purpose of William III. also to seize Carta- gena, one of the principal centres of the same trade in the other hemisphere ; and to that end, six months before his deathjin September, 1701, he had despatched there a squadron under that traditional seaman of the olden time, Benbow. Benbow fell in with a French squadron sent to supply and strengthen the place, and brought it to action north of Carta- gena ; but though superior in force, the treason of several of his captains, who kept out of action, defeated his purpose, and after fighting till his ship was helpless and he himself had received a mortal wound, the French escaped and Carta- gena was saved. Before his death Benbow received a let- ter from the French commodore to this effect : " Yesterday morning I had no hope but I should have supped in your cabin. As for those cowardly captains of yours, hang them up, for, by God ! they deserve it." And hanged two of them were. Rooke's expedition against Cadiz also failed, as it was nearly certain to do ; for his instructions were so to act as to conciliate the Spanish people and disincline them to the Bourbon king. Such doubtful orders tied his hands ; but after failing there, he learned that the galleons from the West Indies, loaded with silver and merchandise, had put into Yigo Bay under escort of French ships-of-war. He went there at once, and found the enemy in a harbor whose entrance was but three quarters of a mile wide, defended by fortifications and a heavy boom ; but a passage was forced through the boom under a hot fire, the place seized, and all the shipping, with much of the specie, either taken or sunk. This affair, which is known in history as that of the Vigo galleons, was a brilliant and interesting feat of arms, but has no military features calling for mention, except the blow it gave to the finances and prestige of the two crowns. 208 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. The affair at Vigo had, however, important political re- sults, and helped to that change in the general plan of the sea powers which has been mentioned. The King of Por- tugal, moved by fear of the French, had acknowledged Philip V. ; but his heart was against him, for he dreaded French influence and power brought so near his little and isolated kingdom. It had been a part of Rooke's mission to detach him from the alliance of the two crowns ; and the affair of Vigo, happening so near his own frontiers, impressed him with a sense of the power of the allied navies. In truth, Portugal is nearer to the sea than to Spain, and must fall naturally under the influence of the power controlling the sea. Inducements were offered, — by the Emperor of Austria a cession of Spanish territory, by the sea powers a subsidy ; but the king was not willing to declare himself until the Austrian claimant should have landed at Lisbon, fairly com- mitting the coalition to a peninsular as well as a continental war. The emperor transferred his claims to his second son, Charles ; and the latter, after being proclaimed in Vienna and acknowledged by England and Holland, was taken by the allied fleets to Lisbon, where he landed in March, 1704. This necessitated the important change in the plans of the sea powers. Pledged to the support of Carlos, their fleets were thenceforth tied to the shores of the peninsula and the protection of commerce ; while the war in the West Indies, becoming a side issue on a small scale, led to no results. From this time on, Portugal was the faithful ally of England, whose sea power during this war gained its vast preponder- ance over all rivals. Her ports were the refuge and support of English fleets, and on Portugal was based in later days the Peninsular war with Napoleon. In and through all, Portugal, for a hundred years, had more to gain and more to fear from England than from any other power. Great as were the effects of the maritime supremacy of the two sea powers upon the general result of the war, and espe- cially upon that undisputed empire of the seas which Eng- land held for a century after, the contest is marked by no CHARACTER OF THE NAVAL STRUGGLE. 209 one naval action of military interest. Once only did great fleets meet, and then with results that were indecisive ; after which the French gave up the struggle at sea, confining them- selves wholly to a commerce-destroying warfare. This fea- ture of the War of the Spanish Succession characterizes nearly the whole of the eighteenth century, with the excep- tion of the American Revolutionary struggle. The noiseless, steady, exhausting pressure with which sea power acts, cut- ting off the resources of the enemy while maintaining its own, supporting war in scenes where it does not appear itself, or appears only in the background, and striking open blows at rare intervals, though lost to most, is emphasized to the careful reader by the events of this war and of the half- century that followed. The overwhelming sea power of England was the determining factor in European history during the period mentioned, maintaining war abroad while keeping its own people in prosperity at home, and building up the great empire which is now seen; but from its very greatness its action, by escaping opposition, escapes attention. 9n the few occasions in which it is called to fight, its supe- riority is so marked that the affairs can scarcely be called battles ; with the possible exceptions of Byng's action at Minorca and Hawke's at Quiberon, the latter one of the most brilliant pages in naval history, no decisive encounter between equal forces, possessing military interest, occurs between 1700 and 1778. Owing to this characteristic, the War of the Spanish Suc- cession, from the point of view of our subject, has to be blocked out in general outline, avoiding narrative and in- dicating general bearings, especially of the actions of the fleets. With the war in Flanders, in Germany, and in Italy the navies had naturally no concern ; when they had so pro- tected the commerce of the allies that there was no serious check to that flow of subsidies upon which the land war depended, their part toward it was done. In the Spanish pen- insula it was different. Immediately after landing Carlos III. at Lisbon, Sir George Rooke sailed for Barcelona, which it 14 210 CAPTURE OF GIBRALTAR. was understood would be handed over when the fleets ap- peared ; but the governor was faithful to his king and kept down the Austrian party. Rooke then sailed for Toulon, where a French fleet was at anchor. On his way he sighted another French fleet coming from Brest, which he chased but was unable to overtake ; so that both the enemy's squadrons were united in the port. It is worth while to note here that the English navy did not as yet attempt to blockade the Frencli ports in winter, as they did at a later date. At this period fleets, like armies, went into winter quarters. Another Eng- lish admiral, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, had been sent in the spring to blockade Brest ; but arriving too late, he found his bird flown, and at once kept on to the Mediterranean. Rooke, not thinking himself strong enough to resist the combined French squadrons, fell back toward the Straits ; for at this time England had no ports, no base, in the Mediterranean, no useful ally ; Lisbon was the nearest refuge. Rooke and Shovel met off Lagos, and there held a council of war, in which the former, who was senior, declared that his instructions forbade his undertaking anything without the consent of the kings of Spain and Portugal. This was indeed tying the hands of the sea powers ; but Rooke at last, chafing at the humiliating inac- tion, and ashamed to go home without doing something, de- cided to attack Gibraltar for three reasons : because he heard it was insufficiently garrisoned, because it was of infinite importance as a port for the present war, and because its capture would reflect credit on the queen's arms. The place was attacked, bombarded, and then carried by an assault in boats. The English possession of Gibraltar dates from August 4, 1704, and tlie deed rightly keeps alive the name of Rooke, to whose judgment and fearlessness of responsi- bility England owes the key of the Mediterranean. The Bourbon king of Spain at once undertook to retake the place, and called upon the French fleet in Toulon to sup- port his attack. Tourville had died in 1701, and the fleet was commanded by the Count of Toulouse, — a natural son of Louis XIV., only twenty-six years old. Rooke also sailed NAVAL BATTLE OF MALAGA. 211 eastward, and the two fleets met on the 24th of August off Velez Malaga. The allies were to windward with a northeast wind, both fleets on the port tack heading to the southward and eastward. There is some uncertainty as to the numbers ; the French had fiftv-two ships-of-the-line, their enemy probably half a dozen more. The allies kept away together, each ship for its opposite ; there was apparently no attempt on Rooke's part at any tactical combination. The battle of Malaga pos- sesses indeed no military interest, except that it is the first in which we find fully developed that wholly unscientific method of attack by the English which Clerk criticised, and which prevailed throughout the century. It is instructive to notice that the result in it was the same as in all others fought on the same principle. The van opened out from the centre, leaving quite an interval ; and the attempt made to penetrate this gap and isolate the van was the only tactical move of the French. We find in them at Malaga no trace of the cautious, skilful tactics which Clerk rightly thought to recognize at a later day. The degeneracy from the able combinations of Monk, Ruyter, and Tourville to the epoch of mere seamanship is clearly marked by the battle of Malaga, and gives it its only historical importance. In it was real- ized that primitive mode of fighting which Macaulay has sung, and which .remained for many years the ideal of the English navy : — " Then on both sides the leaders Gave signal for the charge ; And on both sides the footmen Strode forth with lance and targe ; And on both sides the horsemen Struck their spurs deep in gore, And front to front the armies Met with a mighty roar." Human movement is not always advance ; and there are traces of a somewhat similar ideal in the naval periodical literature of our own day. The fight was severe, lasting from ten in the morning till five in the afternoon, but was en- tirely indecisive. The next day the wind shifted, giving the 212 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. weather-gage to the French, but they did not use the oppor- tunity to attack ; for which they were much to blame, if their claim of the advantage the day before is well founded. Rooke could not have fought ; nearly half his fleet, twenty- five ships, it is said, had used up all their ammunition. Even during the battle itself several of the allied ships were towed out of line, because they had not powder and ball for a single broadside. This was doubtless due to the attack upon Gibral- tar, in which fifteen thousand shot were expended, and to the lack of any port serving as a base of supplies, — a deficiency which the new possession would hereafter remove. Rooke, in seizing Gibraltar, had the same object in view that prompted the United States to seize Port Royal at the beginning of the Civil War, and which made the Duke of Parma urge upon his king, before sending the Spanish Great Armada, to seize Flushing on the coast of Holland, — advice which, had it been followed, would have made unnecessary that dreary and disastrous voyage to the north of England. The same reasons would doubtless lead any nation intending serious operations against our seaboard, to seize points remote from the great centres and susceptible of defence, like Gardiner's Bay or Port Royal, which in an inefficient condition of our navy they might hold with and for their fleets. Rooke retired in peace to Lisbon, bestowing by the way on Gibraltar all the victuals and ammunition that could be spared from the fleet. Toulouse, instead of following up his victory, if it was one, went back to Toulon, sending only ten ships- of-the-line to support the attack on Gibraltar. All the at- tempts of the French against the place were carried on in a futile manner ; the investing squadron was finally destroyed and the land attack converted into a blockade. " With this reverse," says a French naval officer, " began in the French people a regrettable reaction against the navy. The wonders to which it had given birth, its immense services, were for- gotten. Its value was no longer believed. The army, more directly in contact with the nation, had all its favor, all its sympathy. The prevailing error, that the greatness or decay FALL OF BARCELONA. 213 of France depended upon some Rhenish positions, could not but favor these ideas adverse to the sea service, which have made England's strength and our Aveakness." ^ During this year, 1704, the battle of Blenheim was fought, in which the French and Bavarian troops were wholly over- thrown by the English and German under Marlborough and Prince Eugene. The result of this battle was that Bavaria forsook the French alliance, and Germany became a second- ary theatre of the general war, which was waged thereafter mainly in the Netherlands, Italy, and the Peninsula. The following year, 1705, the allies moved against Philip Y. by two roads, — from Lisbon upon Madrid, and by way of Bar- celona. The former attack, though based upon the sea, was mainly by land, and resultless ; the Spanish people in that quarter showed unmistakably that they would not welcome the king set up by foreign powers. It was different in Cata- lonia. Carlos III. went there in person with the allied fleet. The French navy, inferior in numbers, kept in port. The French army also did not appear. The allied troops invested the town, aided by three thousand seamen and supported by supplies landed from the fleet, which was to them both base of supplies and line of communications. Barcelona surren- dered on the 9th of October ; all Catalonia welcomed Carlos, and the movement spread to Aragon and Valencia, the capital of the latter province declaring for Carlos. The following year, 1706, the French took the offensive in Spain on the borders of Catalonia, while defending the passes of the mountains toward Portugal. In the absence of the allied fleet, and of the succors which it brought and main- tained, the resistance was weak, and Barcelona was again besieged, this time by the French party supported by a French fleet of thirty sail-of-the-line and numerous transports with supplies from the neighboring port of Toulon. The siege, begun April 5, was going on hopefully ; the Austrian claim- ant himself was within the walls, the prize of success ; but on the 10th of May the allied fleet appeared, the French ships 1 Lapeyrouse-Bonfils : Hist, de la Mariue Frau9aise. 214 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION: retired, and the siege was raised in disorder. The Bourbon claimant dared not retreat into Aragon, and so passed bj Roussillon into France, leaving his rival in possession. At the same time there moved forward from Portugal — that other base which the sea power of the English and Dutch at once controlled and utilized — another army maintained by the subsidies earned from the ocean. This time the western attack was more successful ; many cities in Estremadura and Leon fell, and as soon as the allied generals learned the rais- ing of the siege of Barcelona, they pressed on by way of Salamanca to Madrid. Philip V., after escaping into France, had returned to Spain by the western Pyrenees ; but on the approach of the allies he had again to fly, leaving to them his capital. The Portuguese and allied troops entered Ma- drid, June 26, 1706. The allied fleet, after the fall of Bar- celona, seized Alicante and Cartagena. So far success had gone ; but the inclinations of the Spanish people had been mistaken, and the strength of their purpose and pride, supported by the natural features of their country, was not yet understood. The national hatred to the Portu- guese was aroused, as well as the religious dislike to here- tics, the English general himself being a Huguenot refugee. Madrid and the surrounding country were disaffected, and the south sent the Bourbon king assurance of its fidelity. The allies were not able to remain in the hostile capital, par- ticularly as the region around was empty of supplies and full of guerillas. They retired to the eastward, drawing toward the Austrian claimant in Aragon. Reverse followed reverse, and on the 25th of April, 1707, the allied army was disastrously over- thrown at Almansa, losing fifteen thousand men. All "Spain fell back again into the power of Philip V., except tlie prov- ince of Catalonia, part of which also was subdued. The next year^ 1708, the French made some progress in the same quar- ter, but were not able to attack Barcelona ; Valencia and Alicante, however, were reduced. The year 1707 was not marked by any naval event of importance. During the summer the allied fleets in the SARDINIA AND PORT MA HON TAKEN. 215 Mediterranean were diverted from the coast of Spain to support an attack upon Toulon made by the Austrians and Piedmontesc. The latter moved from Italy alonj^ the coast of the Mediterranean, the fleet supporting the flank on the sea, and contributing supplies. The siege, however, failed, and the campaign was inconclusive. Returning home, the admiral, Sir Cloudesley Shovel, with several ships-of-the-line, was lost on the Scilly Islands, in one of those shipwrecks which have become historical. In 1708 the allied fleets seized Sardinia, which from its fruitfulness and nearness to Barcelona became a rich store- house to the Austrian claimant, so long as by the allied help he controlled the sea. The same year Minorca, with its valu- able harbor, Port Mahon, was also taken, and from that time for fifty years remained in English hands. Blocking Cadiz and Cartagena by the possession of Gibraltar, and facing Toulon with Port Mahon, Great Britain was now as strongly based in the Mediterranean as either France or Spain ; while, with Portugal as an ally, she controlled the two stations of Lisbon and Gibraltar, watching the trade routes both of the ocean and of the inland sea. By the end of 1708 the dis- asters of France by land and sea, the frightful sufferings of the kingdom, and the almost hopelessness of carrying on a strife which was destroying France, and easily borne by Eng- land, led Louis XIV. to offer most humiliating concessions to obtain peace. He undertook to surrender the whole Span- ish monarchy, reserving only Naples for the Bourbon king. The allies refused ; they demanded the abandonment of the whole Spanish Empire without exception by the Duke of Anjou, refusing to call him king, and added thereto ruinous conditions for France herself. Louis would not yield these, and the war went on. During the remaining years the strenuous action of the sea power of the allies, which had by this time come to be that of Great Britain alone, with little help from Holland, was less than ever obtrusive, but the reality of its effect remained. The Austrian claimant, confined to Catalonia for the most 216 WAR OF THE SPANISH SUCCESSION. part, was kept in communication with Sardinia and the Ital- ian provinces of Germany by the English fleet ; but the entire disappearance of the French navy and the evident intention on the part of Louis to keep no squadrons at sea, allowed some diminution of the Mediterranean fleet, witli the result of greater protection to trade. In the years 1710 and 1711 expeditions were also made against the French colonies in North America. Nova Scotia was taken, but an attempt on Quebec failed. During the winter of 1709 and 1710 Louis withdrew all the French troops from Spain, thus abandoning the cause of his grandson. But when the cause of France was at the very lowest, and it seemed as though she might be driven to con- cessions which would reduce her to a second-class power, the existence of the coalition was threatened by the disgrace of Marlborough, who represented England in it. His loss of favor with the queen was followed by the accession to power of the party opposed to the war, or ratlier to its further con- tinuance. This change took place in the summer of 1710, and the inclination toward peace was strengthened both by the favorable position in which England then stood for treat- ing, and by the heavy burden she was bearing ; which it became evident could bring in no further advantages com- mensurate to its weight. The weaker ally, Holland, had gradually ceased to contribute her stipulated share to the sea forces ; and although far-sighted Englishmen might see with complacency the disappearance of a rival sea power, the imme- diate increase of expense was more looked to and felt by the men of the day. The cost both of the continental and Span- ish wars was also largely defrayed by England's subsidies ; and while that on the continent could bring her no further gain, it was seen that the sympathies of the Spanish people could not be overborne in favor of Carlos III. without paying more than tlie game was worth. Secret negotiations between England and France soon began, and received an additional impulse by tlie unexpected death of the Emperor of Germany, the brother of the Austrian claimant of the Spanish throne. BRITISH CONDITIONS OF PEACE. 217 There being no other male heir, Carlos became at once emperor of Austria, and was soon after elected emperor of Germany. England had no more wish to see two crowns on an Austrian head than on that of a Bourbon. The demands made by England, as conditions of peace in 1711, showed her to have become a sea power in the purest sense of the word, not only in fact, but also in her own con- sciousness. She required that the same person should never be king both of France and Spain ; that a barrier of fortified towns should be granted her allies, Holland and Germany, as a defensive line against France ; that French conquests from her allies should be restored ; and for herself she de- manded the formal cession of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, whose strategic and maritime value has been pointed out, the destruction of the port of Dunkirk, the home nest of the pri- vateers that preyed on English commerce, the cession of the French colonies of Newfoundland, Hudson's Bay, and Nova Scotia, the last of which she held at that time, and finally, treaties of commerce with France and Spain, and the conces- sion of the monopoly of the slave trade with Spanish Amer- ica, known as the Asiento, which Spain had given to France in 1701. Negotiations continued, though hostilities did not cease ; and in June, 1712, a four months' truce between Great Britain and France removed the English troops from the allied armies on the continent, their great leader Marlborough having been taken from their head the year before. The campaign of 1712 was favorable to France ; but in almost any event the with- drawal of Great Britain made the end of the war a question of but a short time. The remonstrances of Holland were met by the reply that since 1707 the Dutch had not furnished more than one third their quota of ships, and taking the war through, not over one half. The House of Commons in an address to the throne in 1712 complained that — " The service at sea hath been carried on through tlie whole course of the war in a manner highly disadvantageous to your Majesty's kingdom, for the necessity requiring that great fleets should be fitted 218 PEACE OF UTRECHT. out every year for maintaining a superiority in the Mediterranean and for opjiosing any force which the enemy might prepare either at Dunkirk or in the ports of west France ; your Majesty's readiness, in fitting out your proj)ortion of ships for all parts of that service, hath not prevailed with Holland, which has been greatly deficient every year in proportion to what your Majesty hath furnished. . . . Hence your Majesty hath been obliged to supply those deficiencies with additional reinforcements of your own ships, and your Majesty's shijis have been forced in greater numbers to continue in remote seas, and at unseasonable times of the year, to the great damage of the navy. This also hath straitened the convoys for trade ; the coasts have been exposed for want of cruisers ; and you have been disabled from annoying the enemy in their most beneficial commerce with the West Indies, whence they received those vast supplies of treasure, without which they could not have supjDorted the expenses of the war." In fact, between 1701 and 1716 tlie commerce of Spanish America had brought into France forty million dollars in specie. To these complaints the Dutch envoy to England could only reply that Holland was not in a condition to fulfil her compacts. The reverses of 171 2, added to Great Brit- ain's fixed purpose to have peace, decided the Dutch to the same ; and the English still kept, amid their dissatisfaction with their allies, so much of their old feeling against France as to support all the reasonable claims of Holland. April 11, 1713, an almost general peace, known as the Peace of Utrecht, one of the landmarks of history, was signed be- tween France on the one hand, and England, Holland, Prus- sia, Portugal, and Savoy on the other. The emperor still held out, but the loss of British subsidies fettered the move- ments of his armies, and with the withdrawal of the sea powers the continental war might have fallen of itself ; but France with her hands freed carried on during 1713 a bril- liant and successful campaign in Germany. On the 7th of March, 1714, peace was signed between France and Austria. Some embers of the war continued to burn in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, which persisted in their rebellion against Philip V. ; but the revolt was stifled as soon as the arms of RESULTS OF THE WAR TO FRANCE AND SPAIN. 219 France were turned against them. Barcelona was taken by- storm in September, 1714 ; the islands submitted in the folloAv- ing summer. The changes effected by this long war and sanctioned bj the peace, neglecting details of lesser or passing im|)ortance, may be stated as follows : 1, The House of Bourbon was settled on the Spanish throne, and the Spanish empire retained its West Indian and American possessions ; the purpose of William III. against her dominion there was frus- trated when England undertook to support the Austrian prince, and so fastened the greater part of her naval force to the Mediterranean. 2. The Spanish empire lost its pos- sessions in the Netherlands, Gelderland going to the new kingdom of Prussia and Belgium to the emperor ; the Spanish Netherlands thus became the Austrian Netherlands. 3. Spain lost also the principal islands of the Mediterranean ; Sardinia being given to Austria, Minorca with its fine harbor to Great Britain, and Sicily to the Duke of Savoy. 4. Spain lost also her Italian possessions, Milan and Naples going to the emperor. Such, in the main, were the results to Spain of the fight over the succession to her throne. France, the backer of the successful claimant, came out of the strife worn out, and with considerable loss of terri- tory. She had succeeded in placing a king of her own royal house on a neighboring throne, but her sea strength was ex- hausted, her population diminished, her financial condition ruined. . The European territory surrendered was on her northern and eastern boundaries ; and she abandoned the use of the port of Dunkirk, the centre of that privateering warfare so dreaded by English merchants. In America, the cession of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was the first step toward that entire loss of Canada which befell half a century later; but for the present she retained Cape Breton Island, with its port Louisburg, the key to the Gulf and River St. Lawrence. The gains of England, by the treaty and the war, corre- sponded very nearly to the losses of France and Spain, and were all in the direction of extending and strengthening her sea 220 RESULTS OF THE ^yAR TO power. Gibraltar and Port Mahon in the Mediterranean, and the colonies already mentioned in North America, afforded new bases to that power, extending and protecting her trade. Second only to the expansion of her own was the injury to the sea power of France and Holland, by the decay of their navies in consequence of the immense drain of the land war- fare ; further indications of that decay will be given later. The very neglect of Holland to fill up her quota of ships, and the bad condition of those sent, while imposing extra bur- dens upon England, may be considered a benefit, forcing the British navy to greater development and effort. The dispro- portion in military power on the sea was further increased by the destruction of the works at Dunkirk ; for though not in itself a first-class port, nor of much depth of water, it had great artificial military strength, and its position was pecu- liarly adapted to annoy English trade. It was but forty miles from the South Foreland and the Downs, and the Channel abreast it is but twenty miles wide. Dunkirk was one of Louis' earliest acquisitions, and in its develop- ment was as his own child ; the dismantling of the works and filling-in of the port show the depth of his humiliation at this time. But it was the wisdom of England not to base her sea power solely on military positions nor even on fighting- ships, and the commercial advantages she had now gained by the war and the peace were very great. The grant of the slave trade with Spanish America, in itself lucrative, became yet more so as the basis for an immense smuggling inter- course with those countries, which gave the English a par- tial recompense for their failure to obtain actual possession ; while the cessions made to Portugal by France in South America were mainly to the advantage of England, which had olitained the control of Portuguese trade by the treaty of 1703. The North American colonies ceded were valuable, not merely nor chiefly as military stations, but commercially ; and treaties of commerce on favorable terms were made both with France and Spain. A minister of the day, defending the treaty in Parliament, said : " The advantages from this peace ENGLAND AND HOLLAND. 221 appear in the addition made to our wealth ; in the great quantities of bullion lately coined in our mint ; by the vast increase in our shipping employed since the peace, in the fish- eries, and in merchandise; and by the remarkable growth of the customs upon imports, and of our manufactures, and the growth of our country upon export;" in a word, by the impetus to trade in all its branches. While England thus came out from the war in good run- ning condition, and fairly placed in that position of mari- time supremacy which she has so long maintained, her old rival in trade and fighting was left hopelessly behind. As the result of the war Holland obtained nothing at sea, — no colony, no station. The commercial treaty with France placed her on the same terms as England, but she received no concessions giving her a footing in Spanish America like that obtained by her ally. Indeed, some years before the peace, while the coalition was still maintaining Carlos, a treaty was made with the latter by the British minister, unknown to the Dutch, practically giving the British mo- nopoly of Spanish trade in America ; sharing it only with Spaniards, which was pretty much the same as not sharing it at all. This treaty accidentally became known, and made a great impression on the Dutch ; but England was then so necessary to the coalition that she ran no risk of being left out by its other members. The gain which Holland made by land was that of military occupation only, of certain for- tified places in the Austrian Netherlands, known to his- tory as the " barrier towns ; " nothing was added by them to her revenue, population, or resources ; nothing to that national strength which must underlie military institutions. Holland had forsaken, perhaps unavoidably, the path by which she had advanced to wealth and to leadership among nations. The exigencies of her continental position had led to the neglect of her navy, which in those days of war and privateering involved a loss of carrying-trade and commerce ; and although she held her head high through the war, the symptoms of weakness were apparent in her failing arma- 222 GAINS OF AUSTRIA. mcnts. Therefore, though the United Provinces attained the great object for which they began the war, and saved the Spanish Netherlands from the hands of France, the success was not worth the cost. Thenceforth they withdrew for a long period from the wars and diplomacy of Europe ; partly, perhaps, because they saw how little they had gained, but yet more from actual weakness and inability. After the strenuous exertions of the war came a reaction, which showed painfully the inherent weakness of a State narrow in ter- ritory and small in the number of its people. The visible decline of the Provinces dates from the Peace of Utrecht ; the real decline began earlier. Holland ceased to be numbered among the great powers of Europe, her navy was no longer a military factor in diplomacy, and her commerce also shared in the general decline of the State. It remains only to notice briefly the results to Austria, and to Germany generally. France yielded the barrier of the Rhine, with fortified places on the east bank of the river. Austria received, as has been mentioned, Belgium, Sardinia, Naples, and the Spanish possessions in northern Italy ; dis- satisfied in other respects, Austria was especially discontented at her failure to obtain Sicily, and did not cease negotiating afterward, until she had secured that island. A circumstance more important to Germany and to all Europe than this transi- tory acquisition of distant and alien countries by Austria was the rise of Prussia, which dates from this war as a Protestant and military kingdom destined to weigh in the balance against Austria. Such were the leading results of the War of the Spanish Succession, " the vastest yet witnessed by Europe since the Crusades." It was a war whose chief military interest was on the land, — a war in which fought two of the greatest generals of all times, Marlborough and Prince Eugene, the names of whose battles, Blenheim, Ramillies, Malplaquet, Turin, are familiar to the most casual reader of history ; while a multitude of able men distinguished themselves on •the other theatres of the strife, in Flanders, in Germany, in RESULTS OF THE WAR. 223 Ital}', in Spain. On the sea only one great battle, and tliat scarcely worthy of the name, took place. Yet looking only, for the moment, to immediate and evident results, who reaped the benefit ? Was it France, whose only gain was to seat a Bourbon on the Spanish tlirone ? Was it Spain, whose only gain was to have a Bourbon king instead of an Austrian, and thus a closer alliance with France ? Was it Holland, with its barrier of fortified towns, its ruined navy, and its ex- hausted people ? Was it, lastly, Austria, even tliough she had fought witli the money of the sea powers, and gained such maritime States as the Netherlands and Naples? Was it with these, who had waged war more and more exclusively by land, and set their eyes more and more on gains on the land, or was it not rather with England, who had indeed paid for that con- tinental war and even backed it with her troops, but who mean- while was building up her navy, strengthening, extending, and protecting her commerce, seizing maritime positions, — in a word, founding and rearing her sea power upon the ruins of that of her rivals, friend and foe alike ? It is not to de- preciate the gains of others that the eye fixes on England's naval growth ; their gains but bring out more clearly the immenseness of hers. It was a gain to France to have a friend rather than an enemy in her rear, though her navy and shipping were ruined. It was a gain to Spain to be brought in close intercourse with a livjug country like France after a century of political death, and she liad saved the greater part of her threatened possessions. It was a gain to Holland to be definitively freed from French aggres- sion, with Belgium in the hands of a strong instead of a weak State. And it doubtless was a gain to Austria not only to have checked, chiefly at the expense of others, the progress of her hereditary enemy, but also to have received provinces like Sicily and Naples, which, under wise gov- ernment, might become the foundation of a respectable sea power. But not one of these gains, nor all together, com- pared in greatness, and much less in solidity, with the gain to England of that unequalled sea power which started ahead 224 COMMANDING POSITION OF ENGLAND. during the War of the League of Augsburg, and received its completeness and seal during that of the Spanish Succession. By it she controlled the great commerce of the open sea with a military shipping that had no rival, and in the exhausted condition of the other nations could have none ; and that shipping was now securely based on strong positions in all the disputed quarters of the world. Although her Indian empire was not yet begun, the vast superiority of her navy would enable her to control the communications of other nations with those rich and distant regions, and to assert her will in any disputes arising among the trading-stations of the different nationalities. The commerce which had sus- tained her in prosperity, and her allies in military efficiency, during the war, though checked and harassed by the enemy's cruisers (to which she could pay only partial attention amid the many claims upon her), started with a bound into new life when the war was over. All over the world, exhausted by their share of the common suffering, people were long- ing for the return of prosperity and peaceful commerce ; and there was no country ready as England was in wealth, capital, and shipping to forward and reap the advantages of every enterprise by which the interchange of commodities was pro- moted, either by lawful or unlawful means. In the War of the Spanish Succession, by her own wise management and through the exhaustion of other nations, not only her navy but her trade was steadily built up ; and indeed, in that dangerous condition of the seas, traversed by some of the most reckless and restless cruisers France ever sent out, the efficiency of the navy meant safer voyages, and so more em- ployment for the merchant-ships. Tlie British merchant- ships, being better protected than those of the Dutch, gained the reputation of being far safer carriers, and the carrying- trade naturally passed more and more into their hands ; while the habit of employing them in preference, once established, was likely to continue. "Taking all things together," says an historian of the British navy, " I doubt whether the credit of the English nation ever COMMANDING POSITION OF ENGLAND. 225 stood higher than nt this period, or the spirit of the people higher. The success of our arms at sea, the necessity of protectin"- our trade, and the popularity of every step taken to increase our mari- time power, occasioned such measures to be pursued as annually added to our force. Hence arose that mighty difference which at the close of the year 1706 ajipeared in the Royal Navy; this, not only in the number but in the quality of the ships, was much supe- rior to what it had been at the time of the Revolution or even before. Hence it was that our trade rather increased than diminished during the last war, and that we gained so signally by our strict intercourse with Portugal." ^ The sea power of England therefore was not merely in the great navy, with which we too commonly and exclusively associate it ; France had had such a navy in 1688, and it shrivelled away like a leaf in the fire. Neither was it in a prosperous commerce alone ; a few years after the date at which we have arrived, the commerce of France took on fair proportions, but the first blast of war swept it off the seas as the navy of Cromwell had once swept that of Holland. It was in the union of the two, carefully fostered, that Eng- land made the gain of sea power over and beyond all other States ; and this gain is distinctly associated with and dates from the War of the Spanish Succession. Before that war England was one of the sea powers ; after it she was the sea power, without any second. This power also she held alone, unshared by friend and unchecked by foe. She alone was rich, and in her control of the sea and her extensive ship- ping had the sources of wealth so much in her hands that there was no present danger of a rival on the ocean. Thus her gain of sea power and wealth was not only great but solid, being wholly in her own hands ; while the gains of the other States were not merely inferior in degree, but weaker in kind, in that they depended more or less upon the good will of other peoples. Is it meant, it maybe asked, to attribute to sea power alone the greatness or wealth of any State ? Certainly not. The 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 15 22G DEPRESSED CONDITION OF FRANCE. due use and control of the sea is but one link in the chain of exchange by which wealth accumulates ; but it is tlie central link, which lays under contribution other nations for the bene- fit of the one holding it, and which, history seems to assert, most surely of all gathers to itself riches. In England, this control and use of the sea seems to arise naturally, from the concurrence of many circumstances ; the years immediately preceding the War of the Spanish Succession had, moreover, furthered the advance of her prosperity by a series of fiscal measures, which Macaulay speaks of as " the deep and solid foundation on which was to rise the most gigantic fabric of commercial prosperity which the woi'ld had ever seen." It may be questioned, however, whether the genius of the people, inclined to and developed by trade, did not make easier the taking of such measures ; whether their adoption did not at least partially spring from, as well as add to, the sea power of the nation. However that may be, there is seen, on the opposite side of the Channel, a nation which started ahead of England in the race, — a nation peculiarly well fitted, by situa- tion and resources, for the control of the sea both by war and commerce. The position of France is in this peculiar, that of all the great powers slie alone had a free choice ; the others were more or less constrained to the land chiefly, or to tlie sea chiefly, for any movement outside their own borders ; but she to her long continental frontier added a seaboard on three seas. In 1672 she definitely chose expansion by land. At that time Colbert had administered her finances for twelve years, and from a state of terrible confusion had so restored them that the revenue of the King of France was more than double that of the King of England. In those days France paid the subsidies of Europe ; but Colbert's plans and hopes for France rested upon making her powerful on the sea. The war with Holland arrested these plans, the onward movement of prosperity ceased, the nation was thrown back upon itself, shut off from the outside world. Many causes doubtless worked together to the disastrous result which marked the end of the reign of Louis XIY. : constant wars, bad adminis- DEPRESSED CONDITIOX OF FRANCE. 227 tration in the latter half of the period, extravagance tlirough- out ; but France was practically never invaded, the war was kept at or beyond her own frontiers with slight exceptions, her home industries could suffer little from direct hostili- ties. In these respects she was nearly equal to England, and under better conditions than her other enemies. What made the difference in the results ? Why was France miserable and exhausted, while England was smiling and prosperous ? Why did England dictate, and France accept, terms of peace ? The reason apparently was the difference in wealth and credit. France stood alone against many enemies ; but those ene- mies were raised and kept moving by English subsidies. The Lord Treasurer of England, writing in 1706 to Marl- borough, says : — " Though the land and trade of both England and Holland have excessive burtliens upon them, yet the credit continues good both of them and us ; whereas the finances of France are so much more ex- hausted that they are forced to give twenty and twenty-five per cent for every penny they send out of the kingdom, unless they send it iu specie." In 1712 the expenditure of France was 240,000,000 francs, wliile the taxes brought in only 113,000,000 gross, of which, after deducting losses and necessary expenses, only 37,000,000 remained in the treasury ; the deficit was sought to be met by anticipating parts of the revenue for years ahead, and by a series of extraordinary transactions tedious to name or to understand. "In the summer of 1715 [two years after the peace] it seemed as if the situation could not grow worse, — no more public nor private credit; no more clear revenue for the State; the portions of the revenue not pledged, anticipated on the following years. Neither labor nor consumption could be resumed for want of circulation ; usury reigned on the ruins of society. The alternations of high prices and the depreciation of commodities finally crushed the people. Provision riots broke out among them, and even in the army. Manu- factures were languishing or suspended ; forced mendicity was prey- 228 COMMERCIAL PROSPERITY OF ENGLAND. iug upon the cities. The fields were deserted, the lands fallow for lack of iustruments, for lack of manure, for lack of cattle ; the houses were falling to ruin. Monarchical France seemed ready to expire with its aged king." ^ Thus it was in France, with a population of nineteen mil- lions at that time to the eight millions of all the British Islands ; with a land vastly more fertile and productive ; be- fore the great days, too, of coal and iron. " In England, on tlie contrary, the immense grants of Parliament in 1710 struck the French prodigiously ; for while their credit Avas low, or in a manner quite gone, ours w^as at its zenith." During that same war " there appeared that mighty spirit among our merchants which enabled them to carry on all their schemes with a vigor that kept a constant circulation of money throughout the kingdom, and afforded such mighty encour- agement to all manufactures as has made the remembrance of those times grateful in worse." "By the treaty with Portugal we were prodigious gainers. . . . The Portuguese began to feel the comfortable effects of their Brazil gold mines, and the prodigious commerce that followed with us made their good fortune in great measure ours ; and so it has been ever since ; otherwise I know not how the expenses of the war had been borne. . . . The running cash in the kingdom increased very consider- ably, which must be attributed in great measure to our Portuguese trade; and this, as I have made manifest, we owed wholly to our power at sea [which took Portugal from the alliance of the two crowns, and threw her upon the protection of the maritime powers]. Our trade with the Spanish West Indies by way of Cadiz was cer- tainly much interrupted at the beginning of this war ; but afterward it was in great measure restored, as well by direct communication with several provinces when under the Archduke, as through Portu- gal, by which a very great though contraband trade was carried on. We were at the same time very great gainers by our commerce with the Spaniards in the West Indies [also contraband]. . . .

Thus stood the Power of the Seas during the years in which the French historians iell us that their cruisers were battening on her commerce. The English writer admits heavy losses. In 1707, that is, in the space of five years, the returns, according to the report of a committee of the House of Lords, " show that since the beginning of the war England had lost 30 ships-of-war and 11-16 merchant-ships, of which 300 were retaken ; whereas Ave had taken from them, or destroyed, 80 ships-of-war, and 1346 merchantmen ; 175 privateers also were taken." The greater number of the ships-of-war were probably on private venture, as has been explained. But, be the relative ^ Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. 230 DUGUAY-TROUIN AT RIO JANEIRO. numbers what they may, no argument is needed beyond the statements just given, to show the inability of a mere cruising warfare, not based upon large fleets, to break down a great sea power. Jean Bart died in 1702 ; but in Forbin, Du Casse, and others, and above all in Duguay-Trouin, he left worthy successors, the equals of any commerce-destroyers the world has ever seen. The name of Duguay-Trouin suggests the mention, before finally leaving the War of the Spanish Succession, of his greatest privateering expedition, carried to a distance from home rarely reached by the seamen of his occupation, and which illustrates curiously the spirit of such enterprises in that day, and the shifts to which the French government was reduced. A small French squadron had attacked Rio Janeiro in 1710, but being repulsed, had lost some prisoners, who were said to have been put to death. Duguay-Trouin sought permission to avenge the insult to France. The king, con- senting, advanced the ships and furnished the crews ; and a regular contract was drawn up between the king on the one hand and the company employing Duguay-Trouin on the other, stipulating the expenses to be borne and supplies fur- nished on either hand ; among which we find the odd, busi- ness-like provision that for every one of the troops embarked who shall die, be killed, or desert during the cruise, the company should pay a forfeit of thirty francs. The king was to receive one fifth of the net profits, and was to bear the loss of any one of the vessels that should be wrecked, or destroyed in action. Under these provisions, enumerated in full in a long contract, Duguay-Trouin received a force of six ships-of-the-line, seven frigates, and over two thousand troops, with which he sailed to Rio Janeiro in 1711 ; captured the place after a series of operations, and allowed it to be ransomed at the price of something under four hundred thou- sand dollars, probably nearly equal to a million in the present day, besides five hundred cases of sugar. The privateering company cleared about ninety-two per cent on their venture. As two of the ships-of-the-line were never heard from after WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND SWEDEN. 231 sailing on the return voyage, the king's profits were probably small. While the War of the Spanish Succession was engao-ino- all western Europe, a strife which might have had a profound influence upon its issue was going on in the east. Sweden and Russia were at war, the Hungarians had revolted against Austria, and Turkey was finally drawn in, though not till the end of the year 1710. Had Turkey helped the Hun- garians, she would have made a powerful diversion, not for the first time in history, in favor of France. The English historian suggests that she was deterred by fear of the English fleet ; at all events she did not move, and Hungary was reduced to obedience. The war between Sweden and Russia was to result in the preponderance of the latter upon the Baltic, the subsidence of Sweden, the old ally of France, into a second-rate State, and the entrance of Russia defini- tively into European politics. CHAPTER VI. The Regency in France. — Alberoni in Spain. — Policies of Walpole and Fleuri. — War of the Polish Succession. — English Contraband Trade in Spanish America. — Great Britain declares War against Spain. — 1715-1739. nr^HE Peace of Utrecht was soon followed by the deaths -*- of the rulers of the two countries which had played the foremost part in the War of the Spanish Succession. Queen Anne died August 1, 1714 ; Louis XIV. on the 1st of September, 1715. The successor to the English throne, the German George I., though undoubtedly the choice of the English people, was far from being their favorite, and was rather endured as a necessary evil, giving them a Protestant instead of a Roman Catholic king. Along with the coldness and dislike of his own partisans, he found a very considerable body of dis- affected men, who wished to see the son of James II. on the throne. There was therefore a lack of solidity, more ap- parent than real, but still real, in his position. In France, on the contrary, the succession to the throne was undis- puted ; but the heir was a child of five years, and there was much jealousy as to the possession of the regency, a power more absolute than that of the King of England. The re- gency was obtained and exercised by the next in succession to the throne, Philip, Duke of Orleans ; but he had to appre- hend, not only attempts on the part of rivals in France to shake his hold, but also the active enmity of the Bourbon king of Spain, Philip V., — an enmity which seems to have dated from an intrigue of Orleans, during the late war, to supplant Philip on the Spanish throne. There was therefore POLICY OF THE REGENT. 233 a feeling of instability, of apprehension, in the governments of England and France, which influenced the policy of both. As regards the relations of France and Spain, the mutual hatred of the actual rulers stood for a while in the way of the friendly accord Louis XIV. had hoped from family ties, and was injurious to the true interests of both nations. The Regent Orleans, mider the advice of the most able and celebrated French statesman of that day, the Abbd Dubois, made overtures of alliance to the King of Great Britain. He began first by commercial concessions of the kind generally acceptable to the English, forbidding French shipping to trade to the South Seas under penalty of death, and lowering the duties on the importation of English coal. England at first received these advances warily ; but the regent would not be discouraged, and offered, further, to compel the Pretender, James III., to withdraw beyond the Alps. He also undertook to fill up the port at Mardyck, a new excavation by which the French government was trying to indemnify itself for the loss of Dunkirk. These concessions, all of which but one, it will be noted, were at the expense of the sea power or commercial interests of France, induced England to sign a treaty by which the two countries mutually guaranteed the execution of the treaties of Utrecht as far as their respective interests were concerned ; especially the clause by which the House of Orleans was to succeed to the French throne, if Louis XV. died childless. The Protestant succession in England was likewise guaranteed. Holland, exhausted by tlie war, was unwilling to enter upon new engagements, but was at last brought over to this by the remission of certain dues on her merchandise entering France. The treaty, signed in Jauu- ary, 1717, was known as the Triple Alliance, and bound France to England for some years to come. While France was thus making overtures to England, Spain, under the guidance of another able churchman, was seeking the same alliance and at the same time developing her national strength with the hope of recovering her lost Italian States. The new minister, Cardinal Alberoni, promised 234 ALLIANCE OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE. Philip V. to put him in a position to reconquer Sicily and Naples, if granted five years of peace. He worked hard to bring up the revenues, rebuild the navy, and re-establish the army, while at the same time promoting manufactures, commerce, and shipping, and the advance made in all these was remarkable ; but the more legitimate ambition of Spain to recover her lost possessions, and with them to establish her power in the Mediterranean, so grievously wounded by the loss of Gibraltar, was hampered by the ill-timed purpose of Philip to overthrow the regency of Orleans in France. Alberoni was compelled to alienate France, whose sea power, as well as that of Spain, was concerned in seeing Sicily in friendly hands, and, instead of that natural ally, had to conciliate the maritime powers, England and Holland. This he also sought to do by commercial concessions ; promising promptly to put the English in possession of the privileges granted at Utrecht, concerning which Spain had so far delayed. In return, he asked favorable action from them in Italy. George L, wdio was at heart German, received coldly advances which were unfriendly to the German em- peror in his Italian dominions ; and Alberoni, offended, with- drew them. The Triple Alliance, by guaranteeing the exist- ing arrangement of succession to the French throne, gave further offence to Philip V., who dreamed of asserting his own claim. The result of all these negotiations was to bind England and France together against Spain, — a blind policy for the two Bourbon kingdoms. The gist of the situation created by these different aims and feelings, was that the Emperor of Austria and the King of Spain both wanted Sicily, which at Utrecht had been given to the Duke of Savoy ; and that France and England both wished for peace in western Europe, because war would give an opportunity to the malcontents in either kingdom. The position of George, however, being more secure than that of Orleans, the policy of the latter tended to yield to that of the former, and this tendency was increased by the active ill-will of the King of Spain. George, as a German, THE SPANIARDS INVADE SARDINIA. 235 wished the emperor's success ; and the English statesmen naturally preferred to see Sicily in the hands of their late ally and well-assured friend rather than in Spain's. France, contrary to her true policy, but under the urgency of the regent's position, entertained the same views, and it was proposed to modify the Treaty of Utrecht by transferring Sicily from Savoy to Austria, giving the former Sardinia instead. It was necessary, however, to consider Spain, which under Alberoni had already gained a degree of mili- tary power astounding to those who had known her weakness during the last war. She was not yet ready to light, for only half of the five years asked by the cardinal had passed ; but still less was she ready to forego her ambitions. A trifling incident precipitated an outbreak. A high Spanish official, travelling from Rome to Spain by land, and so passing through the Italian States of the emperor, was arrested as a rebellious subject by order of the latter, who still styled himself King of Spain. At this insult, Alberoni could not hold Philip back. An expedition of twelve ships of war and eighty-six hundred soldiers was sent against Sardinia, the transfer to Savoy not having yet taken effect, and reduced the island in a few months. This happened in 1717. Doubtless the Spaniards would at once have moved on against Sicily ; but France and England now intervened more actively to prevent the general war that seemed threaten- ing. England sent a fleet to the Mediterranean, and negotia- tions began at Paris, Vienna, and Madrid. The outcome of these conferences was an agreement between England and France to effect the exchange of Sardinia and Sicily just mentioned, recompensing Spain by giving her Parma and Tuscany in northern Italy, and stipulating that the emperor should renounce forever his absurd but irritating claim to the Spanish crown. This arrangement was to be enforced by arms, if necessary. The emperor at first refused consent ; but the increasing greatness of Alberoni's preparations at last decided him to accept so advantageous an offer, and the accession of Holland to the compact gave it the historical 236 SPANISH INVASION OF SICILY. title of the Quadruple Alliance. Spain M'as obstinate ; and it is sij^nificant of Alberoni's achievements in developing her power, and the eagerness, not to say anxiety, of George I. , that the offer was made to purchase her consent by ceding Gib- raltar. If the Regent Orleans knew this, it would partly justify his forwarding the negotiations. Alberoni tried to back up his military power by diplomatic efforts extending all over Europe. Russia and Sweden were brought together in a project for invadijig England in the interest of the Stuarts ; the signing of the Quadruple Alli- ance in Holland was delayed by his agents ; a conspiracy was started in France against the regent ; the Turks were stirred up against the emperor ; discontent was fomented through- out Great Britain ; and an attempt was made to gain over the Duke of Savoy, outraged by being deprived of Sicily. On the 1st of July, 1718, a Spanish army of thirty thousand troops, escorted by twenty-two ships-of-the-line, appeared at Palermo. The troops of Savoy evacuated the city and pretty nearly the whole island, resistance being concentrated in the citadel of Messina. Anxiety was felt in Naples itself, until the Eng- lish admiral, Byng,^ anchored there the day after the invest- ment of Messina. The King of Sicily having now consented to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance, Byng received on board two thousand Austrian troops to be landed at Messina. When he appeared before the place, finding it besieged, he wrote to the Spanish general suggesting a suspension of arms for two months. This was of course refused ; so the Aus- trians were landed again at Reggio, in Italy, and Byng passed through the Straits of Messina to seek the Spanish fleet, which had gone to the southward. The engagement which ensued can scarcely be called a battle, and, as is apt to happen in such affairs, when the par- ties are on the verge of war but war has not actually been declared, there is some doubt as to how far the attack was morally justifiable on the part of the English. It seems pretty sure that Byng was determined beforehand to seize 1 Afterward Lord Torrington ; father of Admiral Jolin Byng, shot in 1757. ACTION OFF CAPE PASSARO. 237 or destroy the Spanish fleet, and that as a military man he was justified by his orders. The Spanish naval officers had not made up their minds to any line of conduct ; they were much inferior in numbers, and, as must always be the case, Alberoni's hastily revived navy had not within the same pe- riod reached nearly the efficiency of his army. The English approached threateningly near, one or more Spanish ships opened fire, whereupon the English, being to windward, stood down and made an end of them ; a few only escaped into Valetta harbor. The Spanish navy was practically annihi- lated. It is difficult to understand the importance attached by some writers to Byng's action at this time in attaclcing without regard to the line-of-battle. He had before liim a disorderly force, much inferior both in numbers and dis- cipline. His merit seems rather to lie in the readiness to assume a responsibility from which a more scrupulous man might have shrunk ; but in this and throughout the cam- paign he rendered good service to England, whose sea power was again strengthened by the destruction not of an actual but a possible rival, and his services were rewarded by a peer- age. In connection with this day's work was written a de- spatch which has great favor with English historians. One of the senior captains was detached with a division against some escaping ships of the enemy. His report to the ad- miral ran thus : " Sm, — We have taken or destroyed all the Spanish ships upon this coast, the number as per margin. Respectfully, etc., G. Walton." One English writer makes, and another indorses, the uncalled-for but characteristic fling at the French, that the ships thus thrust into the margin would have filled some pages of a French narration.^ It may be granted that the so-called " battle " of Cape Passaro did not merit a long description, and Captain Walton possibly felt so ; but if all reports of naval transactions were modelled upon his, the writing of naval history would not depend on official papers. Thus the Spanish navy was struck down on the 11th of 1 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals ; guoted by Lord Mahon in his History of England. 238 DESTRUCTION OF SPANISH DOCK-YARDS. August, 1718, off Cape Passaro. This settled the fate of Sicily, if it had been doubtful before. The English fleet cruised round the island, supporting the Austrians and iso- lating the Spaniards, none of whom were permitted to with- draw before peace was made. Alberoni's diplomatic projects failed one after the other, with a strange fatality. In the following year the French, in pursuance of the terms of the alliance, invaded the north of Spain and destroyed the dock- yards ; burning nine large ships on the stocks, besides the materials for seven more, at the instigation of an English attache accompanying the French headquarters. Thus was completed the destruction of the Spanish navy, which, says an English historian, was ascribed to the maritime jealousy of England. " This was done," wrote the French commander, the Duke of Berwick, a bastard of the house of Stuart, " in order that the English government may be able to show the next Parliament that nothing has been neglected to diminish the navy of Spain." The acts of Sir George Byng, as given by the English naval historian, make yet more manifest the pur- pose of England at this time. While the city and citadel of Messina were being besieged by the Austrians, English, and Sardinians, a dispute arose as to the possession of the Spanish men-of-war within the mole. Byng, " reflecting within him- self that possibly the garrison might capitulate for the safe return of those ships into Spain, which he Avas determined not to suffer ; that on the other hand the right of posses- sion might breed an inconvenient dispute at a critical junc- ture among the princes concerned, and if it should at length be determined that they did not belong to England it were better they belonged to no one else, proposed to Count de Merci, the Austrian general, to erect a battery and destroy them as they lay." ^ After some demur on the part of the other leaders, this was done. If constant care and watch- fulness deserve success, England certainly deserved her sea power ; but what shall be said of the folly of France at this time and in this connection ? 1 Lives of the Admirals. ENGLAND IN THE BALTIC. 239 The stead}' stream of reverses, and the hopelessness of contending for distant maritime possessions when without a navy, broke down the resistance of Spain. England and France insisted upon the dismissal of Alberoni, and Philip yielded to the terms of the Quadruple Alliance. The Austrian power, necessarily friendly to England, was thus firmly settled in the central Mediterranean, in Naples and Sicily, as England herself was in Gibraltar and Port Mahon. Sir Robert Wal- pole, the minister now coming into power in England, failed at a later day to support this favorable conjunction, and so far betrayed the traditional policy of his country. The do- minion of the House of Savoy in Sardinia, which then began, has lasted ; it is only within our own day that tbe title King of Sardinia has merited in the broader one of King of Italy. Contemporaneously with and for some time after the short episode of Alberoni's ministry and Spain's ambition, a strug- gle was going on around the shores of the Baltic which must be mentioned, because it gave rise to another effectual illus- tration of the sea power of England, manifested alike in the north and south with a slightness of exertion which calls to mind tlie stories of the tap of a tiger's paw. The long contest between Sweden and Russia was for a moment in- terrupted in 1718, by negotiations looking to peace and to an alliance between the two for the settlement of the succes- sion in Poland and the restoration of the Stuarts in Eng- land. This project, on which had rested many of Alberoni's hopes, was finally stopped by the death in battle of the Swe- dish king. The war went on ; and the czar, seeing the ex- haustion of Sweden, purposed its entire subjugation. This destruction of the balance of power in the Baltic, making it a Russian lake, suited neither England nor France ; especially the former, whose sea power both for peace and war depended upon the naval stores chiefly drawn from those regions. The two western kingdoms interfered, both by diplomacy, while England besides sent licr fleet. Denmark, which was also at ■war with her traditional enemv Sweden, readily yielded ; but 240 THE REGENCY IN FRANCE. Peter the Great cluifed heavily under the implied coercion, until at last orders were sent to the English admiral to join his fleet to that of the Swedes and repeat in the Baltic the history of Cape Passaro. The czar in alarm withdrew his fleet. This happened in 1719 ; but Peter, though bafifled, was not yet subdued. The following year the interposition of England was repeated with greater effect, although not in time to save the Swedish coasts from serious injury ; but the czar, recognizing the fixed purpose with which he had to deal, and knowing from personal observation and prac- tical experience the efficiency of England's sea power, con- sented finally to peace. The French claim much for their own diplomacy in this happy result, and say that England supported Sweden feebly ; being willing that she should lose her provinces on the eastern shore of the Baltic because Rus- sia, thus brought down to the sea-shore, could more easily open to English trade the vast resources of her interior. This may very possibly be true, and certainty can be felt that British interests, especially as to commerce and sea power, were looked after ; but the character of Peter the Great is the guarantee that the argument which weighed most heavily with him was the military efficiency of the British fleet and its ability to move up to his very doors. By this Peace of Nystadt, August 30, 1721, Sweden abandoned Livonia, Estho- nia, and other provinces on the east side of the Baltic. This result was inevitable ; it was yearly becoming less possible for small States to hold their own. It cnn readily be understood that Spain was utterly dis- contented with tlie terms wrung from her by the Quadruple Alliance. The twelve years which followed are called years of peace, but the peace was very uncertain, and fraught with elements of future wars. The three great grievances rankling with Spain were — Sicily and Naples in the possession of Austria, Gibraltar and Mahon in the hands of England, and lastly, the vast contraband trade carried on by English mer- chants and ships in Spanish America. It will be seen that England was the active supporter of all these injuries ; Eng- DEATH OF THE REGENT. 241 land therefore was the special enemy of Spain, but Spain was not the only enemy of England. The quiet, such as it was, that succeeded the fall of Albe- roni was due mainly to the character and policy of the two ministers of France and England, who agreed in wishing a general peace. The policy and reasons of the French regent are already known. Moved by the same reasons, and to re- move an accidental offence taken by England, Dubois ob- tained for her the further concession from Spain, additional to the commercial advantages granted at Utrecht, of send- ing a ship every year to trade in the West Indies. It is said that this ship, after being anchored, was kept continu- ally supplied by others, so that fresh cargo came in over one side as fast as the old was sent ashore from the other. Dubois and the regent both died in the latter half of 1723, after an administration of eight years, in which they had re- versed the policy of Richelieu by alliance with England and Austria and sacrificing to them the interests of France. The regency and the nominal government of France passed to another member of the royal family ; but the real ruler was Cardinal Fleuri, the preceptor of the young king, who was now thirteen years of age. Efforts to displace the preceptor resulted only in giving him the title, as well as the power, of minister in 1726. At this time Sir Robert Walpole had become prime minister of England, with an influence and power which gave him practically the entire guidance of the policy of the State. The chief wish of both Walpole and Fleuri was peace, above all in western Europe. France and England therefore continued to act together for that purpose, and though they could not entirely stifle every murmur, they were for several years successful in preventing outbreaks. But while the aims of the two ministers were thus agreed, the motives which in- spired them were different. Walpole desired peace because of the still unsettled condition of the English succession ; for the peaceful growth of English commerce, which he had ever before his eyes ; and probably also because his spirit, im- patient of equals in the government, shrank from war which 16 242 ADMINISTRATION OF FLEURI. would raise up stronger men around him. Fleuri, reasonably secure as to the throne and his own power, wished like Wal- pole the peaceful development of his country, and shrank from war with the love of repose natural to old age ; for he was seventy-three when he took office, and ninety when he laid it down in death. Under his mild administration the prosperity of France revived ; the passing traveller could note the change in the face of the country and of the people ; yet it may be doubted whether this change was due to the government of the quiet old man, or merely to the natural elasticity of the people, no longer drained by war nor isolated from the rest of the world. French authorities say that agri- culture did not revive throughout the country. It is certain, however, that the maritime prosperity of France advanced wonderfully, owing mainly to the removal of commercial restrictions in the years immediately following the death of Louis XIY. The West India islands in particular throve greatly, and their welfare was naturally shared by the home ports that traded with them. The tropical climate of Mar- tinique, Guadeloupe, and Louisiana, and cultivation by slaves, lent themselves readily to the paternal, semi-military gov- ernment which marks all French colonies, but which pro- duced less happy results in the bitter weather of Canada. In the West Indies, France at this time obtained a decided pre- ponderance over England ; tlie value of the French half of Hayti was alone equal to that of all the English West Indies, and French coffee and sugar were driving those of England out of European markets. A like advantage over England in the Mediterranean and Levant trade is asserted by French liistorians. At the same time the East India Company was revived, and its French depot, whose name tells its association with the East, the Breton town of L'Orient, quickly became a splendid city. Pondicherry on the Coromandel coast, and Chandernagore on the Ganges, the chief seats of French power and commerce in India, grew rapidly ; the Isle of Bourbon and the Isle of France, now the Mauritius, whose position is so well suited for the control of the Indian Ocean, FRANCE IN INDIA. 243 became, the one a rich agricultural colony, the other a power- ful naval station. The monopoly of the great company was confined to the trade between home and the chief Indian stations ; the traffic throughout the Indian seas was open to private enterprise and grew more rapidly. This great move- ment, wholly spontaneous, and even looked on with distrust by the government, was personified in two men, Duplcix and La Bourdonnais ; who, the former at Chandernagore and the latter at the Isle of France, pointed out and led the way in all these undertakings, which were building up the power and renown of the French in the Eastern seas. The movement was begun which, after making France the rival of England in the Hindustan peninsula, and giving her for a moment the promise of that great empire which has bestowed a new title on the Queen of Great Britain, was destined finally to falter and perish before the sea power of England. The extent of this expansion of French trade, consequent upon peace and the removal of restrictions, and not due in any sense to government protection, is evidenced by the growth of French merchant shipping from only three hundred vessels at the death of Louis XIV., to eighteen hundred, twenty years later. This, a French historian claims, refutes " the deplor- able prejudices, born of our misfortunes, that France is not fitted for sea commerce, the only commerce that indefinitely extends the power of a nation with its sphere of activity." ^ This free and happy movement of the people was far from acceptable to Fleuri, who seems to have seen it wath the distrust of a hen that has hatched ducklings. Walpole and himself were agreed to love peace ; but Walpole was obliged to reckon with the English people, and these were prompt to resent rivalry upon the sea and in trade, however obtained. Moreover, Fleuri had inherited the unfortunate policy of Louis XIV. ; his eyes were fixed on the continent. He did not in- deed wish to follow the course of the regency in quarrelling with Spain, but rather to draw near to her ; and although he was not able for a time to do so without sacrificing his peace 1 Martin : History of France. 244 WALPOLE'S NAVAL DEMONSTRATIONS. policy, because of Spain's restless enmity to England, yet his mind was chiefly bent upon strengthening the position of France on the land, by establishing Bourbon princes where he could, and drawing them together by family alliances. The navy was allowed to decay more and more. " The French government abandoned the sea at the very moment that the nation, through the activity of private individuals, was making an effort to regain it." The material force fell to fifty-four ships-of-the-line and frigates, mostly in bad con- dition ; and even when war with England had been imminent for five years, France had but forty-five ships-of-the-line to England's ninety. This difference foreshadowed the results which followed a quarter of a century of war. During the same period Walpole, relying upon Fleuri's co-operation, resolutely set his face against open war between England and Spain. The difliculties caused by the threaten- ing and exasperating action of the latter country, and of such allies as she from time to time could raise, were met, and for a while successfully met, by naval demonstrations, — reminders of that sea power which one nation after another had felt and yielded to. In 1725, the Spanish king and the emperor agreed to sink their long-standing feud, and signed a treaty at Vienna, in which there was a secret clause providing that the emperor would support the claim of Spain to Gibraltar and Port Mahon, by arms if necessary. Russia also showed a disposition to join this confederacy. A counter-alliance was formed between England, France, and Prussia ; and English fleets were sent, one to the Baltic to awe the czarina, another to the coast of Spain to check that government and protect Gibraltar, and a third to Porto Bello, on the Spanish Main, to blockade the fleet of galleons there assembled, and by cutting off the supplies remind the Spanish king at once of his dependence upon the specie of America, and of England's control of the highway by which it reached him. Walpole's aversion to war was marked by giving the admiral at Porto Bello the strictest orders not to fight, only to blockade ; the consequence of which, through the long delay of the squadron TRADE IN SPANISH AMERICA. 245 upon the sickly coast, was a mortality among the crews that shocked the nation, and led, among other causes, to the minis- ter's overthrow many years later. Between three and four thousand ofhcers and men, including Admiral Hosier himself, died there. Walpole's aim, however, was reached ; though Spain made a foolish attack by land upon Gibraltar, the presence of the English fleet assured its supplies and provi- sions and averted the formal outbreak of war. The emperor withdrew from the alliance, and under English pressure also revoked the charter of an East India company which he had authorized in the Austrian Netherlands, and which took its name from the port of Ostend. English merchants demanded the removal of this competitor, and also of a similar rival es- tablished in Denmark ; both which concessions the English ministry, backed by Holland, obtained. So long as com- merce was not seriously disturbed, Walpole's peace policy, accompanied as it naturally was by years of plenty and general content, was easily maintained, even though Spain continued threatening and arrogant in her demands for Gib- raltar ; but unfortunately she now entered more deeply upon a course of annoyance to English trade. The concessions of the Asiento, or slave-trade, and of the annual ship to South America have been mentioned ; but these privileges were but a part of the English commerce in those regions. The sys- tem of Spain with regard to the trade of her colonies was of the narrowest and most exclusive character ; but, while at- tempting to shut them out from foreign traffic, she neglected to provide for their wants herself. The consequence was that a great smuggling or contraband trade arose throughout her American possessions, carried on mainly by the English, who made their lawful traffic by the Asiento and the yearly ship subserve also the unlawful, or at least unauthorized, trade. This system was doubtless advantageous to the great body of the Spanisli colonists, and was encouraged by them, while colonial governors connived at it, sometimes for money, some- times swayed by local public opinion and their own knowledge of the hardships of the case ; but there were Spanish subjects 246 VIOLENT ACTION OF SPAIN. who saw their own business injured by the use and abuse of English privileges, and the national government suffered both in pocket and in pride by these evasions of the revenue. It now began to pull the strings tighter. Obsolete regulations were revived and enforced. Words in which the action of Spain in this old controversy have been described are curi- ously applicable to certain recent disputes to which the United States has been a party. " The letter of the treaty was now followed, though the spirit which dictated it was abandoned. Although English ships still enjoyed the liberty of putting into Spanish harbors for the purpose of refitting and provisioning, yet they were far from enjoying the same advantages of carrying on a friendly and commercial inter- course. They were now watched with a scrupulous jealousy, strictly visited by guarda-costas, and every efficient means adopted to prevent any commerce with the colonies, except what was allowed by the annual ship." If Spain could have confined herself to closer watchfulness and to enforcing in her own waters vexatious customs regulations, not essentially different from those sanctioned by the general commercial ideas of that day, perhaps no further harm would have re- sulted ; but the condition of things and the temper of her government would not let her stop there. It was not possi- ble to guard and effectually seal a sea-coast extending over hundreds of miles, with innumerable inlets ; nor would traders and seamen, in pursuit of gain which they had come to consider their right, be deterred by fears of penalties nor consideration for Spanish susceptibilities. The power of Spain was not great enough to enforce on the English minis- try any regulation of their shipping, or stoppage of the abuse of the treaty privileges, in face of the feelings of the mer- chants ; and so the weaker State, wronged and tiarassed, was goaded into the use of wholly unlawful means. Ships-of-war and guarda-costas were instructed, or at least permitted, to stop and search English ships on the high seas, outside of Spanish jurisdiction ; and the arrogant Spanish temper, un- restrained by the weak central government, made many of WALPOLE'S EFFORTS FOR PEACE. 247 these visits, both the lawful and the unlawful, scenes of insult and even violence. Somewhat similar results, springing from causes not entirely different, have occurred in the relations of Spanish officials to the United States and American merchant- ships in our own day. The stories of these acts of violence coming back to England, coupled with cases of loss by confis- cation and by the embarrassment of trade, of course stirred up the people. In 1737 the West India merchants petitioned the House of Commons, saying, — " For many years past their ships have not only frequently been stopped and searched, but also forcibly and arbitrarily seized upon the high seas, by Spanish ships fitted out to cruise, under the plau- sible pretext of guarding their own coasts ; that the commanders thereof, with their crews, have been inhumanly treated, and their ships carried into some of the Spanish ports and there condemned with their cargoes, in manifest violation of the treaties subsisting between the two crowns ; that the remonstrances of his Majesty's ministers at Madrid receive no attention, and that insults and plunder must soon destroy their trade." Walpole struggled hard, during the ten years following 1729, to keep off war. In that year a treaty signed at Seville professed to regulate matters, restoring the conditions of trade to what they had been four years before, and providing that six thousand Spanish troops should at once occupy the territory of Tuscany and Parma. Walpole argued with his own people that war would lose them the commercial privi- leges they already enjoyed in Spanish dominions ; while with Spain he carried on constant negotiations, seeking concessions and indemnities that might silence the home clamor. In the midst of this period a war broke out concerning the succes- sion to the Polish throne. The father-in-law of the French king was one claimant ; Austria supported his opponent. A common hostility to Austria once more drew France and Spain together, and they were joined by the King of Sardinia, who hoped through this alliance to wrest Milan from Austria and add it to his own territory of Piedmont. The neutrality 248 BOURBON FAMILY COMPACT. of England and Holland -^ras secnred by a promise not to attack the Austrian Netherlands, the possession of any part of which by France was considered to be dangerous to Eng- land's sea power. The allied States declared war against Austria in October, 1733, and their armies entered Italy together ; but the Spaniards, intent on their long-cherished projects against Naples and Sicily, left the others and turned southward. The two kingdoms were easily and quickly con- quered, the invaders having command of the sea and the favor of the population. The second son of the King of Spain was proclaimed king under the title of Carlos HI., and the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies thus came into exist- ence. Walpole's aversion to war, leading him to abandon a long-standing ally, thus resulted in the transfer of the central Mediterraneau to a control necessarily unfriendly to Great Britain. But while Walpole thus forsook the emperor, he was him- self betrayed by his friend Fleuri. While making the open alliance with Spain against Austria, the French govei'nment agreed to a secret clause directed against England. This engagement ran as follows : " Whenever it seems good to both nations alike, the abuses which have crept into com- merce, especially through the English, shall be abolished ; and if the English make objection, France will ward off their hostility with all its strength by land and sea." " And this compact was made," as the biographer of Lord Hawke points out, " during a period of intimate and ostentatious alliance with England itself." ^ " Thus the policy against which William III. had called on England and Europe to arm, at last came into existence." Had Walpole known of this secret agreement, it might have seemed to him an additional argument in favor of peace ; for, his keen political sagacity warning him of the existence of a danger which he yet could not see, he told the House of Commons that " if the Span- iards had not private encouragement from powers more con- siderable than themselves, they would never have ventured 1 Burrows : Life of Lord Hawke. INCREASED POWER OF HOUSE OF BOURBON. 249 on the insults and injuries which have been proved at your bar ; " and he expressed the opinion that " England was not a match for the French and Spaniards too." Fleuri had indeed given his old friend and fellow-statesman an ugly fall. The particular question which excited the two years' War of the Polish Succession, the choice of a ruler for a distracted kingdom fated soon to disappear from the list of European States, seems a small matter ; but the turn imparted to European politics by the action of the powers engaged gives it a very different importance. France and Austria came to an arrangement in October, 1735, upon terms to which Sardinia and Spain afterward acceded, the principal points of which were as follows : The French claimant to the Polish throne gave up his claim to it, and received instead the duchies of Bar and Lorraine on the east of France, with the provision that upon his death they were to go to his son-in-law, the King of France, in full sovereignty ; the two kingdoms of Sicily and Naples were confirmed to the Spanish Bourbon prince, Don Carlos ; and Austria received back Parma. The Sardinian monarchy also got an increase to its Italian territory. France thus, under the peace-loving Fleuri, obtained in Bar and Lorraine an accession of strength which more warlike rulers had coveted in vain ; and at the same time her external position was fortified at the expense of England, by the transfer of controlling positions in the cen- tral Mediterranean to an allv. Yet the heart of Fleuri might well have failed him as he remembered the secret agreement to check the commerce of England, and thought of her mighty sea power alongside of the decayed navy of France. That compact between France and Spain, to which the Two Sicilies acceded later, bore within it, in the then strained relations between England and Spain, the germ of the great wars be- tween England and the House of Bourbon which issued in the creation of the British Empire and the independence of the United States. The clamor in England over Spanish outrages continued, and was carefully nursed by the opposition to Walpole. The 250 fV-'^^' BETWEEN ENGLAND AND SPAIN. minister was now over sixty years of age, and scarcely able to change the settled convictions and policy of his prime. He was face to face with one of those irrepressible conflicts between nations and races toward which a policy of repres- sion and compromise can be employed but for a short time. The English were bent upon opening the West Indies and Spanish America, the Spanish government equally bent upon obstructing them. Unfortunately for their policy of obstruc- tion, they strengthened Walpole's enemies by unlawful search of English ships on the open sea, and possibly also by out- rages to English seamen. Some of the latter were brought before the bar of the House of Commons, and testified that they had been not merely plundered, but tortured, shut up in prison, and compelled to live and work under loathsome conditions. The most celebrated case was that of a certain Jenkins, the master of a merchant-brig, who told that a Span- ish officer had torn off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to the king his master, and say that if he had been there he would have been served likewise. Being asked what were his feelings at such a moment of danger and suffering, he was said to have replied, " I commended my soul to God and my cause to my country." This well-turned dramatic utterance from the mouth of a man of his class throws a suspicion of high coloring over the whole story ; but it can be readily imagined what a capital campaign-cry it would be in the heat of a popular movement. The tide of feeling swept away Walpole's patchwork of compromise, and war was de- clared against Spain by Great Britain on the 19th of October, 1739. The English ultimatum insisted upon a formal renun- ciation of the right of search as claimed and exercised by the Spaniards, and upon an express acknowledgment of the Brit- ish claims in North America. Among these claims was one relating to the limits of Georgia, then a recently established colony, touching the Spanish territory of Florida. How far the war thus urged on and begun by England, against the judgment of her able minister, was morally justi- fiable has been warmly argued on either side by English ORIGIN OF THE WAR. 251 writers. The laws of Spain with regard to the trade of her colonies did not differ in spirit from those of England herself as shown by her Navigation Act, and Spanish naval officers found themselves in a position nearly identical with that of Nelson when captain of a frigate in the West Indies half a century later. American ships and merchants then, after the separation from the mother-country, continued the trade which they had enjoyed as colonists ; Nelson, zealous for the commercial advantage of England as then understood, under- took to enforce the act, and in so doing found against him the feeling of the "West Indians and of the colonial authori- ties. It does not seem that he or those supporting him searched unlawfully, for the power of England was great enough to protect her shipping interests without using irregu- lar means; whereas Spain between 1730 and 1740, being weak, was tempted, as she has since been, to seize those whom she knew to have injured her wherever she could find them, even outside her lawful jurisdiction. After reading the entirely sympathetic presentation of the case of Walpole's opponents, urging war, which is given by Professor Burrows in his Life of Lord Hawke, a foreigner can scarcely fail to conclude that the Spaniards were griev- ously wronged, according to the rights of the mother-country over colonies as commonly admitted in that day ; though no nation could tolerate the right of search as claimed by them. It chiefly concerns our subject to notice that the dispute was radically a maritime question, that it grew out of tlie uncon- trollable impulse of the English people to extend their trade and colonial interests. It is possible that France was acting under a similar impulse, as English writers have asserted ; but the character and general policy of Fleuri, as well as tlie genius of the French people, make this unlikely. There was no Parliament and no opposition to make known popular opinion in the France of that day, and very different esti- mates of Fleuri's character and administration have foimd voice since then. The English look ratlier at the ability which obtained Lorraine for France and the Sicilies for the House 252 DECAY OF THE FRENCH NAVY. of Bourbon, and blame Walpole for being overreached. The French say of Fleuri that " he lived from day to day seeking only to have quiet in his old age. He had stupefied France "with opiates, instead of laboring to cure her. He could not even prolong this silent sleep until his own death." ^ When the war broke out between England and Spain, " the latter claimed the advantage of her defensive alliance with France. Fleuri, grievously against his will, was forced to fit out a squadron ; he did so in niggardly fashion." This squadron, of twenty-two ships, convoyed to America the Spanish fleet assembled at Ferrol, and the reinforcement prevented the English from attacking.^ " Still, Fleuri made explanations to Walpole and hoped for compromise, — an ill-founded hope, which had disastrous results for our sea interests, and prevented measures which would have given France, from the beginning of the war, the superiority in eastern seas." But " upon Walpole's overthrow," says another Frenchman, " Fleuri perceived his mistake in letting the navy decay. Its importance had lately struck him. He knew that the kings of Naples and Sardinia forsook the French alliance merely because an English squadron threatened to bombard Naples and Genoa and to bring an armv into Italv. For lack of 1 Martin : History of France. - The peculiar political relation which France bore toward England between 1739 and 1744, while the latter country was at war with Spain, needs to be explained, as it depended upon views of international duties which are practi- cally obsolete. By her defensive alliance with Spain, France had bound herself to furnish a contingent of specified force to the Spanish fleet when that country was involved in war of a certain kind. She claimed, however, that her sending these succors was not such an act of hostility to England as involved a breach of the peace existing between the two nations. The French ships-of-war, while thus serving with the Spani.sh fleet under the terms of the treaty, were enemies ; but the French nation and all other armed forces of France, on sea and land, were neutrals, with all the privileges of neutrality. Of course England was not bound to accept this view of the matter, and could make the action of France a casus belli ; but France claimed it was not justly so, and England practically conceded the claim, though the relation was likely to lead to formal war, as it did in 1744. A few years later the Dutch will be found claiming the same privi- lege of neutrality toward France while furnishing a large contingent to the Austrian army acting against her. DEATH OF WALPOLE AND OF FLEURI. 953 this element of greatness, France silently swallowed the greatest humiliations, and could only complain of the violence of English cruisers, which pillaged our commerce, in violation of the law of nations," ^ during the years of nominal peace that elapsed between the time when the French fleet was con- fined to protecting the Spanish against the English and the outbreak of formal war. The explanation of these differing views seems not very hard. The two ministers had tacitly agreed to follow lines which apparently could not cross. France was left free to expand by land, provided she did not excite the jealousy of the English people, and Walpole's own sense of English interests, by rivalry at sea. This course suited Fleuri's views and wishes. The one sought power by sea, the other by land. Which had been wiser, war was to show ; for, with Spain as an ally to one party, war had to come, and that on the sea. Neither minister lived to see the result of his policy. Walpole was driven from power in 17-12, and died in March, 1715. Fleuri died in office, Janu- ary 29, 1713. ^ LapejTOuse-Boafils : Hist, de la Marine Fran9aise. CHAPTER VII. War between Great Britain and Spain, 1 739. — War of the Austrian Succession, 1740. — France joins Spain against Great Britain, 1744. — Sea Battles of Matthews, Anson, AND Hawke. — Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, 1 748. WE have now reached the opening of a series of great wars, destined to last with short intervals of peace for nearly half a century, and having, amid many misleading details, one broad characteristic distinguishing them from previous, and from many subsequent, wars. This strife em- braced the four quarters of the world, and that not only as side issues here and there, the main struggle being in Europe ; for the great questions to be determined by it, concerning the world's history, w^ere the dominion of the sea and the con- trol of distant countries, the possession of colonies, and, dependent upon these, the increase of wealth. Singularly enough it is not till nearly the end of the long contest that great fleets are found engaging, and the struggle transferred to its proper field, the sea. The action of sea power is evi- dent enough, the issue plainly indicated from the beginning ; but for a long time there is no naval warfare of any conse- quence, because the truth is not recognized by the French government. The movement toward colonial extension by France is wholly popular, though illustrated by a few great names ; the attitude of the rulers is cold and mistrustful : hence came neglect of the navy, a foregone conclusion of defeat on the main question, and destruction for the time of her sea power. Such being the character of the coming wars, it is impor- tant to realize the relative positions of the three great powers in those quarters of the world, outside of Europe, where the strife was to engage. ENGLISH AND FRENCH IN NORTH AMERICA. 255 In North America, England now held the thirteen colonies, the original United States, from Maine to Georgia. In these colonies was to be found the highest development of that form of colonization peculiar to England, bodies of free men essentially self-governing and self-dependent, still enthusias- tically loyal, and by occupation at once agricultural, commer- cial, and sea-faring. In the character of their country and its productions, in its long sea-coast and sheltered harbors, and in their own selves, they had all the elements of sea power, which had already received large development. On such a country and such a people the royal navy and army were securely based in the western hemisphere. The English colonists were intensely jealous of the French and Canadians. France held Canada and Louisiana, a name much more extensive in its application then than now, and claimed the entire valley of the Ohio and Mississippi, by right of prior discovery, and as a necessary link between the St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Mexico. There was as yet no adequate occu- pation of this intermediate country, nor was the claim ad- mitted by England, whose colonists asserted the right to extend indefinitely westward. The strength of the French position was in Canada ; the St. Lawrence gave them access to the heart of the country, and though Newfoundland and Nova Scotia had been lost, in Cape Breton Island they still held the key of the gulf and river. Canada had the char- acteristics of the French colonial system planted in a climate least suited to it. A government paternal, military, and monkish discouraged the development of individual enter- prise and of free association for common ends. The colo- nists abandoned commerce and agriculture, raising only food enough for immediate consumption, and were given to arms and hunting. Their chief traffic was in furs. There was so little mechanical art among them that they bought of the English colonies part of the vessels for their interior navi- gation. The chief element of strength was the military, arms-bearing character of the population ; each man was a soldier. 256 SPANISH, ENGLISH, AND FRENCH Besides the hostility inlierited from the mother-countries, there was a necessary antagonism between two social and political systems, so directly opposed, and lying one along- side the other. The remoteness of Canada from the West Indies, and the inhospitable winter climate, made it, from the naval point of view, of much less value to France than the English colonies to England ; besides wdiich the resources and population were greatly inferior. In 1750 the population of Canada was eighty thousand, that of the English colonies twelve hundred thousand. With such disparity of strength and resources, the only chance for Canada lay in the support of the sea power of France, either by direct control of the neighboring seas, or by such powerful diversion elsewhere as would relieve the pressure upon her. On the continent of North America, in addition to Mexico and the countries south of it, Spain held Florida ; under which name were embraced extensive regions beyond the peninsula, not accurately defined, and having little impor- tance at any period of these long wars. In the West Indies and South America, Spain held mainly what are still known as Spanish American countries, besides Cuba, Porto Rico, and part of Hayti ; France had Guadeloupe, Martinique, and the western half of Hayti ; England, Jamaica, Barbadoes, and some of the smaller islands. The fertile char- acter of the soil, the commercial productions, and the less rigorous climate would seem to make these islands objects of particular ambition in a colonial war ; but as a matter of fact no attempt was made, nor, except as to Jamaica, which Spain wished to recover, was any intention entertained of conquering any of the larger islands. The reason probably was that Eng- land, whose sea power made her the principal aggressor, was influenced in the direction of her efforts by the wishes of the great body of Englishmen on the North American continent. The smaller West India islands are singly too small to be strongly held except by a power controlling the sea. They had a twofold value in war : one as offering military positions for such a power ; the other a commercial value, either as adding to PENINSTLA OF INDIA AND CEYLON .

War directed against them may be considered as a war upon com- merce, and the islands themselves as ships or convoys loaded with enemy's wealth. They will be found therefore changing hands like counters, and usually restored when peace comes ; though the final result was to leave most of them in the hands of England. Nevertheless, the fact of each of the great powers having a share in this focus of commerce drew thither both large fleets and small squadrons, a tendency aided by the un- favorable seasons for military operations on the continent ; and in the West Indies took place the greater number of the fleet-actions that illustrated this long series of wars. In yet another remote region was the strife between Eng- land and France to be waged, and there, as in North America, finally decided by these wars. In India, the rival nations were represented by their East India companies, who di- rectly administered both government and commerce. Back of them, of course, were the mother-countries; but in imme- diate contact with the native rulers were the presidents and officers appointed by the companies. At this time the prin- cipal settlements of the English were, — on the west coast, Bombay ; on the east, Calcutta upon the Ganges, at some dis- tance from tlie sea, and Madras ; while a little south of Madras another town and station, known generally to the English as Fort St. David, though sometimes called Cuddalore, had been established later. The three presidencies of Bombay, Calcutta, and Madras were at this time mutually independent, and responsible only to the Court of Directors in England. Prance was established at Chandernagore, on the Ganges, above Calcutta ; at Pondicherry, on the east coast, eighty miles south of Madras; and on the west coast, far to the south of Bombay, she had a third station of inferior importance, called Mahd. The French, however, had a great advantage in the possession of the intermediate station already pointed out in the Indian Ocean, the neighboring islands of France and Bourbon. They were yet more fortunate in the personal character of the two men who were at this time at the head 17 258 DUPLEIX AND LA BOURDONNAIS. of their affairs in the Indian peninsula and the islands, Du- pleix and La Bourdonnais, — men to whom no rivals in ability or force of character had as yet appeared among the English Indian oflticials. Yet in these two men, whose cordial fellow- working might have ruined the English settlement in India, there appeared again that singular conflict of ideas, that hesi- tation between the land and the sea as the stay of power, a prophecy of which seems to be contained in the geographical position of France itself. The mind of Dupleix, though not inattentive to commercial interests, was fixed on building up a great empire in which France should rule over a multitude of vassal native princes. In the pursuit of this end he dis- played great tact and untiring activity, pei'haps also a some- what soaring and fantastic imagination ; but when he met La Bourdonnais, whose simpler and sounder views aimed at sea supremacy, at a dominion based upon free and certain communication with the home country instead of the shifting sands of Eastern intrigues and alliances, discord at once arose. " Naval inferiority," says a French historian who considers Dupleix to have had the higher aims, " was the principal cause that arrested his progress ; " ^ but naval superiority was pre- cisely the point at M'hich La Bourdonnais, himself a seaman and the governor of an island, aimed. It may be that with the weakness of Canada, compared to the English colonies, sea power could not there have changed the actual issue ; but in the condition of the rival nations in India everything depended upon controlling the sea. Such were the relative situations of the three countries in the principal foreign theatres of war. No mention has been made of the colonies on the west coast of Africa, because they were mere trading stations having no military importance. The Cape of Good Hope was in possession of the Dutch, who took no active part in the earlier wars, but long maintained toward England a benevolent neutrality, surviving from the alliance in the former wars of the century. It is necessary to mention briefly the condition of the military navies, which 1 Martin : History of France. ENGLISH AND FRENCH NAVIES IN I74O. 259 were to have an importance as yet unrealized. Neither pre- cise numbers nor an exact account of condition of the shijjS, can be given ; but the relative efficiency can be fairly esti- mated. Campbell, the English contemporary naval historian, says that in 1727 the English navy had eighty four ships-of- the-line, from sixty guns up ; forty 50-gun ships, and fifty-four frigates and smaller vessels. In 1734 this number had fallen to seventy ships-of-the-line and nineteen 50-gun ships. In 1744, after four years of war with Spain alone, the number was ninety ships-of-the-line and eighty-four frigates. The French navy at the same time he estimates at forty-five ships- of-the-line and sixty-seven frigates. In 1747, near the end of tlie first war, he says that the royal navy of Spain was reduced to twenty-two ships-of-the-line, that of France to thirty-one, while the English had risen to one hundred and twenty-six. The French writers consulted are less precise in their figures, but agree in representing not only that the navy was reduced to a pitiful number of sliips, but that these were in bad condition and the dock-yards destitute of mate- rials. This neglect of the navy lasted more or less through- out these wars, until 1760, when the sense of the nation was aroused to the importance of restoring it ; too late, however, to prevent the most serious of the French losses. In England as well as in France discipline and administration had been sapped by the long peace ; the inefficiency of the armaments sent out was notorious, and recalls the scandals that marked the outbreak of the Crimean War; while the very disappear- ance of the French ships led, by the necessity of replacing them, to putting afloat vessels superior singly, because more modern and scientific, to the older ships of the same class in England. Care must be had, however, in accepting too easily the complaints of individual writers ; French authors will be found asserting that English ships are faster, while at the same period Englishmen complain that they are slower. It may be accepted as generally true that the French ships built between 1740 and 1800 Avere better designed and larger, class for class, than the English. The latter had the un- 2G0 ENGLISH AND FRENCH NAVIES IN lllfi. doubted superiority both in the number and quality of the seamen and officers. Keeping some fleets always afloat, whether better or worse, the officers could not quite lose touch of their profession : whereas in France it is said that not one fifth of the officers were, in 1744, employed. This superiority was kept and increased by the practice, which henceforth obtained, of blockading the French military ports with superior force ; the enemy's squadrons when they put to sea found themselves at once at a disadvantage in point of practical skill. On the other hand, large as was the number of English seamen, the demands of commerce were so great that war found them scattered all over the world, and part of the fleet was always paralyzed for lack of crews. This con- stant employment assured good seamanship, but the absence of so many men had to be supplied by an indiscriminate press, which dragged in a class of miserable and sickly men, sadly diluting the quality of the whole. To realize the con- dition of ships' companies of that day, it will be necessary only to read the accounts of those sent to Anson starting for a cruise round the world, or to Hawke when fitting out for war service ; the statements are now almost incredible, and the results most deplorable. It was not a question of sanitation only ; the material sent was entirely unfit to meet the conditions of sea life under the most favoraWe circum- stances. In both the French and English service a great deal of weeding among the officers was necessary. Those were the palmy days of court and political influence ; and, moreover, it is not possible, after a long peace, at once to pick out from among the fairest-seeming the men who will best stand the tests of time and exposure to the responsibilities of war. There was in both nations a tendency to depend upon officers who had been in their prime a generation before, and the results were not fortunate. "War having been declared against Spain by England in October, 1739, the first attempts of the latter power were naturally directed against the Spanish-American colonies, the cause of the dispute, in which it was expected to find an EXPEDITIONS OF VERNON AND ANSON. 261 easy and rich prey. The first expedition sailed under Ad- miral Yernon in November of the same year, and took Porto Bello by a sudden and audacious stroke, but found only the insignificant sum of ten thousand dollars in the port whence the galleons sailed. Returning to Jamaica, Vernon received large reinforcements of ships, and was joined by a land force of twelve thousand troops. With this increased force, at- tempts were made upon both Cartagena and Santiago de Cuba, in the years 1741 and 1742, but in both wretched fail- ures resulted ; the admiral and the general quarrelled, as was not uncommon in days when neither had an intelligent comprehension of the other's business. Marryatt, when char- acterizing such misunderstandings by a humorous exaggera- tion, seems to have had in view this attempt on Cartagena : " The army thought that the navy might have beaten down stone ramparts ten feet thick ; and the navy wondered why the army had not walked up the same ramparts, which were thirty feet perpendicular," Another expedition, justly celebrated for the endurance and perseverance shown by its leader, and famous both for the hardships borne and singular final success, was sent out in 1740 under Anson. Its mission was to pass round Cape Horn and attack the Spanish colonies on the west coast of South America. After many delays, due apparently to bad admin- istration, the squadron finally got away toward the end of 1740. Passing the Cape at the worst season of the year, the ships met a series of tempests of the most violent kind ; the squadron was scattered, never all to meet again, and Anson, after infinite peril, succeeded in rallying a part of it at Juan Fernandez. Two ships had put back to England, a third was lost to the southward of Chiloe. "With the three left to him he cruised along the South American coast, taking some prizes and pillaging the town of Payta, intending to touch near Panama and join hands with Yernon for the capture of that place and the possession of the isthmus, if possible. Learning of the disaster at Cartagena, he then determined to cross the Pacific and waylay the two galleons 262 WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION. that sailed yearly from Acapulco to Manila. In the passage across, one of the two ships now left to him was found in such bad condition that she had to be destroyed. With the other he succeeded in his last undertaking, capturing the great galleon with a million and a half dollars in specie. The expedition, from its many misfortunes, had no mili- tary result beyond the terror and consequent embarrassment caused to the Spanish settlements ; but its very misfortunes, and the calm persistency which worked out a great success from them all, have given it a well-deserved renown. During the year 1740 happened two events which led to a general European war breaking in upon that in which Spain and England were already engaged. In May of that year Frederick the Great became king of Prussia, and in October the emperor Charles VI., formerly the Austrian claimant of the Spanish throne, died. He had no son, and left by will the sovereignty of his estates to his eldest daughter, the cele- brated Maria Theresa, to secure whose succession the efforts of his diplomacy had been directed for many years. This suc- cession had been guaranteed by the European powers ; but the apparent weakness of her position excited the ambitions of other sovereigns. The Elector of Bavaria laid claim to the whole inheritance, in which he was supported by France ; while the Prussian king claimed and seized the province of Silesia. Other powers, large and small, threw in their lot with one or the other ; while the position of England was complicated by her king being also elector of Hanover, and in that capacity hurriedly contracting an obligation of neutrality for the electorate, although English feeling was strongly in favor of Austria. Meanwhile the failure of the Spanish-American expeditions and the severe losses of Eng- lish commerce increased the general outcry against Walpole, who resigned early in 1742. England under the new minis- try became the open ally of Austria ; and Parliament voted not only a subsidy to the empress-queen, but also a body of troops to be sent as auxiliaries to the Austrian Netherlands. At the same time Holland, under English influence, and bound THE NAVIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. 263 like England by previous treaties to support the succession of Maria Theresa, also voted a subsidy. Here occurs again that curious view of international relations before mentioned. Both of these powers thus entered the war against France, but only as auxiliaries to the empress, not as principals ; as nations, except the troo})S actually in the field, they were considered to be still at peace. Such an equivocal situation could in the end have only one result. On the sea France had already assumed the same position of auxiliary to Spain, in virtue of the defensive alliance between the two kingdoms, while affecting still to be at peace with England ; and it is curious to see the gravity with which French writers com- plain of assaults upon French by English ships, upon the plea that there was no open war between the two States. It has already been mentioned that in 1740 a French squadron supported a division of Spanish ships on their way to America, In 1741, Spain, having now entered the continental war as an enemy of Austria, sent a body of fifteen thousand troops from Barcelona to attack the Austrian possessions in Italy. The English admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, sought and found the Spanish fleet ; but with it was a division of twelve French sail-of-the-line, whose commander informed Haddock that he was engaged in the same expedition and had orders to fight, if the Spaniards, though formally at war with Eng- land, were attacked. xA.s the allies were nearly double his force, the English admiral was obliged to go back to Fort Mahon. He was soon after relieved ; and the new admiral, Matthews, held at once the two positions of commander-in- chief in the Mediterranean and English minister at Turin, the capital of the King of Sardinia. In the course of the year 1742 an English captain in his fleet, chasing some Spanish galleys, drove them into the French port of St. Tropez, and following them into the harbor burned them, in spite of tlio so-called neutrality of France. In the same year Matthews sent a division of ships under Commodore Martin to Naples, to compel the Bourbon king to withdraw his contingent of twenty thousand troops serving with the Spanish army in 264 THE NAVIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN. northern Italy against the Austrians. To the attempts to negotiate, Martin replied only by pulling out his watch and giving the government an hour to come to terms. There was nothing for it but submission ; and the English fleet left the harbor after a stay of twenty-four hours, having re- lieved the empress of a dangerous enemy. Henceforward it was evident that the Spanish war in Italy could only be maintained by sending troops through France ; England con- trolled the sea and the action of Naples. These two last incidents, at St. Tropez and Naples, deeply impressed the aged Fleuri, who recognized too late the scope and impor- tance of a well-founded sea power. Causes of complaint were multiplying on both sides, and the moment was fast approach- ing when both France and England must quit the pretence of being only auxiliaries in the war. Before it came to that, however, the controlling sea power and wealth of England again made itself felt by attaching the King of Sardinia to the Austrian cause. Between the dangers and advantages of the French or English alliance the king's action was deter- mined by a subsidy and the promise of a strong English fleet in the Mediterranean ; in return he engaged to enter the war with an army of forty-five thousand men. This compact was signed in September, 1743. In October, Fleuri being now dead, Louis XV. made with Spain a treaty, by which he en- gaged to declare war against England and Sardinia, and to support the Spanish claims in Italy, as also to Gibraltar, Ma- hon, and Georgia. Open war was thus near at hand, but the declaration was still deferred. The greatest sea fight that took place occurred while nominal peace yet existed. In the latter part of 1743 the Infante Philip of Spain had sought to land on the coast of the Genoese Republic, which was unfriendly to the Austrians ; but the attempt had been frustrated by the English fleet, and the Spanish ships forced to retreat into Toulon. They lay there for four months, unable to go out on account of the English superiority. In this di- lemma the court of Spain applied to Louis XV. and obtained an order for the French fleet, under the command of Admiral I I 0 0 fl D 6 0 i ^ I ^ 4 ^ >lfi it <o III ^ . ? 5 !2 — o 6 < ^ ■^^-^ tf7 C7 G9 \ \^ \ X '^ --- tS^ Ca.

The French admiral was ordered not to fire unless he was attacked. In order to secure the hest co-operation of the Spaniards, whose efficiency he probably distrusted, De Court proposed, as Ruyter had done in days long gone by, to scat- ter their ships among his own; but as the Spanish admiral, Navarro, refused, the line-of-battle was forjned with nine French ships in the van, in the centre six French and three Spaniards, in the rear nine Spanish ships ; in all, twenty-seveu. In this order the combined fleets sailed from Toulon Febru- ary 19, 1744:. The English fleet, which had been cruising off Hyeres in observation, chased, and on the 22d its van and centre came up with the allies ; but the rear division was then several miles to windward and astern, quite out of sup- porting distance (Plate YII., r). The wind was easterly, both fleets heading to the southward, and the English had the weather-gage. The numbers Avere nearly equal, the Eng- lish having twenty-nine to the allied twenty-seven; but this advantage was reversed by the failure of the English rear to join. The course of the rear-admiral has been generally at- tributed to ill-will toward Matthews ; for although he proved that in his separated position he made all sail to join, he did not attack later on when he could, on the plea that the sig- nal for the line-of-battle was flying at the same time as the signal to engage; meaning that he could not leave the line to fight without disobeying the order to form line. This tech- nical excuse was, however, accepted by the subsequent court- martial. Under the actual conditions Matthews, mortified and harassed by the inaction of his lieutenant, and fearing that the enemy would escape if he delayed longer, made the signal to engage when his own van was abreast the enemy's cen- tre, and at once bore down himself out of the line and at- tacked with his flag-ship of ninety guns the largest ship in the enemy's line, the " Royal Philip," of one hundred and ten guns, carrying the flag of the Spanish admiral (a). In doing 2GG BATTLE OFF TOULON. this he was bravely supported by his next ahead and astern. The moment of attack seems to have been judiciously chosen; five Spanish ships had straggled far to the rear, leaving their admiral with the support only of his next ahead and astern, while three other Spaniards continued on with the French. The English van stood on, engaging the allied centre, while the allied van was without antagonists. Being thus disen- gaged, the latter was desirous of tacking to windward of the head of the Englisli line, thus putting it between two fires, but was checked by the intelligent action of the three leading English captains, who, disregarding the signal to bear down, kept their commanding position and stopped the enemy's attempts to double. For this they were cashiered by the court-martial, but afterward restored. This circumspect but justifiable disregard of signals was imitated without any justification by all the English captains of the centre, save the admiral's seconds already mentioned, as well as by some of those in the van, who kept up a cannonade at long range while their commander-in-chief was closely and even furiously engaged. The one marked exception was Captain Ilawke, afterward the distinguished admiral, who imitated the example of his chief, and after driving his first antago- nist out of action, quitted his place in the van (b), brought to close quarters (b') a fine Spanish ship that had kept at bay five other English ships, and took her, — the only prize made that day. The commander of the English van, with his seconds, also behaved with spirit and came to close action. It is unnecessary to describe the battle further ; as a military affair it deserves no attention, and its most im- portant result was to bring out the merit of Hawke, whom the king and tlie government always remembered for his share in it. The general inefficiency and wide-spread mis- behavior of the English captains, after five years of declared war, will partly explain the failure of England to obtain from her undoubted naval superiority the results she might have expected in this war — the first act in a forty years' drama — and they give military officers a lesson on the CAUSES OF ENGLISH FAILURE. 2G7 necessity of having their minds prepared and stocked, by study of the conditions of war in their own day, if they would not be found unready and perhaps disgraced in the hour of battle.^ It is not to be supposed that so many Eng- lish seamen misbehayed through so vulgar and rare a defect as mere cowardice; it was unpreparedness of mind and lack of military efficiency in the captains, combined with bad leader- ship on the part of the admiral, with a possible taint of ill will toward him as a rude and domineering superior, that caused this fiasco. Attention may here fitly be drawn to the effect of a certain cordiality and good-will on the part of su- periors toward their subordinates. It is not perhaps essential to military success, but it undoubtedly contributes to the other elements of that success a spirit, a breath of life, which makes possible what would otherwise be impossible ; which reaches heights of devotion and achievement that the strictest dis- cipline, not so enkindled, cannot attain. Doubtless it is a natural gift. The highest example of it possibly ever known among seamen was Nelson. When he joined the fleet just before Trafalgar, the captains who gathered on board the ^ There is not iu modern naval history a more striking warning to the officers of every era, than this battle of Toulon. Coming as it did after a generation of comparative naval inactivity, it tried men's reputation as by fire. The lesson, in the judgment of the author, is the danger of disgraceful failure to men who have neglected to keep themselves prepared, not only in knowledge of their pro- fession, but in the sentiment of what war requires. The average man is not a coward ; but neither is he endowed by nature only with the rare faculty of seiz- ing intuitively the proper course at a critical moment. He gains it, some more, some less, by experience or by reflection. If both have been lacking to him, in- decision will follow; either from not knowing what to do, or from failure to realize that utter self-devotion of himself and liis command are required. Of one of the captains cashiered it is said : " Xo man had ever lived with a fairer or more honorable character previous to the unfortunate event which did such irreparable injury to his reputation. Many of his contemporaries, men in tlie highest popular estimation, who knew him well, could scarcely credit what were indisputably established as facts, and declared, with the utmost astonisliment, ' they believed it next to impossible for Captain Burrish to behave otherwise than as a man of gallantry and intrepidity.' " He had been twenty-five years in service, and eleven afloat as a captain (Charnock's Biographia Navalis). Otlicrs of the condemned men bore fair characters ; and even Richard Xorris, who absconded to avoid trial, had been of respectable repute. 268 RESULTS OF MATTHEWS' S ACTION. flag-ship seemed to forget the rank of their admiral in their desire to testify their joy at meeting him. "This Xelson," wrote Captain Duff, who fell in the battle, " is so lovable and excellent a man, so kindly a leader, that we all wish to ex- ceed his desires and anticipate his orders." He himself was conscious of this fascination and its value, when writing of the battle of the Nile to Lord Howe, he said, " I had the happiness to command a band of brothers." The celebrity attained by Matthews's action off Toulon, cer- tainly not due to the skill with which it was managed, nor to its results, sprang from the clamor at home, and chiefly from the number and findings of the com'ts-martial that followed. Both the admiral and his second, and also eleven captains out of the twenty-nine, had charges preferred against them. The admiral was cashiered because he had broken the line ; that is, because his captains did not follow him when he left it to get at the enemy, — a decision that smacks more of the Irish bull than of the Irish love of fighting. The second was ac- quitted on the technical grounds already given ; he avoided the fault of breaking the line by keeping far enough away. Of the eleven captains one died, one deserted, seven were dis- missed or suspended, two only were acquitted. Nor were the French and Spaniards better pleased ; mutual recriminations passed. Admiral de Court was relieved from his command, while the Spanish admiral was decorated by his government with the title of Marquis de la Victoria, a most extraordinary reward for what was at best a drawn fight. The French, on the other hand, assert that he left the deck on the plea of a very slight wound, and that the ship was really fought by a French captain who happened to be on board. To use a common expression, this battle, the first general action since that off Malaga forty years before, " woke up " the English people and brought about a healthful reaction. The sifting process begun by the battle itself was continued, but the result was reached too late to have its proper effect on the current war. It is rather by its deficient action, than by such conspicuous successes as were attained in earlier and THE LAND WARFARE, ITU-IT^S. 269 later times, that the general value of England's sea power is now shown ; like some precious faculty, scarcely valued when possessed, but keenly missed when withdrawn. Mistress now of the seas rather by the weakness of her enemies than by her own disciplined strength, she drew from that mastery no ade- quate results ; the most solid success, the capture of Cape Bre- ton Island, in 1745, was achieved by the colonial forces of Xew England, to which indeed the royal navy lent valuable aid, for to troops so situated the fleet is the one line of communication. The misconduct off Toulon was repeated by ofticcrs high in command in the West and East Indies, resulting in the latter case in the loss of Madras. Other causes concurred with the effete condition of the naval officers to hamper the action of that sea power which launches out far from home. The con- dition of England itself was insecure ; the cause of the Stuarts was still alive, and though a formidable invasion by fifteen thousand troops under Marshal Saxe, in 1744, was foiled, partly by the English Channel fleet, and partly by a storm which wrecked several of the transports assembled off Dunkirk, with the loss of many lives, yet the reality of the danger was shown in the following year, when the Pretender landed in Scotland with only a few men at his back and the northern kingdom rose with him. His successful invasion was carried well down into England itself ; and sober historians have thought that at one time the chances of ultimate success were rather with than against him. Another serious fetter upon the full use of Eng- land's power was the direction given to the French operations on land and the mistaken means used to oppose them. Neg- lecting Germany, France turned upon the Austrian Nether- lands, a country which England, out of regard to her sea interests, was not willing to see conquered. Her commercial preponderance would be directly threatened by the passing of Antwerp, Ostend, and the Scheldt into the hands of her great rival ; and though her best check against this would have been to seize valuable Frencli possessions elsewhere and hold them as a pledge, the weakness of her government and the present inefficiency of the navy prevented her doing so. 270 '^11^ LAND WARFARE, 17U-17Ji8. The position of Hanover, again, controlled the action of Eng- land ; for though nnitcd only by the tie of a common sov- ereign, the love of that sovereign for his continental dominion, his native country, made itself strongly felt in the councils of a weak and time-serving ministry. It was the disregard of Hanover by the first William Pitt, consequent upon his strong English feeling, that incensed the king and led him so long to resist the demands of the nation that he should be put at the head of affairs. These different causes — dissension at home, interest in the Netherlands, regard for Hanover — combined to prevent a subservient and second-rate ministry, divided also among themselves, from giving a proper direc- tion and infusing a proper spirit into the naval war ; but a better condition of the navy itself, more satisfactory results from it, might have modified even their action. As it was, the outcome of the war was almost nothing as regards the disputes between England and her special enemies. On the continent, the questions after 1745 reduced themselves to two, — what part of the Austrian possessions should be given to Prussia, Spain, and Sardinia, and how peace was to be wrenched by France from England and Holland. The sea countries still, as of old, bore the expenses of the war, which however now fell chiefly upon England. Marshal Saxe, who commanded the French in Flanders throughout this war, summed up the situation in half a dozen words to his king. " Sire," said he, " peace is within the walls of Maestricht." This strong city opened the course of the Meuse and the way for the French army into the United Provinces from the rear ; for the English fleet, in conjunc- tion with that of Holland, prevented an attack from the sea. By the end of 1746, despite the efforts of the allies, nearly all Belgium was in the hands of the French; but up to this time, although Dutch subsidies were supporting the Austrian government, and Dutch troops in the Netherlands were fighting for it, there was nominal peace between the United Provinces and France. In April, 1747, " the King of France invaded Dutch Flanders, announcin"; that he was WAR IN THE NETHERLANDS. 271 obliged to send his army into the territory of the republic, to arrest the protection granted by the States-General to the Austrian and English troops ; but that he had no intention of breaking with it, and that the places and provinces occu- pied would be restored to the United Provinces as soon as they gave proof that they had ceased to succor the enemies of France." This was actual, but not formal, war. Numer- ous places fell during the year, and the successes of the French inclined both Holland and England to come to terms. Negotiations went on during the winter ; but in April, 1748, Saxe invested Maestricht. This forced a peace. Meanwliile, though languishing, the sea war was not wholly uneventful. Two encounters between English and French squadrons happened during the year 1747, completing the destruction of the French figliting navy. In both cases the English were decidedly superior ; and though there was given opportunity for some brilliant fighting by particular captains, and for the display of heroic endurance on the part of the French, greatly outnumbered but resisting to the last, only one tactical lesson is afforded. This lesson is, that when an enemy, either as the result of battle or from original in- equality, is greatly inferior in force, obliged to fly without standing on the order of his flying, the regard otherwise due to order must be in a measure at least dismissed, and a general chase ordered. The mistake of Tourville in this respect after Beachy Head has already been noted. In the first of the cases now under discussion, the English Admiral Anson had fourteen ships against eight French, weaker individually as well as in total number; in the second. Sir Edward Hawke had fourteen against nine, the latter being somewhat larger, ship for ship, than the English. In both cases the signal was made for a general chase, and the action which resulted was a milSe. There was no opportunity for anything else ; the one thing necessary was to overtake the running enemy, and that can only certainly be done by letting the fleetest or best situated ships get ahead, sure that the speed of the fastest pursuers is better than that of 272 HAWKE AND U:^TENDUi:RE. the slowest of the pursued, and that therefore either the lat- ter must be abandoned or the whole force brought to bay. In the second case the French commander, Commodore I'Eten- duere, did not have to be followed far. He had with him a convoy of two hundred and fifty merchant-ships ; detaching one ship-of-the-line to continue the voyage with the convoy, he placed himself with the other eight between it and the enemy, awaiting the attack under his topsails. As the English came up one after auother they divided on either side of the French column, which was thus engaged on both sides. After an obstinate resistance, six of the French ships were taken, but the convoy was saved. The English had been so roughly handled that the two remaining French men-of-war got back safely to France. If, therefore. Sir Edward Hawke showed in his attack the judgment and dash which always distin- guished that remarkable officer, it may be claimed for Com- modore I'Etenduere that fortune, in assigning him the glorious disadvantage of numbers, gave him also the leading part in the drama, and that he filled it nobly. A French officer justly remarks that " he defended his convoy as on shore a position is defended, when the aim is to save an army corps or to assure an evolution ; he gave himself to be crushed. After an action that lasted from mid-day till eight P. M. the convoy was saved, thanks to the obstinacy of the defence ; two hundred and fifty ships were saved to their owners by the devotion of L'Etenduere and of the captains under his orders. This devotion cannot be questioned, for eight ships had but few chances of surviving an action with fourteen ; and not only did the commander of the eight accept an action which he might possibly have avoided, but he knew how to inspire his lieutenants with trust in him ; for all supported the strife with honor, and yielded at last, showing the most indisputable proofs of their fine and energetic defence. Four ships were entirely dismasted, two had only the foremast standing." ^ The whole affair, as conducted on both sides, affords an admirable study of how to follow up an advantage, 1 Troude : Batailles Navales de la France. LA BOURDONNAIS AT THE ISLE OF FRANCE. 273 original or acquired, and of the results that may be obtained by a gallant, even hopeless defence, for the furtherance of a particular object. It may be added that Hawke, disabled from further pursuit himself, sent a sloop of war express to the West Indies, ■svith information of the ai)proach of the convoy, — a step which led to the capture of part of it, and gives a touch of completeness to the entire transaction, which cannot fail to be gratifying to a military student interested in seeing the actors in history fully alive to and dischargiug to the utmost their important tasks. Before bringing to a close the story of this war and men- tioning the peace settlement, an account must be given of the transactions in India, where France and England were then on equal terms. It has been said that affairs there were controlled by the East India companies of cither na- tion ; and that the French were represented in the peninsula by Dupleix, in the islands by La Bourdonnais. The latter was appointed to his post in 1735, and his untiring genius had been felt in all the details of administration, but es- pecially in converting the Isle of France into a great naval station, — a work which had to be built up from the foun- dations. Everything was wanting ; everything was by him in greater or less measure supplied, — storehouses, dock-yards, fortifications, seamen. In 1740, when war between France and England became probable, he obtained from the East India Company a squadron, though smaller than he asked, with which he proposed to ruin the English commerce and shipping ; but when war actually began in 1744, he received orders not to attack the English, the French company hoping that neutrality might exist between the companies in that distant region, though the nations were at war. The propo- sition does not seem absurd in view of the curious relations of Holland to France, nominally at peace while sending troops to the Austrian army ; but it was much to the advantage of the English, who were inferior in the Indian seas. Their company accepted the proffer, while saying that it of course could bind neither the home government nor the royal navy. 18 274 DUPLE IX IN INDIA. The advantage won by the forethought of La Bourdonnais was thus lost ; though first, and long alone, on the field, his hand was stayed. Meanwhile the English admiralty sent out a squadron and began to seize French ships between India and China ; not till then did the company awake from its illusion. Having done this part of its work, the English squadron sailed to the coast of India, and in July, 1745, appeared off Pondi- cherry, the political capital of French India, prepared to sus- tain an attack which the governor of Madras was about to make by land. La Bourdonnais' time was now come. Meanwhile, on the mainland of tlie Indian peninsula, Du- pleix had been forming wide views and laying broad founda- tions for the estal)lishraent of French preponderance. Having entered the service of their company at first in a subordinate clerical position, his ability had raised him by rapid steps to be head of the commercial establishments at Chandernagore, to which he gave a very great enlargement, seriously affect- ing, it is said even destroying, parts of the English trade. In 1742 he was made governor-general, and as such removed to Pondicherry. Here lie began to develop his policy, which aimed at bringing India under the power of France. He saw that through the progress and extension of the European races over the seas of the whole world the time had come when the Eastern peoples must be brought into ever-increasing contact with them ; and he judged that India, so often con- quered before, was now about to be conquered by Europeans. He meant that France should win the prize, and saw in Eng- land the only rival. His plan was to meddle in Indian politics : first, as head of a foreign and independent colony, which he already was ; and second, as a vassal of the Great Mogul, which he intended to become. To divide and con- quer, to advance the French lines and influence by judicious alliances, to turn wavering scales by throwing in on one side or the other the weight of French courage and skill, — such were his aims. Pondicherr}', though a poor harbor, was well adapted for his political plans ; being far distant from Delhi, the capital of the Mogul, aggressive extension might INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER.' 275 go on mimarked, until strong enough to Ijcar the light. Duplcix's present aim, therefore, was to build up a great French principality in southeast India, around Pondicherrj, ■uhile maintaining the present positions in Bengal. Let it be noted, however, — and the remark is necessary in order to justify the narration of these plans in connection with our subject, a connection perhaps not at first evident, — that the kernel of the question now before Dupleix was not how to build up an empire out of the Indian provinces and races, but hov,' to get rid of the English, and that finally. The wildest dreams of sovereignty he may have entertained could not have surpassed the actual performance of England a few years later. European qualities were bound to tell, if not offset by the opposition of other Europeans ; and such op- position on the one side or the other depended upon the control of the sea. In a climate so deadly to the white races the small numbers whose heroism bore up the war against fearful odds on many a field must be continually renewed. As everywhere and always, the action of sea power was here q'.iiet and unperceived ; but it will not be necessary to belittle in the least the qualities and career of Clive the English hero of this time and the founder of their empire, in order to prove the decisive influence which it exerted, despite the inefficiency of the English naval officers first engaged, and the lack of conclusive results in such naval battles as were fought.i If during the twenty years following 1743, French 1 " Notwithstanding the extraordinary effort made by the French in sending out M. Lally with a considerable force last year, I am confident before the end of this [1759] they will be near their last gasp in the Carnatic unless some very unforeseen event interpose in their favor. The superioritij of our squadron and the plenty of money and supplies of all kinds which our friends on that coast will be furnished with from this province [Bengal], while the enemy are in total want of everything, without any visible means of redress, are such advan- tages as, if properly attended to, cannot fail of wholly effecting their ruin in that as well as in every otlier part of India" (Letter of Clive to Titt. Calcutta, January 7, 1759; Gleig's Life of Lord Clive). It will be remembered th.it the control and use of Bengal, upon which Clive here counts, had only lately been acquired by the English ; in the days of Dupleix tliey did not possess them. As will be seen later, Clive's predictions in this letter were wholly fulfilled. 276 AFFAIRS IN INDIA, 174G. fleets instead of English had controlled the coasts of the pe- ninsula and the seas between it and Europe, can it be be- lieved that the schemes of Dupleix would have utterly failed ? " Naval inferiority," justly says a French historian, " was the principal cause that arrested the progress of Dupleix. The French royal navy did not make its appearance in the East Indies " in his day. It remains to tell the story briefly. The English, in 1745, made preparations to besiege Pondi- clierry, in which the royal navy was to support the land forces ; but the effects of Dupleix's political schemes were at once seen. The Nabob of the Carnatic threatened to attack Madras, and the English desisted. The following year La Bourdonnais appeared on the scene, and an action took place between his squadron and that under Commodore Peyton ; after which, although it had been a drawn fight, tlie English officer deserted the coast, taking refuge in Ceylon, and leavinp; the control at sea with the French. La Bourdonnais anchored at Pondicherry, where quarrels between him and Dupleix soon arose, and were aggravated by the conflicting tone of their instructions from home. In September he went to Madras, attacked by land and sea, and took the place, but made with the governor the stipulation that it might be ransomed ; and a ransom of two million dollars was accordingly paid. When Dupleix heard of this he was very angry, and claimed to an- nul the terms of capitulation on the ground that, once taken, the place was within his jurisdiction. La Bourdonnais re- sented this attempt as dishonorable to him after the promise given. While the quarrel was going on, a violent cyclone wrecked two of his ships and dismasted the rest. • He soon after returned to France, where his activity and zeal were repaid by three years' imprisonment under charges, from the effects of which treatment he died. After liis departure Dupleix broke the capitulation, seized and kept Madras, drove out the English settlers, and went on to strengthen the fortifi- cations. From Madras he turned against Fort St. David, but the approach of an English squadron compelled him to raise the siege in March, 1747. PEACE OF AIX-LA-CIIAPELLE. 277 During tins year the disasters to the French navy in the Atlantic, already related, left the English undisturbed mas- ters of the sea. In the following winter they sent to India the greatest European fleet yet seen in the East, with a large land force, the whole under the command of Admiral Bos- cawen, who bore a general's commission in addition to his naval rank. The fleet appeared off the Coromandel coast in August, 1748. Pondicherry was attacked by land and sea, but Dupleix made a successful resistance. The English fleet in its turn suffered from a hurricane, and the siege was raised in October. Shortly after came the news of the Peace of Aix- la-Chapelle, which ended the European war. Dupleix, with his home communications restored, could now resume his subtle and persevering efforts to secure a territorial base which should, as far as possible, shelter him from the chances of sea war. Pity that so much genius and patience should have been spent in an effort wholly vain ; nothing could pro- tect against that sea attack but a naval aid, which the home government could not give. One of the conditions of the peace was that Madras should be restored to the English in exchange for Louisburg, the prize won by the North Ameri- can colonists and released by them as reluctantly as Madras M-as by Dupleix. This was indeed illustrating Napoleon's boast that he would reconquer Pondicherry on the bank of the Vistula ; yet, although the maritime supremacy of Eng- land made Louisburg in her hands much stronger than ^la- dras, or any other position in India, when held by the French, the gain by the exchange was decidedly on the side of Great Britain. The English colonists were not men to be contented with this action ; but they knew the naval power of England, and that they could do again what they had done once, at a point not far distant from their own shores. They under- stood the state of the case. Not so with Madras. How pro- found must have been the surprise of the native princes at this surrender, how injurious to the personality of Dupleix and' the influence he had gained among them, to see him, in the very hour of victory, forced, by a power they could not 278 INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER ON understand, to relinquish his spoil! They were quite right: the mysterious power which they recognized by its working, though they saw it not, was not in this or that man, king or statesman, but in that control of the sea which the French government knew forbade the hope of maintaining that dis- tant dependency against the fleets of England. Dupleix him- self saw it not ; for some years more he continued build- ing, on the sand of Oriental intrigues and lies, a house which he vainly hoped would stand against the storms that must descend upon it. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, ending this general war, was signed April 30, 1748, by England, France, and Holland, and finally by all the powers in October of the same year. With the exception of certain portions shorn off the Austrian Empire, — Silesia for Prussia, Parma for the Infante Philip of Spain, and some Italian territory to the east of Piedmont for the King of Sardinia, — the general tenor of the terms was a return to the status before the war. " Never, perhaps, did any war, after so many great events, and so large a loss of blood and treasure, end in replacing the nations engaged in it so nearly in the same situation as they held at first." In truth, as regarded France, England, and Spain, the affair of the Austrian succession, supervening so soon upon tlie out- break of war between the two latter, had wholly turned hostil- ities aside from their true direction and postponed for fifteen years the settlement of disputes which concerned them much more nearly than the accession of Maria Theresa. In the distress of her old enemy, the House of Austria, France was easily led to renew her attacks upon it, and England as easily drawn to oppose the attempts of the French to influence or dictate in German affairs, — a course the more readily fol- lowed from the German interests of the king. It may be questioned whether the true policy for France was to direct the war upon the heart of the Austrian Empire, by way of the Rhine and Germany, or, as she finally did, upon the remote possessions of the Netherlands. In the former case she rested on friendly territory in Bavaria, and gave a hand to Prussia, THE RESULTS OF THE WAR. 279 whose military power was now first felt. Such was the first theatre of the war. On the other hand, in the Netherlands, whither the chief scene of hostilities shifted later, France struck not only at Austria, but also at the sea powers, always jealous of her intrusion there. They were the soul of the war against her, by their subsidies to her other enemies and bv the losses inflicted on her commerce and that of Spain. The misery of France Avas alleged to the King of Spain by Louis XV., as forcing him to conclude peace ; and it is evident that the suffering must have been great to induce him to yield such easy terms as he did, when he already held the Nether- lands and parts of Holland itself by force of arms. But wiiile so successful on the continent, his navy was annihilated and communication with the colonies thus cut off ; and though it may be doubted whether the French government of that day cherished the colonial ambitions ascribed to it by some, it is certain French commerce was suffering enormously. While this was the condition of France, impelling her to peace, England in 1747 found that, from disputes about trade in Spanish America and through the inefficient action of her navy, she had been led away into a continental war, in which she had met with disaster, incurred nearly £80,000,000 of debt, and now saw her ally Holland threatened with inva- sion. The peace itself was signed under a threat by the French envoy that the slightest delay would be the signal for the French to destroy the fortifications of the captured towns and at once begin the invasion. At the same time her own resources were drained, and Holland, exhausted, was seeking to borrow from her. " Money," we are told, " was never so scarce in the city, and cannot be had at twelve per cent." Had France, therefore, at this time had a navy able to make head against that of England, even though somewhat infe- rior in strength, she might, with her grip on the Netherlands and Maestricht, have exacted her own conditions. England, on the other hand, though driven to the wall on the conti- nent, was nevertheless able to obtain peace on equal terms, through the control of the sea by her navy. 280 INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER. The commerce of all three nations had suffered enor- mously, but the balance of prizes in favor of Great Britain was estimated at .£2,000,000. Stated in another way, it is said that the combined losses of French and Spanish com- merce amounted during the war to 3,434 ships, the English to 3,238 ; but in considering such figures, the relation they bear to the total merchant shipping of either nation must not be forgotten. A thousand vessels were a very much larger fraction of French shipping than of English, and meant more grievous loss. " After the disaster to the squadron of L'Etenduere," says a French writer, '• the French flag did not appear at sea. Twenty- two ships-of-the-line composed the navy of France, which sixty years before had one hundred and twenty. Privateers made few prizes ; followed everywhere, unprotected, they almost always fell a prey to the English. The British naval forces, without any rivals, I)assed unmolested over the seas. In one year they are said to have taken from French commerce £7,000,000 sterling. Yet this sea power, which might have seized French and Spanish colonies, made few conquests from want of unity and persistence in the direc- tion given them." ^ To sum up, France was forced to give up her conquests for want of a navy, and England saved her position by her sea power, though she had failed to use it to the best advantage. 1 Lapeyrouse-Boufils : Hist, de la Marine Frangaise.

'npHE urgency with which peace was desired by the prin- -■■ cipal parties to the War of the Austrian Succession may perhaps be inferred from the neglect to settle definitely and conclusively many of the questions outstanding between them, and notably the very disputes about which the war between England and Spain began. It seems as though the powers feared to treat thoroughly matters that contained the germs of future quarrels, lest the discussion should prolong the war that then existed. England made peace because the fall of Holland was otherwise inevitable, not because she had enforced, or surrendered, her claims of 1739 against Spain. The right of uninterrupted navigation in West Indian seas, free from any search, was left undetermined, as were other kindred matters. Not only so, but the boundaries between the English and French colonies in the valley of the Ohio, toward Canada, and on the land side of the Nova Scotian peninsula, remained as vague as they had before been, it was plain that peace could not last ; and by it, if she had saved Holland, England surrendered the control of the sea which she had won. The true character of the strife, shrouded for a moment by the continental war, was revealed by the so- called peace ; though formally allayed, the contention con- tinued in every part of the world. In India, Dupleix, no longer able to attack the English openly, sought to undermine their power by the line of policy 282 RECALL OF DUPLE IX. already described. Mingling adroitly in the quarrels of sur- rounding princes, and advancing his own power while so doing, he attained by rapid steps to the political control, in 1751, of the southern extremity of India, — a country nearly as large as France. Given the title of Nabob, he now had a place among the princes of the land. " A merely commer- cial policy was in his eyes a delusion ; there could be no middle course between conquest and abandonment." In the course of the same year further grants extended the French power through extensive regions to the north and east, em- bracing all the coast of Orissa, and made Dupleix ruler of a third of India. To celebrate his triumphs, perhaps also in accordance with his policy of impressing the native mind, he now founded a town and put up a pillar setting forth his successes. But his doings caused the directors of the com- pany only disquietude ; instead of the reinforcements he asked for they sent him exhortations to peace ; and at about this time Robert Clive, then but twenty-six years old, began to show his genius. The success of Dupleix and his allies became checkered with reverses ; the English under dive's leadership supported the native opponents of the French. The company at home was but little interested in his political schemes, and was annoyed at the failure of dividends. Nego- tiations were opened at London for a settlement of difficulties, and Dupleix was summoned home ; the English government, it is said, making his recall an absolute condition of con- tinued peace. Two days after his departure, in 1754, his successor signed a treaty with the English governor, wholly abandoning his policy, stipulating that neither company should interfere in the internal politics of India, and that all possessions acquired during the war in the Carnatic should be given back to the Mogul. What France thus surrendered was in extent and population an empire, and the mortification of French historians has branded the concession as ignominious ; but how could the country have been held, with the English navy cutting off the eagerly desired reinforcements ? In North America, the declaration of peace was followed by AGITATION IN NORTH AMERICA. 283 renewed agitation, which sprang from and betokened the deep feeling and keen sense of the situation had by the colonists and local authorities on either side. The Americans held to their points with the stubbornness of their race. " There is uo repose for our thirteen colonies," wrote Franklin, " so long- as the French are masters of Canada." Tiie rival claims to the central unsettled region, which may accurately enough be called the valley of the Ohio, involved, if the English were successful, the military separation of Canada from Louisiana ; while on the other hand, occupation by the French, linking the two extremes of their acknowledged possessions, would shut up the English colonists between the Alleghany Moun- tains and the sea. The issues were apparent enough to leading Americans of that day, though they were more far- reaching than the wisest of them could iiave foreseen ; there is room for curious speculation as to the effect, not only upon America, but upon the whole world, if the French govern- ment had had the will, and the French people the genius, effectively to settle and hold the northern and western regions which they then claimed. But while Frenchmen upon the spot saw clearly enough the coming contest and the terrible disadvantage of unequal numbers and inferior navy under which Canada must labor, the home government was blind alike to the value of the colony and to the fact that it must be fought for ; while the character and habits of the French settlers, lacking in political activity and unused to begin and carry through measures for the protection of their own interests, did not remedy the neglect of the mother- country. The paternal centralizing system of French rule had taught the colonists to look to the mother-country, and then failed to take care of them. The governors of Canada of that day acted as careful and able military men, doing what they could to supply defects and weaknesses ; it is possible that their action was more consistent and well-planned than that of the English governors ; but with the carelessness of both home governments, nothing in the end could take the place of the capacity of the English colonists to look out for them- 284 ARMED COLLISIONS IN AMERICA. selves. It is odd and amusing to read the conflicting state- ments of English and French historians as to the purposes and aims of the opposing statesmen in these years when the first murmurings of the storm were heard ; the simple truth seems to be that one of those conflicts familiarly known to us as irrepressible was at hand, and that both governments would gladly have avoided it. The boundaries might be un- determined ; the English colonists were not. The French governors established posts where they could on the debatable ground, and it was in the course of a dispute over one of these, in 1754, that the name of Washington first appears in history. Other troubles occurred in Nova Scotia, and both home governments then began to awake. In 1755 Braddock's disastrous expedition was directed against Fort Duquesne, now Pittsburg, where Washington had surren- dered the year before. Later in the year another collision between the English and French colonists happened near Lake Gqorge. Although Braddock's expedition had been first to start, the French government was also moving. In May of the same year a large squadron of ships-of-war, mostly armed en flute, sailed from Brest with three thousand troops, and a new governor, De Vaudreuil, for Canada. Admiral Boscawen had already preceded this fleet, and lay in wait for it off the mouth of the St. Lawrence. There was as yet no open war, and the French were certainly within their rights in sending a garrison to their own colonies ; but Boscawen's orders were to stop them. A fog which scattered the French squadron also covered its passage ; but two of the ships were seen by the English fleet and captured, June 8, 1755. As soon as this news reached Europe, the French ambassador to London was recalled, but still no declaration of war followed. In July, Sir Edward Hawke was sent to sea with orders to cruise between Ushant and Cape Finisterre, and to seize any French ships-of-the-line he might see ; to which were added 1 That is, with the guns on board, but for the most part not mounted on tlieir carriages, in order to give increased accommodation for troops. When the troops were landed, the guns were mounted. EXPEDITION AGAINST MINORCA. 285 in August further orders to take all French ships of every kind, men-of-war, privateers, and merchantmen, and to send them into English ports. Before the end of the year, three hundred trading vessels, valued at six million dollars, had been captured, and six thousand French seamen were impris- oned in England, — enough to man nearly ten ships-of-the-line. All this was done while nominal peace still existed. War was not declared until six months later. France still seemed to submit, but she was biding her time, and preparing warily a severe stroke for which she had now ample provocation. Small squadrons, or detachments of ships, continued to be sent to the West Indies and to Canada, while noisy preparations were made in the dock-yard of Brest, and troops assembled upon the shores of the Channel. England saw herself threatened with invasion, — a menace to which her people have been peculiarly susceptible. The government of the day, weak at best, was singularly unfit for waging war, and easily misled as to the real danger. Besides, England was embarrassed, as always at the beginning of a war, not only by the numerous points she had to protect in addition to her commerce, but also by the absence of a large number of her seamen in trading-vessels all over the world. The Mediterranean was therefore neglected ; and the French, while making loud demonstrations on the Channel, quietly equipped at Toulon twelve ships-of-the-line, whicii sailed on the 10th of April, 1756, under Admiral la Galissoniere, con- voying one hundred and fifty transports with fifteen thou- sand troops, commanded by the Duke of Richelieu. A week later the army was safely landed in Alinorca, and Port Mahon invested, while the fleet established itself in blockade before the harbor. Practically this was a complete surprise ; for though the suspicions of the English government had been at last aroused, its action came too late. The garrison had not been reinforced, and numbered a scant three thousand men, from which thirty-five officers were absent on leave, among them the governor and the colonels of all the regiments. Admiral 280 BYNG'S ACTION OFF MTXORCA. Bjng sailed from Portsmouth with ton ships-of-the-linc only three days before the French left Toulon. Six weeks later, when he reached the neighborhood of Port Mahon, his fleet had been increased to thirteen ships-of-the-line, and he had with him four thousand troops. It was already late ; a practicable breach had been made in the fortress a week before. When the English fleet came in sight, La Galissoniere stood out to meet it and bar the entrance to the harbor. The battle that followed owes its historical celebrity wholly to the singular and tragic event which arose from it. Unlike Matthews's battle off Toulon, it does afford some tactical in- struction, though mainly applicable to the obsolete conditions of warfare under sail ; but it is especially linked to the earlier action through the effect produced upon the mind of the unfor- tunate Byng by the sentence of the court-martial upon Mat- thews. During the course of the engagement he repeatedly alluded to the censure upon that admiral for leaving the line, and seems to have accepted the judgment as justifying, if not determining, his own course. Briefly, it may be said that the two fleets, having sighted each other on the morning of the 20th of May, were found after a series of manoeuvres both on the port tack, with an easterly wind, heading southerly, the French to leeward, between the English and the harbor. Byng ran down in line ahead off the wind, the French remaining by it, so that when the former made the signal to engage, the fleets were not parallel, but formed an angle of from thirty to forty degrees (Plate Vila. A, A). The attack which Byng by his own account meant to make, each ship against its opposite in the enemy's line, difficult to carry out under any circumstances, was here further impeded by the distance between the two rears being much greater than that between the vans ; so that his whole line could not come into action at the same mo- ment. When the signal was made, the van ships kept away in obedience to it, and ran down for the French so nearly head-on (B, B) as to sacrifice their artillery fire in great measure ; they received three raking broadsides, and were BYXG'S ACTION OFF MINORCA. 287 seriously dismantled aloft. The sixth English ship, counting from the van, had her foretopmast shot away, flew up into the wind, and came aback, stopping and doubling up the rear of tlie line. Then undoubtedly was the time for Byng, hav- ing committed himself to the fight, to have set the example and borne down, just as Farragut did at Mobile when his line was confused by the stopping of the next ahead ; but accord- ing to the testimony of the flag-captain, Matthows's sentence deterred him. " You see, Captain Gardiner, that the signal for the line is out, and that I am ahead of the ships ' Louisa ' and ' Trident ' [which in the order should have been ahead of him]. You would not have me, as the admiral of the fleet, run down as if I were going to engage a single ship. It was Mr. Matthews's misfortune to be prejudiced by not carrying down his force together, which I shall endeavor to avoid." The affair thus became entirely indecisive ; the English van was separated from the rear and got the brunt of the fight (C). One French authority blames Galissoniere for not tack- ing to windward of the enemy's van and crushing it. Anotlier says he ordered the movement, but that it could not be made from the damage to the rigging ; but this seems imi)robable, as the only injury the French squadron underwent aloft was the loss of one topsail yard, whereas the English suffered very badly. The true reason is probably that given and approved by one of the French authorities on naval warfare. Galissoniere considered the support of the land attack on Mahon paramount to any destruction of the English fleet, if he thereby exposed his own. " The French navy has always preferred the glory of assuring or preserving a conquest to that more brilliant perhaps, but actually less real, of taking some ships, and therein has approached more nearly the true end that has been proposed in war." ^ The justice of this conclusion depends upon the view that is taken of the true end of naval war. If it is merely to assure one or more posi- tions ashore, the navy becomes simply a brancli of the army for a particular occasion, and subordinates its action accord- 1 Eamatuelle : Tactique Xavale. 288 FRENCH NAVAL POLICY. ingly; but if the true end is to preponderate over the enemy's navy and so control the sea, then the enemy's ships and fleets are the true objects to be assailed on all occasions. A glim- mer of this view seems to have been present to Morogues when he wrote that at sea tiiere is no field of battle to be held, nor places to be won. If naval warfare is a war of posts, then the action of the fleets must be subordinate to the attack and defence of the posts ; if its object is to break up the enemy's power on the sea, cutting off his communica- tions with the rest of his possessions, drying up the sources of his wealth in his commerce, and making possible a closure of his ports, then the object of attack must be his organized military forces afloat ; in short, his navy. It is to the latter course, for whatever reason adopted, that England owed a control of the sea that forced the restitution of Minorca at the end of this war. It is to the former that France owed the lack of prestige in her navy. Take this very case of Minorca ; had Galissoniere been beaten, Richelieu and his fifteen thousand troops must have been lost to France, cooped up in Minorca, as the Spaniards, in 1718, were confined to Sicily. The Frencli navy therefore assured the capture of the island ; but so slight was the impression on the ministry and the public, that a French naval officer tells us : " Incredible as it may seem, the minister of marine, after the glorious affair off Mahon, instead of yielding to the zeal of an enlightened patriotism and profiting by the impulse which this victory gave to France to build up the navy, saw fit to sell the ships and rigging which we still had in our ports. We shall soon see the deplorable consequences of this cowardly conduct on the part of our statesmen." ^ Neither the glory nor the vic- tory is very apparent ; but it is quite conceivable that had the French admiral thought less of Mahon and used the great advantage luck had given him to take, or sink, four or five of the enemy, the French people would have anticipated the outbreak of naval enthusiasm which appeared too late, in 1760. During the remainder of this war the French fleets, * Lapeyrouse-Bonflls : Hist, de la Marine. FRENCH NAVAL POLICY. 289 except in the East Indies, appear only as the pursued in a general chase. The action imposed upon the French fleets was, however, consistent with the general policy of the French government ; and John Clerk was probably right in saying that there is apparent in this action off Minorca a tactics too well dclined to be merely accidental, — a tactics essentially defensive in its scope and aim.i In assuming the lee-gage the French ad- miral not only covered Mahon, but took a good defensive posi- tion, imposing upon his enemy the necessity of attacking with all the consequent risks. Clerk seems to bring evidence enough to prove that the leading French ships did, after roughly handling their assailants, astutely withdraw (C) thus forcing the latter to attack again with like results. The same policy was repeatedly followed during the Ameri- can war twenty years later, and with pretty uniform success ; so much so that, although formal avowal of the policy is wanting, it may be concluded that circumspection, economy, defensive war, remained the fixed purpose of the French authorities, based doubtless upon the reasons given by Ad- miral Grivel, of that navy : — • " If two maritime powers are at strife, tlie one that has the fewest ships must always avoid doubtful engagements ; it must run only those risks necessary for carrying out its missions, avoid action by manojuvring, or at worst, if forced to engage, assure itself of favorable conditions. The attitude to be taken should depend radically upon the power of your opponent. Let us not tire of repeating, accord- ing as she has to do with an inferior or superior power, France has before her two distinct strategies, radically opposite both in means and ends, — Grand War and Cruising War." Such a formal utterance by an officer of rank must be re- ceived with respect, and the more so when it expresses a consistent policy followed by a great and warlike nation ; yet it may be questioned whether a sea power worthy of the name can thus be secured. Logically, it follows from the position assumed, that combats between equal forces arc to be discour- 1 Clerk : Naval Tactics. 19 290 EXECUTION OF ADMIRAL BYNG. aged, because the loss to you is greater than tlie loss to your opponent. " In fact," says Ramatuelle, upholding the French policy, " of what consequence to the English would be the loss of a few ships ? " But the next inevitable step in the argument is that it is better not to meet the enemy. As an- other Frenchman,^ previously quoted, says, it was considered a mishap to their ships to fall in with a hostile force, and, if one was met, their duty was to avoid action if possible to do so honorably. They had ulterior objects of more importance than fighting the enemy's navy. Such a course cannot be consistently followed for years without affecting the spirit and tone of the officers charged with it ; and it led directly to as brave a man as ever commanded a fleet, the Comte de Grasso, failing to crush the English under Rodney when he Had the chance, in 1782. On the 9tli of April of that year, being chased by the English among the Windward' Islands, it happened to him to have sixteen of their fleet under his lee while the main body was becalmed under Dominica. Though greatly superior to the separated ships, during the three hours that this state of things lasted, De Grasse left them undisturbed, except by a distant cannonade by his own van ; and his action was justified. by the court which tried him, in which were many officers of high rank and doubtless of distinction, as being " an act of prudence on the part of the admiral, dictated to him by the ulterior projects of the cruise." Three days later he was signally beaten by the fleet he had failed to attack at disadvantage, and all the ulterior projects of the cruise went down with him. To return to Minorca ; after the action of the 20th, Byng called a council of war, which decided that nothing more could be done, and that the English fleet should go to Gib- raltar and cover that place from an attack. At Gibraltar, Byng was relieved by Hawke and sent home to be tried. The court-martial, while expressly clearing him of cowardice or disaffection, found him guilty of not doing his utmost either to defeat the French fleet or to relieve the garrison at Mahon ; 1 Jurien de la Graviere : Guerres Maritimes. ENGLISH MARITIME PROSPERITY. 291 and, as the article of war prescribed death with no alterna- tive punishment for this offence, it felt compelled to sentence him to death. The king refused to pardon, and Byng was accordingly shot. The expedition against Minorca was begun while nominal peace still lasted. On the ITtli of May, three days before Byng's battle, England declared war, and France replied on the 20th of June. On the 28th, Port Malion surrendered, and Minorca passed into the hands of France. The nature of tlie troubles between the two nations, and the scenes wliere they occurred, pointed out clearly enough the proper theatre of the strife, and we should by rights now be at the opening of a sea war, illustrated by great naval actions and attended with great modifications in the colonial and foreign possessions of the two powers. Of the two, England alone recognized the truth ; France was again turned aside from the sea by causes which will shortly be given. Her fleets scarcely appeared ; and losing the control of the sea, she surrendered one by one her colonies and all her hopes in India. Later in the struggle she drew in Spain as her ally, but it was only to involve that country in her own external ruin. England, on the other hand, defended and nourished by the sea, rode it everywhere in triumph. Secure and pros- perous at home, she supported with her money the enemies of France. At the end of seven years the kingdom of Great Britain had become the British Empire. It is far from certain that France could have successfully contended with England on the sea, without an ally. In 1756 the French navy had sixty-three ships-of-the-line, of which forty-five were in fair condition ; but equipments and artillery were deficient. Spain had forty-six ships-of-the-line ; but from the previous and subsequent performances of the Span- ish navy, it may avcU be doubted if its worth were equal to its numbers. England at this time had one hundred and thirty ships-of-the-line ; four years later she had one hundred and twenty actually in commission. Of course when a nation allows its inferiority, whether on land or sea, to become 292 SEVEN YEARS' WAR BEGINS. as great as that of France now was, it cannot hope for success. Nevertheless, she obtained advantages at first. The con- quest of Minorca was followed in November of the same year by the acquisition of Corsica. The republic of Genoa sur- rendered to France all the fortified harbors of the island. With Toulon, Corsica, and Port Mahon, she now had a strong grip on the Mediterranean. In Canada, the operations of 1756, under Montcalm, were successful despite the inferiority of numbers. At the same time an attack by a native prince in India took from the English Calcutta, and gave an oppor- tunity to the French. Yet another incident offered a handle for French states- manship to strengthen her position on the ocean. The Dutch had promised France not to renew their alliance with Eng- land, but to remain neutral. England retaliated by declaring " all the ports of France in a state of blockade, and all vessels bound to those ports liable to seizure as lawful prize." Such a violation of the rights of neutrals can only be undertaken by a nation that feels it has nothing to fear from their rising against it. The aggressiveness, born of the sense of power, which characterized England might have been used by France to draw Spain and possibly other States into alliance against her. Instead of concentrating against England, France began another continental war, this time with a new and extraor- dinary alliance. The Empress of Austria, working on the religious superstitions of the king and upon the anger of the king's mistress, who was piqued at sarcasms uttered against her by Frederick the Great, drew France into an alliance with Austria against Prussia. This alliance was further joined by Russia, Sweden, and Poland. The empress urged that the two Roman Catholic powers should unite to take Silesia away from a Protestant king, and expressed her willingness to give to France a part of her possessions in the Netherlands, which France had always desired. Frederick the Great, learning the combination against him. CAPTURE OF LOUISBURG, 175S. 993 instead of waiting for it to develop, put his armies in motion and invaded Saxony, whose ruler was also King of Poland. This movement, in October, 175G, began the Seven Years' War ; which, like the War of the Austrian Succession, but not to the same extent, drew some of the contestants off from the original cause of difference. But while France, having already on hand one large quarrel with her neighbor across the Channel, was thus needlessly entering upon another struggle, with the avowed end of building up that Austrian empire which a wiser policy had long striven to humble, Eng- land this time saw clearly where her true interests lay. Making the continental war wholly subsidiary, she turned her efforts upon the sea and the colonies ; at tlie same time sui> porting Frederick both with money and cordial sympathy in the war for the defence of his kingdom, which so seriously diverted and divided the efforts of France. England thus had really but one war on hand. In the same year the direc- tion of the struggle Avas taken from the hands of a weak ministry and given into those of the bold and ardent William Pitt, who retained his office till 1761, by which time the ends of the war had practically been secured. In the attack upon Canada there were two principal lines to be chosen, — that by the way of Lake Champlain, and that by the way of the St. Lawrence. The former was entirely inland, and as such does not concern our subject, beyond noting that not till after the fall of Quebec, in 1759, was it fairly opened to the English. In 1757 the attempt against Louisburg failed ; the English admiral being unwilling to engage sixteen ships-of-tlie-line he found there, with tlie fif- teen under his own command, which were also, he said, of inferior metal. Whether he was right in his decision or hot, the indignation felt in England clearly shows the difference of policy underlying the action of the French and English governments. The following year an admiral of a higher spirit, Boscawen, was sent out accompanied with twelve thou- sand troops, and, it must in fairness be said, found only five ships in the port. The troops wxre landed, while the fleet 294 FALL OF CANADA, 17G0. covered the siege from the only molestation it could fear, and cut off from the besieged the only line by which they could look for supplies. The island fell in 1758, opening the way by the St. Lawrence to the heart of Canada, and giving the English a new base both for the fleet and army. The next year the expedition under Wolfe was sent against Quebec. All his operations were based upon the fleet, which not only carried his army to the spot, but moved up and down the river as the various feints required. The landing which led to the decisive action was made directly from the ships. Montcalm, whose skill and determination had blocked the attacks by way of Lake Champlain the two previous years, had written urgently for reinforcements ; but they were re- fused by the minister of war, who replied that in addition to other reasons it was too probable that the English would intercept them on the way, and that the more France sent, the more England would be moved to send. In a word, the possession of Canada depended upon sea power. Montcalm, therefore, in view of the certain attack upon Quebec by the river, was compelled to weaken his resistance on the Champlain route ; nevertheless, the English did not get farther than the foot of the lake that year, and their opera- tions, though creditable, had no effect upon the result at Quebec. In 1760, the English, liolding the course of the St. Law- rence, with Louisburg at one end and Quebec at the other, seemed firmly seated. Nevertheless, the French governor, De Vaudreuil, still held out at Montreal, and the colonists still hoped for help from France. The English garrison at Quebec, though inferior in numbers to the forces of the Cana- dians, was imprudent enough to leave the city and meet them in the open field. Defeated there, and pursued by the enemy, the latter nearly entered Quebec pell-mell with the English troops, and trenches were opened against the city. A few days later an English squadron came in sight, and the place was relieved. " Thus," says the old English chronicler of the navy, " the enemy saw what it was to be inferior at sea ; INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER. 295 for, had a French squadron got the start of the English in sailing up the river, Quebec must have fallen." Wholly cut off now, the little body of Frenchmen that remained in Montreal was surrounded by three English armies, which had come, one by way of Lake Champlain, the others from Oswego and from Quebec. The surrender of the city on the 8th of September, 1760, put an end forever to the French possession of Canada. In all other quarters of the world, after the accession of Pitt to power, the same good fortune followed the English arms, checkered only at the first by some slight reverses. It was not so on the continent, where the heroism and skill of Frederick the Great maintained with difficulty his brilliant struggle against France, Austria, and Russia. The study of the difficulties of his position, of the military and political combinations attending it, do not belong to our subject. Sea power does not appear directly in its effects upon the struggle, but indirectly it w^as felt in two ways, — first, by the subsidies which the abundant wealth and credit of England enabled lier to give Frederick, in whose thrifty and able hands they went far ; and second, in the embarrassment caused to France by the attacks of England upon her colonies and her own sea- coast, in the destruction of her commerce, and in the money — all too little, it is true, and grudgingly given — which France was forced to bestow on her navy. Stung by the constant lashing of the Power of the sea, France, despite the blindness and unwillingness of the rulers, was driven to undertake something against it. With a navy much inferior, unable to cope in all quarters of the world, it was rightly decided to concentrate upon one object ; and the object chosen was Great Britain itself, whose shores were to be invaded. This decision, soon apprehended by the fears of the English nation, caused the great naval operations to centre for some years around the coast of France and in the Channel. Before de- scribing them, it will bo well to sum up the general plan by which England was guided in the use of her overwhelming sea power. 296 ENGLISH NAVAL POLICY, 1756-1763. Besides the operations on the North American continent already described, this plan was fourfold: — 1. The French Atlantic ports were watched in force, espe- cially Brest, so as to keep the great fleets or small squadrons from getting out without fighting. 2. Attacks were made upon the Atlantic and Channel coasts with flying squadrons, followed at times by the descent of small bodies of troops. These attacks, the direction of which could not be foreseen by the enemy, were chiefly in- tended to compel him to keep on hand forces at many points, and so to diminish the army acting against the King of Prus- sia. While the tendency would certainly be that way, it may be doubted whether the actual diversion in favor of Frederick was of much consequence. No particular mention will be made of these operations, which had but little visible effect upon the general course of the war. 3. A fleet was kept in the Mediterranean and near Gib- raltar to prevent the Frencli Toulon fleet from getting round to the Atlantic. It does not appear that any attempt was seriously made to stop communications between France and Minorca. The action of the Mediterranean fleet, though an independent command, was subsidiary to that in the Atlantic, 4. Distant foreign expeditions were sent against the French colonies in the West India Islands and on the coast of Africa, and a squadron was maintained in the East Indies to secure the control of those seas, thereby supporting the English in the Peninsula, and cutting off the communications of the French. These operations in distant waters, never inter- mitted, assumed greater activity and larger proportions after the destruction of the French navy had relieved England from the fear of invasion, and when the ill-advised entrance of Spain into the war, in 1762, offered yet richer prizes to her enterprise. The close blockade of the enemy's fleet in Brest, which was first systematically carried out during this war, may be con- sidered rather a defensive than an offensive operation ; for PROJECTED INVASION OF ENGLAND. 297 though the intention certainly was to fight if opportunity offered, the chief ol)ject was to neutralize an offensive weapon in the enemy's hands ; the destruction of the weapon was secondary. The truth of this remark is shown by the out- burst of fear and anger which swept over England when an unavoidable absence of the blockading fleet in 1759 allowed the French to escape. The effect of the blockade in this and after wars was to keep the French in a state of constant infe- riority in the practical handling of their ships, however fair- showing their outward appearance or equal their numerical force. The position of the port of Brest was such that a blockaded fleet could not get out during the heavy westerly gales that endangered the blockaders ; the latter, therefore, had the habit of running away from them to Torbay or Plymouth, sure, with care, of getting back to their station with an east wind before a large and ill-handled fleet could get much start of them. In the latter part of 1758, France, depressed by the sense of failure upon the continent, mortified and harassed by Eng- lish descents upon her coasts, w^hich had been particularly an- noying that year, and seeing that it was not possible to carry on both the continental and sea wars with her money re- sources, determined to strike directly at England. Her com- merce was annihilated while the enemy's throve. It was the boast of London merchants that under Pitt commerce was united with and made to flourish by war;i and this thriving commerce was the soul also of the land struggle, by the money it lavished on the enemy of France. At this time a new and active-minded minister, Choiseul, was called into power by Louis XV. From the beginning of 1759, preparations were made in the ocean and Channel ports. Flat-boats to transport troops were built at Havre, Dunkirk, Brest, and Rochefort. It was intended to embark as many as fifty thousand men for the invasion of England, while twelve thousand were to be directed upon Scotland. Two squadrons were fitted out, each of respectable strength, 1 Mahnn : Tlistorv of Eiiirlan 1. 298 BOSCAWEN AND DE LA CLUE, 1759. one at Toulon, the other at Brest. The junction of these two squadrons at Brest was the first step in the great enterprise. It was just here that it broke down, through the possession of Gibraltar by the English, and their naval superiority. It seems incredible that even the stern and confident William Pitt should, as late as 1757, have offered to surrender to Spain the watch-tower from which England overlooks the road between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, as the price of her help to recover Minorca. Happily for England, Spain refused. In 1759, Admiral Boscawen commanded the English Mediterranean fleet. In making an attack upon French frigates in Toulon roads, some of his ships were so damaged that he sailed with his w^hole squadron to Gibraltar to refit ; taking the precaution, however, to station lookout frigates at intervals, and to arrange signals by guns to notify him betimes of the enemy's approach. Taking advantage of his absence, and in obedience to orders, the French com- modore, De la Clue, left Toulon with twelve ships-of-the-line on the 5th of August, and on the 1 7th found himself at the Straits of Gibraltar, with a brisk east w ind carrying him out into the Atlantic. Everything seemed propitious, a thick haze and falling night concealing the French ships from the land, while not preventing their sight of each other, when an English frigate loomed up in the near distance. As soon as she saw the fleet, knowing they must be enemies, she hauled in for the land and began firing signal-guns. Pursuit was useless : fliglit alone remained. Hoping to elude the chase he knew must follow, the French commodore steered west-northwest for the open sea., putting out all lights ; but either from carelessness or disaffection, — for the latter is hinted by one French naval officer, — five out of the twelve ships headed to the northward and put into Cadiz when on the following morning they could not see the commodore. The latter was dismayed when at daylight he saw his forces thus diminished. At eight o'clock some sails made their appearance, and for a few minutes he hoped they were the BOSCAWEN AND DE LA CLUE, 1759. 299 missing ships. Instead of that, they were the lookouts of Boscawen's fleet, which, numbering fourteen ships-of-the- line, was in full pursuit. The French formed their order on one of the close-hauled lines, and fled ; but of course their fleet-speed was less tluin that of the fastest English ships. The general rule for all chases where the i)ursuer is decidedly superior, namely, that order must be observed only so far as to keep the leading ships within reasonable supporting dis- tance of the slower ones, so that they may not be singly overpowered before the latter can come up, was by this time well understood in the English navy, and that is certainly the fitting time for a melee. Boscawen acted accordingly. The rear ship of the French, on the other hand, nobly emulated the example of L'Etenduere when he saved his convoy. Overtaken at two o'clock by the leading English ship, and soon after surrounded by four others, her captain made for five hours a desperate resistance, from which he could hope, not to save himself, but to delay the enemies long enough for the better sailers to escape. He so far succeeded that — thanks to the injury done by him and their better speed — they did that day escape action at close quarters, which could only have ended in their capture. When he hauled down his flag, his three topmasts were gone, the mizzen-mast fell immedi- ately after, and the hull was so full of water that the ship was with difficulty kept afloat. M. de Sabran — his name is worthy to be remembered — had received eleven wounds in this gallant resistance, by which he illustrated so signally the duty and service of a rearguard in retarding pursuit. That night two of the French ships hauled off to the westward, and so escaped. The other four continued their flight as before ; but the next morning the commodore, despairing of escape, headed for the Portuguese coast, and ran them all ashore between Lagos and Cape St. Vincent. The English^ admiral followed and attacked them, taking two and burning the others, without regard to the neutrality of Portugal. For this insult no amend was made beyond a formal apology ; Portugal was too dependent upon England to be seriously 300 HAWKE AND CONFLANS, 1759. considered. Pitt, writing to the English minister to Portugal about the affair, told him that while soothing the susceptibili- ties of the Portuguese government he must not allow it to suppose that either the ships would be given up or the dis- tinguished admiral censured.^ The destruction or dispersal of the Toulon fleet stopped the invasion of England, though the five ships that got into Cadiz remained a matter of anxiety to Sir Edward Hawke, who cruised before Brest. Choiseul, balked of his main object, still clung to the invasion of Scotland. The French fleet at Brest, under Marshal de Conflans, a sea officer despite his title, numbered twenty sail-of-the-line, besides frigates. The troops to be embarked are variously stated at fifteen to twenty thousand. The original purpose was to escort the transports with only five ships-of-the-line, besides smaller vessels. Conflans insisted that the whole fleet ought to go. The minister of the navy thought that the admiral was not a sufficiently skilful tactician to be able to check the advance of an enemy, and so insure the safe arrival of the convoy at its destination near the Clyde without risking a decisive encounter. Believing therefore that there would be a gen- eral action, he considered that it would be better to fight it before the troops sailed ; for if disastrous, the convoy would not be sacrificed, and if decisively victorious, tlie road would then be clear. The transjwrts were assembled, not at Brest, but in the ports to the southward as far as the mouth of the Loire. The French fleet therefore put to sea with the expec- tation and purpose of fighting the enemy ; but it is not easy to reconcile its subsequent course with that purpose, nor with the elaborate fighting instructions ^ issued by the admiral before sailing. About the 5th or 6th of November there came on a tremen- dous westerly gale. After buffeting it for three days, Hawke bore up and ran into Torbay, where lie waited for the wind to shift, keeping his fleet in readiness to sail at once. The 1 Mahon : History of England. 2 For these, see Troude : Batailles Xavales. HAWKE AND CONFLAXS, 1759. 301 same gale, while keeping back the French already in Brest, gave the chance to a small squadron under M. Bompart, which was expected from the West Indies, to slip in during llawke's absence. Conflans made his preparations with activity, dis- tributed Bompart's crews among his own ships, which were not very well manned, and got to sea with an easterly wind on the 14th. He stood at once to the southward, flatterins: himself that he had escaped Hawke. The latter, however, had sailed from Torbay on the 12th ; and though again driven back, sailed a second time on the 14th, the same day that Conflans left Brest. He soon reached his station, learned that the enemy had been seen to the southward steering east, and easily concluding that they were bound to Quiberon Bay, shaped his own course for the same place under a press of sail. At eleven p. m. of the 19th the French admiral esti- mated his position to be seventy miles southwest by west from Belle Isle ; ^ and the wind springing up fresh from the west- ward, he stood for it under short sail, the wind continuing to increase and hauling to west-northwest. At daybreak sev- eral ships were seen ahead, which proved to be the English squadron of Commodore Duff, blockading Quiberon. The signal was made to chase; and the English, taking flight, sepa- rated into two divisions, — one going off before the wind, the other hauling up to the southward. The greater part of the French fleet continued its course after the former division, that is, toward the coast ; but one ship hauled up for the second. Immediately after, the rear French ships made signal of sails to windward, which were also visible from aloft on board the flag-ship. It must have been about the same moment that the lookout frigate in advance of the English fleet informed her admiral of sails to leeward. Hawke's diligence had brought him up with Conflans, who, in his official reports, says he had considered it impossible that the enemy could have in that neighborhood forces superior or even equal to his own. Conflans now ordered his rear division to haul its wind in support of the ship chasing to the southward and I See Plate VIIL 302 HAWKE AND COX FLANS, 1759. eastward. In a few moments more it was discovered that tlic fleet to windward numbered twenty-three ships-of-the- line to the French twenty-one, and among them some three- deckers. Conflans then called in the chasing ships and got ready for action. It remained to settle his course under circumstances which he had not foreseen. It was uow blow- ing hard from the west-northwest, with every appearance of heavy weather, the fleet not far from a lee shore, Avith an enemy considerably superior in numbers ; for besides Hawke's twentv-three of the line, Duff had four fifty-gun ships. Con- flans therefore determined to run for it and lead his squadron into Quiberon Bay, trusting and believing that Hawke would not dare to follow, under the conditions of the weather, into a bay which French authorities describe as containing banks and shoals, and lined with reefs which the navigator rarely sees without fright and never passes without emotion. It was in the midst of these ghastly dangers that forty-four large ships were about to engage pell-mell ; for the space was too contracted for fleet manoeuvres. Conflans flattered himself that he would get in first and be able to haul up close under the western shore of the bay, forcing the enemy, if he fol- lowed, to take position between him and the beach, six miles to leeward. None of his expectations were fulfilled. In the retreat he took the head of his fleet ; a step not unjustifiable, since only by leading in person could he have shown just what he wanted to do, but unfortunate for his reputation with the public, as it placed the admiral foremost in the flight. Hawke was not in the least, nor for one moment, deterred by the dangers before him, whose full extent he, as a skilful sea- man, entirely realized ; but his was a calm and steadfast as well as a gallant temper, tliat weighed risks justly, neither dissembling nor exaggerating. He has not left us his rea- soning, but he doubtless felt that the French, leading, would serve partially as pilots, and must take the ground before him ; he believed the temper and experience of his officers, tried by the severe school of the blockade, to be superior to those of the French ; and he knew that both the government Si R 0 1 CQ J 1 3 I Il 8 3 E 1 1 5 Xnvniouv)_ 3 9 1 THE BREST FLEET DISPERSED. 303 and the country demanded that the enemy's fleet should not reach another friendly port in safety. On the very day that he was thus following the French, amid dangers and under conditions that have made this one of the most dramatic of sea fights, he was being burnt in effigy in England for allow- ing them to escape. As Confians, leading his fleet, was round- ing the Cardinals, — as the southernmost rocks at the entrance of Quiberon Bay are called, — the leading English ships brought the French rear to action. It was another case of a general chase ending in a melee, but under conditions of exceptional interest and grandeur from the surrounding circumstances of the gale of wind, the heavy sea, the lee shore, the headlong speed, shortened canvas, and the great number of ships en- gaged. One French seventy-four, closely pressed and out- numbered, ventured to open her lower-deck ports ; the sea sweeping in carried her down with all on board but twenty men. Another was sunk by the fire of Hawke's flag-ship. Two others, one of which carried a commodore's pennant, struck their colors. The remainder were dispersed. Seven fled to the northward and eastward, and anchored off the mouth of the little river Vilaine, into which they succeeded in enteriug at the top of high water in two tides, — a feat never before performed. Seven others took refuge to the southward and eastward in Rochefort. One, after being very badly injured, ran ashore and was lost near the mouth of the Loire. The flag-ship bearing the same name as that of Tourville burned at La Hougue, the " Royal Sun," anchored at nightfall off Croisic, a little to the northward of the Loire, where she rode in safety during the night. The next morn- ing the admiral found himself alone, and, somewhat precipi- tately it would seem, i-an the ship ashore to keep her out of English hands. This step has been blamed by the French, but needlessly, as Hawke would never have let her get away. The great French fleet was annihilated ; for the fourteen ships not taken or destroyed were divided into two parts, and those in the Vilaine only succeeded in escaping, two at a time, between fifteen months and two years later. The 304 ACCESSION OF CHARLES III. English lost two ships which ran upon a shoal (a), and were hopelessly wrecked ; their losses in action were slight. At nightfall Ilawke anchored his fleet and prizes in the position shown in the plate (b). All possibility of an invasion of England passed away with the destruction of the Brest fleet. The battle of November 20, 1759, was the Trafalgar of this war ; and though a block- ade was maintained over the fractions that were laid up in the Vilaine and at Rochefort, the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before. The same year that saw this great sea fight and the fall of Quebec witnessed also the capture of Guadeloupe in the West Indies, of Goree on the west coast of Africa, and the abandonment of the East Indian seas by the French flag after three indecisive actions between their commodore, D'Ache, and Admiral Pocock, — an abandonment which necessarily led to the fall of the French power in India, never again to rise. In this year also the King of Spain died, and his brother succeeded, un- der the title of Charles III. This Charles had been King of Naples at the time when an English commodore had al- lowed one hour for the court to determine to withdraw the Neapolitan troops from the Spanish army. He had never for- gotten this humiliation, and brought to his new throne a heart unfriendly to England. With such feelings on his part, France and Spain drew more readily together. Charles's first step was to propose mediation, but Pitt was averse to it. Looking upon France as the chief enemy of England, and upon the sea and the colonies as the chief source of power and wealth, he wished, now that he had her down, to weaken her thoroughly for the future as well as the present, and to establish England's greatness more firmly upon tlie wreck. Later on he offered certain conditions; but the influence of Louis's mistress, attached to the Empress of Austria, prevailed to except Prussia from the negotiations, and England would not allow the exception. Pitt, indeed, was not yet ready for peace. A year later, October 25, 1760, George II. died, and AFFAIRS IN INDIA. 305 Pitt's influence then began to wane, the new king being less bent on war. During these years, 1759 and 1760, Frederick the Great still continued the deadly and exhausting strife of his small kingdom against the great States joined against him. At one moment his case seemed so hopeless that he got ready to kill himself ; but the continuance of the war di- verted the efforts of France from England and the sea. The hour was fast approaching for the great colonial ex- peditions, which made the last year of the war illustrious by the triumph of the sea power of England over France and Spain united. It is first necessary to tell the entirely kin- dred story of the effect of that sea power in the East Indian peninsula. The recall of Dupleix and the entire abandonment of his policy, which resulted in placing the two East India compa- nies on equal terms, have already been told. The treaty stipu- lations of 1754 had not, however, been fully carried out. The Marquis de Bussy, a brave and capable soldier who had been a second to Dupleix, and was wholly in accord with his policy and ambitions, remained in the Deccan, — a large region in the southern central part of the peninsula, over which Dupleix had once ruled. In 1756, troubles arose between the English and the native prince in Bengal. The nabob of that province had died, and his successor, a young man of nineteen, at- tacked Calcutta. The place fell, after a weak resistance, in June, and the surrender was followed by the famous tragedy known as that of the Black Hole of Calcutta. The news reached Madras in August, and Clive, whose name has already been mentioned, sailed with the fleet of Admiral Watson, after a long and vexatious delay. The fleet entered the river in December and appeared before Calcutta in January, when the place fell into English hands again as easily as it had been lost. The nabob was very angry, and marched against the English ; sending meanwhile an invitation to the French at Chandernagore to join him. Although it was now known that England and France were at war, the French company, despite the experience of 1744, weakly hoped that peace 20 306 BATTLE OF PLASSEY. might be kept between it and the English. The native invitation was therefore refused, and offers of neutrality made to the other company. Clive marched out, met the Indian forces and defeated them, and the nabob at once asked for peace, and sought the English alliance, yielding all the claims on the strength of which he had first attacked Calcutta. After some demur his offers were accepted. Clive and Watson then turned upon Chandernagore and compelled the surrender of the French settlement. The nabob, w^ho had not meant to allow this, took umbrage, and entered into correspondence with Bussy in the Deccan. Clive had full knowledge of his various intrigues, which were carried on with the vacillation of a character as weak as it was treacherous ; and seeing no hope of settled peace or trade under the rule of this man, entered into an extensive conspiracy for his dethronement, the details of which need not be given. The result was that war broke out again, and that Clive with three thousand men, one third of whom were English, met the nabob at the head of fifteen thousand horse and thirty-five thousand foot. The disproportion in artillery was nearly as great. Against these odds was fought and won the battle of Plassey, on the 23d of June, 1757, — the date from which, by common consent, the British empire in India is said to begin. The overthrow of the nabob was followed by placing in power one of the conspirators against him, a creature of the English, and dependent upon them for support. Bengal thus passed under their control, the first-fruits of India. " Clive," says a French historian, " had understood and applied the system of Duplcix." This was true ; yet even so it may be said that the founda- tion thus laid could never have been kept nor built upon, had the English nation not controlled the sea. The conditions of India were such that a few Europeans, headed by men of nerve and shrewdness, dividing that they might conquer, and advancing their fortunes by judicious alliances, were able to hold their own, and more too, amidst overwhelming numerical odds ; but it was necessary that they should not be opposed by NAVAL BATTLES IN EAST INDIES. 307 men of their own kind, a few of whom could turn the waver- ing balance the other way. At the very time that Clive was acting in Bengal, Bussy invaded Orissa, seized the English factories, and made liimself master of much of the coast re- gions between Madras and Calcutta ; while a French squadron of nine ships, most of which, however, belonged to the East India Company and were not first-rate men-of-war, was on its way to Pondicherry with twelve hundred regular troops, — an enormous European army for Indian operations of that day. The English naval force on the coast, though fewer in num- bers, may be considered about equal to the approaching French squadron. It is scarcely too much to say that the future of ludia was still uncertain, and the first operations showed it. The French division appeared off the Coromandel coast to the southward of Pondicherry on the 26th of April, 1758, and anchored on the 28th before the English station called Fort St. David. Two ships kept on to Pondicherry, having on board the new governor, Comte de Lally, who wished to go at once to his seat of government. Meanwhile, the English admiral, Pocock, having news of the enemy's coming, and fearing specially for this post, was on his way to it, and appeared on the 29th of April, before the two ships with the governor were out of sight. The French at once got under way and stood out to sea on the starboard tack (Plate Va.), heading to the northward and eastward, the wind being south- east, and signals were made to recall the ship and frigate (a) escorting Lally ; but they were disregarded by the latter's order, an act which must have increased, if it did not originate, the ill-will between him and Commodore d'Ache, through which the French campaign in India miscarried. The Eng- lish, having formed to windward on the same tack as the French, made their attack in the then usual Avay, and with the usual results. The seven English ships were ordered to keep away together for the French eight, and the four leading ships, including the admiral's, came into action liandsomely ; the last three, whether by their own fault or not, were late in doing so, but it will be remembered that this was almost 308 NAVAL BATTLES IN EAST INDIES. always the case in such attacks. The French commodore, •seeing this interval between the van and the rear, formed the plan of separating them, and made signal to wear to- gether, but in his impatience did not wait for an answer. Putting his own helm up, he wore round, and was followed in succession by tlie rear ships, while the van stood on. The English admiral, who had good reason to know, gives D'Ache more credit than the French writers, for he describes this movement thus : — " At half-jsast foar P. M. the rear of the French line had drawn pretty close up to their flag-ship. Our three rear ships were signalled to engage closer. Soon after, M. d'Ache broke the line, and put be- fore the wind ; his second astern, who had kept on the ' Yarmouth's ' [English flag-ship] quarter most j^art of the action, then came up alongside, gave his fire, and then bore away ; and a lew minutes after, the enemy's van bore away also." By this account, which is by no means irreconcilable with the French, the latter effected upon the principal English ship a movement of concentration by defiling past her. The French now stood down to their two separated sliips, while the Eng- lish vessels that had been engaged were too much crippled to follow. This battle prevented the English fleet from reliev- ing Fort St. David, which surrendered on the 2d of June. After the fall of this place, the two opposing squadrons having refitted at their respective ports and resumed their station, a second action was fought in August, under nearly the same conditions and in much the same fashion. The French flag-sliip met with a series of untoward accidents, which determined the commodore to withdraw from action ; but the statement of his further reasons is most suggestive of the necessary final overthrow of the French cause. " Prudence," a writer of his own country says, " commanded him not to prolong a contest from which his ships could not but come out with injuries very difficult to repair in a region where it was impossible to supply the almost entire lack of spare stores." This want of so absolute a requisite for naval CONDITION OF THE FRENCH ISLANDS. 309 efficiency shows in a strong light the fatal tendency of that economy which always characterized French operations at sea, and was at once significant and ominous. Returning to Pondicherry, D'Achd found that, though the injuries to the masts and rigging could for this time be repaired, there was lack of provisions, and that the ships needed calking. Although his orders were to remain on the coast until October 15, he backed himself with the opinion of a council of war which decided that the ships could not remain there longer, because, in case of a third battle, there was neither rigging nor supplies remaining in Pondicherry ; and disregarding the protests of the governor, Lally, he sailed on the 2d of September for the Isle of France. The underlying motive of D'Ache, it is known, was hostility to the governor, with whom he quarrelled continually. Lally, deprived of the help of the squadron, turned his arms inland instead of against Madras. Upon arriving at the islands, D'Ache found a state of things which again singularly illustrates the impotence and short-sightedness characteristic of the general naval policy of the French at this time. His arrival there was as un- welcome as his departure from India had been to Lally. The islands were then in a state of the most complete desti- tution. The naval division, increased by the arrival of three ships-of-the-line from home, so exhausted them that its im- mediate departure was requested of the commodore. Repairs were pushed ahead rapidly, and in November several of the ships sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, then a Dutch colony, to seek provisions ; but these were consumed soon after being received, and the pressure for the departure of the squadron was renewed. The situation of the ships was no less preca- rious than that of the colony ; and accordingly the commodore replied by urging his entire lack of food and supplies. The condition was such that, a little later, it was necessary to make running rigging out of the cables, and to put some of the ships on the bottom, so as to give their materials to others. Before returnino- to India, D'Ache wrote to the 310 FALL OF FRENCH POWER IN INDIA. minister of the navy that he " was about to leave, only to save the crews from dying of hunger, and that nothing need be expected from the squadron if supplies were not sent, for both men and things were in a deplorable state." Under these circumstances D'Ache sailed from the islands in July, 1759, and arrived off the Coromandel coast in Sep- tember. During his year of absence Lally had besieged Ma- dras for two months, during the northeast monsoon. Both squadrons were absent, that season being uufit for naval operations on this coast ; but the English returned first, and are said by the French to have caused, by the English to have hastened, the raising of the siege. D'Ach^, upon his return, was much superior in both number and size of ships ; but when the fleets met, Pocock did not hesitate to attack with nine against eleven. This action, fought September 10, 1759, was as indecisive as the two former ; but D'Ache retreated, after a very bloody contest. Upon it Campbell, in his " Lives of the Admirals," makes a droll, but seemingly serious, comment : " Pocock had reduced the French ships to a very shattered condition, and killed a great many of their men ; but what shows the singular talents of both ad- mirals, they had fought three pitched battles in eighteen months without the loss of a ship on either side." The fruits of victory, however, were with the weaker fleet ; for D'Ache returned to Pondicherry and thence sailed on the 1st of the next month for the islands, leaving India to its fate. From tliat time the result was certain. The English con- tinued to receive reinforcements from home, while the French did not ; the men opposed to Lally were superior in ability ; place after place fell, and in January, 1761, Pondicherry itself surrendered, surrounded by land and cut off from the sea. This was the end of the French power in India ; for though Pondicherry and other possessions were restored at the peace, the English tenure there was never again shaken, even under the attacks of the skilful and bold Suffren, who twenty years later met difficulties as great as D'Achd's with a vigor RLUN OF THE FRENCH NAVY. 311 and conduct which the latter at a more hopeful moment failed to show. France having thus lost both Canada and India by the evident failure of her power to act at a distance by sea, it would seem scarcely possible that Spain, with her own weak navy and widely scattered possessions, would choose this mo- ment for entering the war. Yet so it was. The maritime exhaustion of France was plain to all, and is abundantly tes- tified to by her naval historians. " The resources of France were exhausted," says one ; " the year 1761 saw only a few single ships leave her ports, and all of them were captured. The alliance with Spain came too late. The occasional ships that went to sea in 1762 were taken, and the colonies still remaining to France could not be saved." ^ Even as early as 1758, another Frenchman writes, " want of money, the de- pression of commerce given over to English cruisers, the lack of good ships, the lack of supplies, etc., compelled the French ministry, unable to raise large forces, to resort to stratagems, to replace the only rational system of war, Grand War, by the smallest of petty wars, — by a sort of game in which the great aim is not to be caught. Even then, the arrival of four ships-of-the-line at Louisburg, by avoiding the enemy, was looked on as a very fortunate event. ... In 1759 the lucky arrival of the West India convoy caused as much sur- prise as joy to the merchants. We see how rare had be- come such a chance in seas ploughed by the squadrons of England." ^ This was before the disasters of La Clue and Con flans. The destruction of French commerce, beoinning; by the capture of its merchant-ships, was consummated by the reduction of the colonies. It can hardly, therefore, be conceded that the Family Compact now made between the two courts, containing, as it did, not only an agreement to support each other in any future war, but also a secret clause binding Spain to declare war against England within a year, if peace were not made, " was honorable to the wisdom of the two governments." It is hard to pardon, not only the Span- 1 Troude : Batailles Xavales de la Frauce. 2 Lapeyrouse-Bonfils. 312 THE BOURBON FAMILY COMPACT. ish government, but even France for alluring a kindred people into such a bad bargain. It was hoped, however, to revive the French navy and to promote an alliance of neutral pow- ers ; many of which, besides Spain, had causes of complaint against England. " During the war with France," confesses an English historian, " the Spanish flag had not always been respected by British cruisers." ^ " During 1758," says another, " not less than one hundred and seventy-six neutral vessels, laden with the rich produce of the French colonies or with military or naval stores, fell into the hands of the English." ^ The causes were ah-eady at work which twenty years later gave rise to the " armed neutrality " of the Baltic powers, directed against the claims of England on the sea. The pos- session of unlimited power, as the sea power of England then really was, is seldom accompanied by a profound respect for the rights of others. Without a rival upon the ocean, it suited England to maintain that enemy's property was liable to cap- ture on board neutral ships, thus subjecting these nations not only to vexatious detentions, but to loss of valuable trade ; just as it had suited her earlier in the war to establish a paper blockade of French ports. Neutrals of course chafed under these exactions ; but the year 1761 was ill-chosen for an armed protest, and of all powers Spain risked most by a war. Eng- land had then one hundred and twenty ships-of-the-line in commission, besides those in reserve, manned by seventy thou- sand seamen trained and hardened by five years of constant warfare afloat, and flushed with victory. The navy of France, which numbered seventy-seven ships-of-the-line in 1758, lost as prizes to the English in 1759 twenty- seven, besides eight destroyed and many frigates lost ; indeed, as has been seen, their own writers confess that the navy was ruined, root and branch. The Spanish navy contained about fifty ships ; but the personnel, unless very different from the days before and after, must have been very inferior. The weakness of her empire, in the absence of an efficient navy, has before been pointed out. Neutrality, too, though at times outraged, had 1 Mahon : History of England. - Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. ENGLAND DECLARES WAR AGAINST SPAIN. 313 been of great advantage to her, permitting her to restore her finances and trade and to re-establish her internal resources ; but she needed a still longer period of it. Nevertheless, the king, influenced by family feeling and resentment against Eng- land, allowed himself to be drawn on by the astute Choiseul, and the Family Compact between the two crowns was signed on the 15th of August, 1761. This compact, into which the King of Naples was also to enter, guaranteed their mutual pos- sessions by the whole power of both kingdoms. This in itself was a weighty undertaking ; but the secret clause further stipulated that Spain should declare war against England on the 1st of May, 1762, if peace with France had not then been made. Negotiations of this character could not be kept wholly secret, and Pitt learned enough to convince him that Spain was becoming hostile in intention. With his usual haughty resolve, he determined to forestall her by declaring war ; but the influence against him in the councils of the new king was too strong. Failing to carry the ministry with him, he resigned on the 5th of October, 1761. His prevision was quickly justified ; Spain had been eager in professing good- will until the treasure-ships from America should arrive laden with the specie so needed for carrying on war. On the 21st of September the Flota of galleons anchored safely in Cadiz ; and on the 2d of November the British ambassador announced to his government that " two ships had safely ar- rived with very extraordinary rich cargoes from the West IndiQS, so that all the wealth that was expected from Sj)an- ish America is now safe in old Spain," and in the same de- spatch reports a surprising change in the words of the Spanish minister, and tlie haughty language now used.^ The griev- ances and claims of Spain were urged peremptorily, and the quarrel grew so fast that even the new English ministry, though ardently desiring peace, recalled their ambassador be- fore the end of the year, and declared war on the 4th of January, 1762 ; thus adopting Pitt's policy, but too late to reap the advantages at which he had aimed. 1 Mahon : History of England. 314 CAPTURE OF HAVANA. However, no such delay on the part of England could alter the essential inequality, in strength and preparation, between the two nations. The plans formed by Pitt were in the main adopted by his successor, and carried out with a speed which the readiness of the English navy permitted. On the 5th of March, Pocock, who had returned from the East Indies, sailed from Portsmouth, convoying a fleet of transports to act against Havana; in the West Indies he was reinforced from the forces in that quarter, so that his command con- tained nineteen ships-of-the-line besides smaller vessels, and ten thousand soldiers. In the previous January, the West India fleet, under the well-known Rodney, had acted with the land forces in the reduction of Martinique, the gem and tower of the French islands and the harbor of an extensive privateering system. It is said that fourteen hundred English merchantmen were taken during this war in the West Indian seas by cruisers whose principal port was Fort Royal in Martinique. With this necessary base fell also the privateering system resting upon it. Martinique was surrendered February 12, and the loss of this chief commercial and military centre was im- mediately follow^ed by that of the smaller islands, Grenada, Sta. Lucia, St. Vincent. By these acquisitions the English colonies at Antigua, St. Kitts, and Nevis, as w^ell as the ships trading to those islands, were secured against the en- emy, the commerce of England received large additions, and all the Lesser Antilles, or Windw^ard Islands, became British possessions. Admiral Pocock was joined off Cape St. Nicholas by the West Indian reinforcement on the 27th of May, and as the season was so far advanced, he took his great fleet through the old Bahama channel instead of the usual route around the south side of Cuba. This was justly considered a great feat in those days of poor surveys, and was accomplished without an accident. Lookout and sounding vessels went first, frigates followed, and boats or sloops were anchored on shoals with carefully arranged signals for day or night. THE ALLIES INVADE PORTUGAL. 315 Having good weather, the fleet got through in a week and appeared before Havana. The operations will not be given in detail. After a forty days' siege the Moro Castle was taken on the 30th of July, and the city surrendered on the 10th of August. The Spaniards lost not only the city and port, but twelve ships-of-the-line, besides £3,000,000 in monev and merchandise belonging to the Spanish king. The impor- tance of Havana was not to be measured only by its own size, or its position as centre of a large and richly cultivated dis- trict ; it was also the port commanding the only passage by which the treasure and other ships could sail from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe in those days. With Havana in an enemy's hands it would be necessary to assemble them at Cartagena and from there beat up against the trade-winds, — an operation always difficult, and which would keep ships long in waters where they were exposed to capture by Eng- lish cruisers. Not even an attack upon the isthmus would have been so serious a blow to Spain. This important result could only be achieved by a nation confident of controlling the communications by its sea power, to which the happy issue must wholly be ascribed, and which had another signal illustration in the timely conveying of four thousand Amer- ican troops to reinforce the English ranks, terribly wasted by battle and fever. It is said that only twenty-five hundred serviceable fighting men remained on foot when the city fell. While the long reach and vigor of England's sea power was thus felt ill the West Indies, it was receiving further illus- tration in Portugal and in the far East. The allied crowns in the beginning had invited Portugal to join their alliance against those whom they had taken to calling the " tyrants of the seas," reminding her how the English monopoly of her trade was draining the country of gold, and recalling the deliberate violation of her neutrality by the fleet under Bos- cawen. The Portuguese minister of the day well knew all this, and keenly felt it ; but though the invitation was accom- panied by the plain statement that Portugal would not be allowed to continue a neutrality she could not enforce, he 316 CAPTURE OF MANILA. judged rightly that tlie country had more to fear from Eng- land and her fleet than from the Spanish army. The allies declared war and invaded Portugal. They were for a time successful ; but the " tyrants of the seas " answered Por- tugal's call, sent a fleet and landed at Lisbon eight thousand soldiers, who drove the Spaniards over the frontiers, and even carried the war into Spain itself. Simultaneous with these significant events, Manila was attacked. With so much already on hand, it was found im- possible to spare troops or ships from England. The suc- cesses in India and the absolute security of the establishments there, with the control of the sea, allowed the Indian officials themselves to undertake this colonial expedition. It sailed in August, 1762, and reaching Malacca on the 19th, was sup- plied at that neutral port with all that was needed for the siege about to be undertaken ; the Dutch, though jealous of the English advance, not venturing to refuse their demands. The expedition, which depended entirely upon the fleet, re- sulted in the whole group of Philippine Islands surrendering in October and paying a ransom of four million dollars. At about the same time the fleet captured the Acapulco galleon having three million dollars on board, and an English squadron in the Atlantic took a treasure-ship from Lima with four million dollars in silver for the Spanish government. " Never had the colonial empire of Spain received such blows. Spain, whose opportune intervention might have modified the fate of the war, entered it too late to help France, but in time to share her misfortunes. There was reason to fear yet more. Panama and San Domingo were threatened, and the Anglo-Americans were pre- paring for the invasion of Florida and Louisiana. . . . The conquest of Havana had in great measure interrupted the communications be- tween the wealthy American colonies of Spain and Europe. The reduction of the Philippine Islands now excluded her from Asia. The two together severed all the avenues of Spanish trade and cut off all intercourse between the parts of their vast but disconnected empire." ^ 1 Martin : History of France. SPAIN SUES FOR PEACE. 317 The selection of the points of attack, due to the ministry of Pitt, was strategically good, cutting effectually the sinews of the enemy's strength ; and if his plans had been fully cur- ried out and Panama also seized, the success would have been yet more decisive. England had lost also the advantage of the surprise he would have effected by anticipating Spain's declaration of war ; but her arms were triumphant during this short contest, tlirough the rapidity with which her pro- jects were carried into execution, due to the state of efficiency to which her naval forces and administration had been brought. With the conquest of Manila ended the military operations of the war. Nine months, counting from the formal declara- tion by England in January, had been sufficient to shatter the last hope of France, and to bring Spain to a peace in which was conceded every point on which she had based her hostile attitude and demands. It seems scarcely necessary, after even the brief summary of events that has been given, to point out that the speed aud thoroughness with which Eng- land's work was done was due wholly to her sea power, which allowed her forces to act on distant points, widely apart as Cuba, Portugal, India, and the Philippines, without a fear of serious break in their communications. Before giving the terms of peace which ought to summarize the results of the war, but do so imperfectly, owing to the weak eagerness of the English ministry to conclude it, it is necessary to trace in outline the effect of the war upon com- merce, upon the foundations of sea power and national prosperity. One prominent feature of this war may be more strongly impressed upon the mind by a startling, because paradoxical, statement that the prosperity of the English is shown by the magnitude of their losses. " From 1756 to 1760," states a French historian, "French privateers captured from the English more than twenty-five hundred merchant- men. In 1761, though France had not, so to speak, a single sliip-of- the-line at sea, and though the English had taken two hundred and 318 PROSPERITY OF BRITISH COMMERCE. forty of our privateers, their comrades still took eight hundred and twelve English vessels. The explanation of the number of these prizes lies in the prodigious growth of the English shipping. In 1760 it is claimed that the English had at sea eight thousand sail ; of these the French captured nearly one tenth, despite escorts and cruisers. In the four years from 1756 to 1760 the French lost only nine hundred and fifty vessels." ^ But this discrepancy is justly attributed by an English writer " to the diminution of the French commerce and the dread of falling into the hands of the English, which kept many of their trading- vessels from going to sea;" and he goes on to point out that the capture of vessels was not the principal benefit resulting from the efficiency of England's fleets. " Captures like Duquesne, Louisburg, Prince Edward's Island, the reduction of Senegal, and later on of Guadeloupe and Martinique, were events no less destructive to French commerce and colonies than advantageous to those of Eng- land." ^ The m.ultiplication of French privateers was indeed a sad token to an instructed eye, showing behind them mer- chant shipping in enforced idleness, whose crews and whose owners were driven to speculative pillage in order to live. Nor was this risk wholly in vain. The same Englishman confesses that in 1759 the losses of merchantmen showed a worse balance than the ships-of-war. While the French were striving in vain to regain equality upon the sea and repair their losses, but to no purpose, for "in building and arming vessels they labored only for the English fleet," yet, " not- withstanding the courage and vigilance of English cruisers, French privateers so swarmed that in this year they took two hundred and forty British vessels, chiefly coasters and small craft." In 1760 the same authority gives tlie British loss in trading-vessels at over three hundred, and in 1761 at over eight hundred, three times that of the French ; but he adds : " It would not have been wonderful had they taken more and richer ships. While their commerce was nearly destroyed, and they 1 Martin : History of France. 2 Campbell : Lives of the Admirals. TRIUMPHANT POSITION OF ENGLAND. 319 had few merchant-ships at sea, the traduig-fleets of Enirland covered the seas. Every year her commerce was increasing ; the money Avhich the war carried out was returned by the produce of her industry. Eight thousand vessels were em- ployed by the traders of Great Britain." The extent of her losses is attributed to three causes, of which the first only was preventable : (1) The inattention of merchant-ships to the orders of the convoying vessels ; (2) The immense number of English ships in all seas ; (3) The enemy's ven- turing the whole remains of his strength in privateering. During the same year, 1761, the navy lost one ship-of-the-line, which was retaken, and one cutter. At the same time, not- withstanding the various exchanges, the English still held twenty-five thousand French prisoners, while the English prisoners in France were but twelve hundred. These were the results of the sea war. Finally, in summing up the commercial condition of the kingdom at the end of the war, after mentioning the enormous sums of specie taken from Spain, the writer says : — " These strengthened trade and fostered industry. The remit- tances for foreign subsidies were in great part paid by bills on mer- chants settled abroad, who had the value of the drafts in British manufactures. The trade of Enghmd increased gradually every year, and such a scene of national prosperity while waging a long, costly, and bloody war, was never before shown by any people in the world." No wonder, with such results to her commerce and such unvarying success attending her arms, and seeing the practi- cal annihilation of the French navy, that the union of France and Spain, which was tlien lowering on her future and had once excited the fears of all Europe, was now beheld by Great Britain alone without the smallest fear or despondency. Spain was by her constitution and the distribution of her em- pire peculiarly open to the attack of a great sea people ; and whatever the views of the government of the day, Pitt and the nation saw that the hour had come, wliich had been hoped for in vain in 1739, because then years of peace and the obsti- 320 ENGLAND AND PORTUGAL. nate bias of a great minister had relaxed the muscles of her fleet. Now she but reached forth her hand and seized what she wished ; nor could there have been any limit to her prey, had not the ministry again been untrue to the interests of the country. Tlie position of Portugal with reference to Great Britain has been alluded to, but merits some special attention as in- stancing an element of sea power obtained not by colonies, but by alliance, whether necessary or prudential. The com- mercial connection before spoken of " was strengthened by the strongest political ties. The two kingdoms were so situ- ated as to have little to fear from each other, while they might impart many mutual advantages. The harbors of Portugal gave shelter as well as supplies to the English fleet, while the latter defended the rich trade of Portugal with Brazil. The antipathy between Portugal and Spain made it neces- sary for the former to have an ally, strong yet distant. None is so advantageous in that way as England, which in her turn might, and always has, derived great advan- tages from Portugal in a war with any of the southern powers of Europe." This is an English view of a matter which to others looks somewhat like an alliance between a lion and a lamb. To call a country with a fleet like England's " distant " from a small maritime nation like Portugal is an absurdity. Eng- land is, and yet more in those days was, wherever her fleet could go. The opposite view of the matter, showing equally the value of the alliance, was well set forth in the memorial by which, under the civil name of an invitation, the crowns of France and Spain ordered Portugal to declare against England. The grounds of that memorial — namely, the unequal bene- fit to Portugal from the connection and the disregard of Portuguese neutrality — have already been given. The King of Portugal refused to abandon the alliance, for the professed reason that it was ancient and wholly defensive. To this the two crowns replied : — PEACE OF PARIS, 1763. 321 " The defensive alliance is actually an offensive one by the situ- ation of the Portuguese dominions and the nature of the English power. The English squadrons cannot in all seasons keep the sea, nor cruise on the .principal coasts of France and Spain for cutting off the navigation of the two countries, without the ports and assistance of Portugal ; and these islanders could not insult all maritime Europe, if the whole riches of Portugal did not pass through their hands, which furnishes them with the means to make war and renders the alliance truly and properly offensive." Between the two arguments the logic of situation and power prevailed. Portugal found England nearer and more dangerous than Spain, and remained for generations of trial true to the alliance. This relationship was as useful to Eng- land as any of her colonial possessions, depending of course upon the scene of the principal operations at any particular time. The preliminaries of peace were signed at Fontainebleau, November 3, 1762 ; the definitive treaty on the 10th of the fol- lowing February, at Paris, whence the peace takes its name. By its terms France renounced all claims to Canada, Xova Scotia, and all the islands of the St. Lawrence ; along with Canada she ceded the valley of the Ohio and all her territory on the east side of the Mississippi, except the city of New Orleans. At the same time Spain, as an equivalent for Havana, which England restored, yielded Florida, under which name were comprised all her continental possessions east of the Mississippi. Thus England obtained a colonial empire embracing Canada, from Hudson's Bay, and all of the present United States east of the Mississippi. The possibilities of this vast region were then only partially foreseen, and as yet there was no foreshadowing of the revolt of the thirteen colonies. In the West Indies, England gave back to France the important islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. The four so-called neutral islands of the Lesser Antilles were divided between the two powers ; Sta. Lucia going to France, St. Yin- cent, Tobago, and Dominica to England, which also retained Grenada. 21 322 OPPOSITION TO THE TREATY. Minorca was given back to England ; and as the restora- tion of the island to Spain had been one of the conditions of the alliance with the latter, France, unable to fulfil her stipulation, ceded to Spain Louisiana west of the Mississippi. In India, France recovered the possessions she had held before Dupleix began his schemes of aggrandizement; but she gave up the right of erecting fortifications or keeping troops in Bengal, and so left the station at Chandernagore defenceless. In a word, France resumed her facilities for trading, but practically abandoned her pretensions to polit- ical influence. It was tacitly understood that the English company would keep all its conquests. Tlie right of fishing upon the coasts of Newfoundland and in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which France had pre- viously enjoyed, was conceded to her by this treaty ; but it was denied to Spain, who had claimed it for her fishermen. This concession was among those most attacked by the Eng- lish opposition. The nation at large and Pitt, the favorite of the nation, were bitterly opposed to the terms of the treaty. " France," said Pitt, " is chiefly formidable to us as a maritime and com- mercial power. What we gain in this respect is valuable to us above all through the injury to her which results from it. You leave to France the possibility of reviving her navy." In truth, from the point of view of sea power and of the national jealousies which the spirit of that age sanctioned, these words, though illiberal, were strictly justifiable. The restoration to France of her colonies in the West Indies and her stations in India, together with the valuable right of fishery in her former American possessions, put before her the possibility and the inducement to restore her shipping, her commerce, and her navy, and thus tended to recall her from the path of continental ambition which had been so fatal to her interests, and in the same proportion favorable to the unprecedented growth of England's power upon the ocean. The opposition, and indeed some of the ministry, also thought that so commanding and important a position as Havana RESULTS OF THE CONTINENTAL WAR. 323 was poorly paid for by the cession of the yet desolate and unproductive region called Florida. Porto Rico was sug- gested, Florida accepted. There were other minor points of difference, into which it is unnecessary to enter. It could scarcely be denied that with the commanding military control of the sea held by England, grasping as she now did so many important positions, with her navy overwhelmingly supe- rior in numbers, and her commerce and internal condition very thriving, more rigorous terms might easily have been exacted and would have been prudent. The ministry de- fended their eagerness and spirit of concession on the ground of the enormous growth of the debt, which then amounted to £122,000,000, a sum in every point of view much greater then than now ; but while this draft upon the future was fully justified by the success of the war, it also imperatively demanded that the utmost advantages which the military situation made attainable should be exacted. This the min- istry failed to do. As regards the debt, it is well observed by a French writer that " in this war, and for years afterward, England had in view nothing less than the conquest of Amer- ica and the progress of her East India Company. By these two countries her manufactures and commerce acquired more than sufficient outlets, and repaid her for the numerous sacri- fices she had made. Seeing the maritime decay of Europe, — its commerce annihilated, its manufactures so little ad- vanced, — how could the English nation feel afraid of a future which offered so vast a perspective ? " Unfortunately the na- tion needed an exponent in the government ; and its chosen mouthpiece, the only man, perhaps, able to rise to the level of the great opportunity, was out of favor at court. Nevertheless, the gains of England were very great, not only in territorial increase, nor yet in maritime preponder- ance, but in the prestige and position achieved in the eyes of the nations, now fully opened to her great resources and mighty power. To these results, won by the sea, the issue of the continental war offered a singular and suggestive con- trast. France had alreadv withdrawn, along with England, 324 INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER IN from all share in that strife, and peace between the other parties to it was signed five days after the Peace of Paris. The terms of the peace were simply the status quo ante helium. By the estimate of the King of Prussia, one hundred and eighty thousand of his soldiers had fallen or died in this war, out of a kingdom of five million souls; while the losses of Russia, Austria, and France aggregated four hundred and sixty thou- sand men. The result was simply that things remained as they were.^ To attribute this only to a difference between the possibilities of land and sea war is of course absurd. The genius of Frederick, backed by the money of England, had proved an equal match for the mismanaged and not al- ways hearty efforts of a coalition numerically overwhelming. What does seem a fair conclusion is, that States having a good seaboard, or even ready access to the ocean by one or two outlets, will find it to their advantage to seek prosperity and extension by the way of the sea and of commerce, rather than in attempts to unsettle and modify existing political arrangements in countries where a more or less long posses- sion of power has conferred acknowledged rights, and created national allegiance or political ties. Since the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the waste jjlaces of the world have been rapidly filled ; witness our own continent, Australia, and even South America. A nominal and more or less clearly defined po- litical possession now generally exists in the most forsaken regions, though to this statement there are some marked ex- ceptions ; but in many places this political possession is little more than nominal, and in others of a character so feeble that it cannot rely upon itself alone for support or protection. The familiar and notorious example of the Turkish Empire, kept erect only by the forces pressing upon it from opposing sides, by tlie mutual jealousies of powers that have no sym- pathy with it, is an instance of such weak political tenure ; and though the question is wholly European, all know enough of it to be aware that the interest and control of the sea powers is among the chief, if not the first, of the elements that now fix i See Annual Register, 1762, p. 63. REMOTE AND DISORDERED COUNTRIES. 325 tlie situation ; and that they, if intelligently used, will direct the future inevitable changes. Upon the western continents the political condition of the Central American and tropical South American States is so unstable as to cause constant anxiety about the maintenance of internal order, and seriously to interfere with commerce and with the peaceful development of their resources. So long as — to use a familiar expres- sion — they hurt no one but themselves, this may go on ; but for a long time the citizens of more stable governments have been seeking to exploit their resources, and have borne the losses arising from their distracted condition. North America and Australia still offer large openings to immigration and enterprise ; but they are filling up rapidly, and as the oppor- tunities there diminish, the demand must arise for a more settled government in those disordered States, for security to life and for reasonable stability of institutions enabling merchants and others to count upon the future. There is certainly no present hope that such a demand can be fuHillcd from the existing native materials ; if the same be true when the demand arises, no theoretical positions, like the Monroe doctrine, will prevent interested nations from attempting to remedy the evil by some measure, which, whatever it may be called, will be a political interference. Such interferences must produce collisions, which may be at times settled by arbitration, but can scarcely fail at other times to cause w\ar. Even for a peaceful solution, that nation will have the strongest arguments which has the strongest organized force. It need scarcely be said that the successful piercing of the Central American Isthmus at any point may precipitate the moment that is sure to come sooner or later. The profound modification of commercial routes expected from this enter- prise, the political importance to the United States of such a channel of communication between her Atlantic and Pacific seaboards, are not, however, the whole nor even the principal part of the question. As far as can be seen, the time will come when stable governments for the American tropical States must be assured by the now existing powerful and 326 EFFECTS OF THE SEVEN YEARS' WAR stable States of America or Europe. The geographical position of those States, the climatic conditions, make it plain at once that sea power will there, even more than in the case of Turkey, determine what foreign State shall predominate, — if not by actual possession, by its influence over the native governments. The geographical position of the United States and her intrinsic power give her an undeniable advantage ; but that advantage will not avail if there is a great infe- riority of organized brute-force, which still remains the last argument of republics as of kings. Herein lies to us the great and still living interest of the Seven Years' War. In it we have seen and followed England, with an army small as compared with other States, as is still her case to-day, first successfully defending her own shores, then carrying her arms in every direction, spreading her rule and influence over remote regions, and not only binding them to her obedi- ence, but making them tributary to her wealth, her strength, and her reputation. As she loosens the grasp and neutralizes the influence of France and Spain in regions beyond the sea, there is perhaps seen the prophecy of some other great nation in days yet to come, that will incline the balance of power in some future sea war, whose scope will be recognized after- ward, if not by contemporaries, to have been the political future and the economical development of regions before lost to civilization ; but that nation will not be the United States if the moment find her indifferent, as now, to the empire of the seas. The direction then given to England's efforts, by the instinct of the nation and the fiery genius of Pitt, continued after the war, and has profoundly influenced her subsequent policy. Mistress now of North America, lording it in India, through the company whose territorial conquests had been ratified by native princes, over twenty millions of inhabitants, — a population larger than that of Great Britian and having a revenue respectable alongside of that of the home govern- ment, — England, with yet other rich possessions scattered far and wide over the globe, had ever before her eyes, as a UPON THE AFTER POLICY OF ENGLAND. 327 salutary lesson, the severe chastisement which the weakness of Spain had allowed her to inflict upon that huge disjointed empire. Tiic words of the English naval historian of that war, speaking about Spain, apply with slight modifications to England in our own day. " Spain is precisely that power against which England can always contend with the fairest prospect of advantage and honor. That extensive monarchy is exhausted at heart, her resources lie at a great distance, and whatever jjower commands the sea, may com- mand the wealth and commerce of Spain. The dominions from which she draws her resources, lying at an immense distance from the capital and from one another, make it more necessary for her than for any other State to temporize, until she can inspire with activity all parts of her enormous but disjointed empire."^ It would be untrue to say that England is exhausted at heart ; but her dependence upon the outside world is such as to give a certain suggestiveness to the phrase. This analogy of positions was not overlooked by England. From that time forward up to our own day, the possessions won for her by her sea power have combined with that sea power itself to control her policy. The road to India — in the days of Clive a distant and perilous voyage on which she had not a stopping-place of her own — was reinforced as op- portunity offered by the acquisition of St. Helena, of the Cape of Good Hope, of the Mauritius. When steam made the Red Sea and Mediterranean route practicable, she acquired Aden, and yet later has established herself at Socotra. Malta had already fallen into her hands during the wars of the French Revolution ; and her commanding position, as the corner-stone upon which the coalitions against Napoleon rested, enabled her to claim it at the Peace of 1815. Being but a short thou- sand miles from Gibraltar, the circles of military command exercised by these two places intersect. The present day has seen the stretch from Malta to the Isthmus of Suez, formerly without a station, guarded by the cession to her of Cyprus.

She had conquered solely by the superiority of her government." Yes ! but by the superiority of her government using the tremendous weapon of her sea power. This made her rich, and in turn protected the trade by which she had her wealth. With her money she upheld her few auxiliaries, mainly Prussia and Hanover, in their desperate strife. Her power was everywhere that her ships could reach, and there was none to dispute the sea to her. Where she would she went, and with her went her guns and her troops. By this mobility her forces were multiplied, those of her enemies distracted. Ruler of the seas, she everywhere obstructed its highways. The enemies' fleets could not join ; no great fleet could get out, or if it did, it was only to meet at once, with uninured officers and crews, those who were veterans in gales and warfare. Save in the case of Minorca, she carefully held her own sea-bases and eagerly seized those of the enemy. What a lion in the path was Gibraltar to the French squadrons of Toulon and Brest ! What hope for French succor to Canada, when the English fleet had Louisburg under its lee ? The one nation that gained in this war was that which used the sea in peace to earn its wealth, and ruled it in war NAifAL POWER OF GREAT BRITAIN. 329 by the extent of its navy, by the number of its subjects who lived on the sea or by the sea, and by its numerous bases of operations scatt ^.-ed over the globe. Yet it must be observed that these bo ■ -i themselves would have lost their value if their commui ications remained obstructed. Therefore the Fre .ch Iop' ' ^isburg, Martinique, Pondicherry ; so England hcr$volf lost iiiiorca. The service between the bases and the mo' le force between the ports and the fleets is mutual.^ In t' respect the navy is essentially a light coi-ps ; it keeps open the communications between its own ports, it obstructs those of the enemy ; but it sweeps the sea for the service of the land, it controls the desert that man may live and thrive on the habitable globe. 1 These remarks, alwaws true, are doubly so now since the iutroduction of steam. The renewal of coal is a want more frequent, more urgent, more per- emptory, than any known to the sailing-ship. It is vain to look for energetic naval operations distant from coal stations. It is equally vain to acquire dis- tant coaling stations without maintaining a powerful navy ; they will but fall into the hands of the enemy. But the vainest of all delusions is the expectation of bringing down an enemy by commerce-destroying alone, with no coaling stations outside the national boundaries. CHAPTER IX. Course of Events from the Peace of Paris to 1778. — Mari- time War consequent upon the American Revolution. — Sea Battle off Ushant. IF England had reason to complain that she had not reaped from the Treaty of Paris all the advantages that her military achievements and position entitled her to expect, France had every cause for discontent at the position in which the war left her. The gain of England was nearly measured by her losses; even the cession of Florida, made to the conqueror by Spain, had been bought by France at the price of Louisiana. Naturally the thoughts of her statesmen and of her people, as they bent under the present necessity to bear the burden of the vanquished, turned to the future with its possibilities of revenge and compensation. The Due de Choiseul, able though imperious, remained for many years more at the head of affairs, and worked persist- ently to restore the power of France from the effects of the treaty. The Austrian alliance had been none of his seeking ; it was already made and working when he came to office in 1758 ; but he had even at the first recognized that the chief enemy was England, and tried as far as could be to direct the forces of the nation against her. The defeat of Conflans having thwarted his projects of invasion, he next sought, in entire consistency with his main purpose, to stir up Spain and gain her alliance. The united efforts of the two kingdoms with their fine seaboards could, under good administration and with time for preparation, put afloat a navy that would be a fair counterpoise to that of England. It was also doubtless true that weaker maritime States, if thev saw such a combi- REVIVAL OF THE FRENCH NAVV. 331 nation successfully made and working efficiently, would pluck up heart to declare against a government whose greatness excited envy and fear, and which acted with the disregard to the rights and welfare of others common to all uncontrolled power. Unhappily for both France and S[)ain, the alliance came too late. The virtual annihilation of the French fleet in 1759 was indeed followed by an outburst of national en- thusiasm for the navy, skilfully fostered and guided by Choiseul. " Popular feeling took up the cry, from one end of France to the other, ' The navy must be restored.' Gifts of cities, corporations, and private individuals raised funds. A prodigious activity sprang up in tlie lately silent ports ; everywhere ships were building and repairing." The min- ister also recognized the need of restoring the discipline and tone, as well as the material of the navy, Tlie hour, how- ever, was too late ; the middle of a great and unsuccessful war is no time to begin preparations. " Better late than never " is not so safe a proverb as " In time of peace pre- pare for war." The condition of Spain was better. When war broke out, the English naval historian estimates that she had one hundred ships of all sizes ; of these, probably sixty were of the line. Nevertheless, although the addition of Spain to her numerous enemies might make the position of England seem critical, the combination in her favor of num- bers, skill, experience, and prestige, was irresistible. With seventy thousand veteran seamen, she had only to maintain a position already won. The results we know. After the peace, Choiseul wisely remained faithful to his own first ideas. The restoration of the navy continued, and was accompanied and furthered by a spirit of professional ambition and of desire to excel, among the officers of the navy, which has been before mentioned, and which, in the peculiar condition of the United States navy at the present, day, may be commended as a model. The building of ships- of-war continued with great activity and on a large scale. At the end of the war, thanks to the movement begun in 1761, there were forty ships-of-the-line in good condition. In 1770, 332 TONE OF THE FRENCH OFFICERS. when Choiseul was dismissed, the royal navy numbered sixty- four of the line and fifty frigates afloat. The arsenals and storehouses were filled, and a stock of ship-timber laid up. At the same time the minister tried to improve the efficiency of the officers by repressing the arrogant spirit of those of noble birth, which showed itself both toward superiors and toward another order of officers, not of the nobility, whose abilities made them desired on board the fleet. This class- feeling carried with it a curious sentiment of equality among officers of very different grades, which injuriously af- fected the spirit of subordination. Members, all, of a privi- leged social order, their equality as such was more clearly recognized than their inequality as junior and senior. The droll story told by Marryatt of the midshipman, who repre- sented to his captain that a certain statement had been made in confidence, seems to have had a realization on the French quarter-deck of that day. " Confidence ! " cried the captain ; " who ever heard of confidence between a post- captain and a midshipman ! " " No sir," replied the young- ster, " not between a captain and a midshipman, but between two gentlemen." Disputes, arguments, suggestions, between two gentlemen, forgetful of their relative rank, would break out at critical moments, and the feeling of equality, which wild democratic notions spread throughout the fleets of the republic, was curiously forestalled by that existing among the members of a most haughty aristocracy. " I saw by his face," says one of Marryatt's heroes, " that the first lieu- tenant did not agree with the captain ; but he was too good an officer to say so at such a moment." The phrase ex- presses one of the deepest-rooted merits of the English sys- tem, the want of which is owned by French writers : — "Under Louis XVI. the intimacy and fellowship existing be- tween the chief and the subordinate led the latter to discuss the orders which were given liim. . . . The relaxation of discipline and the spirit of independence were due also to another cause than that pointed out ; they can be partly attributed to the regulation of the officers' messes. Admiral, captain, officers, midshipmen, ate together ; FOREIGN POLICY OF CHOISEUL. 333 everything was in common. They thee-and-thou'd each other like chums. In handling the ship, the iuferioi" gave his oi)inion, argued, and the chief, irritated, often preferred to yield rather than make enemies. Facts of this kind are asserted by witnesses whose truth- fulness is above suspicion." ^ Insubordination of this character, to which weaker men gave way, dashed in vain against the resolute and fiery tem- per of Suffreu ; but the spirit of discontent rose ahuost to the height of mutiny, causing him to say in his despatches to the minister of the navy, after his fourth battle : " My heart is pierced by the most general defection. It is frightful to think that I might four times have destroyed the English fleet, and that it still exists." Choiseul's reforms broke against this rock, which only the uprising of the whole na- tion finally removed ; but in the personnel of the crews a great improvement was made. In 17G7 he reorganized the artillery of the fleet, forming a body of ten thousand gunners, who were systematically drilled once a week during the ten years still to intervene before the next war with England. Losing sight of no part of his plans, Choiseul, while pro- moting the naval and military power of France, paid special attention to the alliance with Spain and judiciously encouraged and furthered the efforts of that country in the path of pro- gress under Charles III., the best of her kings of the Bourbon line. Tlie Austrian alliance still existing was maintained, but his hopes were chiefly fixed upon Spain. The wisdom and insight whicli had at once fastened upon England as the centre of enmity to France had been justified and further enlightened by the whole course of the Seven Years' War. In Spain was the surest, and, with good administration, the most powerful ally. The close proximity of the two coun- tries, the relative positions of their ports, made the naval situation particularly strong : and the alliance which was dictated by sound policy, by family ties, and by just fear of England's sea power, was further assured to France by recent and still existing injuries that must continue to rankle with 1 Troude : Batailles Xavalcs. 334 FRANCE ACQUIRES CORSICA. Spain. Gibraltar, Minorca, and Florida were still in the hands of England ; no Spaniard could be easy till this re- proach was wiped out. It may be readily believed, as is asserted by French his- torians, that England viewed with disquietude the growth of the French navy, and would gladly have nipped it betimes ; but it is more doubtful whether she would have been willing to force a war for that purpose. During the years succeeding the Peace of Paris a succession of short ministries, turning mainly upon questions of internal policy or unimportant party arrangement, caused her foreign policy to present a marked contrast to the vigorous, overbearing, but straight- forward path followed by Pitt. Internal commotions, such as are apt to follow great wars, and above all the contro- versy with the North American colonics, which began as early as 1765 with the well-known Stamp Act, conspired with other causes to stay the hand of England. Twice at least during the years of Choiseurs ministry there occurred opportunities which a resolute, ready, and not too scrupulous government might easily have converted into a cause of war ; the more so as they involved that sea power which is to Eng- land above all other nations the object of just and jealous concern. In 1764 the Genoese, weary of their unsuccessful attempts to control Corsica, again asked France to renew the occupation of the ports which had been garrisoned by her in 1756. The Corsicans also sent an ambassador to France in order to solicit recognition of the independence of the island, in consideration of a tribute equivalent to that which they had formerly paid to Genoa. The latter, feeling its inability to reconquer the island, at length decided practically to cede it. The transaction took the shape of a formal permission for the King of France to exercise all the rights of sover- eignty over all the places and harbors of Corsica, as security for debts owing to him by the republic. This cession, dis- guised under the form of a security in order to palliate the aggrandizement of France in the eyes of Austria and Eng- land, recalls the conditional and thinlv veiled surrender of DISPUTE ABOUT FALKLAND ISLANDS. 335 Cvprns to England nine years ago, — a transfer likely to be as final and far-reaching as that of Corsica. England then remonstrated and talked angrily ; but though Burke said, "Corsica as a province of France is terrible to me," only one member of the House of Commons, the veteran admiral Sir Charles Saunders, was found to say " that it would be better to go to war with France than consent to her taking- possession of Corsica." ^ Having in view the then well- recognized interests of England in the Mediterranean, it is evident tbat an island so well situated as Corsica for influ- encing the shores of Italy and checking the naval station at Minorca, would not have been allowed to go into the hands of a strong master, if the nation had felt ready and willing for war. Again, in 1770, a dispute arose between England and Spain relative to the possession of the Falkland Islands. It is not material to state the nature of either claim to what was then but a collection of barren islands, destitute of military as well as of natural advantages. Both England and Spain had had a settlement, on which the national colors were flying ; and at the English station a captain in the navy com- manded. Before this settlement, called Port Egmont, there suddenly appeared, in June, 1770, a Spanish expedition, fitted out in Buenos Ayres, of five frigates and sixteen hundred soldiers. To such a force the handful of Englishmen could make no serious resistance ; so after a few shots, exchanged for the honor of the flag, they capitulated. The news of this transaction, which reached England in the following October, showed by its reception how much more serious is an insult than an injury, and how much more bitterly resented. The transfer of Corsica had scarcely oc- casioned a stir outside the offices of statesmen ; the attack on Port Egmont roused the people and Parliament. The minister to Madrid was ordered to demand the immediate restoration of the islands, with a disavowal of tlic action of the officer who had ordered the attack. Without waiting 1 Mahon : Historv of England. 336 DEATH OF LOUIS XV. for a reply, ships were ordered into commission, press-gangs swept the streets, and in a short time a powerful fleet was ready at Spithcad to revenge the insult. Spain, relying upon the Bourbon family compact and the support of France, was disposed to stand firm ; but the old king, Louis XV., was averse to war, and Choiseul, among whose enemies at court was the last mistress, was dismissed. With his fall disappeared the hopes of Spain, which at once complied with the demands of England, reserving, however, the question as to the rights of sovereignty. This conclusion shows clearly that England, though still wielding an effective sea power able to control Spain, was not eager for a war merely in order to break down the rival navies. It is not wholly alien to the question of sea power to note, without dwelling upon it, a great event which now happened, seemingly utterly removed from all relation to the sea. The first partition of Poland between Prussia, Russia, and Austria, carried out in 1772, was made easier by the preoccupation of Choiseul with his naval policy and the Spanish alliance. The friendship and support of Poland and Turkey, as checks upon the House of Austria, were part of the tradition received from Henry IV. and Richelieu ; the destruction of the for- mer was a direct blow to the pride and interest of France. What Choiseul would have done had he been in office, cannot be known ; but if the result of the Seven Years' War had been different, France might have interfered to some purpose. On the 10th of May, 1774, Louis XV. died, at the time when the troubles in the North American colonies were fast com- ing to a head. Under his youthful successor, Louis XVI., the policy of peace on the continent, of friendly alliance with Spain, and of building up the navy in numbers and eilficiency, was continued. This was the foreign policy of Choiseul, directed against the sea power of England as the chief enemy, and toward the sea power of France as the chief support, of the nation. The instructions which, according to a French naval author, the new king gave to his ministers FOREIGN POLICY OF LOUIS XVI. 337 show the spirit with which his reign up to the Revolution was inspired, Avhether or not they originated with the king himself : — " To watch all indications of approaching danger ; to observe by cruisers the approaches to our islands and the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico ; to keep track of what was passing on the banks of Newfoundland, and to follow the tendencies of English commerce ; to observe in England the state of the troops and armaments, the public credit and the ministry ; to meddle adroitly in the affau's of the Britisli colonies ; to give the insurgent colonists the means of obtaining supjilies of war, while maintaining the strictest neutrality ; to develop actively, but noiselessly, the navy; to repair our ships of war ; to fill our storehouses and to keep on hand the means for rapidly equipping a fleet at Brest and at Toulon, while Spain should be fitting one at Ferrol ; finally, at the first serious fear of rupture, to assemble numerous troops upon the shores of Brittany and Normandy, and get everything ready for an invasion of England, so as to force her to concentrate her forces, and thus restrict her means of resistance at the extremities of the empire."^ Such instructions, whether given all at once as a sym- metrical, well-thought-out plan, or from time to time, as occasion arose, showed that an accurate forecast of the situation had been made, and breathed a conviction which, if earlier felt, would have greatly modified the history of tlie two countries. The execution was less thorough than the conception. In the matter of developing the navy, however, fifteen years of peace and steady work showed good results. When war openly broke out in 1778, France had eighty ships-of-the-line in good condition, and sixty-seven thousand seamen were borne on the rolls of the maritime conscription. Spain, when she entered the war in 1779 as the ally of France, had in her ports nearly sixty ships-of-the-line. To this combination England opposed a total number of two hundred and twenty- eight ships of all classes, of which about one hundred and fifty were of the line. The apparent equality in material ^ Lapeyrouse-Bonfils, vol. iii. p. 5. 90 338 CHARACTER OF THE NAVAL WAR OF 1778. which would result from these numbers was affected, to the disadvantage of England, by the superior size and artillery of the French and Spaniards ; but on the other hand her strength was increased by the unity of aim imparted by be- longing to one nation. The allies were destined to feel the proverbial weakness of naval coalitions, as well as the de- generate administration of Spain, and the lack of habit — may it not even be said without injustice, of aptitude for the sea — of both nations. The naval policy with which Louis XVI. began his reign was kept up to the end ; in 1791, two years after the assembly of the States-General, the French navy numbered eighty-six ships-of-the-line, generally superior, both in dimensions and model, to English ships of the same class. We have come, therefore, to the beginning of a truly maritime war ; which, as will be granted by those who have followed this narrative, had not been seen since the days of De Ruyter and Tourville. The magnificence of sea power and its value had perhaps been more clearly shown by the uncontrolled sway, and consequent exaltation, of one bellig- erent ; but the lesson thus given, if more striking, is less vividly interesting than the spectacle of that sea power meeting a foe worthy of its steel, and excited to exertion by a strife which endangered, not only its most valuable colonies, but even its own shores. Waged, from the ex- tended character of the British Empire, in all quarters of the world at once, the attention of the student is called now to the East Indies and now to the West ; now to the shores of tlie United States and thence to those of England ; from New York and Chesapeake Bay to Gibraltar and Minorca, to the Cape Verde Islands, the Cape of Good Hope, and Ceylon. Fleets now meet fleets of equal size, and the general chase and the melee., which marked the actions of Hawke, Boscawen, and Anson, though they still occur at times, are for the most part succeeded by wary and complicated manoeuvres, too often barren of decisive results as naval battles, which are the prevailing characteristic of this coming war. The superior tactical science of the French succeeded in impart- ORDERS TO FRENCH ADMIRALS. 339 ing to this conflict that peculiar feature of their naval pol- icy, which subordinated the control of the sea by the destruction of the enemy's fleets, of his organized naval forces, to the success of particular operations, the retention of particular points, the carrying out of particular ulterior strategic ends. It is not necessary to endeavor to force upon others the conviction of the present writer that such a policy, however applicable as an exception, is faulty as a rule ; but it is most desirable that all persons responsible for the con- duct of naval affairs should recognize that the two lines of policy, in direct contradiction to each other, do exist. In the one there is a strict analogy to a war of posts ; while in the other the objective is that force whose destruction leaves the posts unsupported and therefore sure to fall in due time. These opposing policies being recognized, consideration should also be had of the results of the two as exemplified in the history of England and France. It was not, however, with such cautious views that the new king at first sought to impress his admirals. In the instructions addressed to the Count d'Orvilliers, commanding the first fleet sent out from Brest, the minister, speaking in the name of the king, says : — " Your duty now is to restore to the French flag the lustre with which it once shone ; past misfortunes and faults must be buried out of sight ; only by the most illustrious actions can the navy hope to succeed in doing this. His Majesty has the right to expect the greatest efforts from his officers. . . . Under whatever circumstances the king's fleet may be placed, his Majesty's orders, which he ex- pressly charges me to impress upon you, as well as upon all officers in command, are that his ships attack with the greatest vigor, and defend themselves, on all occasions, to the last extremity." More follows to the same effect; upon which a French officer, who has not before been quoted in connection with this phase of French naval policy, says : — "How different this language from that held to our admirals durino- ihe last war ; for it would be an error to believe that they 310 ORDERS TO FRENCH ADMIRALS. followed by choice and temper the timid and defensive system which predominated in the tactics of the navy. The government, always finding the expenses exacted by the employment of the navy ex- cessive, too often prescribed to its admirals to keep the sea as long as possible without coming to pitched battles, or even to brushes, generally very expensive, and from which might follow the loss of ships difficult to replace. Often they were enjoined, if driven to accept action, carefully to avoid compromising the fate of their squadron by too decisive encounters. They thought themselves, therefore, obliged to retreat as soon as an engagement took too serious a turn. Thus they acquired the unhappy habit of voluntarily yielding the field of battle as soon as an enemy, even inferior, boldly disputed it with them. Thus to send a feet to meet the enemy, only to retire shamefully from his presence ; to receive action instead of offering it ; to begin battles only to end them with the semblance of defeat ; to ruin moral force in order to save physi- cal force, — that was the spirit which, as has been very judiciously said by M. Charles Dupin, guided the French ministry of that epoch. The results are known." ^ The brave words of Louis XVI. were followed almost im- mediately by others, of different and qualifying tenor, to Admiral d'Orvilliers before he sailed. He w^as informed that the king, having learned the strength of the English fleet, relied upon his prudence as to the conduct to be followed at a moment when he had under his orders all the naval force of which France could dispose. As a matter of fact tlie two fleets were nearly equal ; it would be impossible to decide which was the stronger, without detailed information as to the armament of every ship. D'Orvilliers found himself, as many a responsible man has before, with two sets of orders, on one or the other of which he was sure to be impaled, if unlucky ; while the government, in the same event, was sure of a scape-goat. The consideration of the relative force of the two navies, material and moral, has necessarily carried us beyond the date of the opening of the American Revolutionary War. Before 1 Troude, vol. ii. pp. .3-5. For other quotations from French authors to the same effect, see ante, pages 77, 80, 81. MILITARY SITUATION IN AMERICA. 34I beginning with that struggle, it may be well to supplement the rough estimate of England's total naval force, given, in lack of more precise information, by the statement of the First Lord of the Admiralty made in the House of Lords in Novem- ber, 1777, a very few months before the war with France began. Replying to a complaint of the opposition as to the smallness of the Channel fleet, he said : — " AVe have now fortj^-two ships-of-the-line in commission in Great Britain (without counting those on foreign service), thirty-five of which are completely manned, and ready for sea at a moment's warn- ing. ... I do not believe that either France or Spain entertains any hostile disposition toward us ; but from what I have now submitted to you, I am authorized to affirm that our navy is more than a match for that of the whole House of Bourbon." ^ It must, however, be said that this pleasing prospect was not realized by Admiral Kcppel when appointed to command in the following March, and looking at his fleet with (to use his own apt expression) " a seaman's eye ; " ^ and in June he went to sea with only twenty ships. It is plainly undesirable to insert in a narrative of this character any account of the political questions which led to the separation of the United States from the British Empire. It has already been remarked that the separation followed upon a succession of blunders by the English ministry, — not unnatural in view of the ideas generally prevalent at that day as to the relations of colonies to the mother-country. It needed a man of commanding genius to recognize, not only the substantial justice of the American claims, — many did that, — but also the military strength of their situation, as before indicated. This lay in the distance of the colonies from home, their nearness to each other independently of the command of the sea, the character of the colonists, — mainly of English and Dutch stock, — and the probable hostility of France and Spain. Unfortunately for England, the men most able to cope with the situation were in the minority and out of office. 1 Mahon : History of England; Geutleman's Magazine, 1777, p. 553. - Keppel's Defence. 342 THE LINE OF THE HUDSON. It has been said before that, had the thirteen colonies been islands, the sea power of Great Britain would have so com- pletely isolated them that their fall, one after the other,, must have ensued. To this it may be added that the narrow- ness of the strip then occupied by civilized man, and the man- ner in which it was intersected by estuaries of the sea and navigable rivers, practically reduced to the condition of islands, so far as mutual support went, great sections of the insurgent country, which were not large enough to stand alone, yet too large for their fall not to have been a fatal blow to the com- mon cause. The most familiar case is that of the line of the Hudson, w^iere the Bay of New York was held from the first by the British, who also took the city in September, 1776, two months after the Declaration of Independence. The difficul- ties in the way of moving up and down such a stream were doubtless much greater to sailing vessels than they now are to steamers ; yet it seems impossible to doubt that active and capable men wielding the great sea power of England could so have held that river and Lake Champlain with ships-of-war at intervals and accompanying galleys as to have supported a sufficient army moving between the head-waters of the Hudson and the lake, while themselves preventing any intercourse by water between New England and the States west of the river. This operation would have closely resembled that by which in the Civil War the United States fleets and armies gradually cut in twain the Southern Confederacy by mastering the course of the Mississippi, and the political results would have been even more important than the military ; for at that early stage of the war the spirit of independence was far more general and bitter in the section that would have been cut off, — in New England, — than in New York and New Jersey, perhaps than anywhere except in South Carolina.^ 1 "A candid view of our affairs, which I am going to exhibit, will make you a judge of the difficulties under which we labor. Almost all our supplies of flour and no inconsiderable part of our meat are drawn from the States westward of Hudson's River. This renders a secure communication across that river indis- pensably necessary, both to the support of your squadcon and the army. The enemy, being masters of that navigation, would interrupt this essential intercourse HOWE'S EXPEDITION TO PHILADELPHIA. 343 In 1777 the British attempted to accomplish this object by sending General Burgoyne fi'om Canada to force his way by Lake Champlain to the Hudson. At the same time Sir Henry Clinton moved north from New York with three thou- sand men, and reached West Point, whence he sent by ship- ping a part of his force up the river to within forty miles of Albany. Here the officer in command learned of the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga, and returned ; but what he did at the head of a detachment from a main body of only three thousand, shows what might have been done under a better system. While this was happening on the Hudson, the English commander-in-chief of the troops acting in America had curiously enough made use of the sea power of his nation to transport the bulk of his army — fourteen thousand men — from New York to the head of Chesa- peake Bay, so as to take Philadelpliia in the rear. This eccen- tric movement was successful as regarded its objective, Phila- delphia ; but it was determined by political considerations, because Philadelphia was the seat of Congress, and was con- trary to sound military policy. The conquest therefore was early lost ; but it was yet more dearly won, for by this diver- sion of the British forces the different corps were placed out of mutual support, and the control of the water-line of the Hudson was abandoned. While Burgoyne, with seven thou- sand regular troops, besides auxiliaries, was moving down to seize the head-waters of the river, fourteen thousand men were removed from its mouth to the Chesapeake. The eight thou- sand left in or near New York were consequently tied to the city by the presence of the American army in New Jersey. Tliis disastrous step was taken in August ; in October Burgoyne, isolated and hemmed in, surrendered. In the following May between the States. They have been sensible of these advantages. ... If they could by any demonstration in another part draw our attention and strength from this important point, and by anticipating our return possess themselves of it, the consequences Mould be fatal. Our dispositions must therefore have equal regard to co-operating with you [at Boston] in a defensive plan, and securing tlie North River, which the remoteness of the two objects from each other renders peculiarly difficult." — Washington to D'Estaing, Sept. 11, 1778. 344 AMERICAN PRIVATEERING. the English evacuated Philadelphia, and after a painful and perilous march through New Jersey, with Washington's army in close pursuit, regained New Yorlc. This taking of the British fleet to the head of the Chesa- peake, coupled with the ascent of the Potomac in 1814 by English sailing-frigates, shows another weak line in the chain of the American colonies ; but it was not, like that of the Hudson and Champlain, a line both ends of which rested in the enemy's power, — in Canada on the one hand, on the sea on the other. As to the sea warfare in general, it is needless to enlarge upon the fact that the colonists could make no head against the fleets of Great Britain, and were consequently forced to abandon the sea to them, resorting only to a cruising warfare, mainly by privateers, for which their seamanship and enter- prise well fitted them, and by which they did much injury to English commerce. By the end of 1778 the Englisli naval historian estimates that American privateers had taken nearly a thousand merchant-ships, valued at nearly X 2,000,000 ; he claims, however, that the losses of the Americans were heavier. They should have been ; for the English cruisers were both better supported and individually more powerful, while the extension of American commerce had come to be the wonder of the statesmen of the mother-country. Wlien the war broke out, it was as great as that of England herself at the beginning of the century. An interesting indication of the number of the seafaring population of North America at that time is given by the statement in Parliament by the First Lord of the Admiralty, " that the navy had lost eighteen thousand of the seamen em- ployed in the last war by not having America," ^ — no incon- siderable loss to a sea power, particularly if carried over to the ranks of the enemy. The course of warfare on the sea gave rise, as always, to grievances of neutrals against the English for the seizures of their ships in the American trade. Such provocation, however, 1 Annual Register, 1778, p. 201. FRENCH SUPPORT OF THE AMERICANS. 345 was not necessary to excite the enmity and the hopes of France in the harassed state of the British government. The hour of reckoning, of vengeance, at which the poHcy of Choiseul had aimed, seemed now at hand. The question was early enter- tained at Paris what attitude should be assumed, what advan- tage drawn from the revolt of the colonies. It was decided that the latter should receive all possible support short of an actual break with England ; and to this end a Frenchman named Beaumarchais was furnished with money to establish a business house which should supply the colonists with warlike stores. France gave a million francs, to which Spain added an equal sum, and Beaumarchais was allowed to buy from gov- ernment arsenals. Meanwhile agents were received from the United States, and French officers passed into its service with little real hindrance from their government. Beaumarchais' house was started in 1776 ; in December of that year Ben- jamin Franklin landed in France, and in May, 1777, Lafayette came to America. Meanwhile the preparations for war, espe- cially for a sea war, were pushed on ; the navy was steadily increased, and arrangements were made for threatening an in- vasion from the Channel, while the real scene of the war was to be in the colonies. There France was in the position of a man who has little to lose. Already despoiled of Canada, she had every reason to believe that a renewal of war, with Europe neutral and the Americans friends instead of enemies, would not rob her of her islands. Recognizing that the Americans, who less than twenty years before had insisted upon the con- quest of Canada, would not consent to her regaining it, she expressly stipulated that she would have no such hopes, but exacted that in the coming war she should retain any Eng- lish "West Indian possessions which she could seize. Spain was differently situated. Hating England, wanting to regain Gibraltar, Minorca, and Jamaica, — no mere jewels in her crown, but foundation-stones of her sea power, — she never- theless saw that the successful rebellion of the English colo- nists against the hitherto unrivalled sea power of the mother- country would be a dangerous example to her own enormous 346 TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND AMERICA. colonial system, from which she yearly drew so great sub- sidies. If England with her navy should fail, what could Spain achieve ? In the introductory chapter it was pointed out that the income of the Spanish government was drawn, not as a light tax upon a wealthy sea power, built upon the industry and commerce of the kingdom, but from a narrow stream of gold and silver trickling through a few treasure- ships loaded with the spoils of colonies administered upon the narrowest system. Spain had much to lose, as well as to gain. It was true still, as in 1760, that she was the power witli which England could war to the greatest advantage. Nevertheless, existing injuries and dynastic sympathy carried the day. Spain entered upon the secretly hostile course pursued by France. To this explosive condition of things the news of Burgoyne's surrender acted as a spark. The experience of former wars had taught France the worth of the Americans as enemies, and she was expecting to find in them valuable helpers in her schemes of revenge ; now it seemed that even alone they might be able to take care of themselves, and reject any alliance. The tidings reached Europe on the 2d of December, 1777 ; on the 16th the French foreign minister informed the commissioners of Congress that the king was ready to recog- nize the independence of the United States, and to make with them a commercial treaty and contingent defensive alliance. The speed with which the business was done shows that France had made up her mind ; and the treaty, so momentous in its necessary consequences, was signed on the 6th of Feb- ruary, 1778. It is not necessary to give the detailed terms of the treaty ; but it is important to observe, first, that the express renuncia- tion of Canada and Nova Scotia by France foreshadowed that political theory which is now known as the Monroe doctrine, the claims of which can scarcely be made good without an adequate sea-force ; and next, that the alliance with France, and subsequently with Spain, brought to the Americans that which they above all needed, — a sea power to counterbalance THE MILITARY SITUATION IN 177S. 347 that of England. Will it be too much for American pride to admit that, had France refused to contest the control of the sea with England, the latter would have been able to reduce the Atlantic seaboard ? Let us not kick down the ladder by which we mounted, nor refuse to acknowledge what our fathers felt in their hour of trial. Before going on with the story of this maritime war, the military situation as it existed in the different parts of the world should be stated. The three features which cause it to differ markedly from that at the opening of the Seven Years' War, in 1756, are — (1) the hostile relation of America to England ; (2) the early appearance of Spain as the ally of France ; and (3) the neu- trality of the other continental States, which left France without preoccupation on the land side. On the North American continent the Americans had held Boston for two years. Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island were occupied by the English, who also held New York and Philadelphia. Chesapeake Bay and its entrance, being with- out strong posts, were in the power of any fleet that appeared against them. In the South, since the unsuccessful attack upon Charlestown in 1776, no movement of importance had been made by the English ; up to the declaration of war by France the chief events of the war had been north of the Chesapeake (of Baltimore). In Canada, on the other hand, the Americans had failed, and it remained to the end a firm base to the English power. In Europe the most significant element to be noted is the state of preparedness of the French navy, and to some extent of the Spanish, as compared with previous wars. England stood wholly on the defensive, and without allies ; while tlie Bourbon kings aimed at the conquest of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, and the invasion of England. The first two, however, were the dear objects of Spain, the last of France ; and this divergence of aims was fatal to the success of this maritime coalition. In the introductory chapter allusion was made to the strategic question raised by these two policies. 348 MILITARY SITUATION IN THE WEST INDIES. In the West Indies the grip of the two combatants on the land was in fact about equal, though it should not hare been so. Both France and England were strongly- posted in the Windward Islands, — the one at Martinique, the other at Barbadoes. It must be noted that the posi- tion of the latter, to windward of all others of the group, was a decided strategic advantage in the days of sail. As it happened, the fighting was pretty nearly confined to the neighborhood of the Lesser Antilles. Here, at the opening of the struggle, the English island of Dominica lay between tiie French Martinique and Guadeloupe ; it was therefore coveted and seized. Next south of Martinique lay Sta. Lucia, a French colony. Its strong harbor on the lee side, known as Gros Hot Bay, was a capital place from which to watch the proceedings of the French navy in Fort Royal, Martinique. The English captured the island, and from that safe anchorage Rodney watched and pursued the French fleet before his famous action in 1782. The islands to the southward were of inferior military consequence. In the greater islands, Spain should have outweighed England, holding as she did Cuba, Porto Rico, and, with France, Hayti, as against Jamaica alone. Spain, however, counted here for nothing but a dead- weight ; and England had elsewhere too much on her hands to attack her. The only point in America where the Spanish arms made themselves felt was in the great region east of the Mississippi, then known as Florida, which, though at that time an English possession, did not join the revolt of the colonies. In the East Indies it will be remembered that France had received back her stations at the peace of 1763 ; but the politi- cal predominance of the English in Bengal was not offset by similar control of the French in any part of the peninsula. During the ensuing years the English had extended and strengthened their power, favored in so doing by the charac- ter of their chief representatives, Clive and Warren Hastings. Powerful native enemies had, however, risen against them in the south of the peninsula, both on the east and west, afford- EVENTS IN INDIA. 349 ing an excellent opportunity for France to regain her influence ■svben the war broke out ; but her government and people remained blind to the possibilities of that vast region. Not so England. The very day the news of the outbreak of war reached Calcutta, July 7, 1778, Hastings sent orders to the governor of Madras to attack Pondicherry, and set the example by seizing Chandernagore. The naval force of each nation was insignificant ; but the French commodore, after a brief action, forsook Pondicherry, which surrendered after a siege by land and sea of seventy days. The following March, 1779, Mah(;, the last French settlement, fell, and the French flag- again disappeared ; while at the same time there arrived a strong English squadron of six ships-of-the-line under Admiral Hughes. The absence of any similar French force gave the entire control of the sea to the English until the arrival of Suffren, nearly three years later. In the mean while Holland had been drawn into the war, and her stations, Negapatam on the Coromandel coast, and the very important harbor of Trin- comalee in Ceylon, were both captured, the latter in January, 1782, by the joint forces of the army and navy. The success- ful accomplishment of these two enterprises completed the military situation in Hindostan at the time when the arrival of Suffren, just one month later, turned the nominal war into a desperate and bloody contest. Suffren found himself with a decidedly stronger squadron, but without a port, either French or allied, on Avhich to base his operations against the English. Of these four chief theatres of the war, two, North America and the \Yest Indies, as might be expected from their near- ness, blend and directly affect each other. This is not so obviously the case with the struggles in Europe and India. The narrative therefore naturally falls into three principal divisions, which may to some extent be treated separately. After such separate consideration their mutual influence will be pointed out, together with any useful lessons to be gathered from the goodness or badness, the success or failure, of the grand combinations, and from the part played by sea power. 350 OUTBREAK OF WAR, 177S. On the loth of March, 1778, the French ambassador at London notified the English government that France had acknowledged the independence of the United States, and made with them a treaty of commerce and defensive alliance. England at once recalled her ambassador ; but though war was imminent and England at disadvantage, the Spanish king offered mediation, and France wrongly delayed to strike. In June, Admiral Keppel sailed from Portsmouth, with twenty ships, on a cruise. Falling in with two French frigates, his guns, to bring them to, opened the war. Finding from their papers that thirty-two French ships lay in Brest, he at once returned for reinforcements. Sailing again with thirty ships, he fell in with the French fleet under D'Orvilliei'S to the west- ward of Ushant, and to windward, with a westerly wind. On the 27th of July was fought the first fleet action of the war, generally known as the battle of Ushant. This battle, in which thirty ships-of-the-line fought on either side, was wholly indecisive in its results. No ship was taken or sunk ; both fleets, after separating, returned to their re- spective ports. The action nevertheless obtained great celeb- rity in England from the public indignation at its lack of result, and from the storm of naval and political controversy which followed. The admiral and the ofiicer third in command belonged to different political parties ; they made charges, one against the other, and in the following courts-martial all England divided, chiefly on party lines. Public and naval sentiment generally favored the commander-in-chief, Keppel. Tactically, the battle presents some interesting features, and involves one issue which is still living to-day. Keppel was to leeward and wished to force an action ; in order to do this he signalled a general chase to windward, so that his fastest ships might overtake the slower ones of the enemy. Granting equal original fleet-speed, this was quite correct. D'Orvilliers, to windward, had no intention of fighting except on his own terms. As will generally be the case, the fleet acting on the offensive obtained its wish. At daybreak of the 27th both fleets were on the port tack, heading west-northwest, with a W 8 1 2 5 8 Ro @ 1 Wfi 0 6 6 0 0 { _ s BATTLE OF USIIANT. 35I steady breeze at soutlnvest (Plate IX., A, A, A). 1 The Eiio-- ish rear (R) had fallen to leeward,^ and Kcppcl consequently made signal to six of its ships to chase to windward, so as to place them in a better position to support the main body if it could get into action. D'Orvilliers observed this movement, and construed it to show au intention to attack his rear with a superior force. The two fleets being then from six to eight miles apart, he wore his fleet in succession (French A to B), by which he lost ground to leeward, but approached the enemy, and was able to see them better (Positions B, B, B). At the completion of this e solution the wind hauled to the south- ward, favoring the English ; so Keppel, instead of going about, stood on for half an hour more (English B to C), and then tacked together in wake of the French. This con- firmed D'Orvilliers' suspicions, and as the wind, which cer- tainly favored, the English that morning, now hauled back again to the westward, permitting them to lay up for the French rear, he wore his fleet together (B to C), thus bring- ing the rest to aid the rear, now become the van, and pre- venting Keppel from concentrating on or penetrating it. The two fleets thus passed on opposite tacks (C),^ exchanging ineffective broadsides, the French running free to windward and having the power to attack, but not using it. D'Orvilliers then made the signal for his van, formerly the rear, to wear to leeward of the English rear, which was to leeward of its 1 In this plate the plan followed in every other instance, of showing only the characteristic phases of a battle, in succession, but disconnected, has been aban- doned, and the attempt is to indicate continnously the series of manoeuvres and the tracks by which the fleets at last came into contact (from A to C). As the battle consisted merely in the passage by each other of two fleets, moving in opposite parallel directions, an encounter always indecisive and futile, the previous manoeuvres constitute the chief interest in an affair whose historical irapoTtance is due to other than tactical reasons. 2 The line drawn through the centre of the English fleet at A shows tlie close-hauled line (south-southeast) on which, by strict tactical requirement, the English sliips should have borne from each other. 3 The leading ships of the two fleets diverged from each other (C), which is, hy the French, attributed to tlie Englisli van keeping away ; by the Englisli it is said that the French van luffed.

On the English side the same manoeuvre was attempted. The admiral of the van and some of his ships tacked, as soon as out of fire (D),i and stood after the French rear ; but for the most part the damage to rigging prevented tacking, and wearing was impossible on account of the ships coming up behind. The French now stood to leeward and formed line again, but the English were not in condition to attack. Tliis was the end of the battle. It has been said that there are some interesting points about this resultless engagement. One is, that Keppel's conduct was approved throughout, on oath before the court-martial, by one of the most distinguished admirals England has brought forth, Sir John Jervis, who commanded a ship in the fleet. It does not indeed appear what he could have done more ; but his lack of tactical understanding is shown by a curious re- mark in his defence. " If the French admiral really meant to come to action," says he, " I apprehend he would never have put his fleet on the contrary tack to that on which the British fleet was approaching." This remark can only proceed from ignorance or thoughtlessness of the danger to which the rear of the French fleet would have been exposed, and is the more curious as he himself had said the English were lying up for it. Keppel's idea seems to have been that the French should have waited for him to come up abreast, and then go at it, ship for ship, in what was to him the good old style ; D'Orvilliers was too highly trained to be capable of such action. The failure of the Due de Chartres,^ commanding the French van during the firing, to wear in obedience to orders, 1 The position D, separated from the rest of the plan, shows the end of the passage by, which began at C.

POSITION OF AN ADMIRAL IN BATTLE. 353 whether due to misunderstanding or misconduct, raises the question, which is still debated, as to the ])n)per position for a naval commander-in-chief in action. Had D'Orvilliers been in the van, he could have insured the evolution he wished. From the centre the admiral has the extremities of his fleet equally visible, or invisible, as it may be. At the head he enforces his orders by his example. The French toward the end of this war solved the question by taking him out of the line altogether and putting him on board a frigate, for the avowed reasons that he could thus better see the move- ments of his fleet and of the enemy without being blinded by smoke or disti'acted by the occurrences on board his own ship, and that his signals could be better seen.^ This posi- tion, resembling somewhat that of a general on shore, being remote from personal risk, was also assumed by Lord Howe in 1778 ; but both that officer and the French abandoned the practice later. Nelson at Trafalgar, the end of his career, led his column ; but it may be doubted whether he had any other motive than his ardor for battle. The two other great attacks in which he commanded in chief were directed against ships at anchor, and in neither did he take the head of the column ; for the good reason that, his knowl- edge of the ground being imperfect, the leading ship was in most danger of grounding. The common practice in the days of broadside sailing-ships, except when a general chase was ordered, was for the admiral to be in the line, and in the centre of it. The departure from this custom on the part of both Nelson and Collingwood, each of wdiom led his own columns at Trafalgar, may have had some reason, and an ordinary man rather shrinks from criticising the action of officers of their eminence. The danger to which were exposed the two senior officers of the fleet, upon whom so much de- pended, is obvious ; and had any serious injury befallen their persons, or the head of their columns, the lack of their influ- ence would have been seriously felt. As it was, they were 1 The capture of the Freuch commauder-in-chief on board his flag-ship, in the battle of April 12, 1782, was also a motive for this new order. 23 354: POSITION OF A NA VAL speedilj obliterated, as admirals, iu the smoke of the battle, leaving to those who came after them no guidance or control except the brilliancy of their courage and example. A French admiral has pointed out that the practical effect of the mode of attack at Trafalgar, two columns bearing down upon a line at right angles to them, was to sacrifice the head of the columns in making two breaches in the enemy's line. So far, very well ; the sacrifice was well worth while ; and into these breaches came up the rear ships of each column, nearly fresh, forming in fact a reserve which fell upon the shattered ships of the enemy on either side of the breaks. Now this idea of a reserve prompts a thought as to the commander-in-chief. The size of his ship was such as precluded its being out of the order ; but would it not have been well had the admiral of each column been with this reserve, keeping in his hands the power of directing it according to the chances of the action, making him a reality as well as a name for some time longer, and to a very useful purpose ? The difficulty of arranging any system of signals or light despatch-boats which could take the place of the aids or messengers of a general, coupled with the fact that ships cannot stand still, as divisions of men do, waiting orders, but that they must have steerage-way, precludes the idea of putting an admiral of a fleet under way in a light vessel. By so doing he becomes simply a spectator ; whereas by being in the most powerful ship of the fleet he retains the utmost weight possible after action is once engaged, and, if this ship be in the reserve, the admiral keeps to the latest possible moment the power of commander-in-chief in his own hands. " Half a loaf is better than no bread ; " if the admiral cannot, from the conditions of sea warfare, occupy the calmly watchful position of his brother on shore, let there be secured for him as much as may be. The practice of Farragut after New Orleans and Yicksburg, that is to say, in the latter part of his career, when it may be believed experience had deter- mined his views, was to lead in person. It is known that he very reluctantly, at the solicitation of various officers, yielded his convictions in this matter at Mobile so far as to take the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN BATTLE. 600 second place, and afterward freely expressed his regrets for having done so. It may, however, be argued that the char- acter of all the actions in which Farragut commanded had a peculiarity, differentiating them from battles in the strict sense of the word. At New Orleans, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, and at Mobile, the task was not to engage, but to pass fortifications which the fleet confessedly could not stand up to ; and the passage was to be made under conditions mainly of pilotage upon ground as to which, unlike Nelson, he had good knowledge. There was thus imposed upon the commander-in-chief the duty of leadership in the literal, as well as the military, sense of the term. So leading, he not only pointed out to the fleet the safe road, but, drawing continually ahead of the smoke, was better able to see and judge the path ahead, and to assume the responsibility of a course which he may have prescribed and intended through- out, but from which a subordinate might shrink. It has not perhaps been commonly noted, that at Mobile the lead- ers, not only of one but of both columns, at the critical point of the road hesitated and doubted as to the admiral's purpose ; not that they had not received it clearly, but because circumstances seemed to them to be different from what he had supposed. Not only Alden in the " Brooklyn," but Craven also in the '• Tecumseh," departed from the admiral's orders and left the course dictated to them, with disastrous results. There is no necessity to condemn either captain ; but the irresistible inference is that Farragut was unqualifiedly right in his opinion that the man who alone has the highest re- sponsibility should, under the conditions of his battles, be in the front. And here it must be remarked that at such critical moments of doubt any but the highest order of mind tends to throw off the responsibility of decision upon the superior, though from the instancy of the case hesitation or delay may be fatal. A man who as the commissioned chief would act intelligently, as the mere subordinate will balk. Nelson's action at St. Vincent will rarely be emulated, a truth which is strongly shown by the fact that CoUingwood 356 POSITION OF A NAVAL was immediately in his rear that day, and did not imitate liis action till signalled by the commander-in-chief ; yet after receiving the authority of the signal, he particularly distin- guished himself by his judgment and daring.^ It will be recalled, also, in connection with this question of pilot-ground battles, that a central position nearly lost the flag-ship at New Orleans, owing to the darkness and to the smoke from the pre- ceding ships ; the United States fleet came near finding itself without its leader after the passage of the forts. Now as the mention of a reserve prompted one set of considerations, so the name of pilotage suggests certain ideas, broader than itself, which modify what lias been said of keeping the ad- miral with the reserve. The ease and quickness with wliich a steam fleet can change its formation make it very probable that a fleet bearing down to attack may find itself, almost at the very moment of collision, threatened with some un- looked-for combination ; then where would be the hajjpiest position for an admiral ? Doubtless in that part of his own 1 The following incident, occurring during Rodney's chase of De Grasse, in April, 1782, shows how far subordination may be carried. Hood was one of the finest of the British officers ; nor does the author undertake to criticise his action. He was some miles from Rodney at the time. " The separated French ship in the N.W., having got the breeze at the same time as our van division, boldly stood for and endeavored to weather the British advanced ships ; that being the only way to regain her own fleet, then to windward. To such a length did she carry her audacity that she compelled the Alfred, the head- most ship of Sir Samuel Hood's division, to bear up in order to allow her to pass. Every eye was fixed upon the bold Frenchman, excepting those who were anxiously looking out on the commander-in-chief to make the signal to engage, but who, most likely from not supposing it could be an enemy, did not throw out the ardently looked-for signal, and therefore not a gun was fired. This is mentioned to show the state of discipline on board the ships composing Sir Samuel Hood's division, and that he, though second in command, would not fire a single shot until directed to do so by his commander-in-chief. 'It is more than probable that Sir S. Hood's reason for having waited for the signal to engage from his commander-in-chief, ere he would fire, arose from the supposition that had he been the occasion of prematurely bringing on an action under the above circumstances, he would have been responsible for the results.' " (White's Naval Researches, p. 97.) Hood may have been influenced l.v Rodney's bearing toward inferiors who.«e initiative displeased him. The relations of the two seem to have been strained. COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IN BATTLE. 357 order where he could most readily pilot his ships into the new disposition, or direction, by which he would meet the changed conditions ; that is, in the position of leading. It would seem that there are always two moments of greatest importance in a sea-light ; one which determines the method of the main attack, the other the bringing up and directing the effort of the reserve. If the first is more important, the second perhaps requires the higher order of ability ; for the former may and should proceed on a before-determined plan, while the latter may, and often must, be shaped to meet unfore- seen exigencies. The conditions of sea-battles of the future contain one element that land battles cannot have, — the ex- treme rapidity with which encounters and changes of order can take place. However troops may be moved by steam to the field of battle, they will there fight on foot or on horse- back, and with a gradual development of their plan, which will allow the commander-in-chief time to make his wishes known (as a rule, of course), in case of a change in the enemy's attack. On the other hand, a fleet, comparatively small in numbers and with its component units clearly de- fined, may be meditating an important change of which no sign can appear until it begins, and which will occupy but a few minutes. So far as these remarks are sound, they show the need of a second in command thoroughly conver- sant with not only the plans, but with the leading principles of action of his chief, — a need plain enough from the fact that the two extremities of the order-of-battle may be necessarily remote, and that you want the spirit of the leader at both ex- tremities. As he cannot be there in person, the best thing is to have an efilicient second at one end. As regards Nelson's position at Trafalgar, mentioned at the beginning of this dis- cussion, it is to be noted that the " Victory " did nothing that another ship could not have done as well, and that the light- ness of the wind forbade the expectation of any sudden change in the enemy's order. The enormous risk run by the person of the admiral, on whose ship was concentrated the fire of the enemy's line, and which led several captains to implore 358 N£:lson and collingwood. a change, was condemned long before by Nelson himself in one of his letters after the battle of the Nile : — " I think, if it liad pleased God I had not been wounded, not a boat would have escaped to have told the tale ; but do not believe that any individual in the fleet is to blame. ... I only mean to say that if my experience could in person have directed those individuals, there was every appearance that Almighty God would have continued to bless my endeavors," etc.-^ Yet, notwithstanding such an expression of opinion based upon experience, he took the most exposed position at Trafal- gar, and upon the loss of the leader there followed a curious exemplification of its effects. Collingwood at once, rightly or wrongly, avoidably or unavoidably, reversed Nelson's plans, urged with his last breath. " Anchor ! Hardy, do you anchor I " said the dying chief. " Anchor ! " said Colling- wood. " It is the last thing I should have thought of." 1 Sir N. H. Nicholas : Despatches and Letters of Lord Nelson. CHAPTER X. Maritime War ix North America and West Indies, 1778-1781. — Its Influence upon the course of the American Revo- lution. — Fleet Actions off Grenada, Dominica, and Chesa- peake Bay. ON the 15th of April, 1778, Admiral Comte d'Estaing sailed from Toulon for the American continent, having under his command twelve ships-of-the-line and five frigates. With him went as a passenger a minister accredited to Con- gress, who was instructed to decline all requests for subsidies, and to avoid explicit engagements relative to the conquest of Canada and other British possessions. " The Cabinet of Ver- sailles," says a French historian, " was not sorry for the United States to have near them a cause of anxiety, which would make them feel the value of the French alliance." ^ While acknowledging the generous sympathy of many French- men for their struggle, Americans need not blind themselves to the self-interestedness of the French government. Neither should they find fault ; for its duty was to consider French interests first. D'Estaing's progress was very slow. It is said tliat he wasted much time in drills, and even uselessly. However that may be, he did not reach his destination, the Capes of the Delaware, until the 8th of July, — making a passage of twelve weeks, four of which were spent in reaching the At- lantic. The English government liad news of his intended sailing; and in fact, as soon as they recalled their ambas- sador at Paris, orders were sent to America to evacuate Phila- delphia, and concentrate upon New York. Fortunately for 1 Martin : History of France. 360 D'ESTAING AT NEW YOP^ them, Lord Howe's movements were marked by a vigor and system other than D'Estaing's. First assembling his fleet and transports in Delaware Bay, and then hastening the embarka- tion of stores and supplies, he left Philadelphia as soon a« ^^^. army had marched from there for New York. "^ taken up in reaching the mouth of the bay ; ^ but ne si from it the 28tli of June, ten days before D'Estaing arri though more tlian ten weeks after he had sailed. Once out- side, a favoring wind took the whole fleet to Sandy Hook in two days. War is unforgiving ; the prey that D'Estaing had missed by delays foiled him in his attempts upon both New York and Rhode Island. The day after Howe's arrival at Sandy Hook the English army reached the heights of Navesink, after an harassing march through New Jersey, with Washington's troops hang- ing upon its rear. By the active co-operation of the navy it was carried up to New York by the 5th of July ; and Howe then went back to bar the entrance to the port against the French fleet. As no battle followed, the details of his ar- rangements will not be given ; but a very full and interesting account by an officer of the fleet can be found in Eldns's " Naval Battles." Attention, however, may well be called to the combination of energy, thought, skill, and determination shown by the admiral. The problem before him was to defend a practicable pass with six sixty-four-gun ships and three of fifty, against eight of seventy-four guns or over, three sixty-fours, and one fifty, — it may be said against nearly double his own force. D'Estaing anchored outside, south of the Hook, on the 11th of July, and there remained until the 22d, engaged in sound- ing the bar, and with every apparent determination to enter. On the 22d a high northeast wind, coinciding with a spring tide, raised the water on the bar to thirty feet. The French fleet got under way, and worked up to windward to a point fair for crossing the bar. Then D'Estaing's heart failed him ^ This delay was due to calms.

Naval officej-s cannot but sympathize with the hesitation ^p - ^oovwTf^ii to disregard the advice of pilots, especially on a • to him ; but such sympathy should not close t eyes to the highest type of character. Let any one com- .<j the action of D'Estaing at New York with that of Nelson yt Copenhagen and the Nile, or that of Farragut at Mobile and Port Hudson, and the inferiority of the Frenchman as a mili- tary leader, guided only by military considerations, is painfully apparent. New York was the very centre of the British power ; its fall could not but have shortened the war. In faii'ucss to D'Estaing, however, it must be remembered that other than military considerations had to weigh with him. The French admiral doubtless had instructions similar to those of the French minister, and he probably reasoned that France had nothing to gain by the fall of New York, which might have led to peace between America and England, and left the latter free to turn all her power against his own coun- try. Less than that would have been enough to decide his wavering mind as to risking his fleet over the bar. Howe was more fortunate than D'Estaing, in having no divided purposes. Having escaped from Philadelphia and saved New York by his diligence, he had in store the further honor of saving Rhode Island by the like rajiid movements. Scattered ships-of-war from a fleet despatched from England now began to ai-rive. On the 28th of July Howe was informed that the French fleet, which had disappeared to the southward, had been seen heading for Rhode Island. In four days his fleet was ready for sea, but owing to contrary winds did not reach Point Judith till the 9th of August. There he anchored, and learned that D'Estaing had run the batteries the day be- fore and anchored between Gould and Canonicut Islands ; ^ 1 Most accounts say between Goat Island and Canonicut ; l)ut the position given seems more probable. The names " Goat " and " Gould " (often written " Gold ") are easily confused. Since writing the above, the autlior has been favored with the sight of a contemporary manuscript map obtained in Paris, which shows the anchorage as near Canonicut and abreast Coaster's Harbor 362 HOWE AND D'ESTAING. the Seakonnet and Western passages had also been occupied by French ships, and the fleet was prepared to sustain the American army in an attack upon the British works. The arrival of Howe, although his reinforcements did not raise the English fleet to over two thirds the strength of the French, upset D'Estaing's plans. With the prevailing sum- mer southwest breezes blowing straight into the bay, he was exposed to any attempts his adversary might make. That same night the wind shifted unexpectedly to the northward; and D'Estaing at once got under way and stood out to sea, Howe, though surprised by this unlooked-for act, — for he had not felt himself strong enougii to attack, — also made sail to keep the weather-gage. The next twenty-four hours passed in manoeuvring for the advantage ; but on the night of the 11th of August a violent gale of wind dispersed the fleets. Great injury was done to the vessels of both, and among others the French flag-ship " Languedoc," of ninety guns, lost all her masts and her rudder. Immediately after the gale two different English fiftj^-gun ships, in fighting order, fell in, the one with the " Languedoc," the other with the "Tonnant," of eighty guns, having only one mast stand- ing. Under such conditions both English ships attacked ; but night coming on, they ceased action, intending to begin again in the morning. When morning came, other French ships also came, and the opportunity was lost. It is sug- gestive to note that one of the captains was Hotham, who as admiral of the Mediterranean fleet, seventeen years later, so annoyed Nelson by his cool satisfaction in having taken only two ships : " We must be contented ; we have done very well." This was the immediate occasion of Nelson's char- acteristic saying, " Had we taken ten sail, and allowea the eleventh to escape, being able to get at her, I could never have called it well done." Island ; the latter being marked " L'Tsle d'Or ou Golde Isle." The sketch, while accurate in its main details, seems the more authentic from its mistakes being such as a foreigner, during a hurried and exciting stay of twenty-four hours, might readily make. ACTIVITY SHOWN BY HOWE. 363 The Eng:lish fell back on New York. The French rallied again off the entrance of Narragansett Bay ; but D'Estaino- decided that he could not remain on account of the damage to the squadron, and accordingly sailed for Boston on the 21st of August. Rhode Island was thus left to the English, who retained it for a year longer, evacuating then for strategic reasons. Howe on his part diligently repaired his ships, and sailed again for Rhode Island when he heard of the French being there ; but meeting on the way a vessel with word of their going to Boston, he followed them to that harbor, in which they were too strongly placed to be attacked. Taking into consideration his enforced return to New York, the neces- sary repairs, and the fact that he was only four days behind the French at Boston, it may be believed that Howe showed to the end the activity which characterized the beginning of his operations. Scarcely a shot had been exchanged between the two fleets, yet the weaker had thoroughly outgeneral led the stronger. With the exception of the manoeuvres for the weather-gage after D'Estaing left Newport, which have not been preserved, and of Howe's dispositions to receive the expected attack in New York Bay, the lessons are not tactical, but strategic, and of present application. Chief among them undoubtedly stands the value of celerity and watchfulness, combined with knowl- edge of one's profession. Howe learned of his danger by advices from home three weeks after D'Estaing sailed from Toulon. He had to gather in his cruisers from the Chesa- peake and outside, get his ships-of-the-line from New York and Rhode Island, embark the supplies of an army of ten thousand men, move down the Delaware, — which unavoidably took ten days, — and round to New York again. D'Estaing was ten days behind him at the Delaware, twelve days at Sandy Hook, and only one day ahead of him in entering Newport, outside which harbor he had lain ten days before sailing in. An English narrator in the fleet, speaking of the untiring labor between June 30, when the English army reached Navesink, and the arrival of the French fleet on the 364 SUCCESS OF HOWE'S MOVEMENTS. 11th of July, says : " Lord Howe attended in person as usual, and by his presence animated the zeal and quickened the industry of officers and men." In this quality he was a marked contrast to his amiable but indolent brother, Gen- eral Howe. The same industry and watchfulness marked his remaining operations. As soon as the French ships hauled off to the southward, lookout vessels followed them, and preparations continued (notably of fireships) for pursuit. The last ship that joined from England crossed the bar at New York on the 30th of July. On the 1st of August the fleet was ready for sea, with four fire-ships. The accident of the wind delayed his next movements; but, as has been seen, he came up only one day after the entrance of the enemy into Newport, which his inferior force could not have pre- vented. But the object of the enemy, which he could not oppose, was frustrated by his presence. D'Estaing was no sooner in Newport tiian he wished himself out. Howe's position was strategically excellent. With his weatherly position in reference to the prevailing winds, the difficulty of beating a fleet out through the narrow entrance to the harbor would expose the French ships trying it to be at- tacked in detail ; while if the wind unluckily came fair, the admiral relied upon his own skill to save his squadron. Cooper, in one of his novels, " The Two Admirals," makes his hero say to a cavilling friend that if he had not been in the way of good luck, he could not have profited by it. The sortie of the French, the subsequent gale, and the resulting damage were all what is commonly called luck ; but if it had not been for Howe's presence off Point Judith threatening them, they would have ridden out the gale at their anchors inside. Howe's energy and his confidence in himself as a sea- man had put him in the way of good luck, and it is not fair to deny his active share in bringing it about. But for him the gale would not have saved the British force in Newport.^ 1 " The arrival of the French fleet upon the coast of America is a great and striking event; but the operations of it have been injured by a number D'ESTAING IN THE WEST INDIES. 365 D'Estaing, having repaired his ships, sailed with liis whole force for Martinique on the -Ith of November ; on the same day Commodore Hotham left New York for Barbadoes, with five sixty-four and fifty-gun ships and a convoy of five thousand troops, destined for the conquest of Sta. Lucia Island. On the way a heavy gale of wind injured the French fleet more than the English, the French flag-ship losing her main and mizzcn topmasts. The loss of these spars, and the fact that twelve unencumbered ships-of-war reached Martinique only one day before the convoy of fifty-nine English transports reached Barbadoes, a hundred miles farther on, tells badly for the professional skill which then and now is a determining feature in naval war. Admiral Barrington, commanding at Barbadoes, showed the same energy as Howe. The transports arrived on the 10th ; the troops were kept on board ; sailed on the morning of the 12th for Sta. Lucia, and anchored there at three p. m, the 13th. The same afternoon half the troops were landed, and the rest the next morning. They seized at once a better port, to which the admiral was about to move the transports when the appearance of D'Estaing prevented him. All that night of unforeseen and unfavorable circumstances, which, though they ought not to detract from the merit and good intention of our great ally, have nevertheless lessened the importance of its services in a great degree. The length of the pas- sage, in the first instance, was a capital misfortune ; for had even one of common length taken place, Lord Howe, with the British ships-of-war and all the trans- ports in the river Delaware, must inevitably have fallen ; and Sir Henry Clin- ton must have had better luck than is commonly dispensed to men of his profes- sion under such circumstances, if he and his troops had not shared at least the fate of Burgoyne. The long passage of Count d'Estaing was succeeded by an un- favorable discovery at the Hook, which hurt us in two respects, — first, in a de- feat of the enterprise upon New York and the shipping and troops at that place, and next in the delay occasioned in ascertaining the depth of water over the bar, which was essential to their entrance into the harbor of New York. And, more- over, after the enterprise upon Rhode Island had been planned and was in the moment of execution, that Lord Howe with the British ships should interpose merely to create a diversion and draw the French fleet from the island was again nnlucky, as the Count had not returned on the 17th to the island, though drawn off from it on the 10th; by which means the land operations were retarded, and the whole subjected to a miscarriage in case of the arrival of Byron's squadron." — Washington's Letter, Aug. 20, 1778. 366 'J'liE ENGLISH SEIZE SANTA LUCIA. the transports were being warped inside the ships-of-war, and the latter anchored across the entrance to the bay, espe- cial care being taken to strengthen the two extremities of the line, and to prevent the enemy from passing inside the weather end, as the English ships in after years did at the battle of the Nile. The French was much more than double the Englisli fleet ; and if the latter were destroyed, the transports and troops would be trapped. D'Estaing stood down along the English order twice from north to south, cannonading at long range, but did not anchor. Abandoning then his intentions against the fleet, he moved to another bay, landed some French soldiers, and assaulted the position of the English troops. Failing here also, ho retired to Martinique ; and the French garrison, which had been driven into the interior of the island, surrendered. It seems scarcely necessary to point out the admirable dili- gence of Admiral Barrington, to which and to the skill of his dispositions he owed this valuable strategic success ; for such it was. Sta. Lucia was the island next south of Martinique, and the harbor of Gros Hot at its northern end was especially adapted to the work of watching the French depot at Fort Royal, their principal station in the West Indies. Thence Rodney pursued them before his great action in 1782. The absence of precise information causes hesitation in con- demning D'Estaing for this mortifying failure. His respon- sibility depends upon the wind, which may have been light under the land, and upon his power to anchor. The fact, however, remains that he passed twice along the enemy's line within cannon-shot, yet did not force a decisive action. His course was unfavorably criticised by the great SufTren, then one of his captains.^ The English had thus retrieved the capture of Dominica, which had been taken on the 8th of September by the French governor of the West India Islands. There being no English squadron there, no difficulty had been met. The value of Dominica to the French has been pointed out; and it is ^ See page 42G. D'ESTAING AT GRENADA. 367 necessary here to use the example of both Dominica and Sta. Lucia to enforce what has before been said, that the posses- sion of these smaller islands depended solely upon the naval preponderance. Upon the grasp of this principle held by any one will depend his criticism upon the next action of D'Estaing, to be immediately related. Six months of almost entire quiet followed the affair of Sta. Lucia. The English were reinforced by the fleet of Byron, who took chief command ; but the French, being joined by ten more ships-of-the-line, remained superior in numbers. About the middle of June, Byron sailed with his fleet to protect a large convoy of merchant-ships, bound for England, till they were clear of the islands. D'Estaing then sent a very small expe- dition which seized St. Vincent, June 16, 1779, without diffi- culty ; and on the 30th of June he sailed with his whole fleet to attack Grenada. Anchoring off Georgetown on the 2d of July, he landed his soldiers, and on the 4th the garrison of seven hundred men surrendered the island. Meanwhile Byron, hearing of the loss of St. Vincent and probable attack on Grenada, sailed with a large convoy of vessels carrying troops, and with twenty-one ships-of-the-line, to regain the one and relieve the other. Receiving on the way definite in- formation that the French were before Grenada, he kept on for it, rounding the northwest point of the island at day- break of July 6. His approach had been reported the day before to D'Estaing, who remained at anchor,^ fearing lest with the currents and light winds he might drop too far to leeward if he let go the bottom. When the English came in sight, the French got under way ; but the confused mass- ing of their ships prevented Byron from recognizing at once the disparity of numbers, they having twenty-five ships-of- the-line. He made signal for a general chase, and as the disorder of the French fleet forced it to form on the lee- wardmost ships, the English easily retained the advantage of the wind with which they approached. As the action began, therefore, the French were to the westward with a partly formed line, on the starboard tack, heading north, the rear in 1 D'Estaing's position at anchor is marked by the anchor iu Plate X. 368 NAVAL BATTLE OFF GRENADA. disorder, and to windward of the van and centre (Plate X., A), The English stood down with a fair wind, steering south by west on the port tack (A), between the island and the enemy, their leading ships approaching at a slight angle, but heading more directly for his yet unformed rear ; while the English convoy was between its own fleet and the island, under special charge of three ships (A, a), which were now called in. As the signal so far commanded a general chase, the three fastest of the English, among which was the flag of the second in command. Admiral Barrington, came under fire of the French centre and rear, apparently unsupported (b), and suffered much from the consequent concentration of fire upon them. When they reached the sternmost ships they wore upon the same tack with them and stood north, after and to windward of them ; and at about the same time Byron, who had not be- fore known of the surrender, saw the French flag flying over the forts. Signals followed to wear in succession, and for the advanced ships to form line for mutual support, ceasing the general chase under which the engagement had hitherto been fought. While the main body was still standing south on the port tack, three ships, — " Cornwall," " Grafton," and " Lion " (c), — obeying literally the signal for close action, had passed much to leeward of the others, drawing upon themselves most of the fire of the enemy's line. They thus suffered very severely in men and spars ; and though finally relieved by the advanced ships, as these approached from the southward on the opposite tack, they were unable, after wearing (B, c', c'^), to keep up with the fleet, and so dropped astern and toward the French. The bulk of the injury sustained by the English fell upon these three, upon the three advanced ships under Bar- rington, and upon two others in the rear (A, a), which, seeing the van so heavily engaged, did not follow the successive movement, but bore down straight out of the order, and took their places at the head of the column (B, a, a'), — an act strongly resembling that which won Nelson such high renown at Cape St. Vincent, but involving les,5 responsibility .^ 1 Of one of these, the " Monmouth," sixty-four (a'), it is said that the officers of the French flag-ship drank to the health of the captain of the " little hlack ef o 1 <» *■ c» ^^ V 0 o at s<!/ ^._'^ "'^''^^^ ^ 0 * ^ ^ ^ "HnO^ J ^ ^ ^ \ \ \ , ^ ""*'*'' ^ \/ •■ «» ^'^^ VI z < ^^ o •• >- CT, £: , UJ J"" ^ < o<^ CD r-^ ' S ^ [^ « - ui% i J--2\ \ ^>J'% \ Z => X ^ ^ ^- >'^ ;STA FREN ENGLI .,--■' CO r^ LU CQ ^^ ■ c? ^■•^.-•• \ \ Q . .. ■■...^ 1 ■■■■ -..-c^ •• ■■■■o _.^— • ;.^. ^ \ ....^ / ;• -. ^^ / ••. -s? ■ _ •. ^D / \ / \ / \ ■/o 0^ D'ESTAING'S FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY. 369 So far Bjron had conducted his attack, using the initiative permitted him by tlie advantage of the wind and the disorder of the French rear. It will be observed that, though it was desirable to lose no time in assailing the latter while in con- fusion, it is questionable whether Barrington's three ships should have been allowed to separate as far as they seem to have done from the rest of the fleet. A general chase is per- missible and proper when, from superiority of numbers, origi- nal or acquired, or from the general situation, the ships first in action will not be greatly outnumbered, or subjected to overpowering concentration before support comes up, or when there is probability that the enemy may escape unless promptly struck. This was not so here. Nor should the " Cornwall," " Grafton," and " Lion " have been permitted to take a course which allowed, almost compelled, the enemy to concentrate rather than diffuse his fire. The details of the affair are not precise enough to warrant more comment than naming these mistakes, without necessarily attributing them to fault on the part of the admiral. The French had up to this time remained strictly on the defensive, in accordance with their usual policy. There was now offered an opportunity for offensive action which tested D'Estaing's professional qualities, and to appreciate which the situation at the moment must be understood. Both fleets were by this on the starboard tack, heading north (B, B, B), the French to leeward. The latter had received little injury in their motive power, though their line was not in perfect order; but the English, owing to the faulty attack, had seven ships seriously crippled, four of which — the " Monmouth " (a') "Grafton," "Cornwall" (c'), and "Lion" (c") — were dis- abled. The last three, by three P. M., were a league astern and ship." Ships' names, like those of families, often have a marked career. A for- mer " Monmouth," twenty years before, had attacked and taken, practically sin- gle-handed, the " Foudroyant," eighty-four, one of the finest ships in the French navy. She was then commanded by a Captain Gardiner, who, having com- manded Byng's ship in the battle which led to his execution, was moved by his mortification at the result of that affair to dare such desperate odds, and thereby lost his life. The same ship, here punished so severely off Grenada, will be found in like sturdy fight, under another captain, three year^ later in India. 24 370 INDECISIVE ACTION OF D'ESTAING. much to leeward of their line, being in fact nearer the French than the English ; while the speed of the English fleet was necessarily reduced to that of the crippled ships remaining in line. These conditions bring out strongly the embarrassments of a fleet whose injuries are concentrated upon a few ships, instead of being distributed among all ; the ten or twelve which were practically untouched had to conform to the capabilities of the others. D'Estaing, with twenty-five ships, now had Byron to windward of him with seventeen or eighteen capable of holding together, but slower and less handy than their enemies, and saw him tactically embarrassed by the care of a convoy to windward and three disabled ships to leeward. Under these circumstances three courses were open to the French admiral : (1) He might stretch ahead, and, tacking in succession, place himself between Byron and the convoy, throwing his frigates among the latter ; (2) He might tack his fleet together and stand up to the English line to bring on a general action ; or (3) he could, after going about, cut off the three disabled ships, which might bring on a general action with less exposure. None of these did he do. As regards the first, he, knowing the criticisms of the fleet, wrote home that his line was too much disordered to allow it. Whatever the technical irregu- larity, it is difficult to believe that, with the relative power of motion in the two fleets, the attempt was hopeless. The third alternative probably presented the greatest advantage, for it insured the separation between the enemy's main body and the crippled ships, and might very probably exasperate the British admiral into an attack under most hazardous condi- tions. It is stated by English authorities that Byron said he would have borne down again, had any attack been made on them. At three p. m. D'Estaing tacked all together, form- ing line on the lee sliip,i and stood to the southward again. 1 The line BC shows the final direction of the French 11 ne-of -battle ; the lee ship (o) having tacked and standing to o', while the other ships took position in her wake. Though not expressly stated, Byron donhtlcss formed in the same way on a parallel line. Into this new line the disabled sliips (c'), which could scarcely have made good the course they were heading, would be easily received. D'ESTAING'S PROFESSIONAL REPUTATION. 371 The English imitated this movement, except the van ship "Monmouth" (a'), which being too badly hurt to mana3uvre kept on to the northward, and the three separated ships. Two of these (c') kej)t on north and passed once more under the French broadsides ; but the '• Lion " (c"), unable to keep to the wind, kept broad off before it across the bows of the enemy, for Jamaica, a thousand miles away. She was not pursued ; a single transport was the sole maritime trophy of the French. " Had the admiral's seamanship equalled his courage," wrote the celebrated Suffren, who commanded the French van ship, " we would not have suffered four dismasted vessels to escape." " D'Estaing, at the age of thirty, had been transferred from the army to the navy with the premature rank of rear-admiral. The navy did not credit him with nautical ability when the war broke out, and it is safe to say that its opinion was jus- tified by his conduct during it." ^ " Brave as his sword, D'Estaing was always the idol of the soldier, the idol of the seaman ; but moral authority over his officers failed him on several occasions, notwithstanding the marked protection extended to him by the king." ^ Another cause than incapacity as a seaman has usually been assigned by French historians for the impotent action of D'Estaing on this occasion. He looked upon Grenada, they say, as the real objective of his efforts, and considered the English fleet a very secondary concern. Ramatuelle, a naval tactician who served actively in this war and wrote under the Empire, cites this case, which he couples with that of Yorktovvn and others, as exemplifying the true policy of naval war. His words, which probably reflect the current opinion of his service in that day, as they certainly do the policy of French governments, call for more than passing mention, as they involve principles worthy of most serious discussion : — " The French navy has always preferred the glory of assuring or preserving a conquest to that, more brilliant perhaps, but actually 1 Chevalier : Hist, de la Marine Fran9aise. 2 Que'rin : Hist. Maritime. 372 FRENCH NAVAL POLICY. less real, of taking a few ships ; and in that it has approached more nearly the true end to be proposed in war. What in fact would the loss of a few ships matter to the English ? The essential point is to attack them iu their possessions, the immediate source of their com- mercial wealth and of their maritime power. The war of 1778 fur- nishes examples which prove the devotion of the French admirals to the true interests of the country. The preservation of the island of Grenada, the reduction of Yorktown where the English army surren- dered, the conquest of the island of St. Christopher, were the re- sult of great battles in which the enemy was allowed to retreat un- disturbed, rather than risk giving him a chance to succor the points attacked." The issue could not be more squarely raised than in the case of Grenada. No one will deny that there are moments when a probable military success is to be foregone, or post- poned, in favor of one greater or more decisive. The posi- tion of De Grasse at the Chesapeake, in 1781, with the fate of Yorktown hanging in the balance, is in point ; and it is liere coupled with that of D'Estaing at Grenada, as though both stood on the same grounds. Both are justified alike ; not on their respective merits as fitting the particular cases, but upon a general principle. Is that principle sound ? The bias of the writer quoted betrays itself unconsciously, in saying " a few ships." A whole navy is not usually to be crushed at a blow ; a few ships mean an ordinary naval victory. In Rodney's famous battle only five ships were taken, though Jamaica was saved thereby. In order to determine the soundness of tlie principle, which is claimed as being illustrated by these two cases (St. Chris- topher will be discussed later on), it is necessary to examine what was the advantage sought, and what the determining factor of success in either case. At Yorktown the advantage sought was the capture of Cornwallis's army ; the objective was the destruction of the enemy's organized military force on shore. At Grenada the chosen objective was the posses- sion of a piece of territory of no great military value ; for it must be remarked that all these smaller Antilles, if held in FRENCH NAVAL POLICY. 373 force at all, multiplied large detachments, whose mutual sup port depended wholly upon the navy. These large detach- ments were liable to be crushed separately, if not supported by the navy ; and if naval superiority is to be maintained, the enemy's navy must be crushed. Grenada, near and to lee- ward of Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia, both held strongly by the English, was peculiarly weak to the French ; but sound mili- tary policy for all these islands demanded one or two strongly fortified and garrisoned naval bases, and dependence for the rest upon the fleet. Beyond this, security against attacks by single cruisers and privateers alone was needed. Such were the objectives in dispute. What was the deter- mining factor in this strife ? Surely the navy, the organized military force afloat. Cornwallis's fate depended absolutely upon the sea. It is useless to speculate upon the result, had the odds on the 5th of September, 1781, in favor of De Grasse, been reversed ; if the French, instead of five ships more, had had five ships less than the English. As it was, De Grasse, when that fight began, had a superiority over the English equal to the result of a hard-won fight. The question then was, should he risk the almost certain decisive victory over the organized enemy's force ashore, for the sake of a much more doubtful advantage over the organized force afloat ? This was not a question of Yorktown, but of Cornwallis and his army ; there is a great deal in the way things are put. So stated, — and the statement needs no modifications, — there can be but one answer. Let it be remarked clearly, however, that both De Grasse's alternatives brought before him the organized forces as the objective. Not so with D'Estaing at Grenada. His superiority in numbers over the English was nearly as great as that of De Grasse ; his alternative objectives were the organized force afloat and a small island, fertile, but militarily unimportant. Grenada is said to have been a strong position for defence ; but intrinsic strength does not give importance, if the position has not strategic value. To save the island, he refused to use an enormous advantage fortune had given him over the 374 FRENCH NAVAL POLICY. fleet. Yet upon the strife between the two navies depended the tenure of the islands. Seriously to hold the West India Islands required, first, a powerful seaport, which the French had ; second, the control of the sea. For the latter it was necessary, not to multiply detachments in the islands, but to destroy the enemy's navy, which may be accurately called the army in the field. The islands were but rich towns ; and not more than one or two fortified towns, or posts, were needed. It may safely be said that the principle which led to D'Es- taing's action was not, to say the least, uncjualifiedly correct; for it led him wrong. In the case of Yorktown, the principle as stated by Ramatuelle is not the justifying reason of De Grasse's conduct, though it likely enough was the real rea- son. What justified De Grasse was that, the event depending upon the unshaken control of the sea, for a short time only, he already had it by his greater numbers. Had the numbers been equal, loyalty to the military duty of the hour must have forced him to fight, to stop the attempt which the Eng- lish admiral would certainly have made. The destruction of a few ships, as Ramatuelle slightingly puts it, gives just that superiority to which the happy result at Yorktown was due. As a general principle, this is undoubtedly a better objective than that pursued by the French. Of course, exceptions will be found ; but those exceptions will probably be where, as at Yorktown, the military force is struck at directly elsewiiere, or, as at Port Mahon, a desirable and powerful base of that force is at stake ; though even at Mahon it is doubtful whether the prudence was not misplaced. Had Hawke or Boscawen met with Byng's disaster, they would not have gone to Gibraltar to repair it, unless the French admiral had followed up his first blow with others, increasing their disability. Grenada was no doubt very dear in the eyes of D'Estaing, because it was his only success. After making the failures at the Delaware, at New York, and at Rhode Island, with the mortifying affair at Sta. Lucia, it is difficult to understand D'ESTAING AT SAVANNAH. 375 the confidence in him expressed by some French writers. Gifted with a brilliant and contagious personal daring, he distinguished himself most highly, when an admiral, by lead- ing in person assaults upon intrenchments at Sta. Lucia and Grenada, and a few months later in the unsuccessful attack upon Savannah. During the absence of the French navy in the winter of 1778-79, the English, controlling now the sea with a few of their ships that had not gone to the West Indies, deter- mined to shift the scene of the continental war to the South- ern States, where there was believed to be a .large number of loyalists. The expedition was directed upon Georgia, and was so far successful that Savannah fell into their hands in the last days of 1778. The whole State speedily submitted. Operations were thence extended into South Carolina, but failed to bring about the capture of Charleston. Word of these events was sent to D'Estaing in the West Indies, accompanied by urgent representations of the danger to the Carolinas, and the murmurings of the people against the French, who were accused of forsaking their allies, hav- ing rendered them no service, but on the contrary having profited by the cordial help of the Bostonians to refit their crippled fleet. There was a sting of truth in the alleged failure to help, which impelled D'Estaing to disregard the orders actually in his hands to return at once to Europe with certain ships. Instead of obeying them he sailed for the American coast with twenty-two ships-of-the-line, having in view two objects, — the relief of the Southern States and an attack upon New York in conjunction with Washington's army. Arriving off the coast of Georgia on the 1st of September, D'Estaing took the English wholly at unawares ; but the fatal lack of promptness, which had previously marked the com- mand of this very daring man, again betrayed his good fortune. Dallying at first before Savannah, the fleeting of precious days again brought on a change of conditions, and the approach of the bad-weather season impelled him, too 376 DE GUICHEN SUCCEEDS UESTAING. slow at first, into a premature assault. In it he displayed his accustomed gallantry, fighting at the head of his column, as did the American general ; but the result was a bloody repulse. The siege was raised, and D'Estaing sailed at once for France, not only giving up his project upon New York, but abandonmg the Southern States to the enemy. The value of this help from the great sea power of France, thus cruelly dangled before the eyes of the Americans only to be withdrawn, was shown by the action of the English, who abandoned Newport in the utmost haste when they learned the presence of the French fleet. Withdrawal had been before decided upon, but D'Estaing's coming converted it into flight. After the departure of D'Estaing, which involved that of the whole French fleet, — for the ships which did not go back to France returned to the West Indies, — the Eng- lish resumed the attack upon the Southern States, which had for a moment been suspended. The fleet and army left New York for Georgia in the last weeks of 1779, and after assembling at Tybee, moved upon Charleston by way of Edisto. The powerlessness of the Americans upon the sea left this movement unembarrassed save by single cruis- ers, which picked up some stragglers, — affording another lesson of the petty results of a merely cruising warfare. The siege of Charleston began at the end of March, — the English ships soon after passing the bar and Fort Moul- trie without serious damage, and anchoring within gunshot of the place. Fort Moultrie was soon and easily reduced by land approaches, and the city itself was surrendered on the 12th of May, after a siege of forty days. The whole State was then quickly overrun and brought into military subjection. The fragments of D'Estaing's late fleet were joined by a reinforcement from France under the Comte de Guichen, who assumed chief command in tlie West Indian seas March 22, 1780. The next day he sailed for Sta. Lucia, which he hoped to find unprepared ; but a crusty, hard-fighting old RODNEY'S ARRIVAL IX WEST IXDIES. 377 admiral of the traditional English type, Sir Hyde Parker, had so settled himself at the anchorage, with sixteen ships, that Guichen with his twenty-two would not attack. The opportunity, if it were one, did not recur, De Guichen, re- turning to Martinique, anchored there on the 27tli ; and the same day Parker at Sta. Lucia was joined by the new Eng- lish commander-in-chief, Rodney. This since celebrated, but then only distinguished, admiral was sixty-two years old at the time of assuming a command where he was to win an undying fame. Of distinguished courage and professional skill, but with extravagant if not irregular habits, money embarrassments had detained him in exile in France at the time the war began. A boast of his ability to deal with the French fleet, if circumstances enabled him to go back to England, led a French nobleman who heard it to assume his debts, moved by feelings in which chivalry and national pique probably bore equal shares. Upon his return he was given a command, and sailed, in Janu- ary, 1780, with a fleet of twenty ships-of-the-line, to relieve Gibraltar, then closely invested. Off Cadiz, with a good luck for which he was proverbial, he fell in with a Spanish fleet of eleven ships-of-the-line, which awkwardly held their ground until too late to fly.^ Throwing out the signal for a general chase, and cutting in to leeward of the enemy, between them and their port, Rodney, despite a dark and stormy night, succeeded in blowing up one ship and taking six. Hasten- ing on, he relieved Gibraltar, placing it out of all danger from want ; and then, leaving the prizes and the bulk of his fleet, sailed witli the rest for his station. Despite his brilliant personal courage and professional skill, which in the matter of tactics was far in advance of his contemporaries in England, Rodney, as a commander-in- chief, belongs rather to the wary, cautious school of the French tacticians than to the impetuous, unbounded eager- 1 Drinkwater, in his history of the siege of Gibraltar, explains that the Span- ish admiral believed that Rodney would not accompany the convoy to the Straits, but had separated from it.

As in Tourville we have seen the desperate fighting of the seventeenth century, unwilling to leave its enemy, merging into the formal, artificial — we may almost say trifling — parade tactics of the eighteenth, so in Rodney we shall see the transition from those ceremonious duels to an action which, while skilful in conception, aimed at serious results. For it would be unjust to Rodney to press the com- parison to the French admirals of his day. With a skill that De Guichen recognized as soon as they crossed swords, Rodney meant mischief, not idle flourishes. Whatever inci- dental favors fortune might bestow by the way, the objective from which his eye never wandered was the French fleet, — the organized military force of the enemy on the sea. And on the day when Fortune forsook the opponent who had neg- lected her offers, when the conqueror of Corn wallis failed to strike while he had Rodney at a disadvantage, the latter won a victory which redeemed England from the depths of anxiety, and restored to her by one blow all those islands which the cautious tactics of the allies had for a moment gained, save only Tobago. De Guichen and Rodney met for the first time on the 17th of April, 1780, three weeks after the arrival of the latter. The French fleet was beating to windward in the Channel between Martinique and Dominica, when the enemy was made in the southeast. A day was spent in manoeuvring for the weather-gage, which Rodney got. The two fleets being now well to leeward of the islands ^ (Plate XL), both on the starboard tack heading to the northward and the French on the lee bow of the English, Rodney, who was carry- ing a press of sail, signalled to his fleet that he meant to attack the enemy's rear and centre with his whole force ; and when he had reached the position he thought suitable, ordered them to keep away eight points (90°) together (A, A, A). De Guichen, seeing the danger of the rear, wore his fleet all together and stood down to succor it. Rodney, finding him- self foiled, hauled up again on the same tack as the enemy, 1 The place where the battle was fought is shown by the crossed flags. ^ * O " t \ LJ 10 X 0. o o I — 00 I/) GU 17.17 1 f^ o8 _, l£l > °^ u.' o_ ^ 5 Z < Z -1 O IT Z o U. lij q: RODNEY AND DE GUICHEN. 379 both fleets now licadiiig to the southward and eastward. ^ Later, he again made signal for battle, fullowed an hour after, just at noon, by the order (quoting his own despatch), " for ever}^ ship to bear down and steer for her opposite in the enemy's line." This, which sounds lilve the old story of ship to ship, Rodney explains to have meant her opposite at the moment, not her opposite in numerical order. His own words are : " In a slanting position, that my leading ships might attack the van ships of the enemy's centre division, and the whole British fleet be opposed to only two thirds of the enemy " (B, B). The difficulty and misunderstand- ing wliich followed seem to have sprung mainly from the defective character of the signal book. Instead of doing as the admiral wished, the leading ships (a) carried sail so as to reach their supposed station abreast their numerical oppo- site in the order. Rodney stated afterward that when he bore down the second time, the French fleet was in a very extended line of battle ; and that, had his orders been obeyed, the centre and rear must have been disabled before the van could have joined. There seems every reason to believe that Rodney's inten- tions throughout were to double on the French, as asserted. The failure sprang from the signal-book and tactical ineffi- ciency of the fleet ; for which he, having lately joined, was not answerable. But the ugliness of his fence was so apparent to De Guichen, that he exclaimed, when the English fleet kept away the first time, that six or seven of his ships were gone ; and sent word to Rodney that if his signals had been obeyed he would have had him for his prisoner.^ A more 1 The black ships, iu position A, represent the English ships bearing down upon the French centre and rear.

The positions v', r', are those of the van and rear ships after hauling up on the port tack, when the French wore. 2 In a severe reprimand addressed to Captain Carkett, commanding the lead- ing ship of the English line, by Rodney, he says : " Your leading in the manner you did, induced others to follow so bad an example ; and thereby, forgetting that the signal for the line was at only two cables' length distance from each other, the van division was led by you to more than tu-o /e<i(jnes distance from the centre division, which was thereby exposed to the greatest ;itrength of the enemy, 380 BREAKING THE LINE. convincing proof that he recognized the dangerousness of his enemy is to be found in the fact that he took care not to have the lee-gage in their subsequent encounters. Rodney's care- ful plans being upset, he showed that with them he carried all the stubborn courage of the most downright fighter ; taking his own ship close to the enemy and ceasing only when the latter hauled off, her foremast and mainyard gone, and her hull so damaged that she could hardly be kept afloat. An incident of this battle mentioned by French writers and by Botta,^ who probably drew upon French authorities, but not found in the English accounts, shows the critical nature of the attack in the apprehension of the French. According to them, Rodney, marking a gap in their order due to a ship in rear of the French admiral being out of station, tried to break through (b) ; but the captain of the " Destin," seventy-four, pressed up under more sail and threw himself across the path of the English ninety-gun ship. " The action of the ' Destin ' was justly praised," says Lapeyrouse- Bonfils. " The fleet ran the danger of almost certain defeat, but for the bravery of M. de Goimpy. Such, after the affair, was the opinion of the whole French squadron. Yet, admitting that our line was broken, what disasters then would necessarily threaten the fleet? Would it not always have been easy for our rear to remedy the accident by promptly standing on to fill the place of the vessels cut off? That movement would necessarily have brought about a melee, which would have turned to the advantage of the fleet having the bravest and most devoted captains. But then, as under the empire, it was an acknowl- edged principle that ships cut off were ships taken, and the belief wrought its own fulfilment." The effect of breaking an enemy's line, or order-of-bnttle, depends upon several conditions. The essential idea is to and not properly supported" (Life, vol. i. p. 351). By all rules of tactical common-sense it would seem that the other ships should have taken their distance from their next asteru, that is, should have closed toward the centre. In conver- sation with Sir Gilbert Blane, who was not in this action, Rodney stated that the French line extended four leagues in length, "as if Pe Guiclieu tliought we meant to run away from him " (Naval Chronicle, vol. xxv. p. 402). ^ History of the American Revolution. RODNEY IN NEW YORK. 381 divide the opposing force by penetrating through an interval found, or made, in it, and then to concentrate upon that one of the fractions Avhich can be least easily helped by the other. In a column of ships this will usually be the rear. The compactness of the order attacked, the number of the ships cut off, the length of time during which they can be isolated and outnumbered, will all affect the results. A very great factor in the issue will be the moral effect, the confusion introduced into a line thus broken. Ships coming up toward the break are stopped, the rear doubles up, while the ships ahead continue their course. Such a moment is critical, and calls for instant action ; but the men are rare who in an unforeseen emergency can see, and at once take the ]-ight course, especially if, being subordinates, they incur responsibility. In such a scene of confusion the English, Avithout presumption, hoped to profit by their bet- ter seamanship ; for it is not only " courage and devotion," but skill, which then tells. All these effects of " break- ing the line " received illustration in Rodney's great battle in^l782. De Guichen and Rodney met twice again in the following month, but on neither occasion did the French admiral take the favorite lee-gage of his nation. Meanwhile a Spanish fleet of twelve ships-of-the-line was on its way to join tlie French. Rodney cruised to windward of Martinique to inter- cept them ; but the Spanish admiral kept a northerly course, siglited Guadeloupe, and thence sent a despatch to De Guichen, who joined his allies and escorted them into port. The great preponderance of the coalition, in numbers, raised the fears of the English islands ; but lack of harmony led to delays and hesitations, a terrible epidemic raged in the Spanish squad- ron, and the intended operations came to nothing. In August De Guichen sailed for France with fifteen ships. Rodney, ignorant of his destination, and anxious about both North America and Jamaica, divided his fleet, leaving one half in the islands, and with the remainder sailing for New York, where he arrived on the 12th of September. The risk thus 382 RODNEY RETURNS TO THE WEST INDIES. run was very great, and scarcely justifiable ; but no ill effect followed the dispersal of forces.^ Had De Guichen intended to tui'n upon Jamaica, or, as was expected by Washington, upon New York, neither part of Rodney's fleet could well have withstood him. Two chances of disaster, instead of one, were run, by being in small force on two fields instead of in full force on one. Rodney's anxiety about North America was well grounded. On the 12th of July of this year the long expected French succor arrived, — five thousand French troops under Rocham- beau and seven ships-of-the-line under De Ternay. Hence the English, though still superior at sea, felt forced to con- centrate at New York, and were unable to strengthen their operations in Carolina. The difficulty and distance of move- ments by land gave such an advantage to sea power tliat Lafayette urged the French government further to increase the fleet ; but it was still naturally and properly attentive to its own immediate interests in the Antilles. It was not yet time to deliver America. Rodney, having escaped the great hurricane of October, 1780, by his absence, returned to the West Indies later in the year, and soon after heard of the war between England and Holland ; which, proceeding from causes which will be mentioned later, was declared December 20, 1780. The ad- miral at once seized the Dutch islands of St. Eustatius and St. Martin, besides numerous merchant-ships, with property amounting in all to fifteen million dollars. These islands, Avhile still neutral, had played a role similar to that of Nas- sau during the American Civil War, and had become a great depot of contraband goods, immense quantities of which now fell into the English hands. The year 1780 had been gloomy for the cause of the United States, The l)attle of Camden had seemed to settle the Eng- lish yoke on South Carolina, and the enemy formed high hopes of controlling both North Carolina and Virginia. The treason of Arnold following had increased the depression, which was 1 For Rodney'8 reasons, see his Life, vol. i. pp. 365, 376. DE GRASSE SAILS FROM BREST. 383 but partially relieved by the victory at King's Mountain. The substantial aid of French troops was the most cheerful spot in the situation. Yet even that had a checkered light, the second division of the intended help being- blocked in Brest by the English fleet ; while the final failure of De Guichen to appear, and Rodney coming in his stead, made the hopes of the campaign fruitless. A period of vehement and decisive action was, however, at hand. At the end of March, 1781, the Comte de Grasse sailed from Brest with twenty-six ships-of-the-line and a large con- voy. When off the Azores, five ships parted company for the East Indies, under Suffren, of whom more will be heard later on. De Grasse came in sight of Martinique on the 28th of April. Admiral Hood (Rodney having remained behind at St. Eustatius) was blockading before Fort Royal, the French port and arsenal on the lee side of the island, in which were four ships-of-the-line, when his lookouts reported the enemy's fleet. Hood had two objects before him, — one to prevent the junction of the four blockaded ships with the approaching fleet, the other to keep the latter from getting between him and Gros Hot Bay in Sta. Lucia. Instead of effecting this in the next twenty-four hours, by beating to windward of the Diamond Rock, his fleet got so far to leeward that De Grasse, passing through the channel on the 29th, headed up for Fort Royal, keeping his convoy between the fleet and the island. For this false position Hood was severely blamed by Rodney, but it may have been due to light winds and the lee current. However that be, the four ships in Fort Royal got under way and joined the main body. The English had now only eighteen ships to the French twenty-four, and the latter were to windwai'd ; but though thus in the proportion of four to three, and having the power to attack, De Grasse would not do it. Tlie fear of exposing his convoy prevented him from running the chance of a serious engagement. Great must have been his distrust of his forces, one would say. When is a navy to fight, if this was not a time ? He carried on a distant cannonade, with results so far against the English 384 conxwALLis in the southern states. as to make his backwardness yet more extraordinary. Can a policy or a tradition which justifies such a line of conduct be good ? The following day, April 30, De Grasse, having thrown away his chance, attempted to follow Hood ; but the latter had no longer any reason for fighting, and his original inferiority was increased by the severe injuries of some ships on the 29th. De Grasse could not overtake him, owing to the inferior speed of his fleet, many of the ships not being coppered, — a fact worthy of note, as French vessels by model and size were gen- erally faster than English ; but this superiority was sacrificed through the delay of the government in adopting the new improvement. Hood rejoined Rodney at Antigua , and De Grasse, after re- maining a short time at Fort Royal, made an attempt upon Gros Hot Bay, the possession of which by the English kept all the movements of his fleet under surveillance. Foiled here, he moved against Tobago, which surrendered June 2, 1781. Sailing thence, after some minor operations, he an- chored on the 26th of July at Cap FrauQais (now Cape Hay- tien), in the island of Hayti. Here he found awaiting him a French frigate from the United States, bearing despatches from Washington and Rochambeau, upon which he was to take the most momentous action that fell to any French admiral during the war. The invasion of the Southern States by the English, be- ginning in Georgia and followed by the taking of Charles- ton and the military control of the two extreme States, had been pressed on to the northward by way of Camden into North Carolina. On the 16th of August, 1780, General Gates was totally defeated at Camden ; and during the following nine months the English under Cornwallis persisted in their attempts to overrun North Carolina. These operations, the narration of which is foreign to our immediate subject, had ended by forcing Cornwallis, despite many successes in actual encounter, to fall back exhausted toward the seaboard, and finally upon Wilmington, in which place depots for such a ARNOLD ON THE JAMES RIVER. 385 contingency had been established. His opponent, General Greene, then turned the American troops toward South Caro- lina. Cornvvallis, too weak to dream of controlling, or even penetrating, into the interior of an unfriendly country, had now to choose between returning to Charleston, to assure there and in South Carolina the shaken British power, and moving northward again into Virginia, there to join hands with a small expeditionary force operating on the James River under Generals Phillips and Arnold. To fall back would be a con- fession that the weary marching and fighting of months past had been W'ithout results, and the general readily convinced himself that the Chesapeake was the proper seat of war, even if New York itself had to be abandoned. The commander-in- chief. Sir Henry Clinton, by no means shared this opinion, upon which was justified a step taken without asking him. " Operations in the Chesapeake," he wrote, " are attended with great risk unless we are sure of a permanent superiority at sea. I tremble for the fatal consequences that may ensue." For Cornwallis, taking the matter into his own hands, had marched from Wilmington on the 25th of April, 1781, joining the British already at Petersburg on the 20th of May. The forces thus united numbered seven thousand men. Driven back from the open country of South Carolina into Charles- ton, there now remained two centres of British power, — at New York and in the Chesapeake. With New Jersey and Pennsylvania in the hands of the Americans, communication between the two depended wholly upon the sea. Despite his unfavorable criticism of Cornwallis's action, Clinton had himself already risked a large detachment in the Chesapeake. A body of sixteen hundred men under Bene- dict Arnold had ravaged the country of the James and burned Richmond in January of this same year. In the hopes of capturing Arnold, Lafayette had been sent to Vir- ginia with a nucleus of twelve hundred troops, and on the evening of the 8th of March the French squadron at Newport sailed, in concerted movement, to control the waters of the bay. Admiral Arbuthnot, commanding the English fleet lying 26 38G NAVAL BATTLE OFF THE CHESAPEAKE. in Gardiner's Bay,^ learned the departure by his lookouts, and started in pursuit on the morning of the 10th, thirty-six hours later. Favored either by diligence or luck, he made such good time that when the two fleets came in sight of each other, a little outside of the capes of the Chesapeake, the English were leading ^ (Plate XII., A, A). They at once went about to meet their enemy, who, on his part, formed a line-of-battle. The wind at this time was west, so that neither could head directly into the bay. The two fleets were nearly equal in strength, there being eight ships on each side ; but the English had one ninety- gun ship, while of the French one was only a heavy frigate, which was put into the line. Nevertheless, the case was emi- nently one for the general French policy to have determined the action of a vigorous chief, and the failure to see the mat- ter through must fall upon the good-will of Commodore Des- touches, or upon some other cause than that preference for the ulterior objects of the operations, of which the reader of French naval history hears so much. The weather was bois- terous and threatening, and the wind, after hauling once or twice, settled down to northeast, with a big sea, but was then fair for entering the bay. The two fleets were by this time both on the port tack standing out to sea, the French leading, and about a point on the weather bow of the English (B, B). From this position they wore in succession (c) ahead of the latter, taking the lee-gage, and thus gaining the use of their lower batteries, which the heavy sea forbade to the weather- gage. The English stood on till abreast the enemy's line (a, b), when they wore together, and soon after attacked in the usual manner, and with the usual results (C). The three van ships were very badly injured aloft, but in their turn, throwing their force mainly on the two leaders of the enemy, crippled them seriously in hulls and rigging. The French van then kept away, and Arbuthnot, in perplexity, ordered his 1 At the eastern end of Long Island. 2 The French ascribe this disadvantage to the fact that some of their ships were not coppered.

Destouches now executed a very neat movement b}' defiling. Signalling his van to haul up on the other tack (e), he led the rest of his squadron by the disabled English ships, and after giving them the suc- cessive broadsides of his comparatively fresh ships, wore (d), and out to sea (D). This was the end of the battle, in which the English certainly got the worst ; but with their usual tenacity of purpose, being unable to pursue their enemy afloat, they steered for the bay (D), made the junction with Arnold, and thus broke up the plans of the French and Americans, from which so much had been hoped by Washington. There can be no doubt, after careful reading of the accounts, that after the fighting the French were in better force than the English, and they in fact claimed the victory ; yet the ulte- rior objects of the expedition did not tempt them again to try the issue with a fleet of about their own size.^ The way of the sea being thus open and held in force, two thousand more English troops sailing from New York reached Virginia on the 26th of March, and the subsequent arrival of Cornwallis in May raised the number to seven thousand. The operations of the contending forces during the spring and summer months, in which Lafayette commanded the Ameri- cans, do not concern our subject. Early in August, Corn- wallis, acting under orders from Clinton, withdrew his troops into the peninsula between the York and James rivers, and occupied Yorktown. Washington and Rochambeau had met on the 21st of May, and decided that the situation demanded that the effort of the French West Indian fleet, when it came, should be directed against either New York or the Chesapeake. This was the tenor of the despatch found by De Grasse at Cap Fran9ais, 1 That the French government was not satisfied with M. Destouches's action can be safely inferred from its delay to reward the officers of the squadron, which called forth much feeling and very lively remonstrances. The French asserted that Arbuthnot was hooted in the streets of New York and recalled by his government. The latter is a mistake, as he went home by his own request ; but the former is likely enough. Both commanders reversed in this case the usual naval policy of their nations. 388 DE GRASS E IN THE CHESAPEAKE. and meantime the allied generals drew their troops toward New York, where they would be on hand for the furtherance of one object, and nearer the second if they had to make for it. In either case the result, in the opinion both of Washington and of the French government, depended upon superior sea power ; but Rochambeau had privately notified the admiral that his own preference was for the Chesapeake as the scene of the intended operations, and moreover the French gov- ernment had declined to furnish the means for a formal siege of New York.^ The enterprise therefore assumed the form of an extensive military combination, dependent upon ease and rapidity of movement, and upon blinding the eyes of the enemy to the real objective, — purposes to which the peculiar qualities of a navy admirably lent themselves. The shorter distance to be traversed, the greater depth of water and easier pilotage of the Chesapeake, were further reasons which would commend the scheme to the judgment of a seaman ; and De Grasse readily accepted it, without making difficulties or demanding modifications which would have involved dis- cussion and delay. Having made his decision, the French admiral acted with great good judgment, promptitude, and vigor. The same frigate that brought despatches from Washington was sent back, so that by August 15th the allied generals knew of the intended coming of the fleet. Thirty-five hundred soldiers were spared by the governor of Cap Fran^ais, upon the condition of a Spanish squadron anchoring at the place, which De Grasse procured. He also raised from the governor of Havana the money urgently needed by the Americans ; and finally, instead of weakening his force by sending convoys to France, as the court had wished, he took every available ship to the Chesapeake. To conceal his coming as long as possible, he passed through the Bahama Channel, as a less frequented route, and on the 30th of August anchored in Lynnhaven Bay, just within the capes of the Chesapeake, with twenty-eight ships-of-the-line. Three days before, August 27, ^ Bancroft : History of the United States. CORNWALLIS SHUT UP IN YORKTOWN. 389 the French squadron at Newport, eight ships-of-the-line -svitli four frigates and eighteen transports under M. de Barras, sailed for the rendezvous ; making, however, a wide circuit out to sea to avoid the English. This course was the more necessary as the French siege-artillery was with it. The troops under Washington and Rochambeau had crossed the Hudson on the 2-4tli of August, moving toward the head of Chesapeake Bay. Thus the different armed forces, both land and sea, were converging toward their objective, Cornwallis. The English were unfortunate in all directions. Rodney, learning of De Grasse's departure, sent fourteen ships-of-the- line under Admiral Hood to North America, and himself sailed for England in August, on account of ill health. Hood, going by the direct route, reached the Chesapeake three days before De Grasse, looked into the bay, and finding it empty went on to New York. There he met five ships-of-the-line under Admiral Graves, who, being senior oflficer, took com- mand of the whole force and sailed on the 31st of August for the Chesapeake, hoping to intercept De Barras before he could join De Grasse. It was not till two days later that Sir Henry Clinton was persuaded that the allied armies had gone against Cornwallis, and had too far the start to be overtaken. Admiral Graves was painfully surprised, on making the Chesapeake, to find anchored there a fleet which from its numbers could only be an enemy's. Nevertheless, he stood in to meet it, and as De Grasse got under way, allowing his ships to be counted, the sense of numerical inferiority — nineteen to twenty-four — did not deter the English admiral from attacking. The clumsiness of his method, however, betrayed his gallantry ; many of his ships were roughly handled, without any advantage being gained. De Grasse, expecting De Barras, remained outside five days, keeping the English fleet in play without coming to action ; then return- ing to port he found De Barras safely at anchor. Graves went back to New York, and with him disappeared the last hope of succor that was to gladden Cornwallis's eyes. The siege was 390 MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ENGLISH NAVY. steadily endured, but the control of the sea made only one issue possible, and the English forces were surrendered Octo- ber 19, 1781. With this disaster the hope of subduing the colonies died in England. The conflict flickered through a year longer, but no serious operations were undertaken. In the conduct of the English operations, which ended thus unfortunately, there was both bad management and ill fortune. Hood's detachment might have been strengthened by several ships from Jamaica, had Rodney's orders been carried out.^ The despatch-ship, also, sent by him to Admiral Graves commanding in New York, found that officer absent on a cruise to the eastward, with a view to intercept certain very important supplies which had been forwarded by the American agent in France. The English Court had laid great stress upon cutting off this convoy ; but, with the knowledge that he had of the force accompanying it, the admiral was probably ill-advised in leaving his headquarters himself, with all his fleet, at the time when the approach of the hurricane season in the West Indies directed the active operations of the navies toward the continent. In consequence of his absence, al- though Rodney's despatches were at once sent on by the senior officer in New York, the vessel carrying them being driven ashore by enemy's cruisers. Graves did not learn their contents until his return to port, August 16. The informa- tion sent by Hood of his coming was also intercepted. After Hood's arrival, it does not appear that there was avoidable delay in going to sea ; but there does seem to have been mis- judgment in the direction given to the fleet. It was known that De Barras had sailed from Newport with eight ships, bound probably for the Chesapeake, certainly to effect a junction with De Grasse ; anji it has been judiciously pointed out that if Graves had taken up his cruising-ground near the Capes, but out of sight of land, he could hardly have failed to fall in with him in overwhelming force. Knowing what is now known, this would undoubtedly have been the proper thing to do ; but the English admiral had imperfect informa- 1 Life of Rodney, vol. ii. p. 152 ; Clerk ■ Naval Tactics, p. 84. CONDUCT OF ADMIRAL GRAVES. 39I tion. It was nowhere expected that the French would bring nearly the foi'ce they did ; and Graves lost information, which he ought to have received, as to their numbers, by the care- lessness of his cruisers stationed off the Chesapeake. These had been ordered to keep under way, but were both at anchor under Cape Henry when De Grasse's appearance cut off their escape. One was captured, the other driven up York River. No single circumstance contributed more to the general result than the neglect of these two subordinate officers, by which Graves lost that all-important information. It can readily be conceived how his movements might have been affected, had he known two davs earlier that De Grasse had brought twenty-seven or twenty-eight sail of the line ; how natural would have been the conclusion, first, to waylay De Barras, with whom his own nineteen could more than cope. " Had Admiral Graves succeeded in capturing that squadron, it would have greatly paralyzed the besieging army [it had the siege train on board], if it would not have prevented its operations altogether ; it would have put the two fleets nearly on an equality in point of numbers, would have ar- rested the progress of the French arms for tlie ensuing year in the West Indies, and might possibly have created such a spirit of discord between the French and Ameri- cans 1 as would have sunk the latter into the lowest depths of despair, from which they were only extricated by the arrival of the forces under De Grasse." ^ These are true and sober comments upon the naval strategy. In regard to the admiral's tactics, it will be enough to say that the fleet was taken into battle nearly as Byng took his ; that very similar mishaps resulted ; and that, when attack- ing twenty-four ships with nineteen, seven, under that capable officer Hood, were not able to get into action, owing to the dispositions made. ^ De Barras had been unwilling to go to the Chesapeake, fearing to be inter- cepted by a superior force, and had only yielded to the solicitation of Washington and Rochambeau. 2 Naval Researches ; Capt. Thomas White, R. N. 392 MILITARY SITUATION OF ENGLAND On the French side De Grasse must be credited with a degree of energy, foresight, and determination surprising in view of his failures at other times. The decision to take every ship with him, which made him independent of any failure on the part of De Barras ; the passage through the Bahama Channel to conceal his movements ; the address with wliich he obtained the money and troops required, from the Spanish and the French military authorities ; the pre- vision wliich led him, as early as March 29, shortly after leaving Brest, to write to Rochambeau that American coast pilots should be sent to Cap Francais ; the coolness with which he kept Graves amused until De Barras's squadron had slipped in, are all points worthy of admiration. The French were also helped by the admiral's power to detain tlie two hundred merchaut-ships, the " West India trade," await- ing convoy at Cap Francais, where they remained from July till November, when the close of operations left him at liberty to convoy them with ships-of-war. The incident illustrates one weakness of a mercantile country with repre- sentative government, compared with a purely military nation. " If the British government," wrote an officer of that day, " had sanctioned, or a British admiral had adopted, such a measure, tbe one would have been turned out and the other hanged." ^ Rodney at the same time had felt it necessary to detach five ships-of-the-line with convoys, ^vliile half a dozen more went home with the trade from Jamaica. It is easier to criticise the division of the English fleet be- tween the West Indies and North America in the successive years 1780 and 1781, than to realize the embarrassment of the situation. This embarrassment was but the reflection of the military difficulty of England's position, all over the world, in this great and unequal w^ar. England was every- where outmatched and embarrassed, as she has always been as an empire, by the number of her exposed points. In Europe the Channel fleet was more than once driven into its ports by overwhelming forces. Gibraltar, closely blockaded 1 White : Naval Researches. TN THE WAR OF 1778. 393 by land and sea, was only kept alive in its desperate resist- ance by the skill of English seamen triumphing over the in- aptness and discords of their combined enemies. In the East Indies, Sir Edward Hughes met in Suffren an opponent as superior to him in numbers as was De Grasse to Hood, and of far greater ability. Minorca, abandoned by the home gov- ernment, fell before superior strength, as has been seen to fall, one by one, the less important of the English Antilles. The position of England from the time that France and Spain opened their maritime war was everywhere defensive, except in North America ; and was therefore, from the military point of view, essentially false. She everywhere awaited attacks which the enemies, superior in every case, could make at their own choice and their own time. North America was really no exception to this rule, despite some offensive opera- tions which in no way injured her real, that is her naval, foes. Thus situated, and putting aside questions of national pride or sensitiveness, what did military wisdom prescribe to Eng- land ? The question would afford an admirable study to a military inquirer, and is not to be answered off-hand, but certain evident truths may be pointed out. In the first place, it should have been determined what part of the assailed em- pire was most necessary to be preserved. After the British islands themselves, the North American colonies were the most valuable possessions in the eyes of the England of that day. Next should have been decided what others by their natural importance were best worth preserving, and by their own inherent strength, or that of the empire, which was mainly naval strength, could most surely be held. In the Mediterra- nean, for instance, Gibraltar and Mahon were both very valu- able positions. Could both be held ? Which was more easily to be reached and supported by the fleet ? If both could not probably be held, one should have been frankly abandoned, and the force and efforts necessary to its defence carried elsewhere. So in the West Indies the evident strategic ad- vantages of Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia prescribed the aban- donment of the other small islands by garrisons as soon as 394 NECESSITY FOR A VIGOROUS the fleet was fairly outnumbered, if not before. The case of so large an island as Jamaica must be studied separately, as well as with reference to the general question. Such an island may be so far self-supporting as to defy any attack but one in great force and numbers, and that would rightly draw to it the whole English force from the windward stations at Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia. With the defence thus concentrated, England's great weapon, the navy, should have been vigorously used on the offensive. Experience has taught that free nations, popular governments, will seldom dare wholly to remove tlie force that lies be- tween an invader and its shores or capital. Whatever the military wisdom, therefore, of sending the Channel fleet to seek the enemy before it united, the step may not have been possible. But at points less vital the attack of the English should have anticipated that of the allies. This was most es- pecially true of that theatre of the war which has so far been considered. If North America was the first object, Jamaica and the other islands should have been boldly risked. It is due to Rodney to say that he claims that his orders to the admirals at Jamaica and New York were disobeyed in 1781, and that to this was owing the inferiority in number of Graves's fleet. But why, in 1780, when the departure of De Guichen for Europe left Rodney markedly superior in numbers during his short visit to North America, from September 1-4 to Novem- ber 14, should no attempt have been made to destroy the French detachment of seven ships-of-the-line in Newport ? These ships had arrived there in July ; but although they had at once strengthened their position by earthworks, great alarm was excited by the news of Rodney's appearance off the coast. A fortniglit passed by Rodney in New York and by the French in busy work, placed the latter, in their own opinion, in a position to brave all the naval force of England. " We twice feared, and above all at the time of Rodney's arri- val," wrote the chief of staff of the French squadron, " that the English might attack us in the road itself ; and there was INITIATIVE BY GREAT BRITAIN. 395 a space of time during which such an undertaking would not have been an act of rashness. Now [October 20], the an- chorage is fortified so that we can there brave all the naval force of England." ^ The position thus taken by the French was undoubtedly very strong.^ It formed a re-entrant angle of a little over ninety degrees, contained by lines drawn from Goat Island to what was then called Brenton's Point, the site of the present Fort Adams on the one side, and to Rose Island on the other. On the right flank of the position Rose Island received a battery of thirty-six 24-pounders ; while twelve guns of the same size were placed on the left flank at Brenton's Point. Between Rose and Goat islands four ships, drawn up on a west-northwest line, bore upon the entrance and raked an approaching fleet ; while three others, between Goat Island and Brenton's Point, crossed their fire at right angles with the former four. On the other hand, the summer winds blow directly up the entrance, often with great force. There could be no question even of a considerably crippled attacking sliip reaching her destined position, and when once confused with the enemy's line, the shore batteries would be neutralized. The work on Rose Island certainly, that on Brenton's Point probably, had less height than the two upper batteries of a ship-of-the-line, and could be vastly outnumbered. They could not have been casemated, and might indisputably have been silenced by the grapeshot of the ships that could have been brought against them. Rose Island could be approached on the front and on the west flank within two hundred yards, and on the north within half a mile. There was nothing to prevent this right flank of the French, including the line of ships, being en- 1 Bouclon : La Marine de Louis XVI., p. 281.

The works at the time of Rodney's visit to New York were doubtless less complete than in 1781. This authority, a year later, gives the work on Rose Island twenty SG-pouuders. 396 NECESSITY FOR A VIGOROUS filaded and crushed by the English ships taking position west of Rose Ishmd. The essential points of close range and su- perior height were thus possible to the English fleet, which numbered twenty to the enemy's seven. If successful in de- stroying the shipping and reducing Rose Island, it could find anchorage farther up the bay and await a favorable wind to retire. In the opinion of a distinguished English naval offi- cer of the day,^ closely familiar with the ground, there was no doubt of the success of an attack ; and he urged it fre- quently upon Rodney, offering himself to pilot the leading ship. The security felt by the French in this position, and the acquiescence of the English in that security, mark clearly the difference in spirit between this war and the wars of Nelson and Napoleon. It is not, however, merely as an isolated operation, but in relation to the universal war, that such an attempt is here considered. England stood everywhere on the defensive, with inferior numbers. From such a position tliere is no salvation except by action vigorous almost to desperation. " It is im- possible for us," wrote with great truth the First Lord of the Admiralty to Rodney, " to have a superior fleet in every part ; and unless our commanders-in-chief will take the great line, as you do, and consider the king's whole dominions under their care, our enemies must find us unprepared somewhere, and carry their point against us." ^ Attacks which consid- ered in themselves alone might be thought unjustifiable, were imposed upon English commanders. The allied navy was the key of the situation, and its large detachments, as at Newport, should have been crushed at any risk. The effect of such a line of action upon the policy of the French government is a matter of speculation, as to which tlie pres- ent writer has no doubts ; but no English officer in chief com- 1 Sir Thomas Graves, afterward second in command to Nelson in the attack at Copenhagen in 1801, — an enterprise fnlly as desperate and encompassed with greater difficulties of pilotage than the one here advocated.

INITIATIVE BY GREAT lUUTAIX. 397 mand rose to the level of the situation, with the exception of Hood, and ])0ssibly of Howq. Rodney was now old, infirm, and though of great ability, a careful tactician rather than a great admiral. The defeat of Graves and subsequent surrender of Corn- wallis did not end the naval operations in the western hemi- sphere. On the contrary, one of the most interesting tactical feats and the most brilliant victory of the whole war were yet to grace the English flag in the West Indies ; but with the events at Yorktown the patriotic interest for Americans closes. Before quitting that struggle for independence, it must again be affirmed that its successful ending, at least at so early a date, was due to the control of the sea, — to sea power in the hands of the French, and its improper distribu- tion by the English authorities. This assertion may be safely rested on the authority of the one man who, above all others, thoroughly knew the resources of the country, the temper of the people, the difficulties of the struggle, and whose name is still the highest warrant for sound, quiet, unfluttered good- sense and patriotism. The keynote to all Washington's utterances is set in the " Memorandum for concerting a plan of operations with the French army," dated July 15, 1780, and sent by the hands of Lafayette : — " The Marquis de Lafayette will be pleased to communicate the following general ideas to Count de Rochambeau and the Chevalier de Ternay, as the sentiments of the underwritten : " I. In any operation, and under all circumslances, a decisive naval superiority is to be considered as a fundamentcd principle, and the basis upon which every hope of success must ultimately depend'^ This, however, though the most formal and decisive ex- pression of Washington's views, is but one among many others equally distinct. Thus, writing to Franklin, Decem- ber 20, 1780," he says : — " Disappointed of the second division of French troops [blockaded in Brest], but more especially in the expected naval superiority, which 398 WASHI^■Grox'S opinions as to was the pivot upon which everything turned, we have been compelled to spend an inactive campaign after a flattering prospect at the open- ino^ of it. . . . Latterly we have been obliged to become spectators of a succession of detachments from the army at New York in aid of Lord Cornwallis ; while our naval weakness, and the political dissolu- tion of a large part of our army, put it out of our power to counteract them at the southward, or to take advantage of them here." A month later, January 15, 1781, in a memorandum letter to Colonel Laurens, sent on a special mission to France, he says : — " Next to a loan of money, a constant naval superiority upon these coasts is the object most interesting. This would instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult defensive. . . . Indeed, it is not to be con- ceived how they could subsist a large force in this country, if we had the command of the seas to interrupt the regular transmission of sup- plies from Europe. This superiority, with an aid in money, would enable us to convert the war into a vigorous offensive. With re- spect to us it seems to be one of two deciding points." In another letter to the same person, then in Paris, dated April 9, he writes : — - " If France delays a timely and powerful aid in the critical posture of our affairs, it will avail us nothing, should she attempt it here- after. . . . Why need I run into detail, when it may be declared in a word that we are at the end of our tether, and that now or never our deliverance must come ? How easy would it be to retort the enemy's own game upon them, if it could be made to comport with the general plan of the war to keep a superior fleet always in these seas, and France would put us in condition to be active by advancing us money." Ships and money are the burden of his cry. May 23, 1781, he writes to the Chevalier de la Luzerne : " I do not see how it is possible to give effectual support to the Southern States, and avert the evils which threaten, while we are inferior in naval force in these seas." As the season for active opera- tions advances, his utterances are more frequent and urgent. THE INFLUENCE OF SEA POWER. 399 To Major General Greene, struggling with his difficulties in South Carolina, he writes, June 1, 1781 : " Our affairs have been attentively considered in every point of view, and it was finally determined to make an attempt upon New York, in preference to a Southern operation, as we had not decided command of the water." To Jefferson, June 8 : " Should I be supported in the manner I expect, by the neighboring- States, the enemy will, I hope, be reduced to the necessity of recalling part of tlieir force from the southward to support New York, or they will run the most imminent risk of being expelled from that post, which is to them invaluable ; and should we, by a lucky coincidence of circumstances, gain a naval superiority, their ruin would be inevitable. . . . While we remain inferior at sea . . . policy dictates that relief should be attempted by diversion rather than by sending re- inforcements immediately to the point in distress," that is, to the South. To Rochambeau, June 13 : " Your Excellency will recollect that New York was looked upon by us as the only practicable object under present circumstances ; but should we be able to secure a naval superiority, we may perhaps find others more practicable and equally advisable." By the 15th of August the letters of De Grasse announcing his sailing for the Chesapeake were received, and the corre- spondence of Washington is thenceforth filled with busy preparations for the campaign in Virginia, based upon the long-delayed fleet. The discouragement of De Grasse, and his purpose to go to sea, upon learning that the English fleet in New York had been reinforced, drew forth an appealing let- ter dated September 25, wliich is too long for quotation ; but the danger passed, Washington's confidence returns. The day after the capitulation he writes to De Grasse : " The surrender of York . . . the honor of which belongs to your Excellency^ has greatly anticipated [in time] our most san- guine anticipations." He then goes on to urge further opera- tions in the South, seeing so much of the good season was still left: "The general naval superiority of the British, previous to your arrival, gave them decisive advantages in 400 OPINIOXS OF WASUINGTON. the South, in the rapid transport of their troops and sup- plies ; while the immense land marches of our succors, too tardy and expensive in every point of view, subjected us to be beaten in detail. It will depend upon your Excellency, therefore, to terminate the war." De Grasse refusing this re- quest, but intimating an intention to co-operate in the next year's campaign, Washington instantly accepts: "With your Excellency I need not insist upon the indispensable necessity of a maritime force capable of giving you an absolute ascen- dency in these seas. . . . You will have observed that, what- ever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest." A fortnight later, November 15, he writes to Lafayette, who is on the point of sailing for France : — " As you expressed a desire to know my sentiments respecting the operations of the next campaign, I will, without a tedious display of reasoning, declare in one word that it must depend absolutely upon the naval force which is employed in these seas, and the time of its appearance next year. No land force cau act decisively unless ac- companied by a maritime superiority. ... A doubt did not exist, nor does it at this moment, in any man's mind, of the total extirpation of the British force in the Carol inas and Georgia, if Count de Grasse could have extended his co-operation two months longer." Such, in the opinion of the revered commander-in-chief of the American armies, was the influence of sea power upon the contest which he directed with so much skill and such infinite patience, and which, amidst countless trials and discourage- ments, he brought to a glorious close. It will be observed that the American cause was reduced to these straits, notwithstanding the great and admitted losses of British commerce by the cruisers of the allies and by American privateers. This fact, and the small results from the general war, dominated as it was by the idea of commerce- destroying, show strongly the secondary and indecisive effect of such a policy upon the great issues of war. CHAPTER XL Maritime War in Europe, 1779-1782. 'T^HE last chapter closed with the ophiions of Washington, -*■ expressed in many ways and at many times, as to the effect of sea power upon the struggle for American inde- pendence. If space allowed, these opinions could l)e amply strengthened by similar statements of Sir Henry Clinton, the English commander-in-chief.i In Europe the results turned yet more entirely upon the same factor. There the allies had three ^several objectives, at each of which England stood strictly upon the defensive. The first of these was England herself, involving, as a preliminary to an invasion, the destruction of the Channel fleet, — a project which, if seriously entertained, can scarcely be said to have been seriously attempted ; the second was the reduction of Gibraltar; the third, the capture of Minorca. The last alone met with success. Thrice was England threatened by a largely superior fleet, thrice the threat fell harmless. Thrice was Gibraltar reduced to straits ; thrice was it relieved by the address and fortune of English seamen, despite overpowering odds. After Keppel's action off Ushant, no general encounter took place between fleets in European seas during the year 1778 and the first half of 1779. Meantime Spain was draw- ing toward a rupture with England and an active alliance with France. War was declared by her on the 16th of June, 1779 ; but as early as April 12, a treaty between the two Bourbon kingdoms, involving active war upon England, had been signed. By its terms the invasion of Great Britain or Ireland was to be undertaken, every effort made to recover ^ The curious reader can consult Clinton's letters and notes, in the " Clinton- Cornwallis Controversy," by B. F. Stevens.

As it was, no efficient blockade of Brest was established, and twenty-eight French sail-of-the-line went out unopposed ^ June 3, 1779, under D'Orvilliers,Keppers opponent of the year before. The fleet steered for the coasts of Spain, where it was to find the Spanisli ships ; but it was not till the 22d of July that the full contingent joined. Seven precious summer weeks thus slipped by unimproved, but that was not all the loss ; the French had been provisioned for only thirteen weeks, and this truly great armada of sixty-six ships-of-the-line and fourteen frigates had not more tlian forty working-days before it. Sickness, moreover, ravaged the fleet ; and although it was fortunate enough to enter the Channel while the English were at sea, the latter, numbering little more than half their enemies, succeeded in passing within them. The flabbiness of coali- tions increased the weakness due to inefficient preparation ; a great and not unnatural panic on the English Channel coast, and the capture of one ship-of-the-line, were the sole results of a cruise extending, for the French, over fifteen weeks. -^ The disappointment, due to bad preparation, mainly 1 Bancroft : History of the United States, vol. x. p. 191. 2 Although the English thus culpably failed to use tlicir superiority to the French alone, the Channel fleet numbering over forty of the line, the fear that it might prevent the junction caused the Brest fleet to sail in haste and under- manned, — a fact which had an important effect upon the issue of the cruise. (Chevalier, p. 1.59.) ^ The details of the mismanagement of this huge mob of ships are so numerous as to confuse a narrative, and are therefore thrown into a foot-note. The French fleet was hurried to sea four thousand men short. The Spaniards were seven weeks in joining. When they met, no common system of signals had been arranged ; five fair summer days were spent in remedying this defect. Not till a week after the junction could the fleet sail for England. No steps were taken to supply the provisions consumed by the French during the seven weeks. The RODNEY RELIEVES GIBRALTAR. 403 on the part of Spain, thougli the French ministry utterly failed to meet the prcssinjij wants of its fleet, fell, of course, upon the innocent Admiral d'Orvilliers. That hrave and accomplished but unfortunate officer, whose only son, a lieutenant, had died of the pestilence which scourged the allies, could not support the odium. Being- of a deeply re- ligious character, the refuge which Yilleneuve after Tra- falgar found in suicide was denied him ; but he threw up his command and retired into a religious house. The scanty maritime interest of the year 1780, in Europe, centres round Cadiz and Gibraltar. This fortress Avas in- vested by Spain immediately upon the outbreak of war, and, while successfully resisting direct attack, the supply of pro- visions and ammunition was a matter of serious concern to England, and involved both difficulty and danger. For this purpose, Rodney sailed on the 29th of December, 1779, having under his command twenty ships-of-the-linc wath a large con- voy and reinforcements for Gibraltar and Minorca, as well as the West India trade. The latter parted company on the 7th of January, under the care of four frigates, and the following morning the fleet fell in with and captured a Spanish squad- ron of seven ships-of-war and sixteen supply-ships. Twelve of the latter bein^- laden Avith provisions were carried on to Gibraltar. A week later, at one p. m. of the 16th, a Spanish original orders to D'Orvilliers contemplated a landing at Portsmouth, or the seizure of the Isle of Wight, for wliich a large army was assembled on the coast of Normandy. Upon reaching the Channel, these orders were suddenly changed, and Falmouth indicated as the point of landing. By this time, August 16, summer was nearly over ; and Falmouth, if taken, would offer no shelter to a great fleet. Then an easterly gale drove the fleet out of tlie Channel. By this time the sickness which raged had so reduced the crews that many sliips could be neither handled nor fought. Ships companies of eiglit imndred or a thousand men could muster only from three to five hundred. Thus had ailmini^^tration crippled the fighting powers of tlie fleet ; while the unaccountable military blunder of changing the objective from a safe and accessible roadstead to a fourth-rate and exposed harbor completed the disaster by taking away the only hope of a secure base "f operations during the fall and winter montlis. France then had no first-class port on the Channel ; hence the violent westerly gales which prevail in the autumn and winter would have driven the allies into the North Sea. 404 DEFEAT OF L ANGARA'S FLEET. fleet of eleven sail-of-the-line was seen in the southeast. They held their ground, supposing the approaching vessels to be only supplv-ships for Gibraltar, without a strong force of men-of- war, — an unfortunate error from which they did not awake until too late to escape, owing to the yet more unfortunate oversight of having no lookout frigates thrown out. When the Spanish admiral, Don Juan de Langara, recognized his mistake, he attempted to escape ; but the English ships were copper-bottomed, and Rodney making the signal for a gen- eral chase overtook the enemy, cut in between him and his port, regardless of a blowy night, lee shore, and dangerous shoals, and succeeded in capturing the commander-in-chief with six ships-of-the-line. A seventh was blown up. Tlie weather continuing very tempestuous, one of the prizes was wrecked, and one forced into Cadiz ; several of the English ships were also in great danger, but happily escaped, and within a few days the entire force entered Gibraltar Bay. The convoy for Minorca was at once despatched, and imme- diately after the return of the ships-of-war guarding it, on the 13th of February, Rodney sailed for the West Indies with four ships-of-the-line, sending the rest of his force, with the prizes, to England under Admiral Digby. The state of politics and parties in England at this time was such that, combined with the unavoidable inferiority of the Channel fleet, it was difficult to find an admiral willing to accept the chief command. An admirable officer, Bar- rington, the captor of Sta. Lucia, refused the first place, though willing to serve as second, even to a junior.^ The allied fleet, to the number of thirt3'-six sail-of-the-line, assem- bled at Cadiz. Their cruises, however, were confined to the Portuguese coast ; and their only service, a most important one, was the capture of an entire convoy, largely laden with military stores, for the East and West Indies. The entrance of sixty English prizes, with nearly three thousand prisoners, into Cadiz, was a source of great rejoicing to Spain. On the 1 Life of Admiral Keppel, vol. ii. pp. 72, 346, 403.

THE ARMED NEUTRALITY. 405 24th of October, Dc Guiclicn, returning fi'om his contest with Rodney, came into the same port with his West Indian squad- ron, of nineteen ships-of-the-line ; but the immense armament thus assembled did nothing. The French ships returned to Brest in January, 1781. While thus unproductive of military results in Europe, the war in 1780 gave rise to an event whicli cannot wholly be passed over by any history of sea power. This was the Armed Neutrality, at the head of which stood Russia, joined by Sweden and Denmark. The claim of England to seize enemy's goods in neutral ships bore hard upon neutral powers, and especially upon those of the Baltic and upon Holland, into whose hands, and those of the Austrian Netherlands, the war had thrown much of the European carrying-trade ; while the products of the Baltic, naval stores and grain, were those which England was particularly interested in forbidding to her enemies. The declarations finally put forth by Russia, and signed by Sweden and Denmark, were four in number : 1. That neutral vessels had a right, not only to sail to unblockaded ports, but also from port to port of a belligerent nation ; in other words, to maintain the coasting trade of a belligerent. 2. That property belonging to the subjects of a power at war should be safe on board neutral vessels. This was the principle involved in the now familiar maxim, " Free ships make free goods." 3. That no articles are contraband, except arms, equip- ments, and munitions of war. This ruled out naval stores and provisions unless belonging to the government of a belligerent. 4. That blockades, to be binding, must have an adequate naval force stationed in close proximity to the blockaded port. The contracting parties being neutral in the present war, but binding themselves to support these principles by a com- bined armed fleet of a fixed minimum number, the agreement received the name of the Armed Neutrality. Tlic discussion of the propriety of the various declarations belongs to Inter- 40 G WAR BETWEEN ENGLAND AND HOLLAND. national law ; but it is evident that no great maritime State, situated as England then was, would submit to the first and third as a matter of right. Policy only could induce her to do so. Without meeting the declarations by a direct contra- diction, the ministry and the king determined to disregard them, — a course which was sustained in principle even by prominent members of the bitter opposition of that day. The undecided attitude of the United Provinces, divided as in the days of Louis XIV. between tlie partisans of England and France, despite a century of alliance with the former, drew the especial attention of Great Britain. They had been asked to join the Armed Neutrality ; they hesitated, but the majority of the provinces favored it. A British officer had already gone so far as to fire upon a Dutch man-of-war which had resisted the search of merchant-ships under its convoy ; an act which, whether right or wrong, tended to incense the Dutch generally against England. It was determined by the latter that if the United Provinces acceded to the coalition of neutrals, war should be declared. On the 16th of December, 1780, the English ministry was informed that the States- General had resolved to sign the declarations of the Armed Neutrality without delay. Orders were at once sent out to Rodney to seize the Dutch West India and South American possessions ; similar orders to the East Indies ; and the am- bassador at the Hague was recalled. England declared war four days later. The principal effect, therefore, of the Armed Neutrality upon the war was to add the colonies and com- merce of Holland to the prey of English cruisers. The ad- ditional enemy was of small account to Great Britain, whose geographical position effectually blocked the junction of the Dutch fleet with those of her other enemies. The possessions of Holland fell everywhere, except when saved by the French ; while a bloody but wholly uninstructive battle between English and Dutch squadrons in the North Sea, in August, 1781, was the only feat of arms illustrative of the old Dutch courage and obstinacy. The year 1781, decisive of the question of the independence DERBY RELIEVES GIBRALTAR. 407 of the United States, was marked in the European seas by im- posing movements of great fleets followed by puny results. At the end of March Do Grasse sailed from Brest with twenty- six ships-of-the-line. On the 29th he detached five under Suffren to the East Indies, and himself continued on to meet success at Yorktown and disaster in the West Indies. On the 23d of June De Guichcn sailed from Brest with eighteen ships-of-the-line for Cadiz, where he joined thirty Spanish ships. This immense armament sailed on the 22d of July for the Mediterranean, landed fourteen thousand troops at Minorca, and then moved upon the English Channel. The English had this year first to provide against the danger to Gibraltar. That beset fortress had had no supplies since Rodney's visit, in January of the year before, and was now in sore want, the provisions being scanty and bad, the biscuits weevilly, and the meat tainted. Amid the horrors and uproar of one of the longest and most exciting sieges of history, the sufferings of the combatants were intensified by the presence of many peaceful inhabitants, including the wives and families of soldiers as well as of officers. A great fleet of twenty-eight ships-of-the-line sailed from Portsmouth on the 13th of March, convoying three hundred merchant-ships for the East and West Indies, besides ninety-seven transports and supply-ships for the Rock. A delay on the Irish coast prevented its falling in with De Grasse, who had sailed nine days after it. Arriving off Cape St. Vincent, it met no enemy, and looking into Cadiz saw the great Spanish fleet at anchor. The latter made no move, and the English ad- miral, Derby, threw his supplies into Gibraltar on the 12th of April, undisturbed. At the same time he, like De Grasse, detached to the East Indies a small squadron, which was destined before long to fall in with Suffren. The inaction of the Spanish fleet, considering the eagerness of its gov- ernment about Gibraltar and its equal if not superior num- bers, shows scanty reliance of the Spanish admiral upon himself or his command. Derby, having relieved Gibraltar and Minorca, returned to the Channel in May. 408 THE ALLIES IN ENGLISH CHANNEL, 1781. Upon the approach of the combined fleet of nearly fifty sail in August following, Derby fell back upon Torbay and there anchored his fleet, numbering thirty ships. De Guichen, who held chief command, and whose caution when engaged with Rodney has been before remarked, was in favor of fighting ; but the almost unanimous opposition of the Span- iards, backed by some of his own officers, overruled him in a council of war,^ and again the great Bourbon coalition fell back, foiled by their own discord and the unity of their enemy. Gibraltar relieved, England untouched, were the results of these gigantic gatherings ; they can scarcely be called efforts. A mortifying disaster closed the year for the allies. De Guichen sailed from Brest with seventeen sail, protecting a large convoy of merchantmen and ships with military supplies. The fleet was pursued by twelve English ships under Admiral Kempenfeldt, an officer whose high professional abilities have not earned the immortality with which poetry has graced his tragical death. Falling in with the French one hundred and fifty miles west of Ushant, he cut off a part of the convoy, despite his inferior num- bers.2 A few days later a tempest dispersed the French 1 Beatson gives quite at length (vol. v. p. 395) the debate in the allied council of war. The customary hesitation of such councils, in face of tlie difficulties of the situation, was increased by an appeal to the delusion of commerce-destroying as a decisive mode of warfare. M. de Beausset urged that " the allied fleets should direct their whole attention to that great and attainable object, the inter- cepting of the British homeward-bound West India fleets. This was a measure which, as they were now masters of the sea, could scarcely fail of success ; and it would prove a blow so fatal to that nation, that she could not recover it during the whole course of the war." The French account of Lapeyrouse-Bonfils is essentially the same. Chevalier, who is silent as to details, justly remarks : " The cruise just made by the allied fleet was such as to injure the reputation of France and Spain. These two powers had made a great display of force which had produced no result." The English trade also received little injury. Guichen wrote home : " I have returned from a cruise fatiguing but not glorious." ■■^ This mishap of the French was largely due to mismanagement by De Guichen, a skilful and usually a careful admiral. When Kempenfeldt fell in with him, all the French ships-of-war were to leeward of their convoy, while the English were to windward of it. The former, therefore, were unable to interpose in time ; and the alternative remedy, of the convoy running down to leeward of their escort, could not be applied by all the merchant-ships in so large a body. SURRENDER OF PORT MAIION. 409 fleet. Only two .shi[)s-of-the-line and five merchantmen out of one hundred and fifty reached the West Indies. The year 1782 opened with the loss to the English of Port Mahon, which surrendered on the 5th of February, after a siege of six months. — a surrender induced by the ravages of scurvy, consequent upon the lack of vegetables, and confinement in the foul air of bombproof s and casemates, under the heavy fire of an enemy. On the last night of the defence the call for necessary guards was four hundred and fifteen, while only six hundred and sixty men were fit for duty, thus leaving no reliefs. The allied fleets assembled this year in Cadiz, to the number of forty ships-of-the-line. It was expected that this force would be increased by Dutch ships, but a squadron under Lord Howe drove the latter back to their ports. It does not certainly appear that any active enterprise was intended against the English coast ; but the allies cruised off the mouth of the Channel and in the Bay of Biscay during the summer months. Their presence insured the safe arrival and departure of the homeward and outward bound merchantmen, and likewise threatened English com- merce ; notwithstanding which, Howe, with twenty-two ships, not only kept the sea and avoided an engagement, but also succeeded in bringing the Jamaica fleet safe into port. The injury to trade and to military transportation by sea may be said to have been about equal on either side ; and the credit for successful use of sea power for these most important ends must therefore be given to the weaker party. Having carried out their orders for the summer cruise, the combined fleets returned to Cadiz. On the 10th of September they sailed thence for Algesiras, on the opposite side of the bay from Gibraltar, to support a grand com- bined attack by land and sea, which, it was hoped, would reduce to submission the key to the Mediterranean. With the ships already there, the total rose to nearly fifty ships- of-the-line. The details of the mighty onslaught scarcely belong to our subject, yet cannot be wholly passed by, 410 ATTACK ON GIBRALTAR. Avithout at least such mention as may recognize and draw attention to their interest; The three years' siege which was now drawing to its end had been productive of many brilliant feats of arms, as well as of less striking but more trying proofs of steadfast endurance, on the part of the garrison. How long the latter might have held out cannot be said, seeing the success with which the English sea power defied the efforts of the allies to cut off the communications of the fortress ; but it was seemingly certain that the place must be subdued by main force or not at all, while the growing exhaustion of the belligerents foretold the near end of the war. Accordingly Spain multiplied her efforts of preparation and military in- genuity ; while the report of them and of the approaching decisive contest drew to the scene volunteers and men of emi- nence from other countries of Europe. Two French Bour- bon princes added, by their coming, to the theatrical interest with which the approaching drama was invested. The pres- ence of royalty was needed adequately to grace the sublime catastrophe ; for the sanguine confidence of the besiegers had determined a satisfactory denouement with all the security of a playwright. Besides the works on the isthmus which joins the Rock to the mainland, where three hundred pieces of artillery were now mounted, the chief reliance of the assailants was upon ten floating batteries elaborately contrived to be shot and fire proof, and carrying one hundred and fifty-four heavy guns. These were to anchor in a close north-and-south line along the west face of the works, at about nine hundred yards distance. They were to be supported by forty gunboats and as many bomb vessels, besides the efforts of the ships-of-the- line to cover the attack and distract the garrison. Twelve thousand French troops were brought to reinforce the Span- iards in the grand assault, which was to be made when the bombardment had sufficiently injured and demoralized the defenders. At this time the latter numbered seven thousand, their land opponents thirty -three thousand men. ATTACK ON GIBRALTAR. 411 The final act was opened by the English. At seven o'clock on the morning of September 8, 1782, the commanding gen- eral, Elliott, began a sesere and most injurious fire upon the works on the isthmus. Having effected his purpose, he stopped ; but the enemy took up the glove the next morning, and for four days successively poured in a fire from the isth- mus alone of six thousand five hundred cannon-balls and one thousand one hundred bombs every twenty-four hours. So approached the great closing scene of September 13. At seven a. m. of that day the ten battering-ships unmoored from the head of the bay and stood down to their station. Be- tween nine and ten they anchored, and the general fire at once began. The besieged replied with equal fury. The bat- tering-ships seem in the main, and for some hours, to have justified the hopes formed of them ; cold shot glanced or failed to get through their sides, while the self-acting appara- tus for extinguishing fires balked the hot shot. About two o'clock, however, smoke was seen to issue from the ship of the commander-in-chief, and though controlled for some time, the fire continued to gain. The same misfor- tune befell others ; by evening, the fire of the besieged gained a marked superiority, and by one o'clock in the morning the greater part of the battering-ships were in flames. Their distress was increased by the action of the naval officer com- manding the English gunboats, who now took post upon the flank of the line and raked it effectually, — a service which the Spanish gunboats should have prevented. In the end, nine of the ten blew up at their anchors, with a loss esti- mated at fifteen hundred men, four hundred being saved from the midst of the fire by the English seamen. The tenth ship was boarded and burned by the English boats. The hopes of the assailants perished with the failure of the battering-ships. There remained only the hope of starving out the garrison. To this end the allied fleets now gave themselves. It was known that Lord Howe was on his way out with a great fleet, numbering thirty -four ships-of-the-line, besides supply vessels. 412 LORD HOWE RELIEVES GIBRALTAR. On the 10th of October a violent westerly gale injured the com- bined ships, driving one ashore under the batteries of Gibral- tar, where she was surrendered. The next day Howe's force came in sight, and the transports had a fine chance to make the anchorage, which, through carelessness, was missed by all but four. The rest, with the men-of-war, drove eastward into the Mediterranean. The allies followed on the 13th ; but though thus placed between the port and the relieving force, and not encumbered, like the latter, with supply-ships, they yet contrived to let the transports, with scarcely an ex- ception, slip in and anchor safely. Not only provisions and ammunition, but also bodies of troops carried by the ships- of-war, were landed without molestation. On the 19th the English fleet repassed the straits with an easterly wind, having within a week's time fulfilled its mission, and made Gibraltar safe for another year. The allied fleet followed, and on the 20tli an action took place at long range, the allies to windward, but not pressing their attack close. The num- ber of ships engaged in this magnificent spectacle, the closing scene of the great drama in Europe, the after-piece to the successful defence of Gibraltar, was eighty-three of the line, — forty-nine allies and thirty-four English. Of the former, thirty-three only got into action ; but as the duller sailers would have come up to a general engagement. Lord Howe was probably right in declining, so far as in him lay, a trial which the allies did not too eagerly court. Such were the results of this great contest in the European seas, marked on the part of the allies by efforts gigantic in size, but loose-jointed and flabby in execution. By England, so heavily overmatched in mere numbers, were shown firm- ness of purpose, high courage, and seamanship ; but it can scarcely be said that the military conceptions of her councils, or the cabinet management of her sea forces, were worthy of the skill and devotion of her seamen. The odds against her were not so great — not nearly so great — as the formidable lists of guns and ships seemed to show ; and while allowance must justly be made for early hesitations, the passing years NAVAL POLICY OF GREAT BRITAIN. 413 of indecision and inefficiency on the part of the allies should have betrayed to her their weakness. The reluctance of the French to risk their shi})s, so plainly shown by D'Estaing, De Grasse, and De Guichen, the sluggishness and inefficiency of the Spaniards, should have encouraged England to pursue her old policy, to strike at the organized forces of the enemy afloat. As a matter of fact, and probably from the neces- sities of the case, the opening of every campaign found the enemies separated, — the Spaniards in Cadiz, the French in Brest.^ To blockade the latter in full force before they could get out, England sliould have strained every effort ; thus she would have stopped at its head the main stream of the allied strength, and, by knowing exactly where this great body was, would have removed tliat uncertainty as to its action which fettered her own movements as soon as it had gained the freedom of the open sea. Before Brest she was interposed between the allies ; by her lookouts she would have known the approach of the Spaniards long before the French could know it ; she would have kept in her hands the power of bringing against each, singly, ships more numerous and indi- vidually more effective. A wind that was fair to bring on the Spaniards would have locked their allies in the port. The most glaring instances of failure on the part of England to do this were when De Grasse was permitted to get out unopposed in March, 1781 ; for an English fleet of superior force had sailed from Portsmouth nine days before him, but was delayed ^ "In the spring of 1780 the British admiralty had assembled in the Channel ports forty-five ships-of-the-line. The squadron at Brest was reduced to twelve or fifteen. . . . To please Spain, twenty French ships-of-the-line had joined the flag of Admiral Cordova in Cadiz. In consequence of these dispositions, the English with their Channel fleet held in check the forces which we had in Brest and in Cadiz. Enemy's cruisers traversed freely the space between the Lizard and the Straits of Gibraltar." (Chevalier, p. 202.) In 1781 "the Cabinet of Versailles called the attention of Ilollniid and Spain to the necessity of assembling at Brest a fleet strong enough to impo.se upon tlie ships which Great Britain kept in the Channel. The Dutch remained in the Texel, and the Spaniards did not leave Cadiz. From this state of tilings it resulted that the English, with forty ships-of-tlie-line, blocked seventy belonging to the allied powers." (p. 265.) 414 PROPER DISPOSAL OF THE BRITISH by the admiralty on the Irish coast ; ^ and again at the end of that year, when Kempenfeldt was sent to intercept De Guiehen with an inferior force, while ships enough to change the odds were kept at home. Several of the ships wliich were to ac- company Rodney to the West Indies were ready when Kem- penfeldt sailed, yet they were not associated with an enterprise so nearly affecting the objects of Rodney's campaign. The two forces united would have made an end of De Guichen's seventeen ships and his invaluable convoy. Gibraltar was indeed a heavy weight upon the English operations, but the national instinct which clung to it was correct. The fault of the English policy was in attempting to hold so many other points of land, while neglecting, by rapidity of concentration, to fall upon any of the detach- ments of the allied fleets. The key of the situation was upon the ocean ; a great victory there would have solved all tlie other points in dispute. But it was not possible to win a great victory while trying to maintain a show of force everywhere.^ North America was a yet heavier clog, and there undoubt- edly the feeling of the nation was mistaken ; pride, not wis- dom, maintained that struggle. Whatever the sympathies of individuals and classes in the allied nations, by their gov- ernments American rebellion was valued only as a weakening of England's arm. The operations there depended, as has 1 " A question was very much agitated both in and out of Parliament ; namely, "Whether the intercepting of tlie French fleet under the Count de Grasse should not have been the first object of the British fleet under Viee-Admiral Darby, instead of losing time in going to Ireland, by which that opportunity was missed. The defeat of the French fleet would certainly totally have disconcerted the great plans which the enemies had formed in the East and West Indies. It would have insured the safety of the British West India islands ; the Cape of Good Hope must have fallen into the hands of Britain ; and tlie campaign in North America might have had a very different termination." (Beatson's JMemoirs, vol. v. p. 341, where the contrary arguments are also stated.) 2 This is one of the most common and flagrant violations of the principles of war, — stretching a thin line, everywhere inadequate, over an immense frontier. The clamors of trade and local interests make popular governments especially liable to it. NAVY IN THE WAR OF 1778. 415 been shown, upon the control of the sea; and to maintain that, large detachments of English ships were absorbed from the contest with France and Spain. Could a successful war have made America again what it once was, a warmly at- tached dependency of Great Britain, a firm base for her sea power, it would have been worth much greater sacrifices ; but that had become impossible. But although she had lost, by her own mistakes, the affection of the colonists, which would have supported and secured her hold upon their ports and sea- coast, there nevertheless remained to the mother-country, in Halifax, Bermuda, and the West Indies, enough strong mili- tary stations, inferior, as naval bases, only to those strong ports which are surrounded by a friendly country, great in its resources and population. The abandonment of the con- test in North America would have strengthened England very much more than the allies. As it was, her large naval de- tachments there were always liable to be overpowered by a sudden move of the enemy from the sea, as happened in 1778 and 1781. To the abandonment of America as hopelessly lost, be- cause no military subjection could have brought back the old loyalty, should have been added the giving up, for the time, all military occupancy which fettered concentration, while not adding to military strength. Most of the Antilles fell under tins head, and the ultimate possession of them would depend upon the naval campaign. Garrisons could have been spared for Barbadoes and Sta. Lucia, for Gibraltar and per- haps for Mahon, that could have effectually maintained them until the empire of the seas was decided ; and to them could have been added one or two vital positions in America, like New York and Charleston, to be held only till guarantees were given for such treatment of the loyalists among the in- habitants as good faith required England to exact. Having thus stripped herself of every weight, rapid con- centration with offensive purpose should have followed. Sixty ships-of-the-line on the coast of Europe, half before Cadiz and half before Brest, with a reserve at home to replace in- 416 PROPEtt DISPOSAL OF THE BRITISH jured ships, would not have exhausted by a great deal the roll of the English navy ; and that such fleets would not have had to fight, may not only be said by us, who have the whole history before us, but might have been inferred by those who had watched the tactics of D'Estaing and De Guichen, and later on of De Grasse. Or, had even so much dispersal been thought unadvisable, forty ships before Brest would have left the sea open to the Spanish fleet to try conclusions with the rest of the English navy when the question of controlling Gib- raltar and Mahon came up for decision. Knowing what we do of the efficiency of the two services, there can be little question of the result ; and Gibraltar, instead of a weight, would, as often before and since those days, have been an element of strength to Great Britain. The conclusion continually recurs. Whatever may be the determining factors in strifes between neighboring continental States, when a question arises of control over distant regions, politically weak, — whether they be crumbling empires, an- archical republics, colonies, isolated military posts, or islands below a certain size, — it must ultimately be decided by naval power, by the organized military force afloat, which repre- sents the communications that form so prominent a feature in all strategy. The magnificent defence of Gibraltar hinged upon this ; upon this depended the military results of the war in America ; upon this the final fate of the West India" Islands ; upon this certainly the possession of India, Upon this will depend the control of the Central American Isthmus, if that question take a military coloring; and though modified by the continental position and surroundings of Turkey, the same sea power must be a weighty factor in shaping the outcome of the Eastern Question in Europe. If this be true, military wisdom and economy, both of time and money, dictate bringing matters to an issue as soon as possible upon the broad sea, with the certainty that the power which achieves military preponderance there will win in the end. In the war of the American Revolution the nu- merical preponderance was very great against England ; the NA VY IN THE WAR OF 177S. 417 actual odds were less, though still against her. Military con- siderations would have ordered the abandonment of the colo- nies ; but if the national pi'ide could not stoop to this, the right course was to blockade the hostile arsenals. If not strong enough to be in superior force before both, that of the more powerful nation should have been closed. Here was the first fault of the English admiralty ; the statement of the First Lord as to the available force at the outbreak of the war was not borne out by facts. The first fleet, under Keppel, barely equalled the French ; and at the same time Howe's force in America was inferior to the fleet under D'Estaing. In 1779 and 1781, on tlie contrary, the English fleet was superior to that of the French alone ; yet the allies joined unopposed, while in the latter year De Grasse got away to the West Indies, and Suffren to the East. In Kempenfeldt's affair with De Guichen, the admiralty knew that the French convoy was of the utmost importance to the campaign in the West Indies, yet they sent out their admiral with only twelve ships ; while at that time, besides the reinforcement destined for the West Indies, a number of others were stationed in the Downs, for what Fox justly called "the paltry purpose" of distress- ing the Dutch trade. The various charges made by Fox in the speech quoted from, and which, as regarded the Franco- Spanish War, were founded mainly on the expediency of attacking the allies before they got away into the ocean wil- derness, were supported by the high professional opinion of Lord Howe, who of the Kempenfeldt affair said : " Not only the fate of the West India Islands, but perhaps the whole future fortune of the war, might have been decided, almost without a risk, in the Bay of Biscay." ^ Not without a risk, but with strong probabilities of success, the whole fortune of the war should at the first have been staked on a concen- tration of the English fleet between Brest and Cadiz. No relief for Gibraltar would have been more efficacious ; no diversion surer for the West India Islands ; and the Ameri- cans would have appealed in vain for the help, scantily given 1 Annual Register, 1782. 27 418 DE GIIASSE'S SHORT STAY IN AMERICA. as it was, of the French fleet. For the great results that flowed from the coming of De Grasse must not obscure the fact that he came on the 31st of August, and announced from the beginning that he must be in the West Indies again by the middle of October. Only a providential com- bination of circumstances prevented a repetition to Washing- ton, in 1781, of the painful disappointments by D'Estaing and De Guichen in 1778 and 1780. CHAPTER XII. Events in the East Indies, 1778-1781. — Suffren sails from Brest, 1781. — His Brilliant Xaval Campaign in the Indian Seas, 1782, 1783. nr^HE very interesting and instructive campaign of Suffren -*- in the East Indies, although in itself by far the most noteworthy and meritorious naval performance of the war of 1778, failed, through no fault of his, to affect the gen- eral issue. It was not till 1781 that the French Court felt able to direct upon the East naval forces adequate to the im- portance of the issue. Yet the conditions of the peninsula at that time were such as to give an unusual opportunity for shaking the English power. Hyder Ali, the most skilful and daring of all the enemies against whom the English had yet fought in India, was then ruling over the kingdom of Mysore, which, from its position in the southern part of the peninsula, threatened both tlie Carnatic and the Malabar coast. Hyder, ten years before, had maintained alone a most successful war against the intruding foreigners, concluding with a peace upon the terms of a mutual restoration of con- quests ; and he was now angered by the capture of Mah^. On the other hand, a number of warlike tribes, known by the name of the Mahrattas, of the same race and loosely knit together in a kind of feudal system, had become involved in war with the English. The territory occupied by these tribes, whose chief capital was at Poonah, near Bombay, extended northward from Mysore to the Ganges. With boundaries thus conterminous, and placed centrally with reference to the three English presidencies of Bombay, Calcutta, and Ma- dras, Hyder and the Mahrattas were in a position of advan- tage for mutual support and for offensive operations against 420 ENGLISH DISASTERS IN INDIA. the common enemy. At the beginning of the war between England and Fiance, a French agent appeared at Poonah, It was reported to Warren Hastings, the Governor-General, that the tribes had agreed to terms and ceded to the French a seaport on the Malabar coast. With his usual promptness, Hastings at once determined on war, and sent a division of the Bengal army across the Jumna and into Berar. An- other body of four thousand English troops also marched from Bombay ; but being badly led, was surrounded and forced to surrender in January, 1779. This unusual reverse quickened the hopes and increased the strength of the ene- mies of the English ; and although the material injury was soon remedied by substantial successes under able leaders, the loss of prestige remained. The anger of Hyder Ali, roused by the capture of Mahd, was increased by imprudent thwarting on the part of the governor of Madras. Seeing the English entangled with the Mahrattas, and hearing that a French armament was expected on the Coromandel coast, he quietly prepared for war. In the summer of 1780 swarms of his horsemen descended without warning from the hills, and appeared near the gates of Madras. In September one body of English troops, three thousand strong, was cut to pieces, and another of five thousand was only saved by a rapid retreat upon Madras, losing its artillery and trains. Unable to attack Madras, Hyder turned upon the scattered posts separated from each other and the capital by the open country, which was now wholly in his control. Such was the state of affairs when, in January, 1781, a French squadron of six ships-of-the-line and three frigates appeared on the coast. The English fleet under Sir Edward Hughes had gone to Bombay. To the French commodore, Count d'Orves, Hyder appealed for aid in an attack upon Cud- dalore. Deprived of support by sea, and surrounded by the myriads of natives, the place must have fallen. D'Orves, how- ever, refused, and returned to the Isle of France. At the same time one of the most skilful of the English Indian soldiers. Sir Eyre Coote, took the field against Hyder. The latter at SUFFREN SAILS FROM BREST FOR IXDTA. 421 once raised the siege of the beleaguered posts, and after a series of operations extending through the spring months, was brought to battle on the 1st of July, 1781. His total defeat restored to the English the open country, saved the Carnatic, and put an end to the hopes of tlie partisans of the French in their late possession of Pondicherry. A great opportunity had been lost. Meanwhile a French officer of very different temper from his predecessors Avas on his way to the East Indies. It will be remembered that when De Grasse sailed from Brest, March 22, 1781, for the West Indies, there went with his fleet a division of five ships-of-the-line under Suffren. The latter separated from the main body on the 29th of the month, taking with him a few transports destined for the Cape of Good Hope, then a Dutch colony. The Frencli government had learned that an expedition from England was destined to seize this important halting-place on the road to India, and Suffren's first mission was to secure it. In fact, the squadron under Commodore Johnstone^ had got away first, and had anchored at Porto Praya, in the Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese colony, on the 11th of April. It numbered two ships-of-the-line, and three of fifty guns, with frigates and smaller vessels, besides thirty-five transports, mostly armed. Without apprehension of attack, not because he trusted to the neutrality of the port but because he thought his destina- tion secret, the English commodore had not anchored with a view to battle. It so happened that at the moment of sailing from Brest one of the ships intended for the West Indies was transferred to Suffren's squadron. She consequently had not water enough for the longer voyage, and this with other reasons 1 This Commodore Johnstone, more commonly known as Governor John- stone, was one of the three commissioners sent by Lord Xorth in 177S to promote a reconciliation with America. Owing to certain suspicious proceedings on his part, Congress declared it was incompatible with their honor to hold any manner of correspondence or intercourse with him. His title of Governor arose from his being at one time governor of Pensacola. He had a most unenviable reputation in the English navy. (See Charnock's Biog. Navalis.) 422 ACTION AT PORTO PRAYA. determined Suffren also to anchor at Porto Praya. On the 16th of April, five days after Johnstone, he made the island early in the morning and stood for the anchorage, sending a coppered ship ahead to reconnoitre. Approaching from the eastward, the land for some time hid the English squad- ron ; but at quarter before nine the advance ship, the " Ar- tesien," signalled that enemy's ships were anchored in the bay. The latter is open to the southward, and extends from east to west about a mile and a half ; the conditions are such that ships usually lie in the northeast part, near the shore (Plate XIII). ^ The English were there, stretch- ing irregularly in a west-northwest line. Both Suffren and Johnstone were surprised, but the latter more so ; and the initiative remained with the French officer. Few men were fitter, by natural temper and the teaching of experience, for the prompt decision required. Of ardent disposition and inborn military genius, Suffren had learned, in the conduct of Boscawen toward the squadron of De la Clue,^ in which he had served, not to lay weight upon the power of Portugal to enforce respect for her neutrality. He knew that this must be the squadron meant for the Cape of Good Hope. The only question for him was whether to press on to the Cape with the chance of getting there first, or to attack the English at their anchors, in the hope of so crippling them as to prevent their further progress. He decided for the latter ; and although the ships of his squadron, not sailing equally well, were scattered, he also determined to stand in at once, rather than lose the advantage of a surprise. Making signal to pre- pare for action at anchor, he took the lead in his flag-ship, the " Heros," of seventy-four guns, hauled close round the southeast point of the bay, and stood for the English flag- ship (f). He was closely followed by the " Hannibal," sev- enty-four (line a b) ; the advance ship "Artesien" (c), a sixty-four, also stood on with him; but the two rear ships were still far astern. 1 This plate is taken almost wholly from Cunat's " Vie de Suffren." 2 Page 299. / ^ "^ r. /^ / <^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ■"•■- ■H^ ti. '^ ^ ACTION AT PORTO PR AY A. 423 The English commodore got ready for battle as soon as he made out the enemy, but had no time to rectify his order. Suffren anchored five hundred feet from the flag-ship's star- board beam (by a singular coincidence the English flag-ship was also called " Hero "), thus having enemy's ships on both sides, and opened fire. The " Hannibal " anchored ahead of her commodore (b), and so close that the latter had to veer cable and drop astern (a) ; but her captain, ignorant of Suffren's intention to disregard the neutrality of the port, had not obeyed the order to clear for action, and was wholly unprepared, — his decks lumbered with water-casks which had been got up to expedite watering, and the guns not cast loose. He did not add to this fault by any hesitation, but followed the flag-ship boldly, receiving passively the fire, to which for a time he was unable to reply. Luffing to the wind, he passed to windward of his chief, chose his position with skill, and atoned by his death for his first fault. These two ships were so placed as to use both broadsides. The " Art^sien," in the smoke, mistook an East India ship for a . man-of-war. Run- ning alongside (c'), her captain was struck dead at the mo- ment he was about to anchor, and the critical moment being lost by the absence of a head, the ship drifted out of close ac- tion, carrying the East-Indiaman along with her (c"). The remaining two vessels, coming up late, failed to keep close enough to the wind, and they too were thrown out of action (d,e). Then Suffren, finding himself with only two ships to bear the brunt of the fight, cut his cable and made sail. The " Hannibal " followed his movement ; but so much injured was she that her fore and main masts went over the side, — fortunately not till she was pointed out from the bay, which she left shorn to a hulk. Putting entirely aside questions of international law, the wisdom and conduct of Suffren's attack, from the military point of view, invite attention. To judge them properly, we must consider what was the object of the mission with which he was charged, and what were the chief factors in thwarting or forwarding it. His first object was to protect the Cape 424 MERITS OF SUFFREN'S ACTION. of Good Hope against an English expedition ; the chief reli- ance for effecting his purpose was to get there first ; the obstacle to his success was the English fleet. To anticipate the arrival of the latter, two courses were open to him, — to run for it in the hope of winning the race, or to beat the enemy and so put him out of the running altogether. So lono- as his whereabouts was unknown, a search, unless with very probable information, would be a waste of time ; but when fortune had thrown his enemy across his path, the genius of Suffren at once jumped to the conclusion that the control of the sea in southern waters would determine the question, and should be settled at once. To use his own strong expression, " The destruction of the English squad- ron would cut off the root of all the plans and projects of that expedition, gain us for a long time the superiority in India, a superiority whence might result a glorious peace, and hin- der the English from reaching the Cape before me, — an ob- ject which has been fulfilled and was the principal aim of my mission." He was ill-informed as to the English force, believing it greater than it was ; but he had it at disadvantage and surprised. The prompt decision to fight, therefore, was right, and it is the most pronounced merit of Suffren in this affair, that he postponed for the moment — dismissed, so to speak, from his mind — the ulterior projects of the cruise ; but in so doing he departed from the traditions of the French navy and the usual policy of his government. It cannot be imputed to him as a fault that he did not receive from his captains the support he was fairly entitled to expect. The accidents and negligence which led to their failure have been mentioned ; but having his three best ships in hand, there can be little doubt he was right in profiting by tlie surprise, and trusting that the two in reserve would come up in time. The position taken by his own ship and by the " Hannibal," enabling them to use both broadsides, — in other words, to develop their utmost force, — was excellently judged. He thus availed himself to the full of the advantage given by the surprise and by the lack of order in the enemy's squadron. SUFFREN'S DISTINCTIVE MERITS. 425 This lack of order, according to English accounts, threw out of action two of their fifty-gun ships, — a circumstance wliich, while discreditable to Johnstone, confirmed Sufl'ren's judtr- ment in precipitating his attack. Had he received the aid upon which, after all deductions, he was justified in counting, he would have destroyed the English squadron ; as it was, he saved the Cape Colony at Porto Praya. It is not surprisino", therefore, that the French Court, notwitlistanding its tradi- tional sea policy and the diplomatic embarrassment caused by the violation of Portuguese neutrality, should have heartily and generously acknowledged a vigor of action to which it was unused in its admirals. It has been said that Suffren, who had watched the cautious movements of D'Estaing in America, and had served in the Seven Years' War, attributed in part the reverses suffered by the French at sea to the introduction of Tactics, which he stigmatized as the veil of timidity ; but that the results of the light at Porto Praya, necessarily engaged without previous arrangement, convinced him that system and method. had their use.^ Certainly his tactical combinations afterward were of a high order, especially in his earlier actions in the East (for he seems again to have abandoned them in the later fights under the disappointment caused by his captains' disaffection or blundering). But his great and transcendent merit lay in the clearness with which he recognized in the English fleets, the exponent of the British sea power, the proper enemy of the French fleet, to be attacked first and always when with any show of equality. Far from blind to the importance of those ulterior objects to which the action of the French navy was so constantly subordinated, he yet saw plainly that the way to assure those objects was not by econo- mizing his own ships, but by destroying those of the enemy. Attack, not defence, was the road to sea power in his eyes; and sea power meant control of the issues upon the land, at least in regions distant from Europe. This view out of the English policy he had tlie courage to take, after forty years 1 La Serre : Essais Hist, et Critiques sur la Marine Fran^aise. 426 CLEARNESS OF SUFFREN'S VIEWS. of service in a navy sacrificed to the opposite system ; but lie brought to its practical application a method not to be found in any English admiral of the day, except perhaps Rodney, and a fire superior to the latter. Yet the course thus followed was no mere inspiration of the moment ; it was the result of clear views previously held and expressed. How- ever informed by natural ardor, it had the tenacity of an intellectual conviction. Thus he wrote to D'Estaing, after the failure to destroy Barrington's squadron at Sta. Lucia, remonstrating upon the half-manned condition of his own and other ships, from which men had been landed to attack the English troops : — " Notwithstanding the small results of the two cannonades of the 15th of December [directed against Barrington's squadron], and the unhappy check our laud forces have undergone, we may yet hope for success. But the only means to have it is to attack vigorously the squadron, which, with our superiority, cannot resist, notwithstanding its land batteries, whose effects will be neutralized if we run them aboard, or anchor upon their buoys. If we delay, they may escape. . . . Besides, our fleet being unmanned, it is in condition neither to sail nor to light. What would happen if Admiral Byron's fleet should arrive ? What would become of ships having neither crews nor admiral ? Their defeat would cause the loss of the army and the colony. Let us destroy that squadron ; their army, lacking every- thing and in a bad country, would soon be obliged to surrender. Then let Byron come, we shall be pleased to see him. I think it is not necessary to point out that for this attack we need men and plans well concerted with those who are to execute them." Equally did he condemn the failure of D'Estaing to cap- ture the four crippled ships of Byron's squadron, after the action off Grenada. Owing to a combination of misfortunes, the attack at Porto Praya had not the decisive result it deserved. Commodore Johnstone got under way and followed Suffren ; but he thought his force was not adequate to attack in face of the resolute bearing of the French, and feared the loss of time conse- quent upon chasing to leeward of his port. He succeeded, SUFFREN ARRIVES IN INDIA. 427 however, in retaking the East India ship which the " Artdsicn" had carried out. Suffren continued his course and anchored at the Cape, in Simon's Bay, on the 21st of June. John- stone followed him a fortnight later ; but learning by an advance ship that the French troops had been landed, he gave up the enterprise against the colony, made a successful com- merce-destroying attack upon five Dutch India ships in Sal- danha Bay, which poorly repaid the failure of the military undertaking, and then went back himself to England, after sending the ships-of-the-line on to join Sir Edward Hughes in the East Indies. Having seen the Cape secured, Suffren sailed for the Isle of France, arriving there on the 25th of October, 1781. Count d'Orves, being senior, took command of the united squadron. The necessary repairs were made, and the fleet sailed for India, December 17. On the 22d of January, 1782, an English fifty-gun ship, the " Hannibal," was taken. On the 9th of February Count d'Orves died, and Suffren became commander-in-chief, with the rank of commodore. A few days later the land was seen to the northward of Madras ; but owing to head-winds the city was not sighted until Feb- ruary 15. Nine large ships-of-war were found anchored in order under the guns of the forts. They were the fleet of Sir Edward Hughes, not in confusion like that of Johnstone.^ Here, at the meeting point between these two redoubtable champions, each curiously representative of the characteris- tics of his own race, — the one of the stubborn tenacity and seamanship of the English, the other of the ardor and tac- tical science of the French, too long checked and betrayed by a false system, — is the place to give an accurate state- 1 The question of attacking the English squadron at its anchors was dehated in a council of war. Its opinion confirmed Suffren's decision not to do so. In contrasting this with the failure of the English to attack the French detachment in Newport (p. 394), it must be borne in mind that in the latter case there was no means of forcing the ships to leave their strong position ; whereas by threatening Trincomalee, or other less important points, Suffren could rely upon drawing Hughes out. He was therefore right in uot attacking, while the English before Newport were probably wrong. 428 IMPORTANCE OF CONTROLLING THE SEA. ment of the material forces. The French fleet had three S3venty-fours, seven sixty-fours, and two fifty-gun ships, one of which was the lately captured English " Hannibal." To these Sir Edward Hughes opposed two seventy -fours, one seventy, one sixty-eight, four sixtj'-fours, and one fifty-gun ship. The odds, therefore, twelve to nine, were decidedly against the English ; and it is likely that the advantage in single-ship power, class for class, was also against them. It must be recalled that at the time of his arrival Suffren found no friendly port or roadstead, no base of supplies or repair. The French posts had all fallen by 1779 ; and his rapid movement, which saved the Cape, did not bring him up in time to prevent the capture of the Dutch Indian posses- sions. The invaluable harbor of Trincomalee, in Ceylon, was taken just one month before Suffren saw the English fleet at Madras. But if he thus had everything to gain, Hughes had as much to lose. To Suffren, at the moment of first meeting, belonged superiority of numbers and the power of taking the offensive, with all its advantages in choice of initiative. Upon Hughes fell the anxiety of the defensive, with inferior num- bers, many assailable points, and uncertainty as to the place where the blow would fall. It was still true, though not so absolutely as thirty years before, that control in India depended upon control of the sea. The passing years had greatly strengthened the grip of England, and proportionately loosened that of France. Rela- tively, therefore, the need of Suffren to destroy his enemy was greater than that of his predecessors, D'Ach^ and others ; whereas Hughes could count upon a greater strength in the English possessions, and so bore a somewhat less responsi- bility than the admirals who went before him. Nevertheless, the sea was still by far the most important factor in the coming strife, and for its proper control it was necessary to disable more or less completely the enemy's fleet, and to have some reasonably secure base. For the latter purpose, Trincomalee, though unhealthy, was by far th'e best harbor on the east coast ; but it had not been long enough CONDITIONS INFLUENCING HUGHES. 429 in the hands of England to be well supplied. Hughes, there- fore, inevitably fell back on Madras for repairs after an action, and was forced to leave Trincoraalee to its own resources until ready to take the sea again. Suffren, on the other hand, found all ports alike destitute of naval supplies, while the natural advantages of Trincomalee made its possession an evident object of importance to him ; and Hughes so understood it. Independently, therefore, of the tradition of the English navy impelling Hughes to attack, the influence of which ap- pears plainly between the lines of his letters, Suffren had, in moving toward Trincomalee, a threat w^hich was bound to draw his adversary out of his port. Nor did Trincomalee stand alone ; the existing war between Hyder Ali and the English made it imperative for Suffren to seize a port upon the mainland, at which to land the three thousand troops car- ried by the squadron to co-operate on shore against the common enemy, and from which supplies, at least of food, might be had. Everything, therefore, concurred to draw Hughes out, and make him seek to cripple or hinder the French fleet. The method of his action would depend upon his own and his adversary's skill, and upon the uncertain element of the weather. It was plainly desirable for him not to be brought to battle except on his own terms ; in other words, without some advantage of situation to make up for his weaker force. As a fleet upon the open sea cannot secure any advantages of ground, the position favoring the weaker was that to wind- ward, giving choice of time and some choice as to method of attack, the offensive position used defensively, with the intention to make an offensive movement if circumstances warrant. The leeward position left the weaker no choice but to run, or to accept action on its adversary's terms. Whatever may be thought of Hughes's skill, it must be conceded that his task was difficult. Still, it can be clearly tliought down to two requisites. The first was to get in a blow rat the French fleet, so as to reduce the present in- equality ; the second, to keep Suffren from getting Trin- 430 THE FIRST BATTLE BETWEEN comalee, wnich depended wholly on the fleet.^ Suffren, on the other hand, if he could do Hughes, in an action, more injury than he himself received, would he free to turn in any direction he chose. Suffren having sighted Hughes's fleet at Madras, February 15, anchored his own four miles to the northward. Con- sidering the enemy's line, supported by the batteries, to be too strong for attack, he again got under way at four p. m., and stood south, Hughes also weighed, standing to the south- ward all that night under easy sail, and at daylight found that the enemy's squadron had separated from the convoy, the ships of war being about twelve miles east, while the transports were nine miles southwest, from him (Plate XIY. A, A). This dispersal is said to have been due to the care- lessness of the French frigates, which did not keep touch of the English. Hughes at once profited by it, chasing the convoy (c), knowing that the line-of-battle ships must follow. His copper-bottomed ships came up with and captured sis of the enemy, five of which were English prizes. The sixth carried three hundred troops with military stores. Hughes had scored a point. Suffren of course followed in a general chase, and by three p. M. four of his best sailers were two or three miles from the sternmost English ships. Hughes's ships were now much scattered, but not injudiciously so, for they joined by signal at seven p. m. Both squadrons stood to the southeast during the night, under easy sail. At daylight of the 17th — the date of the first of four actions fought between these two chiefs within seven months — the fleets were six or eight miles apart, the French bearing north- ^ The dependence of Trincomalee nptn the English fleet in this campaign affords an excellent illustration of the embarrassment and false position in which a navy finds itself when the defence of its seaports rests upon it. This bears upon a much debated point of the present day, and is worthy the study of those who maintain, too unqualifiedly, that the best coast defence is a navy. In one sense this is doubtless true, — to attack the enemy abroad is the best of defences ; but in the narrow sense of the word " defence" it is not true. Trincomalee unfor- tified was simply a centre round which Hughes had to revolve like a tethered animal ; and the same will always happen under like conditions. o 1 I i tc to It 0 to l^iO fl * 0 c^ «*' <^<7 in LJ X o C\j ■D 00 X r- oa r^ 2 Ld CO tr UJ u. u. u_ 3 (O in > o OJ 01 > 7 (1 1 O O I T I in IJ o ;; r m CQ r r HUGHES AND SUFFREN. 431 northeast from the English (B, B). The latter formed line- ahead on the port tack (a), with difficulty, owing to the light winds and frequent calms. Admiral Hughes explains that he hoped to weather the enemy by this course so as to engage closely, counting probably on finding himself to windward when the sea-breeze made. The wind continuing light, but with frequent squalls, from north-northeast, the French, run- ning before it, kept the puffs longer and neared the English rapidly, Suffren's intention to attack the rear being aided by Hughes's course. The latter finding his rear straggling, bore up to line abreast (b), retreating to gain time for the ships to close on the centre. These movements in line abreast con- tinued till twenty minutes before four P. M., when, finding he could not escape attack on the enemy's terms, Hughes hauled his wind on the port tack and awaited it (C). Whether by his own fault or not, he was now in the worst possible posi- tion, waiting for an attack by a superior force at its pleasure. The rear ship of his line, the " Exeter," was not closed up ; and there appears no reason why she should not have been made the van, by forming on the starboard tack, and thus bringing the other ships up to her. The method of Suffren's attack (C) is differently stated by him and by Hughes, but the difference is in detail only ; the main facts are certain. Hughes says the enemy " steered down on the rear of our line in an irregular double line- abreast," in which formation they continued till the moment of collision, when " three of the enemy's ships in the first line bore rio:ht down upon the ' Exeter,' while four more of their second line, headed by the ' H^ros,' in which M. de Suffren had his flag, hauled along the outside of the first line toward our centre. At five minutes past four the enemy's three ships began their fire upon the ' Exeter,' which was returned by her and her second ahead ; the action became general from our rear to our centre, the commanding ship of the enemy, with three others of their second line, leading down on our centre, yet never advancing farther than opposite to the ' iSuperbe,' our centre ship, with little or no wind and some heavy rain 432 SUFFEEN'S TACTICS. during the engagement. Under these circumstances, the en- emy brought eight of their best ships to the attack of five of ours, as the van of our line, consisting of the ' Monmouth,' ' Eao-le,' ' Burford,' and ' Worcester,' could not be brought into action without tacking on the enemy," for which there was not enough wind. Here we will leave them, and give Suffren's account of how he took up his position. In his report to the Minister of Marine he says : — " I should have destroyed the English squadron, less by superior numbers than by the advantageous disposition in which I attacked it. I attacked the rear ship and stood along the English line as far as the sixth. I thus made three of them useless, so that we were twelve against six. I began the fight at half-past three in the afternoon, taking the lead and making signal to form line as best could be done ; without that I would not have engaged. At four I made signal to three ships to double on the enemy's rear, and to the squadron to approach within pistol-shot. This signal, though repeated, was not executed. I did not myself give the example, in order that I might hold in check the three van ships, which by tacking would have doubled on me. However, except the ' Brilliant,' which doubled on the rear, no ship was as close as mine, nor received as many shots." The principal point of difference in the two accounts is, that Suffren asserts that his flag-ship passed along the whole English line, from the rear to the sixth ship ; while Hughes says the French divided into two lines, which, upon coming near, steered, one on the rear, the other on the centre, of his squadron. The latter would be the better manoeuvre ; for if the leading ship of the attack passed, as Suffren asserts, along the enemy's line from the rear to the sixth, she should receive in succession the first fire of six ships, which ought to cripple her and confuse her line. Suffren also notes the intention to double on the rear by placing three ships to leeward of it. Two of the French did take this position. Suffren further gives his reason for not closing with his own ship, which led ; but as those which followed him went no nearer, Hughes's attention was not drawn to his action. SUFFREN'S STRATEGIC IDEAS. 433 The French commodore was seriously, and it would seem justly, angered by the inaction of several of his captains. Of the second in command he complained to the minister : " Being at the head, I could not well see what was going on in the rear. I had directed M. de Tromelin to make sig- nals to ships which might be near him ; he only repeated my own without having them carried out." This complaint was wholly justified. On the 6th of February, ten days before the fight, he had written to his second as follows : — "If we are so fortunate as to be to windward, as the English are not more than eight, or at most nine, my intention is to double on their rear. Supposing your division to be in the rear, you will see by your position what number of ships will overlap the enemy's line, and you will make signal to them to double ^ [that is, to engage on the lee side]. ... In any case, I beg you to order to your division the manoeuvres which you shall think best fitted to assure the success of the action. The capture of Trincomalee and that of Negapatam, and perhaps of all Ceylon, should make us wish for a general action." The last two sentences reveal Suffren's own appreciation of the military situation in the Indian seas, which demanded, first, the disabling of the hostile fleet, next, the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives. A general action was the first desideratum of Suffren, and it is therefore safe to say that to avoid such action should have been the first object of Hughes. Tlie attempt of the latter to gain the windward position was con- sequently correct ; and as in the month of February the sea- breeze at Madras sets in from the eastward and southward about eleven a. M.,he probably did well to steer in that general direction, though the result disappointed him. De Guichen in 1 Plate XIV., Fig. T>, shows the order of battle Suffren intended in this action. The five rear ships of the enemy wonld each have two opponent.^ close aboard. The leading French ship on the weather side was to be kept farther off, so that while attacking the sixth Fnglishman she could "contnin " the van ships if they attempted to reinforce the rear by tacking. 28 434 DUTIES OF THE SECOND IN COMMAND. one of his engagements with Rodney shaped the course of his fleet with reference to being to windward when the afternoon breeze made, and was successfuL What use Hughes would have made of the advantage of the wind can only be inferred from his own words, — that he sought it in order to engage more closely. There is not in this the certain promise of any skilful use of a tactical advantage. Sulfren also illustrates, in his words to Tromelin, his con- ception of tlie duties of a second in command, which may fairly be paralleled with that of Nelson in his celebrated order before Trafalgar. In this first action he led the main attack himself, leaving the direction of what may be called the re- serve — at any rate, of the second half of the assault — to his lieutenant, who, unluckily for him, was not a Collingwood, and utterly failed to support him. It is probable that Suf- fren's leading was due not to any particular theory, but to the fact that his ship was the best sailer in the fleet, and that the lateness of the hour and lightness of the wind made it necessary to bring the enemy to action speedily. But here appears a fault on the part of Suffren. Leading as he did involves, not necessarily but very naturally, the idea of ex- ample ; and holding his own ship outside of close range, for excellent tactical reasons, led the captains in liis wake natu- rally, almost excusably, to keep at the same distance, not- withstanding his signals. The conflict between orders and example, which cropped out so singularly at Yicksburg in our civil war, causing the misunderstanding and estrangement of two gallant officers, should not be permitted to occur. It is tlie business of a chief to provide against such misappre- liensions by most careful previous explanation of both the letter and spirit of his plans. Especially is this so at sea, where smoke, slack wind, and intervening rigging make signals hard to read, though they are almost the only means of com- munication. This was Nelson's practice ; nor was Suffren a stranger to the idea. " Dispositions well concerted with those who are to carry them out are needed," he wrote to D'Estaing, three years before. The excuse which may be pleaded for SUFFREN'S COMPLAINTS OF HIS OFFICERS. 435 those who followed him, and engaged, cannot avail for the rear ships, and especially not for the second in command, who knew Siiffren's plans. He should have compelled the rear ships to take position to leeward, leading himself, if ne- cessary. There was wind enough ; for two captains actually engaged to leeward, one of them without orders, acting, through the impulse of his own good will and courage, on Nelson's saying, " No captain can do very wrong who places his ship alongside that of an enemy." He received the special commendation of Suffren, in itself an honor and a reward. Whether the failure of so many of his fellows was due to inefhciency, or to a spirit of faction and disloyalty, is unimportant to the general military writer, however in- teresting to French officers jealous for the honor of their service. Suffren's complaints, after several disappointments, became vehement. " My heart," wrote he, " is wrung by the most general defection. I have just lost the opportunity of destroying the English squadron. . . . All — yes, all — might have got near, since we were to wind- ward and ahead, and none did so. Several among them had behaved bravely in other combats. I can only attribute this horror to the wish to bring the cruise to an end, to ill-will, and to ignorance ; for I dare not suspect anytliing worse. The result has been terrible. I must tell j^ou, Monseigneur, that officers who have been long at the Isle of France are neither seamen nor military men. Not seamen, for they have not been at sea ; and the trading temper, independent and insubordinate, is absolutely opposed to the military spirit." This letter, written after his fourth battle with Hughes, must be taken with allowance. Not only does it appear that Suffren himself, hurried away on this last occasion by his eagerness, was partly responsible for the disorder of his fleet, but there were other circumstances, and above all the char- acter of some of the officers blamed, which made the charge of a general disaffection excessive. On the other hand, it remains true that after four general actions, with superior numbers on the part of the French, under a chief of the skill and ardor of Suffren, the English squadron, to use his own 43G MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. plaintive expression, " still existed ; " not only so, but had not lost a single ship. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that of a French naval writer : " Quantity disappeared be- fore quality." ^ It is immaterial whether the defect was due to inefficiency or disaffection. The inefficiency Avhich showed itself on the field of battle disappeared in the general conduct of the campaign where the qualities of the chief alone told. The battle of February 17th ended with a shift of wind to the southeast at six p. m., after two hours action. The English were thus brought to wind- ward, and their van ships enabled to share in the fight. Night falling, Suffren, at half-past six, hauled his squadron by the wind on the starboard tack, heading northeast, while Hughes steered south under easy sail. It is said by Captain Che- valier, of the French navy, that Suffren intended to renew the fight next day. In that case he should have taken measures to keep within reach. It was too plainly Hughes's policy not to fight without some advantage, — to allow the supposition that with one ship, the " Exeter," lost to liim through the concentration of so many enemies upon her, he would quietly await an attack. This is so plain as to make it probable that Suffren saw sufficient reason, in the results to his fleet and the misconduct of his officers, not to wish to renew action at once. The next morning the two fleets were out of sight of each other. The continuance of the north wind, and the crippled state of two of his ships, forced Hughes to go to Trin- comalec, where the sheltered harbor allowed them to repair. Suffren, anxious about his transports, went to Pondicherry, where he anchored in their company. It was his wish then to proceed against Negapatam ; but the commander of the troops chose to act against Cuddalore. After negotiations and arrangements with Hyder Ali the army landed south of Porto Novo, and marched against Cuddalore, which surrendered on the 4th of April. Meanwhile Suffren, anxious to act against his principal objective, had sailed again on the 23d of March. It was his 1 Troude : Batailles Navales. MOVEMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. 437 hope to cut off two shi})S-of-thc-liiie Avhicli were expected from England. For this he was too late ; the two seventy- fours joined the main body at Madras, March 30th. Hughes had refitted at Trincomalee in a fortnight, and reached Madras again on the 12th of March. Soon after the reinforcement had joined him, he sailed again for Trincomalee with troops and military stores for the garrison. On the 8th of April Suffren's squadron was seen to the northeast, also standing to the southward. Hughes kept on, through that and the two following days, with light northerly winds. On the 11th he made the coast of Ceylon, fifty miles north of Trincomalee, and bore away for the port. On the morning of the 12th the French squadron in the northeast was seen crowding sail in pursuit. It was the day on which Rodney and De Grasse met in the West Indies, but the parts were reversed ; here the French, not the English, sought action. The speed of the ships in both squadrons was very un- equal ; each had some coppered ships and some not cop- pered. Hughes found that his slow sailers could not escape tiie fastest of his enemy, — a condition which will always compel a retreating force to hazard an action, unless it can resolve to give up the rear ships, and which makes it im- perative for the safety, as well as the efficiency, of a squad- ron that vessels of the same class should all have a certain minimum speed. The same cause — the danger of a sepa- rated ship — led the unwilling De Grasse, the same day, in another scene, to a risky manoeuvre and a great mishap. Hughes, with better reason, resolved to fight ; and at nine A. M. formed his line on the starboard tack, standing in-shore (Plate XV., A), the squadron in good order, with intervals of two cables between the ships.^ His account, which again varies from that of Suffren, giving a radically different idea of the tactics used by the French commodore, and more to tlie credit of the latter's skill, will first be followed. Pie says : — <' The enemy, bearing north by east, distant six miles, with wind at north by east, continued manoeuvring their ships and changing ' Between four and five hundred jards. 438 THE SECOND BATTLE BETWEEN their positions in line, till fifteen minutes past noon, when they bore away (a) to engage us, five sail of their van stretching along (b) to engage the ships of our van, and the other seven sail (b') steering directly on our three centre ships, the ' Superbe,' the ' Monmouth,' her second ahead, and the ' Monarca,' her second astern. At half-past one the engagement began in the van of both squadrons ; three minutes after, I made the signal for battle. The French admiral in the ' Heros ' and his second astern in 'L'Orient' (both seventy-fours) bore down on the ' Superbe ' ^ within pistol-shot. The ' Heros ' continued in her posi- tion, giving and receiving a severe fire for nine minutes, and then stood on, greatly damaged, to attack the ' Monmouth,' at that time en- gaged with another of the enemy's ships, making room for the ships in his rear to come up to the attack of our centre, where the engage- ment was hottest. At three the ' Monmouth ' had her mizzen-mast shot away, and in a few minutes her mainmast, and bore out of the line to leeward (C, c) ; and at forty minutes past three the wind un- expectedly continuing far northerly without any sea-breeze, and being careful not to entangle our ships with the land, I made signal to wear and haul by the wind in a line-of-battle on the larboard tack, still engaging the enemy." Now here, practically, was concentration with a vengeance. In this, the hardest fight between these two hard fighters, the Englisli loss was 137 killed and 430 wounded in eleven ships. Of this total, the two centre ships, the flag-ship and her next ahead, lost 104 killed and 198 wounded, — fifty-three per cent of the entire loss of the squadron, of which they formed eighteen per cent. The casualties were very much heavier, in proportion to the size of the ships, than those of the lead- ers of the two columns at Trafalgar.^ The material injury to hulls, spars, etc., was yet more serious. The English squad- ron, by this concentration of the enemy upon a small fraction of it, was entirely crippled. Inferior when the action began, 1 The English and French flag-ships are denoted in the plan by their excep- tional size. 2 The " Victory," Nelson's ship at Trafalgar, a 100-gun ship, lost 57 killed and 102 wounded ; Hughes's sliip, a 74, lost 59 killed and 96 wounded.

But how far was this concentration intended by Suffren ? For this we must go to the pages of two French writers,^ who base their narratives upon his own despatches on record in the Frencli Marine Office. The practical advantage gained by the French must also be tested by comparing the lists of casualties, and the injuries received by their individual ships ; for it is evident that if both the squadrons received the same total amount of injury, but that with the English it fell on two ships, so that they could not be ready for action for a month or more, while with the French the damage was divided among the twelve, allowing them to be ready again in a few days, the victory tactically and strategically would rest with the latter.2 As regards Suffren's purpose, there is nothing to indicate that he meant to make such an attack as Hughes describes. Having twelve ships to the English eleven, his intention seems to have been to pursue the usual English practice, — form line parallel to the enemy, bear down together, and engage ship to ship. To this he added one simple combination ; the twelfth French ship, being unprovided with an opponent, was to engage the rear English ship on her lee side, placing her thus between two fires. In truth, a concentration upon the van and centre, such as Hughes describes, is tactically in- ferior to a like effort upon the centre and rear of a column. This is true of steamers even, wliich, though less liable to loss of motive power, must still turn round to get from van to rear, losing many valuable seconds ; but it is specially true of sailing vessels, and above all in the light, baffling airs wliich are apt to mark the change of monsoon at the season when this fight was fought. Nelson emphasized his contempt of the Russians of his day by saying he would not hesitate to attack their van, counting upon throwing the 1 Troude : Batailles Kavales ; CheA-alier : Hist, de la Marine Fran^aise. 2 This remark seems too self-evideut to need emphasis ; yet it may be ques- tioned whether naval men generally carry it in their stock of axioms. 440 SUFFREN'S TACTICS, APRIL 12, 1783. whole line in confusion from their want of seamanship ; but though entertaining a not much better opinion of the Span- iards, he threw the weight of attack on the rear of the allied fleets at Trafalgar. In dealing with such seamen as the cap- tains of Hughes's fleet, it would have been an error to assail the van instead of the rear. Only a dead calm could have kept the latter out of action. Suffren's attack is thus described by Captain Chevalier. After mentioning Hughes's forming line on the starboard tack, he says : — "This manoeuvre was imitated by the French, and the two squad- rons ran on parallel lines, heading about west-northwest (A, A). At eleven, our line being well formed, Suffren made signal to keep away to west-southwest, by a movement all together. Our ships did not keep their bearing upon the prescribed line, and the van, com- posed of the best sailers, came first within range of the enemy.^ At one, the leading ships of the English fleet opened fire upon the ' Ven- geur ' and ' Artesien ' [French van]. These two ships, having luffed ^ to return the fire, were at once ordered to keep away again. Suffren, who wished for a decisive action, kept his course, receiving without reply the shots directed upon his ship by the enemy. When at pistol- range of the ' Superbe,' he hauled to the wind (B), and the signal to open fire appeared at his mainmast head. Admiral Hughes having only eleven ships, the ' Bizarre,' according to the dispositions taken by the commander-in-chief, was to attack on the quarter the rear ship of the English fleet and double on it to leeward. At the moment when the first cannon-shots were heard, our worst sailers were not up with their stations. Breathing the letter, and not the spirit, of the com- modore's orders, the captains of these ships luffed at the same time as those which preceded them. Hence it resulted that the French line formed a curve (B), whose extremities were represented in the van by the ' Artesien ' and ' Vengeur,' and in the rear by the ' Bizarre,' ' Ajax,' and ' Severe.' In consequence, these ships were very far from those which corresponded to them in the enemy's line." It is evident from all this, written by a warm admirer of Suffren, who has had full access to the official papers, that 1 As always. 2 That is, turned their side to the enemy instead of approaching him. INJURIES OF THE TWO FLEETS. 441 the French chief intended an attack elementary in conception and difficult of execution. To keep a fleet on a line of bearing, sailing free, requires much drill, especially when the ships have different rates of speed, as had 8uffren's. The extreme injury suffered by the " Superbe " and " Monmouth," undeniably due to a concentration, cannot be attributed to Suffren's disposi- tions. " The injuries which the ' H^ros' received at the begin- ning of the action did not allow her to remain by the ' Superbe.' Not being able to back her topsails in time, the braces having been cut, she passed ahead, and was only stopped on the beam of the ' Monmouth.' " ^ This accounts for the suffering of the latter ship, already injured, and now contending with a much larger opponent. The " Superbe " was freed from Suffren only to be engaged by the next Frenchman, an equally heavy ship ; and when the " Monmouth " drifted or bore up, to leeward, the French flag-ship also drifted so that for a few moments she fired her stern guns into the "Superbe's" bow (C, d). The latter at the same time was engaged on the beam and quar- ter by two French ships, who, either with. or without signal, came up to shield their commodore. An examination of the list of casualties shows that the loss of the French was much more distributed among their ships than was the case with the English. No less than three of the latter escaped without a man killed, while of the French only one. The kernel of the action seems to have been in the somewhat fortuitous concentration of two French seventy- fours and one sixty-four on an English seventy-four and sixty- four. Assuming the ships to have been actually of the same force as their rates, the French brought, counting broadside only, one hundred and six guns against sixty-nine. Some unfavorable criticism was excited by the management of Admiral Hughes during the three days preceding the fight, because he refrained from attacking the French, although they were for much of the time to leeward with only one ship more than the English, and much separated at that. It was thought that he had the opportunity of beating them in detail.^ 1 Chevalier. ^ Annual Register, 1782. 442 CRITICISMS UPON HUGHES'S CONDUCT. The accounts accessible are too meagre to permit an accu- rate judgment upon this opinion, which probably reflected the mess-table and quarter-deck talk of the subordinate offi- cers of the fleet. Hughes's own report of the position of the two fleets is vague, and in one important particular directly contradictory to the French. If the alleged opportunity offered, the English admiral in declining to use it adhered to the resolve, with which he sailed, neither to seek nor shun the enemy, but to go directly to Trincomalee and land the troops and supplies he had on board. In other words, he was gov- erned in his action by the French rather than the English naval policy, of subordinating the attack of the enemy's fleet to the particular mission in hand. If for this reason he did allow a favorable chance of fighting to slip, he certainly had reason bitterly to regret his neglect, in the results of the battle which followed ; but in the lack of precise information the most interesting point to be noted is the impression made upon public and professional opinion, indicating how strongly the English held that the attack of the enemy's fleet was the first duty of an English admiral. It may also be said that he could hardly have fared worse by attacking than he did by allowing the enemy to become the assailant ; and certainly not worse than he would have fared had Suffren's captains been as good as his own. After the action, towards sunset, both squadrons anchored in fifteen fathoms of water, irregular soundings, three of the French ships taking the bottom on coral patches. Here they lay for a week two miles apart, refitting. Hughes, from the ruined condition of the " Monmouth," expected an attack ; but when Suffren had finished his repairs on the 19th, he got under way and remained outside for twenty-four hours, in- viting a battle which he would not begin. He realized the condition of the enemy so keenly as to feel the necessity of justifying his action to the Minister of Marine, which he did for eight reasons unnecessary to particularize here. The last was the lack of efficiency and hearty support on the part of his captains. ENFORCED INACTIVITY OF THE ENGLISH. 443 It is not likely that Suffren erred on the side of excessive caution. On the contrary, his most marked detect as a com- mander-in-chief was an ardor which, when in sight of the enemy, became impatience, and carried him at times into ac- tion hastily and in disorder. But if, in the details and exe- cution of his battles, in his tactical combinations, Suffren was at times foiled by his own impetuosity and the short-comings of most of his captains, in the general conduct of the cam- paign, in strategy, where the personal qualities of the com- mander-in-chief mainly told, his superiority was manifest, and achieved brilliant success. Then ardor showed itself in energy, untiring and infectious. The eagerness of his hot Provencal blood overrode difficulty, created resources out of destitution, and made itself felt through every vessel under his orders. No military lesson is more instructive nor of more enduring value than the rapidity and ingenuity with which he, without a port or supplies, continually refitted his fleet and took the field, while his slower enemy was dawdling over his repairs. The battle forced the English to remain inactive for six weeks, till the " Monmouth " was repaired. Unfortunately, Suffren's situation did not allow him to assume the offensive at once. He was short of men, provisions, and especially of spare spars and rigging. In an official letter after the action he wrote : " I have no spare stores to repair rigging ; the squadron lacks at least twelve spare topmasts." A convoy of supply-ships was expected at Point de Galles, which, with the rest of Ceylon, except Trincomalee, was still Dutch. He there- fore anchored at Batacalo, south of Trincomalee, a position in which he was between Hughes and outward-bound English ships, and was favorably placed to protect his own convoys, which joined him there. On the 3d of June he sailed for Tranquebar, a Danish possession, where he remained two or three weeks, harassing the English communications between Madras and the fleet at Trincomalee. Leaving there, he sailed for Cuddalore, to communicate with the commander of the land forces and Hyder Ali. The latter was found to be much 444 ENERGY SHOWN BY SUFFREN. discontented with the scanty co-operation of the French general. Suffren, however, had won his favor, and he expressed a wish to see him on his return from the expedition then in contem- plation ; for, true to his accurate instinct, the commodore was bent upon again seeking out the English fleet, after beating which he intended to attack Negapatam. There was not in him any narrowness of professional prejudice ; he kept always in view the necessity, both political and strategic, of nursing the alliance with the Sultan and establisliing control upon the seaboard and in the interior ; but he clearly recognized that the first step thereto was the control of the sea, by disabling the English fleet. The tenacity and vigor with which he followed this aim, amid great obstacles, joined to the clear sightedness with which he saw it, are the distinguishing merits of Suffren amid the crowd of French fleet-commanders, — his equals in courage, but trammelled by the bonds of a false tradition and the perception of a false objective. Hughes meantime, having rigged jury-masts to the " Mon- mouth," had gone to Trincomalee, where his squadron re- fitted and the sick were landed for treatment ; but it is evident, as has before been mentioned, that the English had not held the port long enough to make an arsenal or supply port, for he says, " I will be able to remast the ' Monmouth ' from the spare stores on board the several ships." His resources were nevertheless superior to those of his adversary. During the time that Suffren was at Tranquebar, worrying the English communications between Madras and Trincomalee, Hughes still stayed quietly in the latter port, sailing for Negapatam on the 23d of June, the day after Suffren reached Cuddalore. The two squadrons had thus again approached each other, and Suffren hastened his preparations for attack as soon as he heard that his enemy was where he could get at him. Hughes awaited his movement. Before sailing, however, Suffren took occasion to say in writing home : " Since my arrival in Ceylon, partly by the help of the Dutch, partly through the prizes we have taken, the squadron has been equipped for six months' service, and I SUFFREN'S MILITARY CHARACTER. 445 have rations of wheat and rice assured for more than a year." Tiiis achievement was indeed a just source of pride and self- congratulation. Without a port, and destitute of resources, the French commodore had lived off the enemy ; the store ships and commerce of the latter had supplied his wants. To his fertility of resource and the activity of his cruisers, inspired by himself, this result was due. Yet he had but two frigates, the class of vessel upon which an admiral must mainly depend for this predatory warfai'e. On the 23d of March, both provisions and stores had been nearly exhausted. Six thousand dollars in money, and the provisions in the con- voy, were then his sole resources. Since then he had fought a severe action, most expensive in rigging and men, as well as in ammunition. After that fight of April 12 he had left only powder and shot enough for one other battle of equal severity. Three months later he was able to report as above, that he could keep the sea on his station for six months without fur- ther supplies. This result was due wholly to himself, — to his self-reliance, and what may without exaggeration be called his greatness of soul. It was not expected at Paris ; on the con- trary, it was expected there that the squadron would return to the Isle of France to refit. It was not thought possible that it could remain on a hostile coast, so far from its nearest base, and be kept in efficient condition. Suffren thought otherwise ; he considered, with true military insight and a proper sense of the value of his own profession, that the success of the operations in India depended upon the control of the sea, and therefore upon the uninterrupted presence of his squadron. He did not shrink from attempting that which had always been thought impossible. This firmness of spirit, bearing the stamp of genius, must, to be justly appreciated, be considered with reference to the circumstances of his own time, and of the preceding generations in which he grew up. Suffren was born July 17, 1729, and served during the wars of 1739 and 1756. He was first under fire at Matthews's action off Toulon, February 22, 1744. He was the contempo- rary of D'Estaing, De Guichen, and De Grasse, before the 446 THE THIRD BATTLE BETWEEN days of the French Revolution, when the uprising of a people had taught men how often impossibilities are not impossible ; before Napoleon and Nelson had made a mock of tlie word. His attitude and action had therefore at tlie time the addi- tional merit of originality, but his lofty temper was capable of yet higher proof. Convinced of the necessity of keeping the squadron on its station, he ventured to disregard not only the murmurs of his officers but the express orders of the Court. When he reached Batacalo, he found despatches directing him to return to the Isle of France. Instead of taking them as a release from the great burden of responsi- bility, he disobeyed, giving his reasons, and asserting that he on the spot could judge better than a minister in Europe what the circumstances demanded. Such a leader deserved better subordinates, and a better colleague than he had in the commander of the forces on shore. Whether or no the con- ditions of the general maritime struggle would have permitted the overthrow of the English East Indian power may be doubt- ful ; but it is certain that among all the admirals of the three nations there was none so fitted to accomplish that result as Suffren. We shall find him enduring severer tests, and always equal to them. In the afternoon of the 5th of July Suffren's squadron came in sight of the English, ancliored off Cuddalore. An hour later, a sudden squall carried away the main and mizzen topmasts of one of the French ships. Admiral Hughes got under way, and the two fleets manoeuvred during the night. The following day the wind favored tlie English, and the opponents found themselves in line of battle on the starboard tack, heading south-southeast, with the wind at southwest. The disabled French ship having by unpardonable inactivity failed to re- pair her injuries, the numbers about to engage were equal, — eleven on each side. At eleven a. m. the English bore down to- gether and engaged ship against ship ; but as was usual under those conditions, the rear ships did not come to as close ac- tion as those ahead of them (Plate XVI., Position I.). Cap- tain Chevalier carefully points out that their failure was a fair 0 % 1 2 3 2 5 1 ] 2 3 } )d 1 11 = 0 U J 1 1 XJ } SUFFREN AND HUGHES. 447 offset to the failure of the French rear on the 12th of April,^ but fails to note in this connection that the French van, both on that occasion and again on the 3d of September, bungled as well as the rear. There can remain little doubt, in the mind of the careful reader, that most of the French captains were inferior, as seamen, to their opponents. During this i)art of the engagement the fourth ship in the French order, the " Brilliant" (a), lost her mainmast, bore up out of the line (a'), and dropped gradually astern and to leeward (a"). At one p. M., when the action was hottest, the wind sud- denly shifted to south-southeast, taking the ships on the port bow (Position II.). Four English ships, the " Burford," "Sultan" (s), "Worcester," and "Eagle," seeing the breeze coming, kept off to port, toward the French line ; the otliers were taken aback and paid off to starboard. The French ships, on the other hand, with two exceptions, the " Brilliant" (a) and " Severe" (b), paid off from the English. The effect of the change of wind was therefore to separate the main parts of the two squadrons, but to bring together between the lines four English and two French ships. Technical order was destroyed. The " Brilliant," having dropped far astern of her position, came under the fire of two of the English rear, the " Worcester" and the " Eagle," who had kept off in time and so neared the French. Suffren in person came to her assist- ance (Position III., a) and drove off the English, who were also threatened by the approach of two other French ships that had worn to the westward in obedience to signal. While this partial action was taking place, the other endangered French ship, the " Severe " (b), was engaged by the English " Sultan " (s), and, if the French captain M. de Cillart can be believed, 1 The British account differs materially as to the cause of the distance sepa- rating the two rears. "In this action it did not fall to the 'Monmouth's' lot to sustain a very considerable share, the enemy's rear being so far to leeward that the ships of the British rear could not, even whilst the v,-ind was favorable, close with tliem without considerably breaking the order of their own line " (Memoir of Captain Alms, Naval Chronicle, vol. ii). Such contradictions are common, and, except for a particular purpose, need not to be reconciled. Alms seems to have been not only a first-rate seaman, but an officer capable of resolute and independent action ; his account is probably correct. 448 THE ^^S^VME" STRIKES HER FLAG. by two other English ships. It is probable, from her place in the line, that the " Burford " also assailed her. However this may be, the " Severe " hauled down her flag ; but while the " Sultan " was wearing away from her, she resumed her fire, raking the English ship. The order to surrender, given by the French captain and carried into execution by the formal well-established token of submission, was disregarded by his subordinates, who fired upon their enemy while the flag was down. In effect, the action of the French ship amounted to using an infamous ruse de guerre ; but it would be unjust to say that this was intended. The positions of the different vessels were sucli that the " Sultan " could not have secured her prize ; other French ships were approaching and must have retaken it. The indignation of the French juniors at the weakness of their captain was therefore justified ; their refusal to be bound by it may be excused to men face to face with an unexpected question of propriety, in the heat of battle and under the sting of shame. Nevertheless, scrupulous good faith would seem to demand that their deliverance should be awaited from other hands, not bound by the action of their commander ; or at least that the forbearing assailant should not have suf- fered from them. The captain, suspended and sent home by Suffren, and cashiered by the king, utterly condemned him- self by his attempted defence : " When Captain de Cillart saw the French squadron drawing off, — for all the ships except the 'Brilliant' had fallen off on the other tack, — he thought it useless to prolong his defence, and liad the flag hauled down. The ships engaged with him immediately ceased their fire, and the one on the starboard side moved away. At this moment the ' Severe ' fell off to starboard and her sails filled ; Cap- tain de Cillart tlien ordered the fire to be resumed by his lower-deck guns, the only ones still manned, and he rejoined his squadron." ^ 1 Troude : Batailles Navales. It was seen from Suffren's ship that the " Se'vere's " flag was down ; but it was supposed that the ensign halliards had been shot away. The next day Hughes sent the captain of the " Sultan " to de- mand the delivery to him of the ship which had struck. The demand, of course, HUGHES'S MILITARY CHARACTER. 449 This action was the only one of the five fought by Suffren on the coast of India, in which the English admiral was the assailant. There can be found in it no indication of military conceptions, of tactical combinations ; but on the other hand Hughes is continually showing the aptitudes, habits of thought, and foresight of the skilful seaman, as well as a courage be- yond all proof. He was in truth an admirable representative of the average English naval officer of the middle of the eigh- teenth century ; and while it is impossible not to condemn the general ignorance of the most important part of the profession, it is yet useful to remark how far thorough mastery of its other details, and dogged determination not to yield, made up for so signal a defect. As the Roman legions often redeemed the blunders of their generals, so did English captains and seamen often save that which had been lost by the errors of their admirals, — errors which neither captain nor seamen rec- ognized, nor would probably have admitted. Nowhere were these solid qualities so clearly shown as in Suffren's battles, because nowhere else were such demands made upon them. No more magnificent instances of desperate yet useful resist- ance to overwhelming odds are to be found in naval annals, than that of the " Monmouth " on April 12, and of the " Exe- ter" on February 17. An incident told of the latter ship is worth quoting. "At the heel of the action, when the 'Exe- ter ' was already in the state of a wreck, the master came to Commodore King to ask him what he should do with the ship, as two of the enemy were again bearing down upon her. He laconically answered, ' there is nothing to be done but to fight her till she sinks.' " ^ She was saved. Suffren, on the contrary, was by this time incensed beyond endurance by the misbehavior of his captains. Cillart was sent home ; but besides him two others, both of them men of influential connections, and one a relative of Suffren himself, could not 1)0 complied with. "The 'Sultan,'" Troude says, "which had hove-to to take possession of the ' Se'vere,' was the victim of this action ; she received daring some time, without replying, the whole fire of the French ship." 1 Annual Register, 1782. 29 450 SUFFREN TAKES TRINCOMALEE. were dispossessed of their commands. However necessary and proper this step, few but Suffren would have had the reso- lution to take it; for, so far as he then knew, he was only a captain in rank, and it was not permitted even to admirals to deal thus with their juniors. "You may perhaps be angry, Monseigneur," he wrote, " that I have not used rigor sooner ; but I beg you to remember that the regulations do not give this power even to a general officer, which I am not." It is immediately after the action of the 6th of July that Suffren's superior energy and military capacity begin mark- edly to influence the issue between himself and Hughes. The tussle had been severe ; but military qualities began to tell, as they surely must. The losses of the two squadrons in men, in the last action, had been as one to three in favor of the English ; on the other hand, the latter had apparently suffered more in sails and spars, — in motive power. Both fleets anchored in the evening, the English off Negapatam, the French to leeward, off Cuddalore. On the 18th of July Suffren was again ready for sea ; whereas on the same day Hughes had but just decided to go to Madras to finish his repairs. Suffren was further delayed by the political neces- sity of an official visit to Hyder Ali, after which he sailed to Batacalo, arriving there on the 9th of August, to await reinforcements and supplies from France. On the 21st, these joined him ; and two days later he sailed, now with fourteen ships-of-the-line, for Trincomalee, anchoring off the town on the 25th. The following night the troops were landed, bat- teries thrown up, and tlie attack pressed with vigor. On the 80th and 31st the two forts which made the defensive strength of the place surrendered, and this all-important port passed into the hands of the French. Convinced that Hughes would soon appear, Suffren granted readily all the honors of war demanded by the governor of the place, con- tenting himself with the' substantial gain. Two days later, on the evening of September 2d, the English fleet was sighted by the French lookout frigates. During the six weeks in which Suffren had been so actively SUFFREN'S UNTIRING ACTIVITY. 451 and profitably employed, the English admiral had remained quietly at anchor, repairing; and refitting. No precise informa- tion is available for deciding how far this delay was unavoid- able ; but having in view the well-known aptitude of English seamen of that age, it can scarcely be doubted that, had Hughes possessed the untiring energy of his great rival, he could have gained the few days which decided the fate of Trincomalce, and fought a battle to save the place. In fact, this conclusion is supported by his own reports, which state that on the 12tli of August the ships were nearly fitted ; and yet, though apprehending an attack on Trincomalee, he did not sail until the 20th. The loss of this harbor forced him to abandon the east coast, which was made unsafe by the approach of the northeast monsoon, and conferred an important strategic advantage upon Suffren, not to speak of the political effect upon the native rulers in India. To appreciate thoroughly this contrast between the two admirals, it is necessary also to note how differently they were situated with regard to material for repairs. After the action of the 6th, Hughes found at Madras spars, cordage, stores, provisions, and material. Suffren at Cuddalore found nothing. To put his squadron in good fighting condition, nineteen new topmasts were needed, besides lower masts, yards, rigging, sails, and so on. To take the sea at all, the masts were removed from the frigates and smaller vessels, and given to the ships-of-the-line, while English prizes were stripped to equip the frigates. Ships were sent off to the Straits of Malacca to procure other spars and timber. Houses were torn down on shore to find lumber for repairing the hulls. The difficulties were increased by the character of the anchorage, an open roadstead with frequent heavy sea, and by the near presence of the English fleet ; but the work was driven on under the eyes of the commander-in-chief, who, like Lord Howe at New York, inspired the working parties by his constant appearance among them. " Notwithstanding his pro- digious obesity, Suffren displayed the fiery ardor of youth ; he was everywhere where work was going on. Under his 452 REINFORCEMENTS SENT FROM ENGLAND. powerful impulse, the most difficult tasks were done with in- credible rapidity. Nevertheless, his officers represented to him the bad state of the fleet, and the need of a port for the ships-of-the-line. 'Until we have taken Trincomalee,' he re- plied, 'the open roadsteads of the Coromandel coast will an- swer.' " 1 It was indeed to this activity on the Coromandel coast that the success at Trincomalee was due. The weapons with which Suffren fought are obsolete ; but the results wrought by his tenacity and fertility in resources are among the undying lessons of history. While the characters of the two chiefs were thus telling upon the strife in India, other no less lasting lessons were being afforded by tlie respective governments at liome, who did much to restore the balance between them. While the English ministry, after the news of the battle of Porto Pray a, fitted out in November, 1781, a large and compact expedition, convoyed by a powerful squadron of six ships-of-the-line, under the command of an active officer, to reinforce Hughes, the French despatched comparatively scanty succors in small detached bodies, relying apparently upon secrecy rather than upon force to assure their safety. Thus Suffren, while strug- gling with his innumerable embarrassments, had the morti- fication of learning that now one and now another of the small detachments sent to his relief were captured, or driven back to France, before they were clear of European waters. There was in truth little safety for small divisions north of the Straits of Gibraltar. Thus the advantages gained bj^ his activity were in the end sacrificed. Up to the fall of Trin- comalee the French were superior at sea ; but in the sis. months which followed, the balance turned the other way, by the arrival of the English reinforcements under Sir Richard Bickerton. With his usual promptness the French commodore had pre- pared for further immediate action as soon as Trincomalee surrendered. The cannon and men landed from the ships were at once re-embarked, and the port secured by a garrison ^ Cuuat : Vie de Suffren. HUGHES APPEARS OFF TRINCOMALEE. 453 strong enough to relieve him of any anxiety about holding it. This great seaman, who had done as much in proportion to the means intrusted to him as any known to history, and had so signally illustrated the sphere and influence of naval power, had no intention of fettering the movements of his fleet, or risking his important conquest, by needlessly taking upon the shoulders of the ships the burden of defending a seaport. When Hughes appeared, it was past the power of the English fleet by a single battle to reduce the now properly garrisoned post. Doubtless a successful campaign, by destroying or driving away the French sea power, would achieve this re- sult ; but Suffren might well believe that, whatever mishaps might arise on a single day, he could in the long run more than hold his own with his opponent. Seaports should defend themselves ; the sphere of the fleet is on the open sea, its object offence rather than defence, its objective the enemy's shipping wherever it can be found. Suffren now saw again before him the squadron on which depended the English control of the sea ; he knew that power- ful reinforcements to it must arrive before the next season, and he hastened to attack. Hughes, mortified by his failure to arrive in time, — for a drawn battle beforehand would have saved what a successful battle afterward could not regain, — was in no humor to balk him. Still, with sound judgment, he retreated to the southeast, flying in good order, to use Suffren's expression ; regulating speed by the slowest ships, and steering many different courses, so that the chase which began at daybreak overtook the enemy only at two in the afternoon. The object of the Englisli was to draw Suffren so far to leeward of the port that, if his ships were disabled, he could not easily regain it. The French numbered fourteen ships-of-the-line to twelve English. This superiority, together with his sound apprecia- tion of the military situation in India, increased Suffren's natural eagerness for action ; but his ships sailed badly, and were poorly handled by indifferent and dissatisfied men. These circumstances, during the long and vexatious pursuit. 454 THE FOURTH BATTLE BETWEEN chafed and fretted the hot temper of the commodore, which still felt the spur of urgency that for two months had quick- ened the operations of the squadron. Signal followed sig- nal, manoeuvre succeeded manoeuvre, to bring his disordered vessels into position. " Sometimes they edged down, some- times they brought to," says the English admiral, who was carefully watching their approach, " in no regular order, as if undetermined what to do." Still, Suffren continued on, and at two p. m., having been carried twenty-five miles away from his port, his line being then partly formed and within striking distance of the enemy, the signal was made to come to the wind to correct the order before finally bearing down. A number of blunders in executing this made matters worse rather than better; and the commodore, at last losing pa- tience, made signal thirty minutes later to attack (Plate XVII,, A), following it with another for close action at pis- tol range. This being slowly and clumsily obeyed, he ordered a gun fired, as is customary at sea to emphasize a signal ; unluckily this was understood by his own crew to be the opening of the action, and the flag-ship discharged all her battery. This example was followed by the other ships, though yet at the distance of half cannon-shot, which, under the gunnery conditions of that day, meant indecisive action. Thus at the end and as the result of a mortifying series of blunders and bad seamanship, the battle began greatly to the disadvantage of the French, despite their superior numbers. The English, who had been retreating under short and handy sail, were in good order and quietly ready ; whereas their enemies were in no order (B). Seven ships had forereached in rounding to,^ and now formed an irregular group ahead of the English van, as well as far from it, where they were of little service ; while in the centre a second confused group was formed, the ships overlapping and masking each other's fire.

A military operation could scarcely be worse carried out. The French ships in the battle did not support each other ; they were so grouped as to hamper their own fire and need- lessly increase the target offered to the enemy ; so far from concentrating their own effort, three ships were left, almost unsupported, to a concentrated fire from the English line.^ " Time passed on, and our three ships [B, a], engaged on the beam by the centre of the English fleet and raked [enfiladed] by van and rear, suffered greatly. After two hours the * H^ros' ' sails were in rags, all her running rigging cut, and she could no longer steer. The 'lllustre' had lost her mizzen-mast and maintopmast." In this disorder such gaps existed as to offer a great opportunity to a more active oppo- nent. " Had the enemy tacked now," wrote the chief-of-staff in his journal, " we would have been cut off and probably destroyed." The faults of an action in which every proper distribution was wanting are summed up in the results. The French had fourteen ships engaged. They lost eighty-two killed and two hundred and fifty-five wounded. Of this total, sixty-four killed and one hundred and seventy-eight wounded, or three fourths, fell to three ships. Two of these three lost their main and mizzen masts and foretopmast ; in other words, were helpless. This was a repetition on a larger scale of the disaster to two of Hughes's ships on the 12tli of April ; but on that day the English admiral, being to leeward and in smaller force, had to accept action on the adversary's terms, while here the loss fell on the assailant, who, to the advantage of the wind and choice of his mode of attack, added superiority in 1 The enemy formed a semiiircle aronml us and raked us ahead and astern, as the ship came up and fell off, witli the helm to leeward. — Joarnal de Bord du Bailli de SuJ^'ren. ^■)6 CONTRAST BETWEEN HUGHES AND SUFFREN. numbers. Full credit must in this action be allowed to Hughes, who, though laciving in enterprise and giving no token of tactical skill or coup d'oeil, showed both judgment and good management in the direction of his retreat and in keeping his ships so well in hand. It is not easy to ap- portion the blame which rests upon his enemies. Suffren laid it freely upon his captains.^ It has been rightly pointed out, however, that many of the officers thus condemned in mass had conducted themselves well before, both under Suf- fren and other admirals ; that the order of pursuit was irregular, and Suffren's signals followed each other with confusing rapidity ; and finally that chance, for which gome- thing must always be allowed, was against the French, as was also the inexperience of several captains. It is pretty certain that some of the mishap must be laid to the fiery and inconsiderate haste of Suffren, who had the defects of his great qualities, upon which his coy and wary antagonist unwittingly played. It is noteworthy that no complaints of his captains are to be found in Hughes's reports. Six fell in action, and of each he speaks in terms of simple but evidently sincere apprecia- tion, while on the survivors he often bestows particular as well as general commendation. The marked contrast be- tween the two leaders, and between the individual ship-com- manders, on either side, makes this singularly instructive among naval campaigns ; and the ultimate lesson taught is in entire accordance with the experience of all military 'his- tory from the beginning. Suffren had genius, energy, great tenacity, sound military ideas, and was also an accomplished seaman. Hughes had apparently all the technical acquire- ments of the latter profession, would probably have com- manded a ship equally well with any of his captains, but shows no trace of the qualities needed by a general officer. On the other hand, without insisting again upon the skill and fidelity of the English subordinates, it is evident that, 1 See page 435. He added : " It is frightful to have had four times in our power to destroy the English squadron, and that it still exists." FRENCH SHIPS WRECKED. 457 to whatever it be attributed, the French single ships were as a rule incomparably worse-handled than those of their oppo- nents. Four times, Suffren claims, certainly thrice, the Enf- lish squadron was saved from overwhelming disaster by the difference in quality of the under officers. Good ti-oops have often made amends for bad generalship ; but in the end the better leader will prevail. This was conspicuously the case in the Indian seas in 1782 and 1783. War cut short the strife, but not before the issue was clearly indicated. The action of September 3, like that of July 6, was brought to a close by a shift of wind to the southeast. When it came, the English line wore, and formed again on the other tack. The French also wore ; and their van shi})s, being now to windward, stood down between their crippled ships and the enemy's line (C). Toward sundown Hughes hauled off to the northward, abandoning the hope of regaining Trincoma- lee, but with the satisfaction of having inflicted this severe retaliation upon his successful opponent. That firmness of mind which was not the least of Suffren's qualities was severely tried soon after the action cff Trin- comalee. In returning to port, a seventy -four, the " Orient," was run ashoi'e and lost by mismanagement, the only con- solation being that her spars were saved for the two dismasted ships. Other crippled masts were replaced as before by rob- bing the frigates, whose crews also were needed to replace the losses in battle. Repairs were pushed on with the usual energy, the defence of the port was fully provided for, and on the 30th of September the squadron sailed for the Coromandel coast, where the state of French interests urgently called for it. Cuddalore was reached in four days ; and here another incapable officer wrecked the " Bizarre," of sixty-four guns, in picking up his anchorage. In consequence of the loss of these two ships, Suffren, when he next met the enemy, could oppose only fifteen to eighteen ships-of-the-line ; so much do general results depend upon individual ability and care. Hughes was at Madras, ninety miles north, whither he had gone at once after the late action. He reports his ships badly 458 APPROACH OF THE BAD SEASON. damaged ; but the loss was so evenly distributed among them that it is difficult to justify his failure to follow up the in- juries done to the French. At this season the monsoon wind, which has come for four or five months from southwest, changes to northeast, blow- ing upon the east coast of the peninsula, where are no good harbors. The consequent swell made the shore often unap- proachable, and so forbade support from fleet to army. The change of the monsoon is also frequently marked by violent hurricanes. The two commanders, tlierefore, had to quit a region where their stay might be dangerous as well as useless. Had Trincomalee not been lost, Hughes, in the condition of his squadron, might have awaited there the reinforcements and supplies expected soon from England ; for although the port is not healthy, it is secure and well situated. Bickerton had already reached Bombay, and was on his way now to Madras with five ships-of-the-line. As things were, Hughes thought necessary to go to Bombay for the season, sailing or rather being driven to sea by a hurricane, on the 17th of October. Four days later Bicker- ton reached Madras, not having fallen in with the admiral. With an activity which characterized him he sailed at once, and was again in Bombay on the 28th of November, Hughes's ships, scattered and crippled by tempest, dropped in one by one, a few days later. Suffren held Trincomalee, yet his decision was not easy. The port was safe, he had not to fear an attack by the Eng- lish fleet ; and on the other hand, besides being sickly during the approaching monsoon, it was doubtful whether the pro- visions needed for the health of the crews could be had there. In short, though of strategic value from its strength and posi- tion, the port was deficient in resources. Opposed to Trin- comalee there was an alternative in Achem, a harbor on the other side of the Bay of Bengal, at the west end of the island of Sumatra. This was healthy, could supply provisions, and, from its position with reference to the northeast monsoon, would permit ships to regain the Coromandel coast sooner MILITARY SITUATION IN INDIA. 459 than those in Bombay, when the milder ending of the season made landing more practicable. These simple considerations were not, however, the only elements in the really difficult problem before Suffrcn. The small results that followed this campaign must not hide the fact that great issues were possible, and that much might depend upon his decision. Owing to the French policy of sending out reinforcements in several small bodies, not only was there much loss, but great uncertainty prevailed among the scattered commands as to conditions elsewhere. This uncertainty, loss, and delay profoundly affected the political situation in India. When Suffren first reached the coast, the English had on their hands not only Hyder Ali, but the Mah- rattas as well. Peace with the latter was signed on the 17th of May, 1782 ; but, owing probably to an opposition party among them, the ratifications were not exchanged until December. Both there and in the court of Hyder Ali there was division of interest ; and representations were made from both to the French, who, though suspicious, could obtain no certain in- formation of the treaty, that everything depended upon the relative military strength of themselves and the English. The presence and the actions of Suffren were all that France had to show, — the prestige of his genius, the capture of Trin- comalee, his success in battle. The French army, cooped up in Cuddalore, was dependent upon the sultan for money, for food, and for reinforcements ; even the fleet called on him for money, for masts, for ammunition, for grain. The Eng- lish, on the other hand, maintained their ground ; though on the whole worsted, they lost no ships ; and Bickerton's power- ful squadron was known to have reached Bombay. Above all, while the French asked for money, the English lavished it. It was impossible for the French to make head against their enemy without native allies ; it was essential to keep Hyder from also making peace. Here the inadequate sup- port and faulty dispositions of the home government made themselves felt. The command in India, both by land and sea, was intrusted to General de Bussy, once the brilliant 4G0 SUFFREN GOES TO ACHEM. fellow-worker with Dupleix, now a gouty invalid of sixty- four. With a view to secrecy, Bussy sailed from Cadiz in November, 1781, with two ships-of-the-line, for Teneriffe, where he was to be joined by a convoy leaving Brest in De- cember. This convoy was captured by the English, only two of the vessels escaping to Bussy. The latter pursued his journey, and learning at the Cape of Good Hope that Bickerton's strong force was on the way, felt compelled to land there a great part of his troops. He reached the Isle of France on the 31st of May. The next convoy of eighteen transports, sailing in April for India, was also intercepted. Two of the four ships-of-war were taken, as also ten of the transports ; the remainder returned to Brest. A third detach- ment was more fortunate, reaching the Cape in May ; but it was delayed there two months by the wretched condition of the ships and crews. These disappointments decided Bussy to remain at the Island until joined by the expected ships from the Cape, and Suffren at this critical moment did not know what the state of things there was. The general had only written him that, as he could not reach the coast before the bad season, he should rendezvous at Achem. These uncertainties made a painful impression upon Hyder Ali, who had been led to expect Bussy in September, and had instead received news of Bickerton's arrival and the defec- tion of his old allies, the Mahrattas. Suffren was forced to pretend a confidence which he did not feel, but which, with the influence of his own character and achievements, determined the sultan to continue the war. This settled, the squadron sailed for Achem on the 15th of October, anchoring there the 2d of November. Three weeks afterward a vessel arrived from Bussy, with word that his departure was indefinitely delayed by an epi- demic raging among the troops. Suffren therefore deter- mined to hasten his own return to the coast, and sailed on the 20th of December. January 8, 1783, he anchored off Ganjam, five hundred miles northeast of Cuddalore, whence he would have a fair wind to proceed when he wished. It SUFFREN RETURNS TO TRINCOMALEE. 461 was his purpose to attack not only the coasting vessels but the English factories on shore as well, the surf being now often moderate ; but learning on the 12th, from an English prize, the important and discouraging news of Plyder All's death, he gave up all minor operations, and sailed at once for Cuddalore, hoping to secure by his presence the continuance of the alliance as well as the safety of the garrison. He reached the place on the 6th of February. During his four months absence the failure of Bussy to appear with his troops, and the arrival of Bickerton, who had shown himself on both coasts, had seriously injured the French cause. Tlie treaty of peace between the English and the Mahrattas had been ratified ; and the former, released from this war and reinforced, had attacked the sultan on the west, or Malabar, coast. The effect of this diversion was of course felt on the east coast, despite the efforts of the French to keep the new sultan there. The sickness among the troops at the Isle of France had, however, ceased early in Novem- ber ; and had Bussy then started without delay, he and Suf- fren would now have met in the Carnatic, with full command of the sea and large odds in their favor ashore. Hughes did not arrive till two months later. Being thus alone, Suffren, after communicating with Tippoo- Saib, the new sultan of Mysore, went to Trincomalee ; and there he was at last joined, on the 10th of March, by Bussy, accompanied by three ships-of-the-line and numerous trans- ports. Eager to bring the troops into the field, Suffren sailed on the 15th with his fastest ships, and landed them the next day at Porto Novo. He returned to Trincomalee on the 11th of April, and fell in with Hughes's fleet of seventeen ships-of- the-line off the harbor's mouth. Having only part of his force with him, no fight ensued, and the English went on to Madras. The southwest monsoon was now blowing. It is not necessary to follow the trivial operations of the next two months. Tippoo being engaged on the other side of the peninsula and Bussy displaying little vigor, while Hughes was in superior force off' the coast, the affairs of the 462 ENGLISH SIEGE OF CUDDALORE. French on shore went from bad to worse. Suffren, having but fifteen ships to eighteen English, was unwilling to go to leeward of Trincomalee, lest it should fall before he could return to it. Under these conditions the English troops ad- vanced from Madras, passing near but around Cuddalore, and encamped to the southward of it, by the sea. The supply- ships and light cruisers were stationed off the shore near the army ; while Admiral Hughes, with the heavy ships, an- chored some twenty miles south, where, being to windward, he covered the others. In order to assure to Suffren the full credit of his subse- quent course, it is necessary to emphasize the fact that Bussy, though commander-in-chief both by land and sea, did not venture to order him to leave Trincomalee and come to his support. Allowing him to feel the extremity of the danger, he told him not to leave port unless he heard that the army was shut up in Cuddalore, and blockaded by the English squadron. This letter was received on the 10th of June. Suffren waited for no more. The next day he sailed, and forty-eight hours later his frigates saw the English fleet. The same day, the loth, after a sharp action, the French army was shut up in the town, behind very weak walls. Everything now depended on the action of the fleets. Upon Suffren' s appearance, Hughes moved away and an- chored four or five miles from the town. Baffling winds prevailed for three days ; but the monsoon resuming on the I6tli, Suffren approached. The English admiral not liking to accept action at anchor, and to leeward, in which he was right, got under way ; but attaching more importance to the weather-gage than to preventing a junction between the ene- my's land and sea forces, he stood out into the offing with a southerly, or south-southeast wind, notwithstanding his su- perior numbers. Suffren formed on the same tack, and some manoeuvring ensued during that night and the next day. At eight P. M. of the 17th the French squadron, which had refused to be drawn to sea, anchored off Cuddalore and com- municated with the commander-in-chief. Twelve hundred NEWS OF THE PEACE REACHES INDIA. 4G3 of the garrison were liastily embarked to fill the iiiiiuerous vacancies at the guns of the lieet. Until the 20th the wind, holding unexpectedly at west, de- nied Hughes the advantage Avliich he sought ; and finally on that day he decided to accept action and await the attack. It was made by Suffren with fifteen ships to eighteen, the fire opening at quarter-past four p. m. and lasting until half- ];ast six. The loss on both sides was nearly equal; but the English ships, abandoning both the field of battle and their army, returned to Madras. Suffren anchored before Cuddalore. The embarrassment of the British army was now very great. The supply-ships on which it had depended fled be- fore the action of the 20th, and the result of course made it impossible for them to return. The sultan's light cavalry harassed their communications by land. On th(3 25th, the general commanding wrote that his " mind was on the rack without a moment's rest since the departure of the fleet, considering the character of M. de Suffren, and the infinite superiority on the part of the French now that we are left to ourselves." From this anxiety he was relieved by the news of the conclusion of peace, which reached Cuddalore on the 29th by flag-of-truce from Madras. If any doubt had remained as to the relative merits of the two sea-commanders, the last few days of their campaign would have removed them. Hughes alleges the number of his sick and shortness of water as his reasons for abandon- ing the contest. Suffrcn's difficulties, however, were as great as his own ; ^ and if he had an advantage at Trincomalee, that only shifts the dispute a step back, for he owed its pos- session to superior generalship and activity. The simple facts that with fifteen ships he forced eighteen to abandon a blockade, relieved the invested army, strengthened his own crews, and fought a decisive action, make an impression which 1 There was not a single ship of Suffren's which had more than three- fourths of her regular complement of men.

Although the tidings of peace sent by Hughes to Bussy rested only upon unofficial letters, they were too positive to justify a continuance of bloodshed. An arrangement was entered into by the authorities of the two nations in India, and hostilities ceased on the 8th of July. Two months later, at Pondi cherry, the official despatches reached Suifren. His own words upon them are worth quoting, for they show the depressing convictions under which he had acted so noble a part : " God be praised for the peace ! for it was clear that in India, though we had the means to impose the law, all would have been lost. I await your orders with impatience, and heartily pray they may permit me to leave. War alone can make bearable the. weariness of certain things." On the 6th of October, 1783, Suffren finally sailed from Trincomalee for France, stopping at the Isle of France and the Cape of Good Hope. The homeward voyage was a con- tinued and spontaneous ovation. In each port visited the most flattering attentions were paid by men of every degree and of every nation. What especially gratified him was the homage of the English captains. It might well be so ; none had so clearly established a right to his esteem as a warrior. On no occasion when Hughes and Suffren met, save the last, did the English number over twelve ships ; but six English captains had laid down their lives, obstinately opposing his efforts. While he was at the Cape, a division of nine of Hughes's ships, returning from the war, anchored in the 1 You will have learned mj promotion to commodore and rear-admiral.

You know the capture and battle of Trincomalee ; but the end of the cam- paign, and that which took place between the month of March and the end of June, is far above anything that has been done in the navy since I entered it. The result has been very advantageous to the State, for the squadron was endan- gered and the army lost. — Priimte Letter of Suffren, Sept. 13, 1783; quoted in the " Journal rJe Bord du Bailli de Sxiffren." MILITARY QUALITIES OF SUFFUEN. 4(J5 harbor. Their captains called eagerly upon the admiral, the stout Commodore King of the " Exeter " at their head. " The good Dutchmen have received me as their savior," wrote Suffren ; " but among the tributes Avhich have most flattered me, none has given me more pleasure than the esteem and consideration testified by the English who are here." On reaching home, rewards were heaped upon him. Having left France as a captain, he came back a rear- admiral ; and immediately after his return the king created a fourth vice-admiralship, a special post to be filled by Suffren, and to lapse at his death. These honors were won by himself alone ; they were the tribute paid to his un- yielding energy and genius, shown not only in actual fight but in the steadfastness which held to his station through every discouragement, and rose equal to every demand made by recurring want and misfortune. Alike in the general conduct of his operations and on the battlefield under the fire of the enemy, this lofty resolve was the distinguishing merit of Suffren ; and when there is coupled with it the clear and absolute conviction which he held of the necessity to seek and crush the enemy's fleet, we have probably the leading traits of his military character. The latter was the light that led him, the former the spirit that sustained him. As a tactician, in the sense of a driller of ships, imparting to them uniformity of action and manoeu- vring, he seems to have been deficient, and would probably himself have admitted, with some contempt, the justice of the criticism made upon him in these respects. Whether or no he ever actually characterized tactics — meaning thereby elementary or evolutionary tactics — as the veil of timidity, there was that in his actions which makes the mot probable. Such a contempt, however, is unsafe even in the case of genius. The faculty of moving together with uniformity and precision is too necessary to the development of the full power of a body of ships to Le lightly esteemed ; it is essen- tial to that concentration of effort at which Suffren rightly aimed, but which he was not always careful to secure by pre- 30 4G6 LATER CAREER OF SUFFREN. vious dispositions. Paradoxical though it sounds, it is true that only fleets which are able to perform regular movements can afford at times to cast them aside ; only captains whom the habit of the drill-ground has familiarized with the shift- ing phases it presents, can be expected to seize readily the opportunities for independent action presented by the field of battle. Howe and Jervis must make ready the way for the successes of Nelson. Suffren expected too much of his cap- tains. He had the right to expect more than he got, but not that ready perception of the situation and that firmness of nerve which, except to a few favorites of Nature, are the re- sult only of practice and experience. Still, he was a very great man. When every deduction has been made, there must still remain his heroic constancy, his fearlessness of responsibility as of danger, the rapidity of his action, and the genius whose unerring intuition led him to break through the traditions of his service and assert for the navy that principal part which befits it, that offensive action which secures the control of the sea by the destruc- tion of the enemy's fleet. Had he met in his lieutenants such ready instruments as Nelson found prepared for him, there can be little doubt that Hughes's squadron would have been destroyed while inferior to Suffren's, before re- inforcements could have arrived ; and with the English fleet it could scarcely have failed that the Coromandel coast also would have fallen. What effect this would have had upon the fate of the peninsula, or upon the terms of the peace, can only be surmised. His own hope was that, by acquiring the superiority in India, a glorious peace might result. No further opportunities of distinction in war were given to Suffren. The remaining years of his life were spent in honored positions ashore. In 1788, upon an appearance of trouble with England, he was appointed to the command of a great fleet arming at Brest ; but before he could leave Paris he died suddenly on the 8th of December, in the six- tieth year of his age. There seems to have been no suspicion LATER CAREER OF SUFFREX. 467 at the time of other than natural causes of death, he bchig exceedingly stout and of apoplectic temperament ; but many years after a story, apparently well-founded, became current that he was killed in a duel arising out of his oflicial action in India. His old antagonist on the battlefield, Sir Edward Hughes, died at a great age in 1794. CHAPTER XIII. Events in the West Indies after the Surrender of Yorktown. — Encounters of De Grasse with Hood. — The Sea Battle OF THE Saints. — 1781, 1782. THE surrender of Cornwallis marked the end of the active war upon the American continent. The issue of the struggle was indeed assured upon the day when France de- voted her sea power to the support of the colonists ; but, as not uncommonly happens, the determining characteristics of a period were summed up in one striking event. From the beginning, the military question, owing to the physical characteristics of the country, a long seaboard with estuaries penetrating deep into the interior, and the consequent greater ease of movement by water than by land, had hinged upon the control of the sea and the use made of that control. Its misdirection by Sir William Howe in 1777, when he moved his army to the Chesapeake instead of supporting Burgoyne's advance, opened the way to the startling success at Saratoga, when amazed Europe saw six thousand regular troops surrendering to a body of provincials. During the four years that followed, until the surrender of Yorktown, the scales rose and fell according as the one navy or the other appeared on the scene, or as English commanders kept touch with the sea or pushed their operations far from its support. Finally, at the great crisis, all is found depend- ing upon the question whether the French or the English fleet should first appear, and upon their relative force. The maritime struggle was at once transferred to the West Indies. The events which followed there were ante- cedent in time both to Suffren's battles and to the final relief of Gibraltar ; but they stand so much by themselves as ATTACK ON ISLAND OF ST. CHRISTOPHER. 469 to call for separate treatment, and have such close relation to the conclusion of the war and the conditions of peace, as to form the dramatic finale of the one and the stepping- stone of transition to the other. It is fitting indeed that a brilliant though indecisive naval victory should close the story of an essentially naval war. The capitulation of Yorktown was completed on the 19th of October, 1781, and on the 5th of November, De Grassc, resisting the suggestions of Lafayette and Washington that the fleet should aid in carrying the war farther south, sailed from the Chesapeake. He reached Martinique on the 26th, the day after the Marquis de Bouill^, commanding the French troops in the West Indies, had regained by a bold surprise the Dutch island of St. Eustatius. The two commanders now concerted a joint expedition against Barbadoes, which was frustrated by the violence of the trade winds. Foiled here, the French proceeded against the island of St. Christopher, or St. Kitt's (Plate XVIII.). On the 11th of January, 1782, the fleet, carrying six thousand troops, anchored on the w^est coast off Basse Terre, the chief town. No opposition was met, the small garrison of six hundred men retiriug to a fortified post ten miles to the northwest, on Brimstone Hill, a solitary precipitous height overlooking the lee shore of the island. The French troops landed and pursued, but the position being found too strong for assault, siege operations were begun. The French fleet remained at anchor in Basse Terre road. Meanwhile, news of the attack was carried to Sir Samuel Hood, who had followed De Grasse from the continent, and, in the continued absence of Rodney, was naval commander- in-chief on the station. He sailed from Barbadoes on the 14th, anchored at Antigua on the 21st, and there embarked all the troops that could be spared, — about seven hundred men. On the afternoon of the 23d the fleet started for St. Kitt's, carrying such sail as would bring it within striking distance of the enemy at daylight next morning. The English having but twenty-two ships to the French 470 HOOD AND DE GRASSE twenty-nine, and the latter being generally superior in force, class for class, it is necessary to mark closely the lay of the land in order to understand Hood's original plans and their subsequent modifications ; for, resultless as his attempt proved, his conduct during the next three weeks forms the most brilliant military effort of the whole war. The islands of St. Kitt's and Nevis (Plates XVIII. and XIX.) being sep- arated only by a narrow channel, impracticable for ships-of- the-line, are in effect one, and their common axis lying northwest and southeast, it is necessary for sailing-ships, with the trade wind, to round the southern extremity of Nevis, from which position the wind is fair to reach all anchorages on the lee side of the islands. Basse Terre is about twelve miles distant from the western point of Nevis (Fort Charles), and its roadstead lies east and west. Tlie French fleet were anchored there in disorder (Plate XYIII., A), three or four deep, not expecting attack, and the ships at the west end of the road could not reach those at the east without beating to windward, — a tedious, and under fire a perilous process. A further most important point to note is that all the east- ern ships were so placed that vessels approaching from the southward could reach them with the usual wind. Hood, therefore, w^e arc told, intended to appear at early daylight, in order of and ready for battle, and fall upon the eastern ships, filing by them with his whole fleet (a, a'), thus concentrating the fire of all upon a few of the enemy ; then turning away, so as to escape the guns of the others, he proposed, first wearing and then tacking, to keep his fleet circling in long procession (a', a") past that part of the enemy's ships chosen for attack. The plan was audacious, but undeniably sound in principle ; some good could hardly fail to follow, and unless De Grasse showed more readiness than he had hitherto done, even decisive results might be hoped for.i 1 The curve, a, a', a", represents the line which Hood proposed to follow with his fleet, the wind being supposed east-southeast. The positions B, B, B, refer to the proceedings of a subsequent day and have nothing to do with the diagram at A. 2 1 9- 1 1 2 1 2 5 J 8 1 3 1 2 6 0 0 L 0 1 Jui 8 3 AT ST. CHRISTOPHER. 47 1 The best-laid plans, however, may fail, and Hood's was balked by the awkwardness of a lieutenant of the watch, who hove-to (stopped) a frigate at night ahead of the fleet, and was consequently run down by a ship-of-the-line. The latter also received such injury as delayed the movement, several hours being lost in repairing damages. The French were thus warned of the enemy's approach, and although not suspecting his intention to attack, De Grasse feared that Hood would pass down to leeward of him and disturb the siege of Brimstone Hill, — an undertaking so rash for an inferior force that it is as difficult to conceive how he could have supposed it, as to account for his overlooking the weakness of his own position at anchor. At one P.M. of the 24th the English fleet was seen rounding the south end of Nevis ; at three De Grasse got under way and stood to the southward. Toward sundown Hood also went about and stood south, as though retreating ; but he was well to windward of his opponent, and maintained this ad- vantage through the night. At daybreak both fleets were to leeward of Nevis, — the English near the island, the French about nine miles distant (Plate XIX.). Some time was spent in manoeuvring, with the object on Hood's part of get- ting the French admiral yet more to leeward ; for, having failed in his first attempt, he had formed the yet bolder intention of seizing the anchorage his unskilful opponent had left, and establishing himself there in an impregnable manner. In this he succeeded,, as will be shown ; but to understand the justification for a movement confessedly haz- ardous, it must be pointed out that he thus would place himself between the besiegers of Brimstone Hill and their fleet ; or, if the latter anchored near the hill, the Eng- lish fleet would be between it and its base in Martinique, ready to intercept supplies or detachments approaching from the southward. In short, the position in which Hood hoped to establish himself was on the flank of the enemy's com- munications, a position the more advantageous because the island alone could not long support the large body of troops 472 HOOD AND DE GRASSE SO suddenly thrown upon it. Moreover, both fleets were expecting reinforcements ; Rodney was on his way and might arrive first, which he did, and in time to save St. Kitt's, which he did not. It was also but four months since York- town ; the affairs of England were going badly ; something must be done, something left to chance, and Hood knew himself and his officers. It may be added that he knew his opponent. At noon, when the hillsides of Nevis were covered with expectant and interested sightseers, the English fleet rapidly formed its line on the starboard tack and headed nortli for Basse Terre (Plate XIX., A, A'). The French, at the moment, were in column steering south, but went about at once and stood for the enemy in a bow-and-quarter line ^ (A, A). At two the British had got far enough for Hood to make signal to anchor. At twenty minutes past two the van of the French came within gunshot of the English centre (B, B, B), and shortly afterward the firing began, the assailants very properly directing their main effort upon the English rear ships, which, as happens with most long columns, had opened out, a tendency increased in this case by the slowness of the fourth ship from the rear, the " Pru- dent." The French flag-ship, " Ville de Paris," of one hun- dred and twenty guns, bearing De Grasse's flag, pushed for the gap thus made, but was foiled by the " Canada," seventy- four, whose captain, Cornwallis, the brother of Lord Corn- wallis, threw all his sails aback, and dropped down in front of the huge enemy to the support of the rear, — an example nobly followed by the "Resolution" and the "Bedford" im- mediately ahead of him (a). The scene was now varied and animated in the extreme. The English van, which had escaped attack, was rapidly anchoring (b) in its appointed position. The commander-in-chief in the centre, proudly reliant upon the skill and conduct of his captains, made ^ When a fleet is in line ahead, close to the wind, on one tack, and the ships go about together, they will, on the other tack, be on the same line, but not one ahead of the other.

CnRTSTOPIIER. 473 signal for the ships ahead to cany a press of sail, and g-ain their positions regardless of the danger to the threat- ened rear. The latter, closely pressed and outnumbered, stood on unswervingly, shortened sail, and came to anchor, one by one, in a line ahead (B, B'), under the roar of the guns of their bafilcd enemies. The latter filed by, delivered their fire, and bore off again to the southward, leaving their former berths to their weaker but clever antagonists. The anchorage thus brilliantly taken by Hood was not exactly the same as that held by De Grasse the day before ; but as it covered and controlled it, his claim that he took up the place the other had left is substantially correct. The following night and morning were spent in changing and strengthening the order, which was finally established as follows (Plate XVIIL, B, B'). The van ship was anchored about four miles southeast from Basse Terre, so close to the shore that a ship could not pass inside her, nor, with the prevailing wind, even reach her, because of a point and shoal just outside, covering her position. From this point the line extended in a west-northwest direction to the twelfth or thirteenth ship (from a mile and a quarter to a mile and a half), where it turned gradually but rapidly to north, the last six ships being on a north and south line. Hood's flag-ship, the " Barfleur," of ninety guns, was at the apex of the salient angle thus formed. It would not have been impossible for the French fleet to take the anchorage they formerly held ; but it and all others to leeward were forbidden by the considerations al- ready stated, so long as Plood remained where he was. It became necessary therefore to dislodge him, but this was rendered exceedingly difficult by the careful tactical dis- positions that have been described. His left flank Avas covered by the shore. Any attempt to enfilade his front by passing along the other flank was met by the broadsides of the six or eight ships drawn up en potence to the rear. The front commanded the approaches to Basse Terre. To attack him in the rear, from the northwest, was forbidden 474 HOOD AND DE GRASSE by the trade-wind. To these difficulties was to be added that the attack must be made under sail against ships at anchor, to whom loss of spars would be of no immediate concern ; and which, having springs ^ out, could train their broadsides over a large area with great ease. Nevertheless, both sound policy and mortification impelled De Grasse to fight, which he did the next day, January 26. The method of attack, in single column of twenty-nine ships against a line so carefully arranged, was faulty in the ex- treme ; but it may be doubted whether any commander of that day would have broken through the traditional fighting order.2 Hood had intended the same, but he hoped a sur- prise on an ill-ordered enemy, and at the original French anchorage it was possible to reach their eastern ships, with but slight exposure to concentrated fire. Not so now. The French formed to the southward and steered for the eastern flank of Hood's line. As their van ship drew up with the point already mentioned, the wind headed her, so that she could only reach the third in the English order, the first four ships of which, using their springs, concentrated their guns upon her. This vessel was supposed by the English to be the " Pluton," and if so, her captain was D' Albert de Rions, in Suffren's opinion the foremost officer of the French navy. " The crash occasioned by their destructive broad- sides," wrote an English officer who was present, " was so tremendous that whole pieces of plank were seen flying from her off side ere she could escape the cool, concentrated fire of her determined adversaries. As she proceeded along the British line, she received the first fire of every ship in ^ A spring is a rope taken from the stern or qiaarter of a ship at anchor, to an anchor properly placed, by which means the ship can be turned in a desired direction. 2 In the council of war of the allied fleets on the expediency of attacking the English squadron anchored at Torbay (p. 408) an opponent of the measure urged " that the whole of the combined fleets could not bear down upon the English in a line-of-battle abreast, that of course they must form the line-of-battle ahead, and go down upon the enemy singly, by which they would run the greatest risk of being shattered and torn to pieces," etc. (Beatson, vol. v. p. 396). AT ST. CHRISTOPHER. 475 passing. She was indeed in so sliattcred a state as to be compelled to bear away for St. Eustatius." And so ship after ship passed bj, running the length of the line (Plate XVIIL, B, B), distributing their successive fires in gallant but dreary, ineffectual monotony over the whole e-\tent. A second time that day De Grasse attacked in the same order, but neglecting the English van, directed his effort upon the rear and centre. This was equally fruitless, and seems to have been done with little spirit. From that time until the 14th of February, Hood maintained his position in sight of the French fleet, which remained cruising in the offing and to the southward. On the 1st a despatch vessel arrived from Kempenfeldt, informing him of the dispersal of the French reinforcements for the West Indies, which must have renewed his hopes that his bold attempt would be successful through Rodney's arrival. It was not, however, to be so. Brimstone Hill surrendered on the 12th, after a creditable defence. On the 13th De Grasse took his fleet, now amounting to thirty-three ships-of-the-line, to Nevis, and anchored there. On the night of the 14th Hood summoned all his captains on board, had them set their watches by his, and at eleven p. m., one after another, without noise or signal, cut their cables and made sail to the northward, passing round that end of the island un- noticed, or at least unmolested, by the French. Both strategically and tactically Hood's conceptions and dispositions were excellent, and their execution was most honorable to the skill and steadiness of himself and his cap- tains. Regarded as a single military operation, this was brilliant throughout ; but when considered with reference to the general situation of England at the time, a much higher estimate must be formed of the admiral's qualities.^ St. Kitt's 1 In war, as in cards, the state of the score must at times dictate the play ; and the chief who never takes into consideration tlie effect which his particular action will have on the general result, nor what is demanded of him by the condition of things elsewhere, both political and military, lacks an essential quality of a great general. "The audacious manner in which AVellington stormed the re- doubt of Francisco [at Ciudad Rodrigo], and broke ground on the first night of 47G CRITICISM OF DE GRASSE'S ACTION. in itself might not be worth a great risk ; but it was of the first importance that energy and audacity should be carried into the conduct of England's naval war, that some great success should light upon her flag. Material success was not obtained. The chances, though fair enough, turned against Hood ; but every man in that fleet must have felt the glow of daring achievement, the assured confidence which follows a great deed nobly done. Had this man been in chief com- mand when greater issues were at stake, had he been first instead of second at the Chesapeake, Cornwallis might have been saved. The operation — seizing an anchorage left by the enemy — would have been nearly the same ; and both situa- tions may be instructively compared with Suffren's relief of Cuddalore. The action of De Grasse, also, should be considered not only with reference to the particular occasion, but to the general condition of the war as well, and when thus weighed, and further compared with other very similar opportunities ne- glected by this general officer, a fair estimate of his military capacity can be reached. This comparison, however, is better deferred to the now not very distant close of the campaign. The most useful comment to be made here is, that his action in failing to crush Hood at his anchors, with a force at least fifty per cent greater, was in strict accordance with the gen- eral French principle of subordinating the action of the fleet to so-called particular operations ; for nothing is more in- structive than to note how an unsound principle results in disastrous action. Hood's inferiority was such as to weaken, for offensive purposes, his commanding position. So long the investment, the more audacious manner in which he assaulted the place liefore the fire of the defence had in any way lessened, and before the counter- scarp had been blown in, were the true causes of the sudden fall of the place. Both the militari/ and political, state of affairs warranted this nefjiert of rules When the general terminated his order for the assault with this sentence, ' Ciudad Rodrigo must be stormed this evening,' he knew well that it would be nobly understood" (Napier's Peninsular War). "Judging that the honour of his ^Majesty's arms, and the circumstances of the tear in these seas, required a considerable degree of enterprise, I felt myself justified in departing from the regular system" (Sir John Jervis's Report of the Battle of Cape St. Vincent). CRITICISM OF DE GRASSE'S ACTIOX. 477 as De Grasse kept to windward, he maintained his commu- nications with Martinique, and he was strong enough, too, to force communication when necessary with the troops be- fore Brimstone Hill. It was probable, as the event showed, that the particular operation, the reduction of St. Kitt's, would succeed despite the presence of the English fleet ; and " the French navy has always preferred the glory of assuring a conquest to that, more brilliant perhaps but less real, of taking a few ships." So far De Grasse may be acquitted of any error beyond that of not rising above the traditions of his service. Some days, however, before the surrender of the island and the departure of the English fleet, he was joined by two ships- of-the-line which brought him word of the dispersal of the expected convoy and reinforcements from Europe.^ He then knew that he himself could not be strengthened before Rod- ney's arrival, and that by that event the English would be superior to him. He had actually thirty-three ships-of-the- line in hand, and a few miles off lay twenty-two English in a position where he knew they would await his attack ; yet he let them escape. His own explanation implies clearly that he had no intention of attacking them at anchor : — " The day after the capitulation of Brimstone Hill was the mo- ment to watch Hood closely, and to fight him as soon as he got under way from the conquered island. But our provisions were exhausted ; we had only enough for thirty-six hours. Some supply-ships had ar- rived at Nevis, and you will admit one must live before fighting. I wen. to Nevis, always to windward and in sight of the enemy, a league and a half from him, in order to take on board the necessary supplies as rapidly as possible. Hood decamped at night without signals, and the next morning I found only the sick whom he left behind." ^ In other words, Hood having held his ground with con- summate audacity and skill, when he had some chance of 1 By Kempenfeldt's attack upon De Guichen's convoy, and the following gale in December, 1781.

What shall be said of this talk about provisions? Did not the Comte de Grasse know a month before how long, to a day, the supplies on board would last ? Did he not know, four days before Hood sailed, that he had with him every ship he could proba- bly count on for the approaching campaign, while the Eng- lish would surely be reinforced? And if the English position was as strong as good judgment, professional skill, and bold hearts could make it, had it not weak points ? Were not the lee ships to leeward ? If they did attempt to beat to windward, had he not ships to " contain " them ? If the van ship could not be reached, had he not force enough to double and treble on the third and following ships, as far down the line as he chose ? A letter of Suffren's, referring to a similar condition of things at Santa Lucia,i but written three years before these events, seems almost a prophetic description of them : — " Notwithstanding the slight results of the two cannonades of December 15 [1778], we can yet expect success; but the only way to attain it is to attack vigorously the squadron, which in consequence of our superiority cannot hold out, despite their land works, which will become of no effect if we lay them on board, or anchor upon their buoys. If we delay, a thousand circumstances may save them. They may profit by the night to depart" There can be no doubt that the English would have sold their defeat dearly ; but results in war must be paid for, and the best are in the long run the cheapest. A tight grip of a few simple principles — that the enemy's fleet was the con- trolling factor in the coming campaign, that it was therefore his true objective, that one fraction of it must be crushed without delay when caught tlms separated — would have saved De Grasse a great blunder ; but it is only fair to note that it would have made him an exception to the practice of the French navy. The hour was now close at hand when the French admiral 1 See pp. 366, 426. JUNCTION OF RODNEY AND HOOD. 479 should feel, even if he did not admit, the consequences of this mistake, by which he had won a paltry island and lost an English fleet- Rodney had sailed from Europe on the loth of January, with twelve ships-of-the-line. On the 19th of February he anchored at Barbadoes, and the same day Hood reached Antigua from St. Kitt's. On the 25th the squad- rons of Rodney and Hood met to windward of Antigua, forming a united fleet of thirty-four ships-of-the-line. The next day De Grasse anchored in Fort Royal, thus escaping the pursuit which Rodney at once began. The English ad- miral then returned to Sta. Lucia, where he was joined by three more ships-of-the-line from England, raising his force to thirty-seven. Knowing that a large convoy was expected from France, before the arrival of w^hich nothing could be attempted, Rodney sent a part of his fleet to cruise to wind- ward and as far north as Guadeloupe ; but the officer in charge of the French convoy, suspecting this action, kept well north of that island, and reached Fort Royal, Marti- nique, on the 20th of March. The ships-of-war with him raised De Grasse's fleet to thirty-three effective sail-of-the-line and two fifty-gun ships. The object of the united efforts of France and Spain this year was the conquest of Jamaica. It was expected to unite at Cap Frangais (now Cap Haitien), in Hayti, fifty ships-of- the-line and twenty thousand troops. Part of the latter were already at the rendezvous ; and De Grasse, appointed to com- mand the combined fleets, was to collect in Martinique all the available troops and supplies in the French islands, and convoy them to the rendezvous. It was this junction that Rodney was charged to prevent. The region within which occurred the important operations of the next few days covers a distance of one hundred and fifty miles, from south to north, including the islands of Sta. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, and Guadeloupe, in the order named. (See Plate XL p. 378.) At this time the first was in English, the others in French, hands. The final, and for the moment decisive, encounter took place between, and a little 480 POSITIONS OF RODNEY AND DE GRASSE. to westward of, Dominica and Guadeloupe. These are twenty- three miles apart ; but the channel is narrowed to thirteen by three islets called the Saints, lying ten miles south of Guadeloupe. It is said to have been De Grasse's intention, instead of sailing direct for Cap Frangais,! to take a circui- tous course near the islands, which, being friendly or neutral, would give refuge to the convoy if pressed. The close pur- suit of the English, who came up with him off Dominica, led him to forsake this plan, sending the convoy into Basse Terre at the south end of Guadeloupe, while with the fleet he tried to beat through the channel and pass east of the island, thus drawing the English away from the transports and ridding himself of the tactical embarrassment due to tlie latter's presence. Accidents to various ships thwarted this attempt, and brought about a battle disastrous to him and fatal to the joint enterprise. The anchorages of the two fleets, in Martinique and Sta. Lucia, were thirty miles apart. The prevailing east wind is generally fair to pass from one to the other ; but a strong westerly current, and the frequency of calms and light airs, tend to throw to leeward sailing-ships leaving Sta. Lucia for the northern island. A chain of frigates connected the Eng- lish lookout ships off Martinique, by signal, with Rodney's flag-ship in Gros Hot Bay. Everything was astir at the two stations, the French busy with the multitudinous arrange- ments necessitated by a great military undertaking, the Eng- lish with less to do, yet maintaining themselves in a state of expectancy and preparation for instant action, that entails constant alertness and mental activity. On the 5tli of April Rodney Avas informed that the soldiers were being embarked, and on the 8th, soon after daylight, the lookout frigates were seen making signal that the enemy was leaving port. The English fleet at once began to get under way, and by noon was clear of the harbor to the num- ber of thirty-six of the line. At half-past two p. m. the ad- vanced frigates were in sight of the French fleet, wliich was 1 See Map IV., of the Atlantic Ocean, p. 532. SAILING OF THE FRENCH FLEET. 481 seen from the mastheads of the mahi body just before sun- down. The English stood to the northward all night, and at daybreak of the 9th were abreast Dominica, but for the most part becalmed. In-shore of them, to the northward and eastward, were seen the French fleet and convoy : the men-of-war numbering thiily^three of the line, besides smaller vessels; the convoy a hundred and fifty sail, under special charge of the two fifty-gun sliips. The irregular and uncertain winds, common to the night and early hours of the day near the land, had scattered these unwieldy num- bers. Fifteen sail-of-the-line were in the channel between Dominica and the Saints, with a fresh trade- wind, appar- ently beating to windward ; the remainder of the ships-of- war and most of the convoy were still becalmed close under Dominica (Plate XX., Position I, b). Gradually, however, one by one, the French ships were catching light airs off the land ; and by favor of these, which did not reach so far as the English in the offing, drew out from the island and entered the more steady breeze of the channel, reinforcing the group which was thus possessed of that prime element of naval power, mobility. At the same time light airs from the southeast crept out to the English van under Hood, fanning it gently north from the main body of the fleet toward t\To isolated French ships (i), which, having fallen to leeward during the night, had shared the calms that left the English motionless, with their heads all round the compass. They had come nearly within gunshot, when a light puff from the northwest enabled the Frenchmen to draw away and approach their own ships in the channel. The farther the English van advanced, the fresher grew their wind, until they fairly opened the channel of the Saints and felt the trade-wind. De Grasse signalled to the convoy to put into Guadeloupe, which order was so well carried out that they were all out of sight to the northward by two in the afternoon, and will appear no more in the sequel. The two French ships, already spoken of as fallen to leeward, not being yet out of danger from the English van, which had now 31 482 ACTION OF APRIL 9, 1782. a commanding breeze, and the latter being much separated from their rear and centre, De Grasse ordered his van to bear down and engage. This was obeyed by the ships signalled and by three others, in all by fourteen or fifteen, the ac- tion beginning at half-past nine a. m., and lasting with in- termissions until quarter-past one P. M. Hood was soon forced to heave-to, in order not to increase too much his separation from the main fleet ; the French kept under way, approaching from the rear and passing in succession at half cannon-shot to windward (Plate XX., Position L). As each ship drew ahead of the English division, she tacked, stand- ing back to the southward until in position to resume her place in the order of attack, thus describing a continuous irregular curve of elliptical form, to windward of their opponents. The brunt of the attack fell upon eight or nine of the English, this number being successively in- creased as one ship after another, as the baffling airs served, drew out from the calm space under Dominica ; but the French received similar accessions. While this engagement was going on, part of the English centre, eight ships with Rodney's flag among them (Position I., a), by carefully watching the puffs and cat's-paws, had worked in with the land and caught the sea breeze, which was felt there sooner than in the offing. As soon as they had nt, about eleven A. M., they stood to the north, being now on the weather quarter i both of the English van and its assailants (Posi- tion II., a). The latter, seeing this, tacked, and abandon- ing the contest for the moment, steered south to join their centre, lest Rodney's eight ships should get between them. At half-past eleven the French again formed line on the starboard tack, most of their ships being now clear of the land, while the English rear was still becalmed. The greater numbers of the French enabled them to extend from north to south along the length of the English line, whereas the latter was still broken by a great gap between the van and centre (Position II.). The attack upon Hood was 1 Weather quarter is behind, but on the windward side. 0 2 F J7 5 L 1 1 8 7 1 3 2 2 0 3 6 qhz } 3 A 1 1 1 81 L 8 | 2 1 A 3 { CRITICISM UPOX DE GRASSES CONDUCT. 4S3 therefore liotly renewed ; but the French centre and rear (b), having the wind, kept their distance, and held Rodney's division at long range. At quarter-past one the French, finding that the whole British line was coming up with the wind, ceased firing, and at two Rodney hauled down the signal for battle, the enemy having withdrawn. This action of the 9th of April amounted actually to no more than an artillery duel. One French ship, the " Caton," a sixty- four (d), received injuries which sent her into Guadeloupe; two English were disabled, but repaired their injuries without leaving the fleet. The material advantage, therefore, lay with the latter. Opinions differ as to the generalship of the Comte de Grasse on this day, but they divide on the same basis of principle as to whether ulterior operations, or the chances of beating the enemy's fleet, are to determine an admiral's action. The facts of the case are these : Sixteen of the English fleet, all the rear and four of the centre (Position 11., c), were not able at any time to fire a shot. Apparently every French ship, first and last, might have been brought into actioUo At the beginning, eight or nine English were opposed to fifteen French. At the end there were twenty English to thirty- three French, and these general proportions doubtless obtained throughout the four hours. De Grasse therefore found himself in the presence of a fleet superior to his own, in numbers at least, and by the favor of Providence that fleet so divided that nearly half of it was powerless to act. He had the wind, he had a fine body of captains; what was to prevent him from attacking Hood's nine ships with fifteen, putting one on each side of the six in the rear. Had those nine been thoroughly beaten, Rodney's further movements must have been hope- lessly crip[)led. The French lost only five in their defeat three days later. The subsequent court-martial, however, laid down the French doctrine thus : " The decision to persist in engaging with only a part of our fleet may be considered as an act of prudence on the part of the admiral, which might be dic- tated by the ulterior projects of the campaign." On this a French professional writer naturally remarks, that if an attack 484 ACCIDENTS IN THE FRENCH FLEET. were made at all, it would be more prudent to make it in force ; less injury would fall on individual ships, while in the end the whole fleet would inevitably be drawn in to support any which, by losing spars, could not return to windward. Three times in one year had Fortune thrown before De Grasse the opportunity of attacking English fleets with de- cisive odds on his side.^ Her favors were now exhausted. Three days more were to show how decidedly the ulterior projects of a campaign may be affected by a battle and the loss of a few ships. From the 9th to the morning of the 12th the French fleet continued beating to windward between Dominica and the Saints, in no regular order. On the night of the 9th the English hove-to to repair damages. The next day the chase to windward was resumed, but the French gained very decidedly upon their pursuers. On the night of the 10th two ships, the "Jason" and "Zele," collided. The " Zel^i " was the bane of the French fleet during these days. She was one of those that were nearly caught by the enemy on the 9th, and was also the cause of the final disaster. The injuries to the " Jason " forced her to put into Guadeloupe. On the 11th the main body was to windward of the Saints, but the " Zel^ " and another had fallen so far to leeward that De Grasse bore down to cover them, thus losing much of the ground gained. On the night following, the " Zdle " was again in collision, this time with De Grasse's flag-ship ; the latter lost some sails, but the other, which had not the right of way and was wholly at fault, carried away both foremast and bowsprit. The admiral sent word to the frigate " Astrde " to take the " Zele " in tow ; and here flits across the page of our story a celebrated and tragical figure, for the captain of the " Astr(?e " was the ill-fated explorer Lapeyrouse, the mystery of whose disappear- ance with two ships and their entire crews remained so long unsolved. Two hours were consumed in getting the ship under way in tow of the frigate, — not very smart work under the conditions of weather and urgency ; but by five a. m. the * April 29, 1781, off Martinique, twenty-four ships to eighteen ; January, 1782, thirty to twenty-two; April 9, 1782, thirty to twenty. THE NAVAL BATTLE OF THE SAINTS. 485 two were standing away for Basse Terrc, where the " Caton" and " Jason," as well as the convoy, had already arrived. The French fleet had thus lost three from its line-of-battle since leaving Martinique. The disabled ship had not long been headed for Basse Terre, when the faint streaks of dawn announced the aj)proach of the 12tli of April, a day doubly celebrated in naval annals. The sun had not quite set upon the exhausted squadrons of Suffren and Hughes, anchoring after their fiercest battle off Ceylon, when his early rays shone upon the opening strife between Rodney and De Grasse.^ The latter was at the time the greatest naval battle in its results that had been fought in a century ; its influence on the course of events was xQry great, though far from as decisive as it might have been ; it was attended with circumstances of unusual though somewhat factitious brilliancy, and particularly was marked by a ma- nceuvre that was then looked upon as exceptionally daring and decisive, — " breaking the line." It must be added that it has given rise to a storm of controversy ; and the mass of details, as given by witnesses who should be reliable, are so confused and contradictory, owing mainly to the uncertainties of the wind, that it is impossible now to do more than attempt to reconcile them in a full account. Nevertheless, the leading features can be presented with sufficient accuracy, and this will first be done briefly and barely ; the outline thus pre- sented can afterward be clothed with the details which give color, life, and interest to the great scene. At daylight^ (about half-past five) the English fleet, which had gone about at two a. m., was standing on the starboard ' The difference of time from Trincomalee to the Saints is nine hours and a half. - The account of the transactions from April 9 to April 12 is based mainly upon the contemporary plates and descriptions of Lieutenant Matthews, R. N., and the much later " Naval Researches " of Capt. Thomas White, also of the British Xav}% who were eye-witnesses, both being checked by French and other English narratives. Matthews and White are at variance with Rodney's official report as to the tack on which the English were at daybreak ; but the latter is explicitly confirmed by private letters of Sir Charles Douglas, sent immediately after the battle to prominent persons, and is followed in the text. 486 THE NAVAL BATTLE OF THE SAINTS, tack, with the wind at southeast,^ an unusual amount of south- ing for that hour (Plate XXL, A). It was then about fifteen miles from the Saints, which bore north-northeast, and ten from the French fleet, which bore northeast. The latter, owing to the events of the night, was greatly scattered, as much as eight or ten miles separating the weather, or easternmost, ships from the lee,^ the flag-ship " Ville de Paris " being among the latter. Anxiety for the " Zele " kept the French admiral, with the ships in his company, under short canvas, standing to the southward on the port tack (A). The English on the star- board tack, with the wind as they had it,^ headed east-north- east, and thus, as soon as there was light to see, found the French " broad on the lee bow, and one of M. de Grasse's ships (the " Zele ") towed by a frigate, square under our lee (a), with his bowsprit and foremast prostrate across his fore- castle." 1 To draw the French farther to leeward, Rodney de- tached four ships (b) to chase the " Zele." As soon as De Grasse saw this he signalled his fleet to keep away (c), as Rodney wished, and at the same time to form the line-of-battle, thus calling down to him the sliips to windward. The English line was also formed rapidly, and the chasing ships recalled at seven a. m. De Grasse, seeing that if he stood on he would lose the weather-gage altogether, hauled up again on the port tack (c') ; and the breeze changing to east-southeast and east in his favor and knocking the English off, the race of the two fleets on opposite tacks, for the advantage of the wind, be- came nearly equal. The French, however, won, thanks to a superiority in sailing which had enabled them to draw so far to windward of the English on the previous days, and, but for the awkwardness of the " Z^le," might have cleared them altogether (Plate XXI., B). Their leading ships first reached and passed the point where the rapidly converging tracks intersected, while the English leader, the " Marlborough," 1 Letter of Sir Charles Douglas, Rodney's chief-of-staff : "United Service Journal," 1833, Part I. p. 515. 2 De Grasse calls this distance three leagues, while some of his captains esti- mated it to be as great as five. 3 The French, in mid-channel, had the wind more to the eastward. * X * % ^ •0 0 * "^« p ■0 .' » cq|o T =^ P^ ^> s CO < O ~ .

The battle, of course, liad by this time begun, the ninth ship in the French line, the " Brave," open- ing fire at twenty minutes before eight a. m. upon the " Marl- borough." As there was no previous intention of breaking the line, the English leader kept away, in obedience to a sig- nal from Rodney, and ran close along under the enemy's lee, followed in succession by all the ships as they reached her wake. The battle thus assumed tlie common and indecisive phase of two fleets passing on opposite tacks, the wind very light, however, and so allowing a more heavy engagement than common under these circumstances, the ships " sliding by " at the rate of three to four knots. Since the hostile lines diverged again south of their point of meeting, De Grasse made signal to keep away four points to south-south- west, thus bringing his van (B, a) to action with the Eng- lish rear, and not permitting the latter to reach his rear unscathed. There were, how^ever, two dangers threatening the French if they continued their course. Its direction, south or soutli-soutliwest, carried them into the calms that hung round the north end of Dominica ; and the uncertainty of the wind made it possible that by its hauling to the south- ward the enemy could pass through their line and gain the wind, and witli it the possibility of forcing the decisive battle which the French policy had shunned ; and this was in fact what happened. De Grasse therefore made signal at half- past eight to wear together and take the same tack as the Eng- lish. This, however, was impossible ; the two fleets were too close together to admit the evolution. He then signalled to haul close to the wind and wear in successio7i, which also failed to be done, and at five minutes past nine the dreaded contin- gency arose ; the wind hauled to the southward, knocking off all the French ships that had not yet kept away ; that is, all who had English ships close under their lee (Plate XXI. C). Rodney, in the " Formidable," was at this time just di-awing up with the fourth ship astern of De Grasse's flag. Luffing to the new wind, he passed through the French line, followed by 488 THE NAVAL BATTLE OF THE SAINTS. the five shi})S next astern of hiiu (C, a), while nearly at the same moment, and from the same causes, his sixth astern (C, b) led through the interval abreast him, followed by the whole English rear. The French line-of-battle was thus broken in two places by columns of enemies' ships in such close order as to force its vessels aside, even if the wind had not conspired to embarrass their action. Every principle upon which a line- of-battle was constituted, for mutual support and for the clear field of fire of each ship, was thus overthrown for the French, and preserved for the English divisions which filed through ; and the French were forced off to leeward by the interposition of the enemy's columns, besides being broken up. Compelled thus to foi'sake the line upon which they had been ranged, it was necessary to re-form upon another, and unite the three groups into which they were divided, — a difficult piece of tactics under any circumstances, but doubly so under the moral impression of disaster, and in presence of a superior enemy, who, though himself disordered, was in better shape, and already felt the glow of victory. It does not appear that any substantial attempt to re-form was made by the French. To reunite, yes ; but only as a flying, disordei'ed mass. The various shifts of wind and move- ments of the divisions left their fleet, at midday (Plate XXI. D), with the centre (c) two miles northwest of and to leeward of the van (v), the rear (r) yet farther from the centre and to leeward of it. Calms and short puffs of wind prevailed now through both fleets. At half-past one P. m. a light breeze from the east sprang up, and De Grasse made signal to form the line again on the port tack ; between three and four, not having suc- ceeded in this, he made signal to form on the starboard tack. The two signals and the general tenor of the accounts show that at no time were the French re-formed after their line was broken ; and all the manoeuvres tended toward, even if they did not necessitate, taking the whole fleet as far down as the most leewardly of its parts (D). In such a movement, it followed of course that the most crippled ships were left be- hind, and these were picked up, one by one, by the English, DETAILS OF THE BATTLE OF APRIL 12. 489 uho pursued without any regular order, for which there was no need, as mutual support was assured without it. Shortly- after six p. M. De Grasse's flag ship, the " Ville de Paris," struck her colors to the " Barfleur," carrying the flag of Sir Samuel Hood. The French accounts state that nine of the enemy's sliips then surrounded her, and there is no doubt that she had been fought to the bitter end. Her name, commemorating the great city whose gift she had been to the king, her unusual size, and the fact that no French naval commander-in-chief had before been taken prisoner in bat- tle, conspired to bestow a peculiar brilliancy upon Rod- ney's victory. Four othtjr ships-of-the-line were taken,i and, singularly enough, upon these particular ships was found the whole train of artillery intended for the reduction of Jamaica. Such were the leading features of the Battle of the Saints, or, as it is sometimes styled, of the 12th of April, known to the French as the Battle of Dominica. Certain points which have so far been omitted for the sake of clearness, but which affect the issue, must now be given. When the day opened, the French fleet was greatly scattered and without order.^ De Grasse, under the influence of his fears for the " Z'jle," so precipitated his movements that his line was not properly formed at the moment of engaging. The van ships had not yet come into position (B, a), and the remainder were so far from haviug reached their places that De Yaudreuil, com- manding the rear division and last engaged, states that the line was formed under the fire of musketry. The English, on the contrary, were in good order, the only change made being to shorten the interval between ships from two to one cable's length (seven hundred feet). The celebrated stroke of break- ing through the Frencli line was due, not to previous intention, but to a shift of wind throwing their ships out of order and so 1 The positions of the French ships captured are shown b}- a cross in each of the three successive stages of the battle, B, C, D. 2 The distance of the weathermost French ships from the " Ville de Faris," when the sitrnal to form liue-of-battle was made, is variously stated at from six to nine miles. 490 BREAKING THE LINE. increasing the spaces between them ; while the gap through which Rodney's group penetrated was widened by the "Dia- deme " on its north side being taken aback and paying round on the other tack (C, c.) Sir Charles Douglas says the imme- diate effect, where the flag-ship broke through, was " the bring- ing together, almost if not quite in contact with each other, the four ships of the enemy which were nearest," on the north, "to the point alluded to (c), and coming up in succession. This unfortunate group, composing now only one large single object at which to fire, was attacked by the ' Duke,' ' Namur,' and ' Formidable ' (ninety-gun ships) all at once, receiving several broadsides from each, not a single shot missing; and great must have been the slaughter." The "Duke" (C, d), being next ahead of the flag-ship, had followed her leader under the French lee ; but as soon as her captain saw that the " Formidable " had traversed the enemy's order, he did the same, passing north of this confused group and so bring- ing it under a fire from both sides. The log of the " Magna- nime," one of the group, mentions passing under the fire of two three-deckers, one on either side. As soon as the order was thus broken, Rodney hauled down the signal for the line, keeping flying that for close action, and at the same time ordered his van, which had now passed beyond and north of the enemy's rear, to go about and rejoin the English centre. This was greatly delayed through the in- juries to spars and sails received in passing under the ene- my's fire. His own flag-ship and the ships with her went about. The rear, under Hood, instead of keeping north again to join the centre, stood to windward for a time, and were then becalmed at a considerable distance from the rest of the fleet. Much discussion took place at a later day as to the wisdom of Rodney's action in breaking through his enemy's order, and to whom the credit, if any, should be ascribed. The lat- ter point is of little concern ; but it may be said that the son of Sir Charles Douglas, Rodney's chief-of-staff, brought for- ward an amount of positive evidence, the only kind that could EFFECTS OF RODNEY'S MANCEUVRE. 491 be accepted to dimiuisli the credit of the person wholly re- sponsible for the results, which proves that the suggestion came from Douglas, and Rodney's consent was with difficulty obtained. The value of the manoeuvre itself is of more conse- quence than any question of personal reputation. It has been argued by some that, so far from being a meritorious act, it was unfortunate, and for Rodney's credit should rather be attiib- uted to the force of circumstances than to choice. It had been better, these say, to have continued along under the lee of the French rear, thus inflicting upon it the fire of the whole English line, and that the latter should have tacked and doubled on the French rear. This argument conven- iently forgets that tacking, or turning round in any way, after a brush of this kind, was possible to only a part of the ships engaged ; and that these would have much difficulty in overtaking the enemies who had passed on, unless the latter were very seriously crippled. Therefore this suggested attack, the precise reproduction of the battle of Ushant, really reduces itself to the fleets passing on opposite tacks, each dis- tributing its fire over the whole of the enemy's line without attempting any concentration on a part of it. It may, and must, be conceded at once, that Rodney's change of course permitted the eleven rear ships of the French (D, r) to run off to leeward, having received the fire of only part of their enemy, while the English v^an had undergone that of nearly the whole French fleet. These ships, however, were thus thrown entirely out of action for a measurable and impor- tant time by being driven to leeward, and would have been still more out of position to help any of their fleet, had not De Grasse himself been sent to leeward by Hood's divi- sion cutting the line three ships ahead of him. The thirteen leading French ships, obeying the last signal they had seen, were hugging the wind ; the group of six with De Grasse (C, e) would have done the same had they not been headed off by Hood's division. The result of Rodney's own action alone, therefore, would have been to divide the French fleet into two parts, separated by a space of six miles, and one of them 492 EFFECTS OF RODNEY'S MANCEUVRE. hopelessly to leeward. The English, having gained the wind, would have been in position easily to " contain " the eleven lee ships, and to surround the nineteen weather ones in over- whelming force. The actual condition, owing to the two breaches in the line, was slightly dift'erent ; the group of six with De Grasse being placed between his weather and lee di- visions, two miles from the former, four from the latter (D). It seems scarcely necessary to insist upon the tactical advan- tages of such a situation for the English, even disregarding the moral effect of the confusion through which the French had passed. In addition to this, a very striking lesson is de- ducible from the immediate effects of the English guns in passing through. Of the five ships taken, three were those under whose sterns the English divisions pierced.^ Instead of giving and taking, as the parallel lines ran by, on equal terms, each ship having the support of those ahead and astern, the French shi])s near wliicli the penetrating columns passed received each the successive fire of all the enemy's division. Thus Hood's thirteen ships filed by the two rear ones of the French van, the "Cesar" and "Hector," fairly crushing them under this concentration of fire ; while in like manner, and with like results, Rodney's six passed by the " Glorieux." This " concentration by defiling " past the ex- tremity of a column corresponds quite accurately to the con- centration upon the flank of a line, and has a special interest, because if successfully carried out it would be as powerful an attack now as it ever has been. If quick to seize their ad- vantage, the English might have fired upon the ships on both sides of the gaps through which they passed, as the " For- midable " actually did ; but they were using the starboard broadsides, and many doubtless did not realize their oppor- 1 The other two French ships taken were the " Ville de Paris," which, in her isolated condition, and bearing the flag of the commander-in-chief, became the quarry around which the enemy's ships naturally gathered, and the " Ardent," of sixty-four guns, which appears to have been intercepted in a gallant attempt to pass from the van to the side of her admiral in his extremity. The latter was tlie solitary prize taken by the allied Great Armada in the English Channel, in 1779. ARMAMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. 493 tunity until too late. The natural results of Rodney's act, therefore, were: (1) The gain of the wind, with the power of offensive action; (2) Concentration of (ire upon a part of the enemy's order ; and (3) The introduction into the latter of confusion and division, which might, and did, become very great, offering the opportunity of further tactical advantage. It is not a valid reply to say that, had the French been more apt, they could have united sooner. A manoeuvre that pre- sents a good chance of advantage does not lose its merit be- cause it can be met by a prompt movement of the enemy, any more than a particular lunge of the sword becomes worthless because it has its appropriate parry. The chances were that by heading off the rear ships, while the van stood on, the French fleet would be badly divided ; and the move was none the less sagacious because the two fragments could have united sooner than they did, had they been well handled. With the alternative action suggested, of tacking after pass- ing the enemy's rear, the pursuit became a stern chase, in which both parties having been equally engaged would pre- sumably be equally crippled. Signals of disability, in fact, were numerous in both fleets. Independently of the tactical handling of the two fleets, there were certain differences of equipment which conferred tactical advantage, and are therefore worth noting. The French appear to have had finer sliips, and, class for class, heavier armaments. Sir Charles Douglas, an eminent offi- cer of active and ingenious turn of mind, who paid particular attention to gunnery details, estimated that in weight of bat- tery the thirty-three French were superior to the thirty-six English by the force of four 84-gun ships ; and that after the loss of the " Zele," " Jason," and " Caton " there still remained an advantage equal to two seventy-fours. The French admiral La Graviere admits the generally heavier calibre of French cannon at this era. The better construc- tion of the French ships and their greater draught caused them to sail and beat better, and accounts in part for the success of De Grasse in a-ainins: to windward ; for in the after- 494 ARMAMENTS OF THE TWO FLEETS. noon of the lltli only three or four of the body of his fleet were visible /rom the mast-head of the EngHsli flag-ship, which had been within gunshot of them on the 9tli. It was the awkwardness of the unlucky " Zeld " and of tlie " Magnanime," which drew down De Grasse from his position of vantage, and justified Rodney's perseverance in relying upon the chapter of accidents to effect his purpose. The greater speed of the French as a body is somewhat hard to account for, because, though undoubtedly with far better lines, the practice of cop- pering the bottom had not become so general in France as in England, and among the French there were several nn- coppered and worm-eaten ships.^ The better sailing of the French was, however, remarked by the English officers, though the great gain mentioned must have been in part owing to Rodney's lying-by, after the action of the 9th, to refit, due probably to the greater injury received by the small body of his vessels, which had been warmly engaged, with greatly su- perior numbers. It was stated, in narrating that action, that the French kept at half cannon-range ; this was to neutralize a tactical advantage the English had in the large number of carronades and other guns of light weight but large calibre, which in close action told heavily, but were useless at greater distances. The second in command, De Vaudreuil, to whom was intrusted the conduct of that attack, expressly states that if he had come within reach of the carronades his ships would have been quickly unrigged. Whatever judg- ment is passed upon the military policy of refusing to crush an enemy situated as the English division was, there can be no question that, if the object was to prevent pursuit, the tactics of De Vaudreuil on the 9th was in all respects excel- lent. He inflicted the utmost injury with the least exposure of his own force. On the 12th, De Grasse, by allowing him- self to be lured within reach of carronades, yielded this ad- vantage, besides sacrificing to an impulse his whole previous strategic policy. Rapidly handled from their lightness, flring 1 Official letter of the Marquis de Vaudreuil. Gue'riu : Histoire de la Marine Frau9aise, vol. v. p. 313. LESSOXS DEDUCED FROM THE BATTLE. 495 grape and shot of large diameter, these guns were peculiarly harmful in close action and useless at long range. In a later despatch De Vaudreuil says : " The effect of these new arms is most deadly within musket range ; it is they which so badly crippled us on the 12th of April." There were other gunnery innovations, in some at least of the English ships, which by increasing the accuracy, the rapidity, and the hold of fire, greatly augmented the power of their batteries. These were the introduction of locks, by which the man who aimed also fired ; and the fitting to the gun-carriages of breast-pieces and sweeps, so that the guns could be pointed farther ahead or astern, — that is, over a larger field than had been usual. In fights between single ships, not controlled in their move- ments by their relations to a fleet, this improvement would at times allow the possessor to take a position whence he could train upon his enemy without the latter being able to reply, and some striking instances of such tactical advantage are given. In a fleet fight, such as is now being considered, the gain was that the guns could be brought to bear farther for- ward, and could follow the opponent longer as he passed astern, thus doubling, or more, the number of shots he might receive, and lessening for him the interval of immunity en- joyed between two successive antagonists.^ These matters of antiquated and now obsolete detail carry with them lessons that are never obsolete ; they differ in no respect from the more modern experiences with the needle-gun and the torpedo. And indeed this whole action of April 12, 1782, is fraught with sound militar}^ teaching. Perseverance in pursuit, gain- ing advantage of position, concentration of one's own effort, dispersal of the enemy's force, the efficient tactical bearing of small but important improvements in the material of war, have been dwelt on. To insist further upon the necessity of not letting slip a chance to beat the enemy in detail, would be thrown away on any one not already convinced by the bearing of April 9 on April 12. The abandonment of the attack upon Jamaica, after the defeat of the French fleet, 1 See United Service Journal, 1834, Part II. pp. 103 and following. 496 RODNEY'S FAILURE TO PURSUE THE ENEMY. shows conclusively that the true way to secure ulterior ol> jects is to defeat the force which threatens them. There remains at least one criticism, delicate in its character, but essential to draw out the full teachings of these events ; that is, upon the manner in which the victory was followed up, and the consequent effects upon the war in general. The liability of sailing-ships to injury in spars and sails, in other words, in that mobility which is the prime charac- teristic of naval strength, makes it difficult to say, after a lapse of time, what might or might not have been done. It is not only a question of actual damage received, which log- books may record, but also of the means for repair, the energy and aptitude of the officers and seamen, which differ from ship to ship. As to the ability of the English fleet, however, to follow up its advantages by a more vigorous pur- suit on the 12th of April, w^e have the authority of two most distinguished officers, — Sir Samuel Hood, the second in com- mand, and Sir Charles Douglas, the captain of the fleet, or chief- of-staff to the admiral. The former expressed the opinion that twenty ships might have been taken, and said so to Rodney the next day ; while the chief- of- staff was so much mortified by the failure, and by the manner in which the admiral re- ceived his suggestions, as seriously to contemplate resigning his position.^ Advice and criticism are easy, nor can the full weight of a responsibility be felt, except by the man on whom it is laid ; but great results cannot often be reached in war without risk and effort. The accuracy of the judgment of these two offi- cers, however, is confirmed by inference from the French reports. Rodney justifies his failure to pursue by alleging the crippled condition of many ships, and other matters in- cident to the conclusion of a hard-fought battle, and then goes on to suggest what might have been done that night, had he pursued, by the French fleet, which " went off in a 1 See letter of Sir Howard Douglas in United Service Journal, 1834, Part II. p. 97 ; also " Naval Evolutions," by same author. The letters of Sir Samuel Hood have not come under the author's eye. RODNEY'S FAILURE TO PURSUE. THE ENEMY. 497 body of twenty-six ships-of-the-line." ^ These possibilities are rather creditable to his imagination, considering what the French fleet had done by day ; but as regards the body of twenty-six ^ ships, De Vaudreuil, who, after De Grasse's sur- render, made the signal for the ships to rally round his flag, found only ten with him next morning, and was not joined by any more before the 14th. During the following days five more joined him at intervals.^ With these he went to the rendezvous at Cap Fran^ais, where he found others, bringing the whole number who repaired thither to twenty. The five remaining, of those that had been in the action, fled to Cura- 90a, six hundred miles distant, and did not rejoin until May. The " body of twenty-six ships," therefore, had no existence in fact ; on the contrary, the French fleet was very badly broken up, and several of its ships isolated. As regards the crippled condition, there seems no reason to think the English had suffered more, but rather less, than their enemy ; and a curious statement, bearing upon this, appears in a letter from Sir Gilbert Blane : — " It was with difficulty we could make the French officers believe that the returns of killed and wounded, made by our ships to the ad- miral, were true ; and one of them flatly contradicted me, saying we always gave the world a false account of our loss. I then walked with him over the decks of the ' Formidable,' and bid him remark what number of shot-holes there were, and also how little her rigging had suffered, and asked if that degree of damage was likely to be connected with the loss of more than fourteen men, which was our number killed, and the greatest of any in the fleet, except the 'Royal Oak ' and ' Monarch.' He . . . owned our fire must have been much better kept up and directed than theirs." ^ There can remain little doubt, therefore, that the advan- tage was not followed up with all possible vigor. Not till five days after the battle was Hood's division sent toward San 1 Rodney's Life, vol. ii. p. 248. 2 There were only twenty-five in all. 8 Gue'rin, vol.

Domingo, where the}' picked up in the Mona Passage the " Jason " and the " Caton," which had separated before the battle and were on their way to Cap Frangais. These, and two small vessels with them, were the sole after-fruits of the vic- tory. Under the conditions of England's war this cautious failure is a serious blot on Rodney's military reputation, and goes far to fix his place among successful admirals. He had saved Jamaica for the time ; but he had not, having the oppor- tunity, crushed the French fleet. He too, like De Grasse, had allowed the immediate objective to blind him to the general militar}^ situation, and to the factor which controlled it. To appreciate the consequences of this neglect, and the real indecisiveness of this celebrated battle, we must go for- ward a year and listen to the debates in Parliament on the conditions of peace, in February, 1783. The approval or censure of the terms negotiated by the existing ministry in- volved the discussion of many considerations ; but the gist of the dispute was, whether the conditions were such as the comparative financial and military situations of the belliger- ents justified, or whether it would have been better for Eng- land to continue the war rather than submit to the sacrifices she had made. As regards the financial condition, despite the gloomy picture drawn by the advocates of the peace, there was probably no more doubt then than there is now about the comparative resources of the different countries. The question of military strength was really that of naval power. The ministry argued that the whole British force hardly numbered one hundred sail-of-the-line, while the navies of France and Spain amounted to one hundred and forty, not to speak of that of Holland. " With so glaring an inferiority, what hopes of success could we derive, either from the experience of tlie last campaign, or from any new distribution of our force in that which would have followed ? In the West Indies we could not have had more than forty-six sail to oppose to forty, which on the day that peace was signed lay in Cadiz Bay, with sixteen thousand troops on board, ready to sail for that quarter of the world, where they would have been joined by twelve RODNEY'S MERITS AS AX ADMIRAL. 499 of the line from Havana and ten from San Domingo. . . . Might we not too reasonably apprehend that the campaign in the West Indies would have closed with the loss of Jamaica itself, the avowed object of this immense armament ? " ^ These are certainly the reasonings of an avowed partisan, for which large allowances must be made. The accuracy of the statement of comparative numbers was denied by Lord Keppel, a member of the same party, and but lately at the head of the admiralty, a post which he had resigned because he disapproved the treaty .^ English statesmen, too, as well as English seamen, must by this time have learned to dis- count largely the apparent, when estimating the real, power of the other navies. Nevertheless, how different would have been the appreciation of the situation, both moral and ma- terial, had Rodney reaped the full fruits of the victory which he owed rather to chance than to his own merit, great as that undeniably was. A letter puljlished in 1809, anonymous, but bearing strong internal evidence of being written by Sir Gilbert Blane, the physician of the fleet and long on intimate terms with Rod- ney, who W'as a constant sufferer during his last cruise, states that the admiral " thought little of his victory on the 12th of April, 1782." He would have preferred to rest his reputation upon his combinations against De Guichen, April 17, 1780, and " looked upon that opportunity of beating, with an infe- rior fleet, such an officer, whom he considered the best in the French service, as one by which, but for the disobedience of his captains, he might have gained immortal renown," ^ Few students will be inclined to question this estimate of Rodney's merit on the two occasions. Fortune, however, decreed that his glory should depend upon a battle, brilliant in itself, to which his own qualities least contributed, and denied him success when he most deserved it. The chief action of his life in which merit and success met, the destruction of Lan- ^ Annual Register, 1783, p. 151. - Annual Register, 1783, p. 157 ; Life of Admiral Keppel, vol. ii. p. 403. 3 Naval Chronicle, vol. xxv. p. 404. 500 RODXEY RELIEVED OF HIS COMMAND. gara's fleet off Cape St. Vincent, has almost passed into oblivion ; yet it called for the highest qualities of a seaman, and is not unworthy of comparison with Hawke's pursuit of Conflans.^ Within the two years and a half which had elapsed since Rodney was appointed to his command he had gained sev- eral important successes, and, as was remarked, had taken a French, a Spanish, and a Dutch admiral. "In that time he had added twelve line-of-battle ships, all taken from the enemy, to the British navy, and destroyed five more ; and to render the whole still more singularly remarkable, the ' Yille de Paris ' was said to be the only first-rate man-of- war that ever was taken and carried into port by any com- mander of any nation." Notwithstanding his services, the party spirit that was then so strong in England, penetrating even the army and navy, obtained his recall ^ upon the fall of Lord North's ministry, and his successor, a man unknown to fame, had ah-eady sailed when news arrived of the victory. In the fallen and discouraging state of English affairs at the time, it excited the utmost exultation, and silenced the strictures which certain parts of the admiral's previous con- duct had drawn forth. The people were not in a humor to be critical, and amid the exaggerated notions that prevailed of the results achieved, no one thought of the failure to obtain greater. This impression long prevailed. As late as 1830, when Rodney's Life was first published, it was asserted " that the French navy had been so effectually crippled and re- duced by the decisive victory of the 12th of April, as to be 1 Page 404. Yet here also the gossip of the day, as reflected in the Naval Atalantis, imputed the chief credit to Young, the captain of the flag-ship. Sir Gilbert Blane stated, many years later, " When it was close upon sunset, it became a question whether the chase should be continued. After some dis- cussion between the admiral and captain, at which I was present, the admiral being confined with the gout, it was decided to persist in the same course with the signal to engage to leeward." (United Service Journal, 1800, Part II. p. 479.) - Rodney was a strong Tory. Almost all the other distinguished admirals of the day, notably Keppel, Howe, and Barrington, were Whigs, — a fact unfortunate for the naval power of England. SUBSEQUENT CAREER OF BE GRASSE. 501 no longer in a condition to contest with Great Britain the empire of the seas." This is nonsense, excusable in 1782, but not to the calm thought of after days. The favorable terms obtained were due to the financial embarrassment of France, not to her naval humiliation ; and if there was exaggeration in the contention of the advocates of peace that England could not save Jamaica, it is probable that she could not have recovered by arms the other islands restored to her by the treaty. The memory of De Grasse will always be associated with great services done to America. His name, rather than that of Rochambeau, represents tlie material succor which France gave to the struggling life of the young Republic, as Lafayette's recalls the moral sympathy so opportunely extended. The incidents of his life, subsequent to the great disaster which closed his active career, cannot be witliout interest to American readers. After the surrender of the " Yille de Paris," De Grasse accompanied the English fleet and its prizes to Jamaica, whither Rodney repaired to refit his ships, thus appear- ing as a captive upon the scene of his intended conquest. On the 19th of May he left the island, still a prisoner, for England. Both by naval officers and by the English people he was treated with that flattering and benevolent attention which comes easily from the victor to the van- quished, and of which his personal valor at least was not unworthy. It is said that he did not refuse to show himself on several occasions upon the balcony of his rooms in Lon- don, to the populace shouting for the valiant Frenchman. This undignified failure to appreciate his true position naturally excited the indignation of his countrymen ; the more so as he had been unsparing and excessive in de- nouncing the conduct of his subordinates on the unlucky 12th of April. " He bears his misfortune," wrote Sir Gilbert Blane, " with equa- nimity ; conscious, as he says, that he has done his duty. ... He attributes his misfortune, not to the inferiority of his force, but to the 502 FINDINGS OF THE COURT-MARTIAL base desertion of his officers in the other ships, to whom lie made the signal to rally, and even hailed them to abide by him, but was abandoned." ^ This was the key-note to all his utterances. Writing from the English flag-ship, the day after the battle, he '' threw upon the greater part of his captains the misfortunes of the day. Some had disobeyed his signals ; others, and notably the captains of the ' Languedoc ' and ' Couronne,' that is to say his next ahead and astern, had abandoned him." ^ He did not, however, confine himself to official reports, but while a prisoner in London published several pamphlets to the same effect, which he sent broadcast over Europe. The government, naturally thinking that an officer could not thus sully the honor of his corps without good reason, resolved to search out and relentlessly punish all the guilty. The captains of the " Languedoc " and " Couronne " were imprisoned as soon as they reached France, and all papers, logs, etc., bearing upon the case were gathered together. Under all the circumstances it is not to be wondered at that on his return to France, De Grasse, to use his own words, " found no one to hold out a hand to him." ^ It was not till the beginning of 1784 that all the accused and witnesses were ready to appear before the court-martial ; but the result of the trial was to clear entirely and in the most ample manner almost every one whom he had attacked, while the faults found were considered of a character entitled to indulgence, and were awarded but slight punishment. " Nevertheless," cautiously observes a French writer, " one cannot but say, with the Court, that the capture of an ad- miral commanding thirty ships-of-the-line is an historical incident which causes the regret of the whole nation." * As 1 Rodney's Life, vol. ii. p. 242. 2 Chevalier, p. 311. ^ Kerguelen : Guerre Maritime de 1778.

It is interesting to note in this connection tliat one of the ships near the French admiral, when he surrendered, was the " Pluton," which, though the extreme rear ship, had nevertheless thus reached a position worthy of the high reputation of her captain, D' Albert de Rions. UPON DE GRASSE AND HIS OFFICERS. 503 to the conduct of the battle by the admiral, the Court found that the danger of the '' Zel^ " on the morning of the 12th was not such as to justify bearing down for so long a time as was done ; that the crippled ship had a breeze which was not then shared by the English, five miles away to the southward, and which carried her into Basse Terre at ten A. M. ; that the engagement should nut have been begun before all the ships had come into line ; and finally, that the fleet should have been formed on the same tack as the English, because, by continuing to stand south, it entered the zone of calms and light airs at the north end of Dominica.^ De Grasse was much dissatisfied with the finding of the Court, and was indiscreet enough to write to the minister of marine, protesting against it and demanding a new trial. The minister, acknowledging his protest, replied in the name of the king. After commenting upon the pamphlets that had been so widely issued, and the entire contradiction of their statements by the testimony before the Court, he concluded with these weighty words : — " The loss of the battle cannot be attributed to the fault of private oflBcers.^ It results, from the findings, that you have allowed yourself to injure, by ill-founded accusations, the reputation of several officers, in order to clear yourself in public opinion of an unhappy result, the excuse for which you might perhaps have found in the inferiority of your force, in the uncertain fortune of war, and in circumstances over which you had no control. His Majesty is willing to believe that you did what you could to prevent the misfortunes of the day ; but he cannot be equally indulgent to your unjust imputations upon those officers of his navy who have been cleared of the charges against them. His Majesty, dissatisfied with your conduct in this respect, forbids you to present yourself before him. I transmit his orders with re- gret, and add my own advice to retire, under the circumstances, to your province." De Grasse died in January, 1788. His fortunate opponent, rewarded with peerage and pension, lived until 1792.

He died in 1816, at the great age of ninety-two. CHAPTER XIV. Critical Discussion of the Maritime War of 1778. nPHE war of 1778, between Great Britain and the House of •^ Bourbon, which is so inextricably associated with the American Revolution, stands by itself in one respect. It was purely a maritime war. Not only did the allied kingdoms carefully refrain from continental entanglements, Avhich Eng- land in accordance with her former policy strove to excite, but there was between the two contestants an approach to equality on the sea which had not been realized since the days of Tourville. The points in dispute, the objects for which the war was undertaken or at which it aimed, were for the most part remote from Europe ; and none of them was on the con- tinent with the single exception of Gibraltar, the strife over which, being at the extreme point of a rugged and dijfficult salient, and separated from neutral nations by the whole of France and Spain, never threatened to drag in other parties than those immediately interested. No such conditions existed in any war between the acces- sion of Louis XIV. and the downfall of Napoleon. There was a period during the reign of the former in Avhich the French navy was superior in number and equipment to the Englisli and Dutch ; but the policy and ambition of the sover- eign was always directed to continental extension, and his naval power, resting on inadequate foundations, was epheme- ral. During the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century there was practically no check to the sea power of England ; great as were its effects upon the issues of the day, the ab- sence of a capable rival made its operations barren of military lessons. In the later wars of the French Republic and Em- 506 SPECIAL INTEREST OF THE WAR OF 1778. pire, the apparent equality in numbers of ships and weight of batteries was illusive, owing to the demoralization of the French officers and seamen by causes upon which it is not necessary here to enlarge. After some years of courageous but impotent effort, the tremendous disaster of Trafalgar proclaimed to the world the professional inefficiency of the French and Spanish navies, already detected by the keen eyes of Nelson and his brother officers, and upon which rested the contemptuous confidence that cliaracterized his attitude, and to some extent his tactics, toward them. Thenceforward the emperor " turned his eyes from the only field of battle where fortune had been unfaithful to him, and deciding to pursue England elsewhere than upon the seas, undertook to restore his navy, but without reserving to it any share in a strife become more than ever furious. . . . Up to the last day of the Empire he refused to offer to this restored navy, full of ardor and confidence, the opportunity to measure itself with the enemy." ^ Great Britain resumed her old position as unquestioned mis- tress of the seas. The student of naval war will therefore expect to find a particular interest in the plans and methods of the parties to this great contest, and especially where they concern the gen- eral conduct of the whole war, or of certain large and clearly defined portions of it ; in the strategic purpose which gave, or should have given, continuity to their actions from first to last, and in the strategic movements which affected for good or ill the fortunes of the more limited periods, which may be called naval campaigns. For while it cannot be conceded that the particular battles are, even at this day, wholly devoid of tactical instruction, which it has been one of the aims of the preceding pages to elicit, it is undoubtedly true that, like all the tactical systems of history, they have had their day, and their present usefulness to the student is rather in the mental training, in the forming of correct tacticial habits of thought, than in supplying models for close imitation. On the other hand, the movements which precede and prepare for great 1 Jurieu de la Gravi^re : Guerres Maritimes, vol. ii. p. 255. OBJECT AND OBJECTIVE. 507 battles, or wliich, by their skilful and energetic combinations, attain great ends without the actual contact of arms, depend upon factors more permanent than the weapons of the age, and therefore furnish principles of more enduring value. In a war undertaken for any object, even if that object be the possession of a particular territory or position, an attack directly upon the place coveted may not be, from the military point of view, the best means of obtaining it. The end upon which the military operations are directed may therefore be other than the object which the belligerent government wislies to obtain, and it has received a name of its own, — the objec- tive. In the critical consideration of any war it is necessary, first, to put clearly before the student's eye the objects desired by each belligerent ; then, to consider whether the objective chosen is the most likely, in case of success, to compass those objects ; and finally, to study the merits or faults of the vari- ous movements by which the objective is approached. The minuteness with which such an examination is conducted will depend upon the extent of the work which the inquirer pro- poses to himself ; but it will generally conduce to clearness if an outline, giving only the main features unencumbered by detail, should precede a more exhaustive discussion. When such principal lines are thoroughly grasped, details are easily referred to them, and fall into place. The effort here will be confined to presenting such an outline, as being alone fitted to the scope of this work. The principal parties to the War of 1778 were, on the one hand, Great Britain ; on the other, the House of Bourbon, controlling the two great kingdoms of France and Spain. The American colonies, being already engaged in an unequal struggle with the mother-country, gladly welcomed an event so important to them ; while in 1780 Holland was deliberately forced by England into a war from which she had nothing to gain and all to lose. The object of the Americans was per- fectly simple, — to rid their country out of the hands of the English. Their poverty and their lack of military sea power, with the exception of a few cruisers that preyed upon the 508 DISCUSSION OF THE WAK OF 1778. enemy's commerce, necessarily confined their efforts to land warfare, which constituted indeed a powerful diversion iu favor of the allies and an exhausting drain upon the resources of Great Britain, but which it was in the power of the latter to stop at once by abandoning the contest. Holland, on the other hand, being safe from invasion by land, showed little desire for anything more than to escape with as little external loss as possible, through the assistance of the allied navies. The object of these two minor parties may therefore be said to have been the cessation of the war ; whereas the principals hoped from its continuance certain changed con- ditions, which constituted their objects. With Great Britain also the object of the war was very simple. Having been led into a lamentable altercation with her most promising colonies, the. quarrel had gone on step by step till she was threatened with their loss. To main- tain forcible control when willing adhesion had departed, she had taken up arms against them, and her object in so doing was to prevent a break in those foreign possessions with which, in the eyes of that generation, her greatness was indissolubly connected. The appearance of France and Spain as active supporters of the colonists' cause made no change in England's objects, whatever change of objective her military plans may, or should, have undergone. The danger of losing the continental colonies was vastly increased by these accessions to the ranks of her enemies, which brought with them also a threat of loss, soon to be realized in part, of other valuable foreign possessions. England, in short, as regards the objects of the war, was strictly on the defensive ; she feared losing much, and at best only hoped to keep what she had. By forcing Holland into war, however, she obtained a military advantage ; for, without increasing the strength of her opponents, several important but ill-defended military and commercial positions were thereby laid open to her arras. The views and objects of France and Spain were more com- plex. The moral incentives of hereditary enmity and desire of revenge for the recent past doubtless weighed strongly, as OBJECTS OF THE BELLIGERENTS. 509 ill France did also the sympathy of the salons and philosophers Avith the colonists' struggle for freedom ; but powerfully as sentimental considerations affect the action of nations, only the tangible means by which it is expected to gratify them admit of statement and measurement. France might wish to regain her North American possessions ; but the then living generation of colonists had too keen personal recollection of the old contests to acquiesce in any such washes as to Canada. The strong inherited distrust of the French, Avhich charac- terized the Americans of the revolutionary era, has been too much overlooked in the glow of gratitude which followed the effectual sympathy and assistance then given ; but it was understood at the time, and France felt, that to renew those pretensions might promote, between people of the same race only recently alienated, a reconciliation by just concessions, which a strong and high-minded party of Englishmen had never ceased to advocate. She therefore did not avow, per- haps did not entertain, this object. On the contrary, she formally renounced all claim to any part of the continent which was then, or had recently been, under the power of the British crown, but stipulated for freedom of action in con- quering and retaining any of the West India Islands, while all the other colonies of Great Britain were, of course, open to her attack. The principal objects at which France aimed were therefore the English West Indies and that control of India which had passed into English hands, and also to secure in due time the independence of the United States, after they had wrought a sufficient diversion in her favor. With the policy of exclusive trade which characterized that generation, the loss of these important possessions was expected to lessen that commercial greatness upon which the prosperity of Eng- land depended, — to weaken her and to strengthen France. In fact, the strife which should be greater may be said to have been the animating motive of France ; all objects were summed up in the one supreme end to which they contrib- uted,— maritime and political superiority over England. Preponderance over England, in combination with France, 510 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. was also the aim of the equally humbled but less vigorous kingdom of Spain ; but there was a definiteness in the injuries suffered and the objects specially sought by her which is less easily found in the broader views of her ally. Although no Spaniard then living could remember the Spanish flag flying over Minorca, Gribraltar, or Jamaica, the lapse of time had not reconciled the proud and tenacious nation to their loss ; nor was there on the part of the Americans the same tradi- tional objection to the renewal of Spanish sovereignty over the two Floridas that was felt with reference to Canada. Such, then, were the objects sought by the two nations, whose interposition changed the whole character of the American Revolutionary War. It is needless to say that they did not all appear among the causes, or pretexts, avowed for engaging in hostility ; but sagacious English opinion of the day rightly noted, as embodying in a few words the real ground of action of the united Bourbon Courts, the following phrase in the French manifesto : " To avenge their respective injuries, and to put an end to that tyrannical empire which England has usurped, and claims to maintain upon the ocean." In short, as regards the objects of the war the allies were on the offen- sive, as England was thrown upon the defensive. The tyrannical empire which England was thus accused, and not unjustly, of exercising over the seas, rested upon her great sea power, actual or latent ; upon her commerce and armed shipping, her commercial establishments, colonies, and naval stations in all parts of the world. Up to this time her scattered colonies had been bound to her by ties of affectionate sentiment, and by the still stronger motive of self-interest through the close commercial connection with the mother- country and the protection afforded by the constant presence of her superior navy. Now a break was made in the girdle of strong ports upon which her naval power was based, by the revolt of the continental colonies ; while the numerous trade interests between them and the West Indies, which were in- jured by the consequent hostilities, tended to divide the sym- pathies of the islands also. The struggle was not onlv for THE CHOICE OF OBJECTIVES. 511 political possession and commercial use. It involved a mili- tary question of the first importance, — whether a chain of naval stations covering one of the shores of the Atlantic, link- ing Canada and Halifax with the West Indies, and backed by a thriving seafaring population, should remain in the hands of a nation which had so far used its unprecedented sea power with consistent, resolute aggressiveness, and with almost un- broken success. While Great Britain was thus embarrassed by the difficulty of maintaining her hold upon her naval bases, which were the defensive element of her naval strength, her ojffensive naval power, her fleet, was threatened by the growth of the armed shipping of France and Spain, which now confronted her upon the field which she had claimed as her own, with an organized military force of equal or superior material strength. The moment was therefore favorable for attacking the great Power whose wealth, reaped from the sea, had been a decisive factor in the European wars of the past century. The next question was the selection of the points of attack — of the principal ob- jectives upon w)nch the main effort of the assailants should be steadily directed, and of the secondary objectives by which the defence should be distracted and its strength dissipated. One of the wisest French statesmen of that day, Turgot, held that it was to the interest of France that the colonies should not achieve their independence. If subdued by exhaustion, their strength was lost to England ; if reduced by a military tenure of controlling points, but not exhausted, the necessity of con- stant repression would be a continual weakness to the mother- country. Though this opinion did not prevail in the councils of the French government, which wished the ultimate inde- pendence of America, it contained elements of truth which effectually moulded the policy of the war. If benefit to the United States, by effecting their deliverance, were the princi- pal object, the continent became the natural scene, and its decisive military points the chief objectives, of operations ; but as the first object of France was not to benefit America, but to injure England, sound military judgment dictated that the 512 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. continental strife, so far from being helped to a conclusion, should be kept in vigorous life. It was a diversion ready made to the hand of France and exhausting to Great Britain, requir- ing only so much support as would sustain a resistance to which the insurgents were bound by the most desperate alter- natives. The territory of the thirteen colonies therefore should not be the principal objective of France ; much less that of Spain. The commercial value of the English West Indies made them tempting objects to the French, who adapted themselves with peculiar readiness to the social conditions of that region, in which their colonial possessions were already extensive. Besides the two finest of the Lesser Antilles, Guadeloupe and Martinique, which she still retains, France then held Sta. Lucia and the western half of Hayti. She might well hope by successful war to add most of the English Antilles, and thus to round off a truly imperial tropical dependency; while, though debarred from Jamaica by the susceptibilities of Spain, it might be possible to win back that magnificent island for an allied and weaker nation. But however desirable as pos- sessions, and therefore as objects, the smaller Antilles might be, their military tenure depended too entirely upon control of the sea for them to be in themselves proper objectives. The French government, therefore, forbade its naval commanders to occupy such as they might seize. They were to make the garrisons prisoners, destroy the defences, and so retire. In the excellent military port of Fort Royal, Martinique, in Cap Francais, and in the strong allied harbor of Havana, a fleet of adequate size found good, secure, and well-distributed bases ; while the early and serious loss of Sta. Lucia must be attrib- uted to the mismanagement of the French fleet and the pro- fessional ability of the English admiral. On shore, in the West Indies, the rival powers therefore found themselves about equally provided with the necessary points of support ; mere occupation of others could not add to their military strength, thenceforth dependent upon the numbers and quality of the fleets. To extend occupation further with safety, the first need OBJECTIVES OF THE OPERATIONS. 513 was to obtain maritime supremacy, not only locally, but over the general field of war. Otherwise occupation was precarious, unless enforced by a body of troops so large as to entail ex- pense beyond the worth of the object. The key of the situa- tion in the West Indies being thus in the fleets, these became the true objectives of the military effort ; and all the more so because the real mUitary usefulness of the West Indian ports in this war was as an intermediate base, between Europe and the American continent, to which the fleets retired when the armies went into winter quarters. No sound strategic opera- tion on sliore was undertaken in the West Indies except the seizure of Sta. Lucia by the English, and the abortive plan against Jamaica in 1782 ; nor was any serious attempt against a military port, as Barbadoes or Fort Royal, possible, until naval preponderance was assured cither by battle or by happy concentration of force. The key of the situation, it must be repeated, was in the fleet. The influence of naval power, of an armed fleet, upon the war on the American continent has also been indicated in the opinions of Washington and Sir Henry Clinton : while the situation in the East Indies, regarded as a field by itself, has been so largely discussed under the head of Suffren's cam- paign, that it needs here only to repeat that everything there depended upon control of the sea by a superior naval force. The capture of Trincomalee, essential as it was to the French squadron which had no other base, was, like that of Sta. Lucia, a surprise, and could only have been effected by the defeat, or, as happened, by the absence of the enemy's fleet. In North America and India sound military policy pointed out, as the true objective, tlie enemy's fleet, upon which also depended the communications with the mother-countries. There remains Europe, which it is scarcely profitable to examine at length as a separate field of action, because its relations to the universal war are so much more important. It may simply be pointed out that the only two points in Europe whose political trans- fer was an object of the war were Gibraltar and Minorca ; the former of which was throughout, by the urgency of Spain, 33 514 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. made a principal objective of the allies. The tenure of both these depended, obviously, upon control of the sea. In a sea war, as in all others, two things are from the first essential, — a suitable base upon the frontier, in this case the seaboard, from which the operations start, and an organized military force, in this case a fleet, of size and quality adequate to the proposed operations. If the war, as in the present in- stance, extends to distant parts of the globe, there will be needed in each of those distant regions secure ports for the shipping, to serve as secondary, or contingent, bases of the local war. Between these secondary and the principal, or home, bases there must be reasonably secure communication, which will depend upon' military control of the intervening sea. This control must be exercised by the navy, which will enforce it either by clearing the sea in all directions of hostile cruisers, thus allowing the ships of its own nation to pass with reason- able security, or by accompanying in force (convoying) each train of supply-ships necessary for the support of the distant operations. The former method aims at a widely diffused effort of the national power, the other at a concentration of it upon that part of the sea where tlie convoy is at a given moment. Whichever be adopted, the communications will doubtless be strengthened by the military holding of good harbors, properly spaced yet not too numerous, along the routes, — as, for in- stance, the Cape of Good Hope and the Mauritius. Stations of this kind have always been necessary, but are doubly so now, as fuel needs renewing more frequently than did the provisions and supplies in former days. These combinations of strong poiuts at home and abroad, and the condition of the commu- nications between tliem, may be called the strategic features of the general military situation, by which, and by the rela- tive strength of the opposing fleets, the nature of the opera- tions must be determined. In each of the three divisions of the field, Europe, America, and India, under whicli for sake of clearness the narrative has been given, the control of the sea has been insisted upon as the determining factor, and the hostile fleet therefore indicated as the true objective. Let the THE BASES OF OPERATIONS. £^^5 foregoing considerations now be applied to the whole field of war, and see how far the same conclusion holds good of it, and if so, what should have been the nature of the operations on either side.^ In Europe the home base of Great Britain was on the Eng- lish Channel, with the two principal arsenals of Plymoutli and Portsmouth. The base of the allied powers was on the Atlantic, the principal military ports being Brest, Ferrol, and Cadiz. Behind these, within the Mediterranean, were the dock-yards of Toulon and Cartagena, over against which stood the English station Port Mahon, in Minorca. The latter, however, may be left wholly out of account, being confined to a defensive part during the war, as the British fleet was not able to spare any squadron to the Mediterranean. Gibraltar, on the contrary, by its position, effectually watched over de- tachments or reinforcements from Avithin the Straits, provided it were utilized as the station of a body of ships adequate to the duty. This was not done ; the British European fleet being kept tied to the Channel, that is, to home defence, and making infrequent visits to the Rock to convoy supplies essen- tial to the endurance of the garrison. There was, however, a difference in the parts played by Port Mahon and Gibraltar. The former, being at the time wholly unimportant, received no attention from the allies until late in the war, when it fell after a six months' siege ; whereas the latter, being considered of the first importance, absorbed from the beginning a very large part of the allied attack, and so made a valuable diver- sion in favor of Great Britain. To this view of the principal features of the natural strategic situation in Europe may properly be added the remark, that such aid as Holland might be inclined to send to the allied fleets had a very insecure line of communication, being forced to pass along the English base on the Channel. Such aid in fact was never given. In North America the local bases of the war at its outbreak were New York, Narragansett Bay, and Boston. The two former were then held by the English, and were the most im- 1 See map of the Atlantic Ocean, p. 532. 516 DISCUSSIOX OF THE WAR OF 1778. portant stations on the continent, from their position, suscep- tibility of defence, and resources. Boston had passed into the hands of the Americans, and was therefore at the service of the allies. Prom the direction actually given to the war, by diverting the active English operations to the Southern States in 1779, Boston was thrown outside the principal theatre of operations, and became from its position militarily unimpor- tant ; but had the plan been adopted of isolating New Eng- land by holding the line of tlie Hudson and Lake Champlain, and concentrating military effort to the eastward, it will be seen that these three ports would all have been of decisive importance to the issue. South of New York, the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays undoubtedly offered tempting fields for maritime enterprise ; but the width of the entrances, the want of suitable and easily defended points for naval sta- tions near the sea, the wide dispersal of the land forces entailed by an attempt to hold so many points, and the sick- liness of the locality during a great part of the year, should have excepted them from a principal part in the plan of the first campaigns. It is not necessary to include them among the local bases of the war. To the extreme south the English were drawn by the ignis fatuus of expected sup- port among the people. They failed t© consider that even if a majority there preferred quiet to freedom, that very quality would prevent them from rising against the revolutionary government by which, on the English theory, they were op- pressed ; yet upon such a rising the whole success of this distant and in its end most unfortunate enterprise was staked. The local base of this war apart was Charleston, which passed into the hands of the British in May, 1780, eighteen months after the first expedition had landed in Georgia. The principal local bases of the war in the West Indies are already known through the previous narrative. They were for the English, Barbadoes, Sta. Lucia, and to a less degree Antigua. A thousand miles to leeward was the large island of Jamaica, with a dock-yard of great natural capabilities at Kingston. The allies held, in the first order of importance? THE BASES OF OPERATIONS. 5I7 Fort Royal in Martinique, and Havana ; in the second order, Guadeloupe and Cap Franc^ais. A controlling feature of the strategic situation in that day, and one which will not be wholly without weight in our own, was the trade- wind, with its accompanying current. A passage to windward against these obstacles was a long and serious undertaking even for single ships, much more for larger bodies. It followed that fleets would go to the western islands only reluctantly, or when assured that the enemy had taken the same direction, as Rodney went to Jamaica after the Battle of the Saints, knowing the French fleet to have gone to Cap Franqais. This condition of the wind made the windward, or eastern, islands points on the natural lines of communication between Europe and America, as well as local bases of the naval war, and tied the fleets to them. Hence also it followed that between the two scenes of operations, between the continent and the Lesser Antilles, was interposed a wide central region into which the larger operations of war could not safely be carried except by a belligerent possessed of great naval superiority, or unless a decisive advantage had been gained upon one flank. In 1762, when England held all the Windward Islands, with undisputed superiority at sea, she safely attacked and subdued Havana ; but in the years 1779-1782 the French sea power in America and the French tenure of the Windward Islands practically balanced her own, leaving the Spaniards at Havana free to prosecute their designs against Pcnsacola and the Bahamas, in the central region mentioned.^ 1 It may be said here in passing, that the key to the English possessions in what was then called West Florida was at Pensacola and ilobile, which depended upon Jamaica for support ; the conditions of the country, of navipatiou, and of the general continental war forbidding assistance from the Atlantic. The English force, military and naval, at Jamaica was only adequate to the defence of the island and of trade, and could not afford sufficient relief to Florida. The cap- ture of the latter and of the Bahamas was effected with little difficulty by over- whelming Spanish forces, as many as fifteen ships-of-the-line and seven thousand troops having been employed against Pensacola. These events will receive no other mention. Their only bearing upon the general war was the diversion of this imposing force from joint operations with the French, Spain here, as at Gibraltar, pursuing her owu aims instead of concentrating upon the common enemy, — a policy as shortsighted as it was selnsL 518 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. Posts like Martinique and Sta. Lucia had therefore for the present war great strategic advantage over Jamaica, Havana, or others to leeward. They commanded the latter in virtue of their position, by which the passage westward could be made so much more quickly than the return ; while the de- cisive points of the continental struggle were practically little farther from the one than from the other. This advantage was shared equally by most of those known as the Lesser Antilles ; but the small island of Barbadoes, being well to windward of all, possessed peculiar advantages, not only for offensive action, but because it was defended by the difficulty with which a large fleet could approach it, even from so near a port as Fort Royal. It will be remembered that the expe- dition which finally sat down before St. Kitt's had been in- tended for Barbadoes, but could not reach it through the violence of the trade-wind. Thus Barbadoes, under the con- ditions of the time, was peculiarly fitted to be the local base and depot of the English war, as well as a wayside port of refuge on the line of communications to Jamaica, Florida, and even to North America ; while Sta, Lucia, a hundred miles to leeward, was held in force as an advanced post for the fleet, watching closely the enemy at Fort Royal. Li Lidia the political conditions of the peninsula neces- sarily indicated the eastern, or Coromandel, coast as the scene of operations. Trincomalee, in the adjacent island of Ceylon, though unhealthy, offered an excellent and defensible harbor, and thus acquired first-rate strategic importance, all the other anchorages on the coast being mere open roadsteads. From this circumstance the trade-winds, or monsoons, in this region also had strategic bearing. From the autumnal to the spring equinox the wind blows regularly from the north- east, at times with much violence, throwing a heavy surf upon the beach and making landing difficult ; but during the sum- mer months the prevailing wind is southwest, giving com- paratively smooth seas and good weather. The " change of the monsoon," in September and October, is often marked by violent hurricanes. Active operations, or even remaining THE BASES OF OPERATIONS. 519 on the coast, were therefore iiiiadvisable from this time until the close of the northeast monsoon. The question of a port to which to retire during this season was pressing. Trin- comalee was the only one, and its unique strategic value was heightened by being to windward, during the fine season, of the principal scene of war. The English harbor of Bombay on the west coast was too distant to be considered a local base, and rather falls, like the French islands Mauritius and Bour- bon, under the head of stations on the line of communica- tions with the motber-country. Such were the principal points of support, or bases, of the belligerent nations, at home and abroad. Of those abroad it must be said, speaking generally, that they were deficient in resources, — an important element of strategic value. Na- val and military stores and equipments, and to a great extent provisions for sea use, had to be sent them from the mother- countries. Boston, surrounded by a thriving, friendly popu- lation, was perhaps an exception to this statement, as was also Havana, at that time an important naval arsenal, where much ship-building was done ; but these were distant from the principal theatres of war. Upon New York and Narra- gansett Bay the Americans pressed too closely for the re- sources of the neighboring country to be largely available, while the distant ports of the East and West Indies depended wholly upon home. Hence the strategic question of commu- nications assumed additional importance. To intercept a large convoy of supply-ships was an operation only secondary to the destruction of a body of ships-of-war ; while to protect such by main strength, or by evading the enemy's search, taxed the skill of the governments and naval commanders in distributing the ships-of-war and squadrons at their dis- posal, among the many objects which demanded attention. The address of Kempenfeldt and the bad management of Guichen in the North Atlantic, seconded by a heavy gale of wind, seriously embarrassed De Grasse in the West Indies. Similar injury, by cutting off small convoys in the Atlantic, was done to Suffren in the Indian seas ; while the latter at 520 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. once made good part of these losses, and worried his oppo- nents by the success of his cruisers preying on the English supply-ships. Thus the navies, by which alone these vital streams could be secured or endangered, bore the same relation to the main- tenance of the general war that has already been observed of the separate parts. They were the links that bound the whole together, and were therefore indicated as the proper objective of both belligerents. The distance from Europe to America was not such as to make intermediate ports of supply absolutely necessary; while if difficulty did arise from an unforeseen cause, it was always possible, barring meeting an enemy, either to return to Europe or to make a friendly port in the West Indies. The case was different with the long voyage to India by the Cape of Good Hope. Bickerton, leaving England with a con- voy in February, was thought to have done well in reaching Bombay the following September ; while the ardent Suffren, sailing in Marcli, took an equal time to reach Mauritius, whence the passage to Madras consumed two months more. A voyage of such duration could rarely be made without a stop for water, for fresh provisions, often for such refitting as called for the quiet of a harbor, even when the stores on board furnished the necessary material. A perfect line of communications required, as has been said, several such har- bors, properly spaced, adequately defended, and with abun- dant supplies, such as England in the present day holds on some of her main commercial routes, acquisitions of her past wars. In the war of 1778 none of the belligerents had such ports on this route, until, by the accession of Holland, the Cape of Good Hope was put at the disposal of the French and suitably strengthened by Suffren. With this and the Mauritius on the way, and Trincomalee at the far end of the road, the communications of the allies with France were rea- sonably guarded. England, though then liolding St. Helena, depended, for the refreshment and refitting of her India- bound squadrons and convoys in the Atlantic, upon the THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION. 521 benevolent neutrality of Portugal, extended in tlic islands of Madeira and Cape Yerde and in the Brazilian ports. This neutrality was indeed a frail reliance for defence, as was shown by the encounter between Johnstone and Suffren at the Cape Yerde ; but there being several possible stopping- places, and the enemy unable to know which, if any, would be used, this ignorance itself conferred no small security, if the naval commander did not trust it to the neglect of proper disposition of his own force, as did Johnstone at Porto Praya. Indeed, with the delay and uncertainty which then character- ized the transmission of intelligence from one point to another, doubt where to find the enemy was a greater bar to offensive enterprises than the often slight defences of a colonial port. This combination of useful harbors and the conditions of the communications between them constitute, as has been said, the main strategic outlines of the situation. The navy, as the organized force linking the whole together, has been indicated as the principal objective of military effort. The method employed to reach the objective, the conduct of the war, is still to be considered.^ Before doing this a condition peculiar to the sea, and af- fecting the following discussion, must be briefly mentioned ; that is, the difficulty of obtaining information. Armies pass through countries more or less inhabited by a stationary pop- ulation, and they leave behind them traces of their march. Fleets move through a desert over which wanderers flit, but where they do not remain; and as the waters close behind them, an occasional waif from the decks may indicate their passage, but tells nothing of their course. The sail spoken by the pursuer may know nothing of the pursued, which yet passed the point of parley but a few days or hours before. Of late, careful study of the winds and currents of the ocean 1 In other words, having considered the objects for which the belligerents were at war and the proper objectives upon which their military efforts should have been directed to compass the objects, the discussion now considers how the military forces should have been handled ; by what means and at what point the objective, being mobile, should have been assailed. 522 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. has laid down certain advantageous routes, which will be ha- bitually followed by a careful seaman, and afford some pre- sumption as to his movements ; but in 1778 the data for such precision were not collected, and even had they been, the quickest route must often have been abandoned for one of the many possible ones, in order to elude pursuit or lying-in-wait. In such a game of hide-and-seek the advantage is with the sought, and the great importance of watching the outlets of an enemy's country, of stopping the chase before it has got away into the silent desert, is at once evident. If for any reason such a watch there is impossible, the next best thing is, not attempting to watch routes which may not be taken, to get first to the enemy's destination and await him there ; but this implies a knowledge of his intentions which may not always be obtainable. The action of Suffren, when pitted against Johnstone, was throughout strategically sound, both in his attack at Porto Praya and in the haste with which he made for their common destination ; while the two fail- ures of Rodney to intercept the convoys to Martinique in 1780 and 1782, though informed that they were coming, show the difficulty which attended lying-in-wait even when the point of arrival was known. Of any maritime expedition two points only are fixed, — the point of departure and that of arrival. The latter may be unknown to the enemy ; but up to the time of sailing, the presence of a certain force in a port, and the indications of a purpose soon to move, may be assumed as known. It may be of moment to either belligerent to intercept such a movement ; but it is more especially and universally neces- sary to the defence, because, of the many points at which he is open to attack, it may be impossible for him to know which is threatened ; whereas the offence proceeds with full knovvd- edge direct to his aim, if he can deceive his opponent. The importance of blocking such an expedition becomes yet more evident should it at any time be divided between two or more ports, — a condition which may easily arise when the facili- ties of a single dock-yard are insufficient to fit out so many STRATEGIC POSITIONS TO BE TAKEN. 523 ships in the time allowed, or when, as in the present war, allied powers furnish separate contingents. To prevent the junction of these contingents is a matter of prime necessity, and nowhere can this be done so certainly as off the ports whence one or both is to sail. The defence, from its very name, is presumably the less strong, and is therefore the more bound to take advantage of such a source of weakness as the division of the enemy's force. Rodney in 1782 at Sta. Lucia, watching the French contingent at Martinique to pre- vent its union with the Spaniards at Cap Frangais, is "an in- stance of correct strategic position ; and had the islands been so placed as to put him between the French and their desti- nation, instead of in their rear, nothing better could have been devised. As it was, he did the best thing possible under the circumstances. The defence, being the weaker, cannot attempt to block all the ports where divisions of the enemy lie, without defeating his aim by being in inferior force before each. This would be to neglect the fundamental principles of war. If he cor- rectly decide not to do this, but to collect a superior force before one or two points, it becomes necessary to decide which shall be thus guarded and which neglected, — a ques- tion involving the whole policy of the war after a full un- derstanding of the main conditions, military, moral, and economic, in every quarter. Tlie defensive was necessarily accepted by England in 1778. It had been a maxim with the best English naval authorities of the preceding era, with Hawke and his contemporaries, that the British navy should be kept equal in numbers to the com- bined fleets of the Bourbon kingdoms, — a condition which, with the better quality of the j^ersonnel and the larger mari- time population upon which it could draw, would have given a real superiority of force. This precaution, however, had not been observed during recent years. It is of no consequence to this discussion whether the failure was due to the ineffi- ciency of the ministry, as was charged by their opponents, or to the misplaced economy often practised by representative 524 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. governments in time of peace. The fact remains that, not- withstanding the notorious probability of France and Sj^ain joining in the war, the English navy was inferior in number to that of the allies. In what have been called the strategic features of the situation, the home bases, and the secondary bases abroad, the advantage upon the whole lay with her. Her positions, if not stronger in themselves, were at least better situated, geographically, for strategic effect ; but in the second essential for war, the organized military force, or fleet, adequate to offensive operations, she had been allowed to become inferior. It only remained, therefore, to use this in- ferior force with such science and vigor as would frustrate the designs of the enemy, by getting first to sea, taking positions skilfully, anticipating their combinations by greater quick- ness of movement, harassing their communications with their objectives, and meeting the principal divisions of the enemy with superior forces. It is sufficiently clear that the maintenance of this war, everywhere except on the American continent, depended upon the mother-countries in Europe and upon open communica- tion with them. The ultimate crushing of the Americans, too, not by direct military effort but by exhaustion, was proba- ble, if England were left unmolested to strangle their com- merce and industries with her overwhelming naval strength. This strength she could put forth against them, if relieved from the pressure of the allied navies ; and relief would be obtained if she could gain over them a decided preponder- ance, not merely material but moral, such as she had twenty years later. In that case the allied courts, whose financial weakness was well known, must retire from a contest in which their main purpose of reducing England to an inferior position was already defeated. Such preponderance, how- ever, could only be had by fighting ; by showing that, despite inferiority in numbers, the skill of her seamen and the re- sources of her wealth enabled her government, by a wise use of these powers, to be actually superior at the decisive points of the war. It could never be had by distributing the ships- ENGLAND UPON THE DEFENSIVE. 525 of-the-lhie all over the world, exposing them to be beaten in detail while endeavoring to protect all the exposed points of the scattered empire. The key of the situation was in Europe, and in Europe in the hostile dock-yards. If England w^ere unable, as she proved to be, to raise up a continental war against France, then her one hope was to find and strike down the enemy's navy. Nowhere was it so certainly to be found as in its home ports ; nowhere so easily met as immediately after leaving them. This dictated her policy in the Napoleonic wars, when the moral superiority of her navy was so established that she dared to oppose inferior forces to the combined dangers of the sea and of the more numerous and well-equipped ships lying quietly at anchor inside. By facing this double risk she ob- tained the double advantage of keeping the enemy under her eyes, and of sapping his efficiency by the easy life of port, while her own officers and seamen were hardened by the rigorous cruising into a perfect readiness for every call upon their energies. " We have no reason," proclaimed Admiral Villeneuve in 1805, echoing the words of the emperor, "to fear the sight of an English squadron. Their seventy-fours have not five hundred men on board ; they are worn out by a two years' cruise." ^ A month later he wrote : " The Toulon squadron appeared very fine in the harbor, the crews well clothed and drilling well ; but as soon as a storm came, all was changed. They were not drilled in storms." ^ " The em- peror," said Nelson, " now finds, if emperors hear truth, that his fleet suffers more in a night than ours in one year. . . . These gentlemen are not used to the hurricanes, which we have braved for twenty-one months without losing mast or yard."^ It must be admitted, however, that the strain was tremendous both on men and ships, and that many English officers found in the wear and tear an argument against keeping their fleets at sea off the enemy's coast. " Every 1 Orders of Admiral Villeneuve to the captains of his fleet, Dec. 20, 1804. 2 Letter of Villeneuve, January, 1805. » Letters and Despatches of Lord Nelson. 526 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. one of the blasts we endure," wrote Collingwood, "lessens the security of the country. The last cruise disabled five large ships and two more lately ; several of them must be docked." " I have hardly known what a night of rest is these two months," wrote he again ; " this incessant cruising seems to me beyond the powers of human nature. Calder is worn to a shadow, quite broken down, and I am told Graves is not much better." ^ The high professional opinion of Lord Howe was also adverse to the practice. Besides the exhaustion of men and ships, it must also be admitted that no blockade could be relied on certainly to check the exit of an enemy's fleet. Villcneuve escaped from Toulon, Missiessy from Rochefort. " I am here watching the French squadron in Rochefort," wrote Collingwood, " but feel that it is not practicable to prevent their sailing ; and yet, if they should get by me, I should be exceedingly mor- tified. . . . The only thing that can prevent their sailing is the apprehension that they may get among us, as they can- not know exactly where we are." ^ Nevertheless, the strain then was endured. The English fleets girdled the shores of France and Spain ; losses were made good ; ships were repaired ; as one officer fell, or was worn out at his post, another took his place. The strict guard over Brest broke up the emperor's combinations ; the watchfulness of Nelson, despite an unusual concurrence of difficulties, followed the Toulon fleet, from the moment of its starting, across the Atlantic and back to the shores of Eu- rope. It was long before they came to blows, before strategy stepped aside and tactics completed the work at Trafalgar ; but step by step and point by point the rugged but disci- plined seamen, the rusty and battered but well-handled ships, blocked eacli move of their unpractised opponents. Disposed in force before each arsenal of the enemy, and linked together by chains of smaller vessels, they might fail now and again to check a raid, but they effectually stopped all grand com- binations of the enemy's squadrons. 1 Life and Letters of Lord Collingwood. EXGLISII POLICY IN OTHER WARS. 527 The ships of 1805 were essentially the same as those of 1780. There had doubtless been progress and improvement ; but the changes were in degree, not in kind. Not only so, but the fleets of twenty years earlier, under Hawke and his fellows, had dared the winters of the Bay of Biscay. " There is not in Hawke's correspondence," says his biographer, " the slightest indication that he himself doubted for a moment that it was not only possible, but his duty, to keep the sea, even through the storms of winter, and that he should soon be able to ' make downright work of it.' " ^ If it be urged that the condition of the French navy was better, the character and training of its officers higher, tlian in the days of Hawke and Nelson, the fact must be admitted ; nevertheless, the ad- miralty could not long have been ignorant that the number of such officers was still so deficient as seriously to affect the quality of the deck service, and the lack of seamen so great as to necessitate filling up the complements witli soldiers. As for the personnel of the Spanish navy, there is no reason to believe it better than fifteen years later, when Nelson, speaking of Spain giving certain ships to France, said, " I take it for granted not manned [by Spaniards], as that would be the readiest way to lose them again." In truth, however, it is too evident to need much arguing, that the surest way for the weaker party to neutralize the enemy's ships was to watch them in their harbors and fight them if they started. The only serious objection to doing this, in Europe, was the violence of the weather off the coasts of France and Spain, especially during the long nights of winter. This brought with it not only risk of immediate dis- aster, which strong, well-managed ships would rarely undergo, but a continual strain which no skill could prevent, and which therefore called for a large reserve of ships to relieve those sent in for repairs, or to refresh the crews. The problem would be greatly simplified if the blockading fleet could find a convenient anchorage on the flank of the route the enemy must take, as Nelson in 180-1 and 1805 1 Burrows : Life of Lord Hawke. 528 DTSCUSSTON OF THE WAR OF 1778. used Maddalena Bay in Sardinia when watching the Toulon fleet, — a step to which he was further forced bj the excep- tionally bad condition of many of his ships. So Sir James Saumarez in 1800 even used Douarnenez Bay, on the French coast, only five miles from Brest, to anchor the in-shore squad- ron of the blockadhig force in heavy weather. The positions at Plymouth and Torbay cannot be considered perfectly satis- factory from this point of view ; not being, like Maddalena Bay, on the flank of the enemy's route, but like Sta. Lucia, rather to its rear. Nevertheless, Hawke proved that diligence and well-managed ships could overcome this disadvantage, as Rodney also afterward showed on his less tempestuous station. In the use of the ships at its disposal, taking the war of 1778 as a whole, the English ministry kept their foreign de- tachments in America, and in the West and East Indies, equal to those of tlie enemy. At particular times, indeed, this was not so ; but speaking generally of the assignment of ships, the statement is correct. In Europe, on the contrary, and in necessary consequence of the policy mentioned, the British fleet was habitually much inferior to that in the French and Spanish ports. It therefore could be used offensively only by great care, and through good fortune in meeting the enemy in detail ; and even so an expensive victory, unless very decisive, entailed considerable risk from the consequent temporary disability of the ships engaged. It followed that the English home (or Channel) fleet, upon which depended also the communications with Gibraltar and the Mediter- ranean, was used very economically both as to battle and weather, and was confined to the defence of the home coast, or to operations against the enemy's communications. India was so far distant that no exception can be taken to the policy there. Ships sent there went to stay, and could be neither reinforced nor recalled with a view to sudden emer- gencies. The field stood by itself. But Europe, North Amer- ica, and the West Indies should have been looked upon as one large theatre of war, throughout which events were mutually DISTRIBUTION OF THE BRITISH NAVY. 529 dependent, and whose different parts stood in close relations of greater or less importance, to which due attention should have been paid. Assuming- that the navies, as the guardians of the communi- cations, were the controlling factors in the war, and that the source, both of the navies and of those streams of supplies which are called communications, was in tlie mother-countries, and there centralized in the chief arsenals, two things follow : First, the main effort of the Power standing on the defensive, of Great Britain, should have been concentrated before those arsenals ; and secondly, in order to such concentration, the lines of communication abroad should not have been need- lessly extended, so as to increase beyond the strictest ne- cessity the detachments to guard them. Closely connected with the last consideration is the duty of strengthening, by fortification and otherwise, the vital points to which the com- munications led, so that these points should not depend in any way upon the fleet for protection, but only for supplies and reinforcements, and those at reasonable intervals. Gib- raltar, for instance, quite fulfilled these conditions, being practically impregnable, and storing supplies that lasted very long. If this reasoning be correct, the English dispositions on the American continent were very faulty. Holding Canada, with Halifax, New York, and Narragansett Bay, and with the line of the Hudson within their grip, it was in their power to isolate a large, perhaps decisive, part of the insurgent ter- ritory. New York and Narragansett Bay could have been made unassailable by a French fleet of that day, thus as- suring the safety of the garrisons against attacks from the sea and minimizing the task of the navy ; while the latter would find in them a secure refuge, in case an enemy's force eluded the watch of the English fleet before a European arsenal and appeared on the coast. Instead of this, these two ports were left weak, and would have fallen before a Nelson or a Farragut, while the army in New York was twice divided, first to the Chesapeake and afterward to 31 530 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. Georgia, neither part of the separated forces being strong enough for the work before it. The control of the sea was thus used in both cases to put the enemy between the divided portions of the EngUsh army, when the latter, un- divided, had not been able to force its way over the ground thus interposed. As the communication between the two parts of the army depended wholly upon the sea, the duty of the navy was increased with the increased length of the lines of communication. The necessity of protecting the seaports and the lengthened lines of communication thus combined to augment the naval detachments in America, and to weaken proportionately the naval force at tlie decisive points in Europe. Thus also a direct consequence of the southern expedition was the hasty abandonment of Narra- gansett Bay, when D'Estaing appeared on the coast in 1779, because Clinton had not force enough to defend both it and New York.i In the West Indies the problem before the English govern- ment was not to subdue revolted territory, but to preserve the use of a number of small, fruitful islands ; to keep possession of them itself, and to maintain their trade as free as possible from the depredations of the enemy. It need not be repeated that this demanded predominance at sea over both the ene- my's fleets and single cruisers, — " commerce-destroyers," as the latter are now styled. As no vigilance can confine all these to their ports, the West Indian waters must be patrolled by British frigates and lighter vessels ; but it would surely be better, if possible, to keep the French fleet away altogether than to hold it in check by a British fleet on the spot, of only equal force at any time, and liable to fall, as it often did, below equality. England, being confined to the defensive, 1 Of this Eodney said : " The evacuating Rhode Island was the most fatal measure that could possibly be adopted. It gave up the best and noblest harbor in America, from whence squadrons, in forty-eight hours, could blockade the three capital cities of America, namely, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia." The whole letter, private to the First Lord of the Admiralty, is worth reading. (Life of Rodney, vol. ii. p. 429.) FAULTS OF THE ENGLISH POLICY. 53 1 was always liable to loss when thus inferior. She actually did lose one by one, by sudden attack, most of her islands, and at different times had her fleet shut up under the batteries of a port ; whereas the enemy, when he found himself in- ferior, was able to wait for reinforcements, knowing that he had nothing to fear while so waiting.^ Nor was this embarrassment confined to the "West Indies. The nearness of the islands to the American continent made it always possible for the offence to combine his fleets in the two quarters before the defence could be sure of his purpose ; and although such combinations were controlled in some measure by well-understood conditions of weather and the seasons, the events of 1780 and 1781 show the perplexity felt from this cause by the ablest English admiral, whose dispositions, though faulty, but reflected the uncertainties of his mind. When to this embarrassment, which is common to the defensive in all cases, is added the care of the great British trade upon which the prosperity of the empire mainly depended, it must be conceded that the task of the British admiral in the West Indies was neither light nor simple. In Europe, the safety of England herself and of Gibraltar was gravely imperilled by the absence of these large de- tachments in the Western Hemisphere, to Avhich may also be attributed the loss of Minorca. When sixty-six allied ships- of-the-line confronted the thirty-five which alone England could collect, and drove them into their harbors, there was realized that mastery of the Channel which Napoleon claimed would make him beyond all doubt master of England. For thirty days, the thirty ships which formed the French contingent had cruised i« the Bay of Biscay, awaiting the arrival of the tardy Spaniards ; but they were not disturbed by the English fleet. Gibraltar was more than once brought within sight of starvation, through the failure of communications with Eng- ^ The loss of Sta. Lucia does not militate against this statement, being due to happy audacity and skill on the part of the English admiral, and tlie professional incapacity of the commander of the greatly superior French fleet. 532 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. land ; and its deliverance was due, not to the power of the English navy suitably disposed by its government, but to the skill of Britisli officers and the inefficiency of the Spaniards. In the great final relief, Lord Howe's fleet numbered only thirty-four to the allied forty-nine. Which, then, in the difficulties under which England labored, was the better course, — to allow the enemy free exit from his ports and endeavor to meet him by maintaining a sufficient naval force on each of the exposed stations, or to attempt to watch his arsenals at home, under all the difficulties of the situation, not with the vain hope of preventing every raid, or intercepting every convoy, but with the expectation of frus- trating the greater combinations, and of following close at the heels of any large fleet that escaped ? Such a watch must not be confounded with a blockade, a term frequently, but not quite accurately, applied to it. " I beg to inform your Lordship," wrote Nelson, " that the port of Toulon has never been blockaded by me ; quite the reverse. Every opportunity has been offered the enemy to put to sea, for it is there we hope to realize the hopes and expectations of our country." " Nothing," he says again, " ever kept the French fleet in Toulon or Brest when they had a mind to come out ; " and although the statement is somewhat exaggerated, it is true that the attempt to shut them up in port would have been hopeless. What Nelson expected by keeping near their ports, with enough lookout ships properly distributed, was to know when they sailed and what direction they took, intending, to use his own expression, to " follow them to the antipodes." " I am led to believe," he writes at another time, " that the Ferrol squadron of French ships will push for the Mediter- ranean. If it join that in Toulon, it will much outnumber us ; but I shall never lose sight of them, and Pellew (commanding the English squadron off Ferrol) will soon be after them." So it happened often enough during that prolonged war that divisions of French ships escaped, through stress of weather, temporary absence of a blockading fleet, or misjudgment on the part of its commander ; but the alarm was quickly given, NEWrOUNOIAND CAFK Vfe PorroPraya / N 1 A B R 4 " 0 K T4 Mar (Aiourqlad 4ILNTD7 & oLnt ( Lautanun Mont Lcone (ivaau LT Tetar Wa Bot u Tein ET Lunu nmN ELOL_uArAL HAnHC ' ~Atec QAAet Fantdor WE r EILALAror Fe BEn-DuC, HALT [ JAAAC Aectautte Guulle Litee Guadlor Drtam: CA Lonququ€ glun r'usluirt Stlrcent #rbadori ~ead Tobag0 Canercn Jti FO ova t Wt! ~Djlinen Ul _ ILt 0 Titato #alin ENGLISH NAVAL POLICY IN OTHER WARS. 533 some of the many frigates caught sight of tliem, followed to detect their probable destination, passed the word from point to point and from fleet to fleet, and soon a division of equal force was after them, " to the antipodes " if need were. As, according to the traditional use of the French navy by French governments, their expeditions went not to fight the hostile fleet, but with " ulterior objects," the angry buzz and hot pursuit that immediately followed was far from conducive to an undisturbed and methodical execution of the programme laid down, even by a single division ; while to great combi- nations, dependent upon uniting the divisions from different ports, they were absolutely fatal. The adventurous cruise of Bruix, leaving Brest with twenty-five ships-of-the-line in 1799, the rapidity with which the news spread, the stirring action and individual mistakes of the English, the frustration of the French projects ^ and the closeness of the pursuit,^ the escape of Missiessy from Rochefort in 1805, of the divisions of Willaumez and Leissegues from Brest in 1806, — all these may be named, along with the great Trafalgar cam- paign, as affording interesting studies of a naval strategy following the lines here suggested ; while the campaign of 1798, despite its brilliant ending at the Nile, may be cited as a case where failure nearly ensued, owing to the English having no force before Toulon when the expedition sailed, and to Nelson being insufficiently provided with frigates. The nine weeks' cruise of Gantcaume in the Mediterranean, in 1808, also illustrates the difficulty of controlling a fleet which has been permitted to get out, unwatched by a strong force, even in such narrow waters. No parallel instances can be cited from the war of 1778, although the old monarchy did not cover the movements of ^ The plan of campaign traced by the Directory for Bruix became impossible of execution ; the delay in the junction of the French and Spanish squadrons having permitted England to concentrate sixty ships in the Mediterranean. — Troitde, vol. iii. p. 158. 2 The combined squadrons of France and Spain, under Bruix, reached Brest on their return only twenty-four hours before Lord Keith, who had followed them from the Mediterranean. (James : Naval History of Great Britain.) 534 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. its fleets with the secrecy enforced by the stern military despotism of the Empire. In both epochs England stood on the defensive ; but in the earlier war she gave up the first line of the defence, off the hostile ports, and tried to protect all parts of her scattered empire by dividing the fleet among them. It has been attempted to show the weakness of the one policy, while admitting the difficulties and dangers of the other. The latter aims at shortening and deciding the war by either shutting up or forcing battle upon the hostile navy, recognizing that this is the key of the situation, when the sea at once unites and separates the different parts of the theatre of war. It requires a navy equal in number and superior in efficiency, to which it assigns a limited field of action, narrowed to the conditions which admit of mutual support among the squadrons occupying it. Thus distributed, it relies upon skill and watchfulness to intercept or overtake any division of the enemy which gets to sea. It defends remote possessions and trade by offensive action against the fleet, in which it sees their real enemy and its own principal objective. Being near the home ports, the relief and renewal of ships needing repairs are accomplished with the least loss of time, while the demands upon the scan- tier resources of the bases abroad are lessened. The other policy, to be effective, call sfor superior numbers, because the different divisions are too far apart for mutual support. Each must therefore be equal to any probable combination against it, which implies superiority everywhere to the force of the enemy actually opposed, as the latter may be unexpectedly reinforced. How impossible and dangerous such a defensive strategy is, when not superior in force, is shown by the fre- quent inferiority of the English abroad, as well as in Europe, despite the effort to be everywhere equal. Howe at New York in 1778, Byron at Grenada in 1779, Graves off the Chesa- peake in 1781, Hood at Martinique in 1781 and at St. Kitt's in 1782, all were inferior, at the same time that the allied fleet in Europe overwhelmingly outnumbered the English. In con- sequence, unseaworthy ships were retained, to the danger of TWO NAVAL POLICIES COMPARED. 535 their crews and their own increasing injury, rather than di- minish the force by sending them home ; for the deficiencies of the colonial dock-yards did not allow extensive repairs without crossing the Atlantic. As regards the comparative expense of the two strategies, the question is not only which would cost the more in the same time, but which would most tend to shorten the war by the effectiveness of its action. The military policy of the allies is open to severer condem- nation than that of England, by so much as the party assum- ing the offensive has by that Tery fact an advantage over the defensive. When the initial difficulty of combining their forces was overcome, — and it has been seen that at no time did Great Britain seriously embarrass their junction, — the allies had the choice open to them where, when, and how to sti'ike with their superior numbers. How did they avail themselves of this recognized enormous advantage ? By nib- bling at the outskirts of the British Empire, and knocking their heads against the Rock of Gibraltar. The most seri- ous military effort made by France, in sending to the United States a squadron and division of troops intended to be double the number of those which actually reached their destination, resulted, in little over a year, in opening the eyes of England to the hopelessness of the contest with the colonies, and thus put an end to a diversion of her strength which had been most beneficial to her opponents. In the West Indies one petty island after another was reduced, generally in the ab- sence of the English fleet, with an ease which showed how completely the whole question would have been solved by a decisive victory over tliat fleet ; but the French, though fa- vored with many opportunities, never sought to slip the knot by the simple method of attacking the force upon which all depended. Spain went her own way in the Floridas, and with an overwhelming force obtained successes of no military value. In Europe the plan adopted by tlie English govern- ment left its naval force hopelessly inferior in numbers year after year ; yet the operations planned by the allies seem in 536 DISCUSSION OF THE WAR OF 1778. no case seriously to have contemplated the destruction of that force. In the crucial instance, when Derby's squadron of thirty sail-of-the-line was hemmed in the open roadstead of Torbay by the allied forty-nine, the conclusion of the council of war not to fight only epitomized the character of the action of the combined navies. To further embarrass their ex- ertions in Europe, Spain, during long periods, obstinately persisted in tying down her fleet to the neighborhood of Gibraltar ; but there was at no time practical recognition of the fact that a severe blow to the English navy in the Straits, or in the English Channel, or on the open sea, was the surest road to reduce the fortress, brought more than once within measurable distance of starvation. In the conduct of their offensive war the allied courts suffered from the divergent counsels and jealousies which have hampered the movements of most naval coalitions. The conduct of Spain appears to have been selfish almost to dis- loyalty, that of France more faithful, and therefore also militarily sounder ; for hearty co-operation and concerted action against a common objective, wisely chosen, would have better forwarded the objects of both. It must be admitted, too, that the indications point to inefficient administration and preparation on the part of the allies, of Spain especially; and that the quality of the personnel ^ was inferior to that of ^ The high professional attainments of many of the French officers is not overlooked in this statement. The cjuality of the personnel was diluted hy an inferior element, owing to the insufficient number of good men. " The person- nel of our crews had been seriously affected by the events of the campaign of 1779. At the beginning of 1780 it was necessary either to disarm some ships, or to increase the proportion of soldiers entering into the composition of the crews. The minister adopted the latter alternative. New regiments, drawn from the land army, were put at the disposal of the navy. The corps of officers, far from numerous at the beginning of liostilities, had become completely inadequate. Eear-Admiral de Guichen met the greatest difficulty in forming the comple- ments, both officers and crews, for his squadron. He took the sea, Feb- ruary 3, with ships 'badly manned,' as he wrote to the minister." (Chevalier: Hist, de la Marine Franc^aise, p. 184.) "During the last war [of 1778] we had met the greatest difficulty in supplying officers to our sliips. If it had been easy to name admirals, commodores, and captains, it had l)een impossible to MISTAKES OF THE ALLIES. 537 England. Questions of preparation and administration, how- ever, though of deep military interest and importance, are very different from the strategic plan or method adopted by the allied courts in selecting and attacking their objectives, and so compassing the objects of the war ; and their exami- nation -would not only extend this discussion unreasonably, hut would also obscure the strategic question by heaping up unnecessary details foreign to its subject. As regards the strategic question, it may be said pithily that the phrase " ulterior objects " embodies the cardinal fault of the naval policy. Ulterior objects brought to nought the hopes of the allies, because, by fastening their eyes upon them, they thoughtlessly passed the road which led to them. De- sire eagerly directed upon the ends in view — or rather upon the partial, though great, advantages which they constituted their ends — blinded them to the means by which alone they could be surely attained ; hence, as the result of the war, everywhere failure to attain them. To quote again the summary before given, their object was " to avenge their respective injuries, and to put an end to that tyrannical em- pire which England claims to maintain upon the ocean." The revenge they had obtained was barren of benefit to them- selves. They had, so that generation thought, injured Eng- land by liberating America ; but they had not righted their wrongs in Gibraltar and Jamaica, the English fleet had not received any such treatment as would lessen its haughty self- reliance, the armed neutrality of the northern powers had been allowed to pass fruitlessly away, and the English em- pire over the seas soon became as tyrannical and more abso- lute than before. Barring questions of preparation and administration, of the fighting quality of the allied fleets as compared with the English, and looking only to the indisputable fact of largely superior numbers, it must be noted as the supreme fill the vacancies caused by death, sickness, or promotion among officers of the rank of lieutenant and ensign." (Chevalier : Marine Fran9aise sous la Republique, p. 20.) 538 FUNDAMEyTAL ERROR OF THE ALLIES. factor in the military conduct of the war, that, while the allied powers were on the offensive and England on the defensive, the attitude of the allied fleets in presence of the English navy was habitually defensive. Neither in the greater strate- gic combinations, nor upon the battlefield, does there appear any serious purpose of using superior numbers to crush frac- tions of the enemy's fleet, to make the disparity of numbers yet greater, to put an end to the empire of the seas by the destruction of the organized force which sustained it. With the single brilliant exception of Suffren, the allied navies avoided or accepted action ; they never imposed it. Yet so long as the English navy was permitted thus with impunity to range the seas, not only was there no security that it would not frustrate the ulterior objects of the campaign, as it did again and again, but there was always the possil^ility that by some happy chance it would, by winning an important vic- tory, restore the balance of strength. That it did not do so is to be imputed as a fault to the English ministry ; but if England was wrong in permitting her European fleet to fall so far below that of the allies, the latter were yet more to blame for their failure to profit by the mistake. The stronger party, assuming the offensive, cannot plead the perplexities which account for, though they do not justify, the undue dispersal of forces by the defence anxious about many points. The national bias of the French, which found expression in the line of action here again and for the last time criticised, appears to have been shared by both the government and the naval officers of the day. It is the key to the course of the French navy, and, in the opinion of the author, to its failure to achieve more substantial results to France from this war. It is instructive, as showing how strong a hold tradition has over the minds of men, that a body of highly accomplished and gallant seamen should have accepted, apparently without a murmur, so inferior a role for their noble profession. It carries also a warning, if these criticisms are correct, that current opinions and plausible impressions should always be FALLACY OF COMMERCE-DESTROYING. 539 thoroughly tested ; for if erroneous they work sure failure, and perhaps disaster. There was such an impression largely held by French offi- cers of that day, and yet more widely spi-ead in the United States now, of the efiicacy of commerce-destroying as a main reliance in war, especially when directed against a commercial country like Great Britain. " The surest means in my opin- ion," wrote a distinguished officer, Lamotte-Picquet, " to con- quer the English is to attack them in their commerce." The harassment and distress caused to a country by serious inter- ference with its commerce will be conceded by all. It is doubtless a most important secondary operation of naval war, and is not likely to be abandoned till war itself shall cease ; but regarded as a primary and fundamental measure, sufficient in itself to crush an enemy, it is probably a delusion, and a most dangerous delusion, when presented in the fascinating garb of cheapness to the representatives of a people. Espe- cially is it misleading when the nation against whom it is to be directed possesses, as Great Britain did and does, the two requisites of a strong sea power, — a wide-spread healthy com- merce and a powerful navy. Where the revenues and indus- tries of a country can be concentrated into a few treasure- ships, like the flota of Spanish galleons, the sinew of war may perhaps be cut by a stroke ; but when its wealth is scattered in thousands of going and coming ships, when the roots of the system spread wide and far, and strike deep, it can stand many a cruel shock and lose many a goodly bough without the life being touched. Only by military command of the sea by prolonged control of the strategic centres of commerce, can such an attack be fatal ; ^ and such control can be wrung 1 The vital centre of Ensjlish commerce is in the waters surrounding the Brit- ish Islands; and as the United Kingdom now depends largely upon external sources of food-supply, it follows that France is the nation most favorably situated to harass it by commerce-destroying, on account of her nearness and her posses- sion of ports both on the Atlantic and the North Sea. From these issued the pri- vateers which in the past preyed upon English shipping. The position is stronger now than formerly, Cherbourg presenting a good Channel port which France lacked in tlie old wars. On the other hand, steam and railroads have made the 540 CONDITIONS OF PEACE, 1783. from a powerful navy only by fighting and overcoming it. For two hundred years England has been the great commer- cial nation of the world. More than any other her wealth has been intrusted to the sea in war as in peace ; yet of all nations she has ever been most reluctant to concede the immunities of commerce and the rights of neutrals. Regarded not as a matter of right, but of policy, history has justified the refusal ; and if she maintain her navy in full strength, the future will doubtless repeat the lesson of the past. The preliminaries of the peace between Great Britain and the allied courts, which brought to an end this great war, were signed at Versailles, January 20, 1783, an arrangement having been concluded between Great Britain and the Ameri- can Commissioners two months before, by which the indepen- dence of tlie United States was conceded. This was the great outcome of the war. As between the European belligerents, Great Britain received back from Prance all the West India Islands she had lost, except Tobago, and gave up Sta. Lucia. The French stations in India were restored ; and Trincomalee being in the possession of the enemy, England could not dispute its return to Holland, but she refused to cede Nega- patam. To Spain, England surrendered the two Floridas and Minorca, the latter a serious loss had the naval power of Spain been sufficient to maintain possession of it ; as it was, it again' ports on the northern coasts of the United Kingdom more available, and British shipping need not, as formerly, focus about the Channel. Much importance has been attached to the captures made during the late sum- mer manoeuvres (1888) by cruisers in and near the English Channel. The United States must remember that such cruisers were near their home ports. Their line of coal-supply may have been two hundred miles ; it would be a very different thing to maintain them in activity three thousand miles from home. The fur- nishing of coal, or of such facilities as cleaning the bottom or necessary repairs, in such a case, would be so unfriendly to Great Britain, that it may well be doubted if any neighboring neutral nation would allow them. Commerce-destroying by independent cruisers depends upon wide dissemina- tion of force. Commerce-destroying through control of a strategic centre by a great fleet depends upon concentration of force. Regarded as a primary, not as a secondary, operation, the former is condemned, the latter justified, by the experi- ence of centuries. CONDITIONS OF PEACE, 1783. 541 fell into the hands of Great Britain in the next war. Some unimportant redistribution of trading-posts on the v/est coast of Africa was also made. Trivial in themselves, there is but one comment that need be made upon these arrangements. In any coming war their permanency would depend wholly upon the balance of sea power, upon that empire of the seas concerning which noth- ing conclusive had been established by the war. The definitive treaties of peace were signed at Versailles, September 3, 1783. INDEX.

There seems indeed to be something essentially antagonistic between the habit of mind that seeks theoretical guidance and that which makes for the successful conduct of war. The conduct of war is so much a question of personality, of character, of common-sense, of rapid decision upon complex and ever-shifting factors, and those factors themselves are so varied, so intangible, so dependent upon unstable moral and physical conditions, that it seems incapable of being reduced to anything like true scientific analysis. At the bare idea of a theory or "science" of war the mind recurs uneasily to well-known cases where highly "scientific" officers failed as leaders. Yet, on the other hand, no one will deny that since the great theorists of the early nineteenth century attempted to produce a reasoned theory of war, its planning and conduct have acquired a method, a precision, and a certainty of grasp which were unknown before. Still less will any one deny the value which the shrewdest and most successful leaders in war have placed upon the work of the classical strategical writers. The truth is that the mistrust of theory arises from a misconception of what it is that theory claims to do. It does not pretend to give the power of conduct in the field; it claims no more than to increase the effective power of conduct. Its main practical value is that it can assist a capable man to acquire a broad outlook whereby he may be [pg 2] [pg 3] [pg 4] the surer his plan shall cover all the ground, and whereby he may with greater rapidity and certainty seize all the factors of a sudden situation. The greatest of the theorists himself puts the matter quite frankly. Of theoretical study he says, "It should educate the mind of the man who is to lead in war, or rather guide him to self-education, but it should not accompany him on the field of battle." Its practical utility, however, is not by any means confined to its effects upon the powers of a leader. It is not enough that a leader should have the ability to decide rightly; his subordinates must seize at once the full meaning of his decision and be able to express it with certainty in well-adjusted action. For this every man concerned must have been trained to think in the same plane; the chief's order must awake in every brain the same process of thought; his words must have the same meaning for all. If a theory of tactics had existed in 1780, and if Captain Carkett had had a sound training in such a theory, he could not possibly have misunderstood Rodney's signal. As it was, the real intention of the signal was obscure, and Rodney's neglect to explain the tactical device it indicated robbed his country of a victory at an hour of the direst need. There had been no previous theoretical training to supply the omission, and Rodney's fine conception was unintelligible to anybody but himself. Nor is it only for the sake of mental solidarity between a chief and his subordinates that theory is indispensable. It is of still higher value for producing a similar solidarity between him and his superiors at the Council table at home. How often have officers dumbly acquiesced in ill-advised operations simply for lack of the mental power and verbal apparatus to convince an impatient Minister where the errors of his plan lay? How often, moreover, have statesmen and officers, even in the most harmonious conference, been unable to decide on a coherent plan of war from inability to analyse scientifically the situation they had to face, and to recognise the general character of the struggle in which they were about to engage. That the true nature of a war should be realised by contemporaries as clearly as it comes to be seen afterwards in the fuller light of history is seldom to be expected. At close range accidental factors will force themselves into undue prominence and tend to obscure the true horizon. Such error can scarcely ever be eliminated, but by theoretical study we can reduce it, nor by any other means can we hope to approach the clearness of vision with which posterity will read our mistakes. Theory is, in fact, a question of education and deliberation, and not of execution at all. That depends on the combination of intangible human qualities which we call executive ability. This, then, is all the great authorities ever claimed for theory, but to this claim the chief of them at least, after years of active service on the Staff, attached the highest importance. "In actual operations," he wrote in one of his latest memoranda, "men are guided solely by their judgment, and it will hit the mark more or less accurately according as they possess more or less genius. This is the way all great generals have acted.... Thus it will always be in action, and so far judgment will suffice. But when it is a question not of taking action yourself, but of convincing others at the Council table, then everything depends on clear conceptions and the exposition of the inherent relations of things. So little progress has been made in this respect that most deliberations are merely verbal contentions which rest on no firm foundation, and end either in every one retaining his own opinion, or in a compromise from considerations of mutual respect—a middle course of no actual value."1 The writer's experience of such discussions was rich and at first hand. Clear conceptions of the ideas and factors involved in a war problem, and a definite exposition of the relations between them, were in his eyes the remedy for loose and purposeless discussion; and such conceptions and expositions are all we mean by the theory or the science of war. It is a process by which we co-ordinate our ideas, define the meaning of the words we use, grasp the difference between essential and unessential factors, and fix and expose the fundamental data on which every one is agreed. In this way we prepare the apparatus of practical discussion; we secure the means of arranging the factors in manageable shape, and of deducing from them with precision and rapidity a practical course of action. Without such an apparatus no two men can even think on the same line; much less can they ever hope to detach the real point of difference that divides them and isolate it for quiet solution. In our own case this view of the value of strategical theory has a special significance, and one far wider than its continental enunciators contemplated. For a world-wide maritime Empire the successful conduct of war will often turn not only on the decisions of the Council chamber at home, but on the outcome of conferences in all parts of the world between squadronal commanders and the local authorities, both civil and military, and even between commanders-in-chief of adjacent stations. In time of war or of preparation for war, in which the Empire is concerned, arrangements must always be based to an exceptional degree on the mutual relation of naval, military, and political considerations. The line of mean efficiency, though indicated from home, must be worked out locally, and worked out on factors of which no one service is master. Conference is always necessary, and for conference to succeed there must be a common vehicle of expression and a common plane of thought. It is for this essential preparation that theoretical study alone can provide; and herein lies its practical value for all who aspire to the higher responsibilities of the Imperial service. [pg 5] [pg 6] [pg 7] [pg 8] So great indeed is the value of abstract strategical study from this point of view, that it is necessary to guard ourselves against over-valuation. So far from claiming for their so-called science more than the possibilities we have indicated, the classical strategists insist again and again on the danger of seeking from it what it cannot give. They even repudiate the very name of "Science." They prefer the older term "Art." They will permit no laws or rules. Such laws, they say, can only mislead in practice, for the friction to which they are subject from the incalculable human factors alone is such that the friction is stronger than the law. It is an old adage of lawyers that nothing is so misleading as a legal maxim, but a strategical maxim is undoubtedly and in every way less to be trusted in action. What then, it will be asked, are the tangible results which we can hope to attain from theory? If all on which we have to build is so indeterminate, how are any practical conclusions to be reached? That the factors are infinitely varied and difficult to determine is true, but that, it must be remembered, is just what emphasises the necessity of reaching such firm standpoints as are attainable. The vaguer the problem to be solved, the more resolute must we be in seeking points of departure from which we can begin to lay a course, keeping always an eye open for the accidents that will beset us, and being always alive to their deflecting influences. And this is just what the theoretical study of strategy can do. It can at least determine the normal. By careful collation of past events it becomes clear that certain lines of conduct tend normally to produce certain effects; that wars tend to take certain forms each with a marked idiosyncrasy; that these forms are normally related to the object of the war and to its value to one or both belligerents; that a system of operations which suits one form may not be that best suited to another. We can even go further. By pursuing an historical and comparative method we can detect that even the human factor is not quite indeterminable. We can assert that certain situations will normally produce, whether in ourselves or in our adversaries, certain moral states on which we may calculate. Having determined the normal, we are at once in a stronger position. Any proposal can be compared with it, and we can proceed to discuss clearly the weight of the factors which prompt us to depart from the normal. Every case must be judged on its merits, but without a normal to work from we cannot form any real judgment at all; we can only guess. Every case will assuredly depart from the normal to a greater or less extent, and it is equally certain that the greatest successes in war have been the boldest departures from the normal. But for the most part they have been departures made with open eyes by geniuses who could perceive in the accidents of the case a just reason for the departure. Take an analogous example, and the province of strategical theory becomes clear at once. Navigation and the parts of seamanship that belong to it have to deal with phenomena as varied and unreliable as those of the conduct of war. Together they form an art which depends quite as much as generalship on the judgment of individuals. The law of storms and tides, of winds and currents, and the whole of meteorology are subject to infinite and incalculable deflections, and yet who will deny nowadays that by the theoretical study of such things the seaman's art has gained in coherence and strength? Such study will not by itself make a seaman or a navigator, but without it no seaman or navigator can nowadays pretend to the name. Because storms do not always behave in the same way, because currents are erratic, will the most practical seaman deny that the study of the normal conditions are useless to him in his practical decisions? If, then, the theoretical study of strategy be approached in this way—if, that is, it be regarded not as a substitute for judgment and experience, but as a means of fertilising both, it can do no man harm. Individual thought and common-sense will remain the masters and remain the guides to point the general direction when the mass of facts begins to grow bewildering. Theory will warn us the moment we begin to leave the beaten track, and enable us to decide with open eyes whether the divergence is necessary or justifiable. Above all, when men assemble in Council it will hold discussion to the essential lines, and help to keep side issues in their place. But beyond all this there lies in the theory of war yet another element of peculiar value to a maritime Empire. We are accustomed, partly for convenience and partly from lack of a scientific habit of thought, to speak of naval strategy and military strategy as though they were distinct branches of knowledge which had no common ground. It is the theory of war which brings out their intimate relation. It reveals that embracing them both is a larger strategy which regards the fleet and army as one weapon, which co-ordinates their action, and indicates the lines on which each must move to realise the full power of both. It will direct us to assign to each its proper function in a plan of war; it will enable each service to realise the better the limitations and the possibilities of the function with which it is charged, and how and when its own necessities must give way to a higher or more pressing need of the other. It discloses, in short, that naval strategy is not a thing by itself, that its problems can seldom or never be solved on naval considerations alone, but that it is only a part of maritime strategy—the higher learning which teaches us that for a maritime State to make successful war and to realise her special strength, army and navy must be used and thought of as instruments no less intimately connected than are the three arms ashore. [pg 9] [pg 10] [pg 11] It is for these reasons that it is of little use to approach naval strategy except through the theory of war. Without such theory we can never really understand its scope or meaning, nor can we hope to grasp the forces which most profoundly affect its conclusions. PART ONE THEORY OF WAR CHAPTER ONE THE THEORY OF WAR The last thing that an explorer arrives at is a complete map that will cover the whole ground he has travelled, but for those who come after him and would profit by and extend his knowledge his map is the first thing with which they will begin. So it is with strategy. Before we start upon its study we seek a chart which will show us at a glance what exactly is the ground we have to cover and what are the leading features which determine its form and general characteristics. Such a chart a "theory of war" alone can provide. It is for this reason that in the study of war we must get our theory clear before we can venture in search of practical conclusions. So great is the complexity of war that without such a guide we are sure to go astray amidst the bewildering multiplicity of tracks and obstacles that meet us at every step. If for continental strategy its value has been proved abundantly, then for maritime strategy, where the conditions are far more complex, the need of it is even greater. By maritime strategy we mean the principles which govern a war in which the sea is a substantial factor. Naval strategy is but that part of it which determines the movements of the fleet when maritime strategy has determined what part the fleet must play in relation to the action of the land forces; for it scarcely needs saying that it is almost impossible that a war can be decided by naval action alone. Unaided, naval pressure can only work by a process of exhaustion. Its effects must always be slow, and so galling both to our own commercial community and to neutrals, that the tendency is always to accept terms of peace that are far from conclusive. For a firm decision a quicker and more drastic form of pressure is required. Since men live upon the land and not upon the sea, great issues between nations at war have always been decided—except in the rarest cases—either by what your army can do against your enemy's territory and national life or else by the fear of what the fleet makes it possible for your army to do. The paramount concern, then, of maritime strategy is to determine the mutual relations of your army and navy in a plan of war. When this is done, and not till then, naval strategy can begin to work out the manner in which the fleet can best discharge the function assigned to it. The problem of such co-ordination is one that is susceptible of widely varying solutions. It may be that the command of the sea is of so urgent an importance that the army will have to devote itself to assisting the fleet in its special task before it can act directly against the enemy's territory and land forces; on the other hand, it may be that the immediate duty of the fleet will be to forward military action ashore before it is free to devote itself whole-heartedly to the destruction of the enemy's fleets. The crude maxims as to primary objects which seem to have served well enough in continental warfare have never worked so clearly where the sea enters seriously into a war. In such cases it will not suffice to say the primary object of the army is to destroy the enemy's army, or that of the fleet to destroy the enemy's fleet. The delicate interactions of the land and sea factors produce conditions too intricate for such blunt solutions. Even the initial equations they present are too complex to be reduced by the simple application of rough-and-ready maxims. Their right handling depends upon the broadest and most fundamental principles of war, and it is as a standpoint from which to get a clear and unobstructed view of the factors in their true relations that a theory of war has perhaps its highest value. The theory which now holds the field is that war in a fundamental sense is a continuation of policy by other means. The process by which the continental strategists arrived at it involved some hard philosophical reasoning. [pg 13] [pg 15] [pg 16] [pg 17] Practical and experienced veterans as they were, their method is not one that works easily with our own habit of thought. It will be well, therefore, to endeavour first to present their conclusions in a concrete form, which will make the pith of the matter intelligible at once. Take, now, the ordinary case of a naval or military Staff being asked to prepare a war plan against a certain State and to advise what means it will require. To any one who has considered such matters it is obvious the reply must be another question—What will the war be about? Without a definite answer or alternative answers to that question a Staff can scarcely do more than engage in making such forces as the country can afford as efficient as possible. Before they take any sure step further they must know many things. They must know whether they are expected to take something from the enemy, or to prevent his taking something either from us or from some other State. If from some other State, the measures to be taken will depend on its geographical situation and on its relative strength by land and sea. Even when the object is clear it will be necessary to know how much value the enemy attaches to it. Is it one for which he will be likely to fight to the death, or one which he will abandon in the face of comparatively slight resistance? If the former, we cannot hope to succeed without entirely overthrowing his powers of resistance. If the latter, it will suffice, as it often has sufficed, to aim at something less costly and hazardous and better within our means. All these are questions which lie in the lap of Ministers charged with the foreign policy of the country, and before the Staff can proceed with a war plan they must be answered by Ministers. In short, the Staff must ask of them what is the policy which your diplomacy is pursuing, and where, and why, do you expect it to break down and force you to take up arms? The Staff has to carry on in fact when diplomacy has failed to achieve the object in view, and the method they will use will depend on the nature of that object. So we arrive crudely at our theory that war is a continuation of policy, a form of political intercourse in which we fight battles instead of writing notes. It was this theory, simple and even meaningless as it appears at first sight, that gave the key to the practical work of framing a modern war plan and revolutionised the study of strategy. It was not till the beginning of the nineteenth century that such a theory was arrived at. For centuries men had written on the "Art of War," but for want of a working theory their labours as a whole had been unscientific, concerned for the most part with the discussion of passing fashions and the elaboration of platitudes. Much good work it is true was done on details, but no broad outlook had been obtained to enable us to determine their relation to the fundamental constants of the subject. No standpoint had been found from which we could readily detach such constants from what was merely accidental. The result was a tendency to argue too exclusively from the latest examples and to become entangled in erroneous thought by trying to apply the methods which had attained the last success to war as a whole. There was no means of determining how far the particular success was due to special conditions and how far it was due to factors common to all wars. It was the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, coinciding as they did with a period of philosophic activity, that revealed the shallowness and empirical nature of all that had been done up to that time. Napoleon's methods appeared to his contemporaries to have produced so strenuous a revolution in the conduct of land warfare that it assumed a wholly new aspect, and it was obvious that those conceptions which had sufficed previously had become inadequate as a basis of sound study. War on land seemed to have changed from a calculated affair of thrust and parry between standing armies to a headlong rush of one nation in arms upon another, each thirsting for the other's life, and resolved to have it or perish in the attempt. Men felt themselves faced with a manifestation of human energy which had had no counterpart, at least in civilised times. The assumption was not entirely true. For although the Continent had never before adopted the methods in question, our own country was no stranger to them either on sea or land. As we shall see, our own Revolution in the seventeenth century had produced strenuous methods of making war which were closely related to those which Napoleon took over from the French Revolutionary leaders. A more philosophic outlook might have suggested that the phenomenon was not really exceptional, but rather the natural outcome of popular energy inspired by a stirring political ideal. But the British precedent was forgotten, and so profound was the disturbance caused by the new French methods that its effects are with us still. We are in fact still dominated by the idea that since the Napoleonic era war has been essentially a different thing. Our teachers incline to insist that there is now only one way of making war, and that is Napoleon's way. Ignoring the fact that he failed in the end, they brand as heresy the bare suggestion that there may be other ways, and not content with assuming that his system will fit all land wars, however much their natures and objects may differ, they would force naval warfare into the same uniform under the impression apparently that they are thereby making it presentable and giving it some new force. Seeing how cramping the Napoleonic idea has become, it will be convenient before going further to determine its special characteristics exactly, but that is no easy matter. The moment we approach it in a critical spirit, it begins to grow nebulous and very difficult to define. We can dimly make out four distinct ideas mingled in the current notion. First, there is the idea of making war not merely with a professional standing army, but with the whole [pg 18] [pg 19] [pg 20] armed nation—a conception which of course was not really Napoleon's. It was inherited by him from the Revolution, but was in fact far older. It was but a revival of the universal practice which obtained in the barbaric stages of social development, and which every civilisation in turn had abandoned as economically unsound and subversive of specialisation in citizenship. The results of the abandonment were sometimes good and sometimes bad, but the determining conditions have been studied as yet too imperfectly to justify any broad generalisation. Secondly, there is the idea of strenuous and persistent effort—not resting to secure each minor advantage, but pressing the enemy without pause or rest till he is utterly overthrown—an idea in which Cromwell had anticipated Napoleon by a century and a half. Scarcely distinguishable from this is a third idea—that of taking the offensive, in which there was really nothing new at all, since its advantages had always been understood, and Frederick the Great had pressed it to extremity with little less daring than Napoleon himself—nay even to culpable rashness, as the highest exponents of the Napoleonic idea admit. Finally, there is the notion of making the armed forces of the enemy and not his territory or any part of it your main objective. This perhaps is regarded as the strongest characteristic of Napoleon's methods, and yet even here we are confused by the fact that undoubtedly on some very important occasions—the Austerlitz campaign, for example—Napoleon made the hostile capital his objective as though he believed its occupation was the most effective step towards the overthrow of the enemy's power and will to resist. He certainly did not make the enemy's main army his primary objective—for their main army was not Mack's but that of the Archduke Charles. On the whole then, when men speak of the Napoleonic system they seem to include two groups of ideas—one which comprises the conception of war made with the whole force of the nation; the other, a group which includes the Cromwellian idea of persistent effort, Frederick's preference for the offensive at almost any risk, and finally the idea of the enemy's armed forces as the main objective, which was also Cromwell's. It is the combination of these by no means original or very distinct ideas that we are told has brought about so entire a change in the conduct of war that it has become altogether a different thing. It is unnecessary for our purpose to consider how far the facts seem to support such a conclusion, for in the inherent nature of things it must be radically unsound. Neither war nor anything else can change in its essentials. If it appears to do so, it is because we are still mistaking accidents for essentials, and this is exactly how it struck the acutest thinkers of Napoleonic times. For a while it is true they were bewildered, but so soon as they had had time to clear their heads from the din of the struggle in which they had taken part, they began to see that the new phenomena were but accidents after all. They perceived that Napoleon's methods, which had taken the world by storm, had met with success in wars of a certain nature only, and that when he tried to extend those methods to other natures of war he had met with failure and even disaster. How was this to be explained? What theory, for instance, would cover Napoleon's successes in Germany and Italy, as well as his failures in Spain and Russia? If the whole conception of war had changed, how could you account for the success of England, who had not changed her methods? To us the answer to these questions is of living and infinite importance. Our standpoint remains still unchanged. Is there anything inherent in the conception of war that justifies that attitude in our case? Are we entitled to expect from it again the same success it met with in the past? The first man to enunciate a theory which would explain the phenomena of the Napoleonic era and co-ordinate them with previous history was General Carl von Clausewitz, a man whose arduous service on the Staff and the actual work of higher instruction had taught the necessity of systematising the study of his profession. He was no mere professor, but a soldier bred in the severest school of war. The pupil and friend of Sharnhorst and Gneisenau, he had served on the Staff of Blücher in 1813, he had been Chief of the Staff to Wallmoden in his campaign against Davoust on the Lower Elbe, and also to the Third Prussian Army Corps in the campaign of 1815. Thereafter for more than ten years he was Director of the General Academy of War at Berlin, and died in 1831 as Chief of the Staff to Marshal Gneisenau. For the fifty years that followed his death his theories and system were, as he expected they would be, attacked from all sides. Yet to-day his work is more firmly established than ever as the necessary basis of all strategical thought, and above all in the "blood and iron" school of Germany. The process by which he reached his famous theory can be followed in his classical work On War and the Notes regarding it which he left behind him. In accordance with the philosophic fashion of his time he began by trying to formulate an abstract idea of war. The definition he started with was that "War is an act of violence to compel our opponent to do our will." But that act of violence was not merely "the shock of armies," as Montecuccoli had defined it a century and a half before. If the abstract idea of war be followed to its logical conclusion, the act of violence must be performed with the whole of the means at our disposal and with the utmost exertion of our will. Consequently we get the conception of two armed nations flinging themselves one upon the other, and continuing the struggle with the utmost strength and energy they can command till one or other is no longer capable of resistance. This Clausewitz called "Absolute War." But his practical experience and ripe study of history told him [pg 21] [pg 22] [pg 23] [pg 24] [pg 25] at once that "Real War" was something radically different. It was true, as he said, that Napoleon's methods had approximated to the absolute and had given some colour to the use of the absolute idea as a working theory. "But shall we," he acutely asks, "rest satisfied with this idea and judge all wars by it however much they may differ from it—shall we deduce from it all the requirements of theory? We must decide the point, for we can say nothing trustworthy about a war plan until we have made up our minds whether war should only be of this kind or whether it may be of another kind." He saw at once that a theory formed upon the abstract or absolute idea of war would not cover the ground, and therefore failed to give what was required for practical purposes. It would exclude almost the whole of war from Alexander's time to Napoleon's. And what guarantee was there that the next war would confirm to the Napoleonic type and accommodate itself to the abstract theory? "This theory," he says, "is still quite powerless against the force of circumstances." And so it proved, for the wars of the middle nineteenth century did in fact revert to the pre-Napoleonic type. In short, Clausewitz's difficulty in adopting his abstract theory as a working rule was that his practical mind could not forget that war had not begun with the Revolutionary era, nor was it likely to end with it. If that era had changed the conduct of war, it must be presumed that war would change again with other times and other conditions. A theory of war which did not allow for this and did not cover all that had gone before was no theory at all. If a theory of war was to be of any use as a practical guide it must cover and explain not only the extreme manifestation of hostility which he himself had witnessed, but every manifestation that had occurred in the past or was likely to recur in the future. It was in casting about for the underlying causes of the oscillations manifested in the energy and intensity of hostile relations that he found his solution. His experience on the Staff, and his study of the inner springs of war, told him it was never in fact a question of purely military endeavour aiming always at the extreme of what was possible or expedient from a purely military point of view. The energy exhibited would always be modified by political considerations and by the depth of the national interest in the object of the war. He saw that real war was in fact an international relation which differed from other international relations only in the method we adopted to achieve the object of our policy. So it was he arrived at his famous theory—"that war is a mere continuation of policy by other means." At first sight there seems little enough in it. It may seem perhaps that we have been watching a mountain in labour and nothing but a mouse has been produced. But it is only upon some such simple, even obvious, formula that any scientific system can be constructed with safety. We have only to develop the meaning of this one to see how important and practical are the guiding lines which flow from it. With the conception of war as a continuation of political intercourse before us, it is clear that everything which lies outside the political conception, everything, that is, which is strictly peculiar to military and naval operations, relates merely to the means which we use to achieve our policy. Consequently, the first desideratum of a war plan is that the means adopted must conflict as little as possible with the political conditions from which the war springs. In practice, of course, as in all human relations, there will be a compromise between the means and the end, between the political and the military exigencies. But Clausewitz held that policy must always be the master. The officer charged with the conduct of the war may of course demand that the tendencies and views of policy shall not be incompatible with the military means which are placed at his disposal; but however strongly this demand may react on policy in particular cases, military action must still be regarded only as a manifestation of policy. It must never supersede policy. The policy is always the object; war is only the means by which we obtain the object, and the means must always keep the end in view. The practical importance of this conception will now become clear. It will be seen to afford the logical or theoretical exposition of what we began by stating in its purely concrete form. When a Chief of Staff is asked for a war plan he must not say we will make war in such and such a way because it was Napoleon's or Moltke's way. He will ask what is the political object of the war, what are the political conditions, and how much does the question at issue mean respectively to us and to our adversary. It is these considerations which determine the nature of the war. This primordial question settled, he will be in a position to say whether the war is of the same nature as those in which Napoleon's and Moltke's methods were successful, or whether it is of another nature in which those methods failed. He will then design and offer a war plan, not because it has the hall-mark of this or that great master of war, but because it is one that has been proved to fit the kind of war in hand. To assume that one method of conducting war will suit all kinds of war is to fall a victim to abstract theory, and not to be a prophet of reality, as the narrowest disciples of the Napoleonic school are inclined to see themselves. Hence, says Clausewitz, the first, the greatest and most critical decision upon which the Statesman and the General have to exercise their judgment is to determine the nature of the war, to be sure they do not mistake it for something nor seek to make of it something which from its inherent conditions it can never be. "This," he declares, "is the first and the most far-reaching of all strategical questions." [pg 26] [pg 27] [pg 28] The first value, then, of his theory of war is that it gives a clear line on which we may proceed to determine the nature of a war in which we are about to engage, and to ensure that we do not try to apply to one nature of war any particular course of operations simply because they have proved successful in another nature of war. It is only, he insists, by regarding war not as an independent thing but as a political instrument that we can read aright the lessons of history and understand for our practical guidance how wars must differ in character according to the nature of the motives and circumstances from which they proceed. This conception, he claims, is the first ray of light to guide us to a true theory of war and thereby enable us to classify wars and distinguish them one from another. Jomini, his great contemporary and rival, though proceeding by a less philosophical but no less lucid method, entirely endorses this view. A Swiss soldier of fortune, his experience was much the same as that of Clausewitz. It was obtained mainly on the Staff of Marshal Ney and subsequently on the Russian headquarter Staff. He reached no definite theory of war, but his fundamental conclusions were the same. The first chapter of his final work, Précis de l'art de la Guerre, is devoted to "La Politique de la Guerre." In it he classifies wars into nine categories according to their political object, and he lays it down as a base proposition "That these different kinds of war will have more or less influence on the nature of the operations which will be demanded to attain the end in view, on the amount of energy that must be put forth, and on the extent of the undertakings in which we must engage." "There will," he adds, "be a great difference in the operations according to the risks we have to run." Both men, therefore, though on details of means they were often widely opposed, are agreed that the fundamental conception of war is political. Both of course agree that if we isolate in our mind the forces engaged in any theatre of war the abstract conception reappears. So far as those forces are concerned, war is a question of fighting in which each belligerent should endeavour by all means at his command and with all his energy to destroy the other. But even so they may find that certain means are barred to them for political reasons, and at any moment the fortune of war or a development of the political conditions with which it is entangled may throw them back upon the fundamental political theory. That theory it will be unprofitable to labour further at this point. Let it suffice for the present to mark that it gives us a conception of war as an exertion of violence to secure a political end which we desire to attain, and that from this broad and simple formula we are able to deduce at once that wars will vary according to the nature of the end and the intensity of our desire to attain it. Here we may leave it to gather force and coherence as we examine the practical considerations which are its immediate outcome. CHAPTER TWO NATURES OF WARS— OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE Having determined that wars must vary in character according to the nature and importance of their object, we are faced with the difficulty that the variations will be of infinite number and of all degrees of distinction. So complex indeed is the graduation presented that at first sight it appears scarcely possible to make it the basis of practical study. But on further examination it will be seen that by applying the usual analytical method the whole subject is susceptible of much simplification. We must in short attempt to reach some system of classification; that is, we must see if it is not possible to group the variations into some well-founded categories. With a subject so complex and intangible the grouping must of course be to some extent arbitrary, and in some places the lines of demarcation will be shadowy; but if classification has been found possible and helpful in Zoology or Botany, with the infinite and minute individual variations with which they have to deal, it should be no less possible and helpful in the study of war. The political theory of war will at any rate give us two broad and well-marked classifications. The first is simple and well known, depending on whether the political object of the war is positive or negative. If it be positive— that is, if our aim is to wrest something from the enemy—then our war in its main lines will be offensive. If, on the other hand, our aim be negative, and we simply seek to prevent the enemy wresting some advantage to our detriment, then the war in its general direction will be defensive. [pg 29] [pg 30] [pg 31] [pg 32] It is only as a broad conception that this classification has value. Though it fixes the general trend of our operations, it will not in itself affect their character. For a maritime Power at least it is obvious that this must be so. For in any circumstances it is impossible for such a Power either to establish its defence or develop fully its offence without securing a working control of the sea by aggressive action against the enemy's fleets. Furthermore, we have always found that however strictly our aim may be defensive, the most effective means of securing it has been by counter-attack over-sea, either to support an ally directly or to deprive our enemy of his colonial possessions. Neither category, then, excludes the use of offensive operations nor the idea of overthrowing our enemy so far as is necessary to gain our end. In neither case does the conception lead us eventually to any other objective than the enemy's armed forces, and particularly his naval forces. The only real difference is this—that if our object be positive our general plan must be offensive, and we should at least open with a true offensive movement; whereas if our object be negative our general plan will be preventive, and we may bide our time for our counter-attack. To this extent our action must always tend to the offensive. For counter- attack is the soul of defence. Defence is not a passive attitude, for that is the negation of war. Rightly conceived, it is an attitude of alert expectation. We wait for the moment when the enemy shall expose himself to a counter- stroke, the success of which will so far cripple him as to render us relatively strong enough to pass to the offensive ourselves. From these considerations it will appear that, real and logical as the classification is, to give it the designation "offensive and defensive" is objectionable from every point of view. To begin with, it does not emphasise what the real and logical distinction is. It suggests that the basis of the classification is not so much a difference of object as a difference in the means employed to achieve the object. Consequently we find ourselves continually struggling with the false assumption that positive war means using attack, and negative war being content with defence. That is confusing enough, but a second objection to the designation is far more serious and more fertile of error. For the classification "offensive and defensive" implies that offensive and defensive are mutually exclusive ideas, whereas the truth is, and it is a fundamental truth of war, that they are mutually complementary. All war and every form of it must be both offensive and defensive. No matter how clear our positive aim nor how high our offensive spirit, we cannot develop an aggressive line of strategy to the full without the support of the defensive on all but the main lines of operation. In tactics it is the same. The most convinced devotee of attack admits the spade as well as the rifle. And even when it comes to men and material, we know that without a certain amount of protection neither ships, guns, nor men can develop their utmost energy and endurance in striking power. There is never, in fact, a clean choice between attack and defence. In aggressive operations the question always is, how far must defence enter into the methods we employ in order to enable us to do the utmost within our resources to break or paralyse the strength of the enemy. So also with defence. Even in its most legitimate use, it must always be supplemented by attack. Even behind the walls of a fortress men know that sooner or later the place must fall unless by counter-attack on the enemy's siege works or communications they can cripple his power of attack. It would seem, therefore, that it were better to lay aside the designation "offensive and defensive" altogether and substitute the terms "positive and negative." But here again we are confronted with a difficulty. There have been many wars in which positive methods have been used all through to secure a negative end, and such wars will not sit easily in either class. For instance, in the War of Spanish Succession our object was mainly to prevent the Mediterranean becoming a French lake by the union of the French and Spanish crowns, but the method by which we succeeded in achieving our end was to seize the naval positions of Gibraltar and Minorca, and so in practice our method was positive. Again, in the late Russo-Japanese War the main object of Japan was to prevent Korea being absorbed by Russia. That aim was preventive and negative. But the only effective way of securing her aim was to take Korea herself, and so for her the war was in practice positive. On the other hand, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that in the majority of wars the side with the positive object has acted generally on the offensive and the other generally on the defensive. Unpractical therefore as the distinction seems to be, it is impossible to dismiss it without inquiring why this was so, and it is in this inquiry that the practical results of the classification will be found to lie—that is, it forces us to analyse the comparative advantages of offence and defence. A clear apprehension of their relative possibilities is the corner stone of strategical study. Now the advantages of the offensive are patent and admitted. It is only the offensive that can produce positive results, while the strength and energy which are born of the moral stimulation of attack are of a practical value that outweighs almost every other consideration. Every man of spirit would desire to use the offensive whether his object were positive or negative, and yet there are a number of cases in which some of the most energetic masters of war have chosen the defensive, and chosen with success. They have chosen it when they have found themselves inferior in physical force to their enemy, and when they believed that no amount of aggressive spirit could redress that inferiority. [pg 33] [pg 34] [pg 35] Obviously, then, for all the inferiority of the defensive as a drastic form of war it must have some inherent advantage which the offensive does not enjoy. In war we adopt every method for which we have sufficient strength. If, then, we adopt the less desirable method of defence, it must be either that we have not sufficient strength for offence, or that the defence gives us some special strength for the attainment of our object. What, then, are these elements of strength? It is very necessary to inquire, not only that we may know that if for a time we are forced back upon the defensive all is not lost, but also that we may judge with how much daring we should push our offensive to prevent the enemy securing the advantages of defence. As a general principle we all know that possession is nine points of the law. It is easier to keep money in our pocket than to take it from another man's. If one man would rob another he must be the stronger or better armed unless he can do it by dexterity or stealth, and there lies one of the advantages of offence. The side which takes the initiative has usually the better chance of securing advantage by dexterity or stealth. But it is not always so. If either by land or sea we can take a defensive position so good that it cannot be turned and must be broken down before our enemy can reach his objective, then the advantage of dexterity and stealth passes to us. We choose our own ground for the trial of strength. We are hidden on familiar ground; he is exposed on ground that is less familiar. We can lay traps and prepare surprises by counter-attack, when he is most dangerously exposed. Hence the paradoxical doctrine that where defence is sound and well designed the advantage of surprise is against the attack. It will be seen therefore that whatever advantages lie in defence they depend on the preservation of the offensive spirit. Its essence is the counter-attack—waiting deliberately for a chance to strike—not cowering in inactivity. Defence is a condition of restrained activity—not a mere condition of rest. Its real weakness is that if unduly prolonged it tends to deaden the spirit of offence. This is a truth so vital that some authorities in their eagerness to enforce it have travestied it into the misleading maxim, "That attack is the best defence." Hence again an amateurish notion that defence is always stupid or pusillanimous, leading always to defeat, and that what is called "the military spirit" means nothing but taking the offensive. Nothing is further from the teaching or the practice of the best masters. Like Wellington at Torres Vedras, they all at times used the defensive till the elements of strength inherent in that form of war, as opposed to the exhausting strain inherent in the form that they had fixed upon their opponents, lifted them to a position where they in their turn were relatively strong enough to use the more exhausting form. The confusion of thought which has led to the misconceptions about defence as a method of war is due to several obvious causes. Counter-attacks from a general defensive attitude have been regarded as a true offensive, as, for instance, in Frederick the Great's best-known operations, or in Admiral Tegetthoff's brilliant counterstroke at Lissa, or our own operations against the Spanish Armada. Again, the defensive has acquired an ill name by its being confused with a wrongly arrested offensive, where the superior Power with the positive object lacked the spirit to use his material superiority with sufficient activity and perseverance. Against such a Power an inferior enemy can always redress his inferiority by passing to a bold and quick offensive, thus acquiring a momentum both moral and physical which more than compensates his lack of weight. The defensive has also failed by the choice of a bad position which the enemy was able to turn or avoid. A defensive attitude is nothing at all, its elements of strength entirely disappear, unless it is such that the enemy must break it down by force before he can reach his ultimate objective. Even more often has it failed when the belligerent adopting it, finding he has no available defensive position which will bar the enemy's progress, attempts to guard every possible line of attack. The result is of course that by attenuating his force he only accentuates his inferiority. Clear and well proven as these considerations are for land warfare, their application to the sea is not so obvious. It will be objected that at sea there is no defensive. This is generally true for tactics, but even so not universally true. Defensive tactical positions are possible at sea, as in defended anchorages. These were always a reality, and the mine has increased their possibilities. In the latest developments of naval warfare we have seen the Japanese at the Elliot Islands preparing a real defensive position to cover the landing of their Second Army in the Liaotung Peninsula. Strategically the proposition is not true at all. A strategical defensive has been quite as common at sea as on land, and our own gravest problems have often been how to break down such an attitude when our enemy assumed it. It usually meant that the enemy remained in his own waters and near his own bases, where it was almost impossible for us to attack him with decisive result, and whence he always threatened us with counterattack at moments of exhaustion, as the Dutch did at Sole Bay and in the Medway. The difficulty of dealing decisively with an enemy who adopted this course was realised by our service very early, and from first to last one of our chief preoccupations was to prevent the enemy availing himself of this device and to force him to fight in the open, or at least to get between him and his base and force an action there. Probably the most remarkable manifestation of the advantages that may be derived in suitable conditions from a strategical defensive is also to be found in the late Russo-Japanese War. In the final crisis of the naval struggle the [pg 36] [pg 37] [pg 38] Japanese fleet was able to take advantage of a defensive attitude in its own waters which the Russian Baltic fleet would have to break down to attain its end, and the result was the most decisive naval victory ever recorded. The deterrent power of active and dexterous operations from such a position was well known to our old tradition. The device was used several times, particularly in our home waters, to prevent a fleet, which for the time we were locally too weak to destroy, from carrying out the work assigned to it. A typical position of the kind was off Scilly, and it was proved again and again that even a superior fleet could not hope to effect anything in the Channel till the fleet off Scilly had been brought to decisive action. But the essence of the device was the preservation of the aggressive spirit in its most daring form. For success it depended on at least the will to seize every occasion for bold and harassing counter-attacks such as Drake and his colleagues struck at the Armada. To submit to blockade in order to engage the attention of a superior enemy's fleet is another form of defensive, but one that is almost wholly evil. For a short time it may do good by permitting offensive operations elsewhere which otherwise would be impossible. But if prolonged, it will sooner or later destroy the spirit of your force and render it incapable of effective aggression. The conclusion then is that although for the practical purpose of framing or appreciating plans of war the classification of wars into offensive and defensive is of little use, a clear apprehension of the inherent relative advantages of offence and defence is essential. We must realise that in certain cases, provided always we preserve the aggressive spirit, the defensive will enable an inferior force to achieve points when the offensive would probably lead to its destruction. But the elements of strength depend entirely on the will and insight to deal rapid blows in the enemy's unguarded moments. So soon as the defensive ceases to be regarded as a means of fostering power to strike and of reducing the enemy's power of attack it loses all its strength. It ceases to be even a suspended activity, and anything that is not activity is not war. With these general indications of the relative advantages of offence and defence we may leave the subject for the present. It is possible of course to catalogue the advantages and disadvantages of each form, but any such bald statement—without concrete examples to explain the meaning—must always appear controversial and is apt to mislead. It is better to reserve their fuller consideration till we come to deal with strategical operations and are able to note their actual effect upon the conduct of war in its various forms. Leaving therefore our first classification of wars into offensive and defensive we will pass on to the second, which is the only one of real practical importance. CHAPTER THREE NATURES OF WARS— LIMITED AND UNLIMITED The second classification to which we are led by the political theory of war, is one which Clausewitz was the first to formulate and one to which he came to attach the highest importance. It becomes necessary therefore to examine his views in some detail—not because there is any need to regard a continental soldier, however distinguished, as an indispensable authority for a maritime nation. The reason is quite the reverse. It is because a careful examination of his doctrine on this point will lay open what are the radical and essential differences between the German or Continental School of Strategy and the British or Maritime School—that is, our own traditional School, which too many writers both at home and abroad quietly assume to have no existence. The evil tendency of that assumption cannot be too strongly emphasised, and the main purpose of this and the following chapters will be to show how and why even the greatest of the continental strategists fell short of realising fully the characteristic conception of the British tradition. By the classification in question Clausewitz distinguished wars into those with a "Limited" object and those whose object was "Unlimited." Such a classification was entirely characteristic of him, for it rested not alone upon the material nature of the object, but on certain moral considerations to which he was the first to attach their real value in war. Other writers such as Jomini had attempted to classify wars by the special purpose for which they were fought, but Clausewitz's long course of study convinced him that such a distinction was unphilosophical and bore no just relation to any tenable theory of war. Whether, that is, a war was positive or [pg 39] [pg 40] [pg 41] [pg 42] negative mattered much, but its special purpose, whether, for instance, according to Jomini's system, it was a war "to assert rights" or "to assist an ally" or "to acquire territory," mattered not at all. Whatever the object, the vital and paramount question was the intensity with which the spirit of the nation was absorbed in its attainment. The real point to determine in approaching any war plan was what did the object mean to the two belligerents, what sacrifices would they make for it, what risks were they prepared to run? It was thus he stated his view. "The smaller the sacrifice we demand from our opponent, the smaller presumably will be the means of resistance he will employ, and the smaller his means, the smaller will ours be required to be. Similarly the smaller our political object, the less value shall we set upon it and the more easily we shall be induced to abandon it." Thus the political object of the war, its original motive, will not only determine for both belligerents reciprocally the aim of the force they use, but it will also be the standard of the intensity of the efforts they will make. So he concludes there may be wars of all degrees of importance and energy from a war of extermination down to the use of an army of observation. So also in the naval sphere there may be a life and death struggle for maritime supremacy or hostilities which never rise beyond a blockade. Such a view of the subject was of course a wide departure from the theory of "Absolute War" on which Clausewitz had started working. Under that theory "Absolute War" was the ideal form to which all war ought to attain, and those which fell short of it were imperfect wars cramped by a lack of true military spirit. But so soon as he had seized the fact that in actual life the moral factor always must override the purely military factor, he saw that he had been working on too narrow a basis—a basis that was purely theoretical in that it ignored the human factor. He began to perceive that it was logically unsound to assume as the foundation of a strategical system that there was one pattern to which all wars ought to conform. In the light of his full and final apprehension of the value of the human factor he saw wars falling into two well-marked categories, each of which would legitimately be approached in a radically different manner, and not necessarily on the lines of "Absolute War." He saw that there was one class of war where the political object was of so vital an importance to both belligerents that they would tend to fight to the utmost limit of their endurance to secure it. But there was another class where the object was of less importance, that is to say, where its value to one or both the belligerents was not so great as to be worth unlimited sacrifices of blood and treasure. It was these two kinds of war he designated provisionally "Unlimited" and "Limited," by which he meant not that you were not to exert the force employed with all the vigour you could develop, but that there might be a limit beyond which it would be bad policy to spend that vigour, a point at which, long before your force was exhausted or even fully developed, it would be wiser to abandon your object rather than to spend more upon it. This distinction it is very necessary to grasp quite clearly, for it is often superficially confused with the distinction already referred to, which Clausewitz drew in the earlier part of his work—that is, the distinction between what he called the character of modern war and the character of the wars which preceded the Napoleonic era. It will be remembered he insisted that the wars of his own time had been wars between armed nations with a tendency to throw the whole weight of the nation into the fighting line, whereas in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries wars were waged by standing armies and not by the whole nation in arms. The distinction of course is real and of far-reaching consequences, but it has no relation to the distinction between "Limited" and "Unlimited" war. War may be waged on the Napoleonic system either for a limited or an unlimited object. A modern instance will serve to clear the field. The recent Russo-Japanese War was fought for a limited object— the assertion of certain claims over territory which formed no part of the possessions of either belligerent. Hostilities were conducted on entirely modern lines by two armed nations and not by standing armies alone. But in the case of one belligerent her interest in the object was so limited as to cause her to abandon it long before her whole force as an armed nation was exhausted or even put forth. The expense of life and treasure which the struggle was involving was beyond what the object was worth. This second distinction—that is, between Limited and Unlimited wars—Clausewitz regarded as of greater importance than his previous one founded on the negative or positive nature of the object. He was long in reaching it. His great work On War as he left it proceeds almost entirely on the conception of offensive or defensive as applied to the Napoleonic ideal of absolute war. The new idea came to him towards the end in the full maturity of his prolonged study, and it came to him in endeavouring to apply his strategical speculations to the practical process of framing a war plan in anticipation of a threatened breach with France. It was only in his final section On War Plans that he began to deal with it. By that time he had grasped the first practical result to which his theory led. He saw that the distinction between Limited and Unlimited war connoted a cardinal distinction in the methods of waging it. When the object was unlimited, and would consequently call forth your enemy's whole war power, it was evident that no firm decision of the struggle could be reached till his war power was entirely crushed. Unless you had a reasonable hope of being able to do this it was bad policy to seek your end by force—that is, you ought not to go to war. In the case of a limited object, however, the complete [pg 43] [pg 44] [pg 45] destruction of the enemy's armed force was beyond what was necessary. Clearly you could achieve your end if you could seize the object, and by availing yourself of the elements of strength inherent in the defensive could set up such a situation that it would cost the enemy more to turn you out than the object was worth to him. Here then was a wide difference in the fundamental postulate of your war plan. In the case of an unlimited war your main strategical offensive must be directed against the armed forces of the enemy; in the case of a limited war, even where its object was positive, it need not be. If conditions were favourable, it would suffice to make the object itself the objective of your main strategical offensive. Clearly, then, he had reached a theoretical distinction which modified his whole conception of strategy. No longer is there logically but one kind of war, the Absolute, and no longer is there but one legitimate objective, the enemy's armed forces. Being sound theory, it of course had an immediate practical value, for obviously it was a distinction from which the actual work of framing a war plan must take its departure. A curious corroboration of the soundness of these views is that Jomini reached an almost identical standpoint independently and by an entirely different road. His method was severely concrete, based on the comparison of observed facts, but it brought him as surely as the abstract method of his rival to the conclusion that there were two distinct classes of object. "They are of two different kinds," he says, "one which may be called territorial or geographical ... the other on the contrary consists exclusively in the destruction or disorganisation of the enemy's forces without concerning yourself with geographical points of any kind." It is under the first category of his first main classification "Of offensive wars to assert rights," that he deals with what Clausewitz would call "Limited Wars." Citing as an example Frederick the Great's war for the conquest of Silesia, he says, "In such a war ... the offensive operations ought to be proportional to the end in view. The first move is naturally to occupy the provinces claimed" (not, be it noted, to direct your blow at the enemy's main force). "Afterwards," he proceeds, "you can push the offensive according to circumstances and your relative strength in order to obtain the desired cession by menacing the enemy at home." Here we have Clausewitz's whole doctrine of "Limited War"; firstly, the primary or territorial stage, in which you endeavour to occupy the geographical object, and then the secondary or coercive stage, in which you seek by exerting general pressure upon your enemy to force him to accept the adverse situation you have set up. Such a method of making war obviously differs in a fundamental manner from that which Napoleon habitually adopted, and yet we have it presented by Jomini and Clausewitz, the two apostles of the Napoleonic method. The explanation is, of course, that both of them had seen too much not to know that Napoleon's method was only applicable when you could command a real physical or moral preponderance. Given such a preponderance, both were staunch for the use of extreme means in Napoleon's manner. It is not as something better than the higher road that they commend the lower one, but being veteran staff-officers and not mere theorists, they knew well that a belligerent must sometimes find the higher road beyond his strength, or beyond the effort which the spirit of the nation is prepared to make for the end in view, and like the practical men they were, they set themselves to study the potentialities of the lower road should hard necessity force them to travel it. They found that these potentialities in certain circumstances were great. As an example of a case where the lower form was more appropriate Jomini cites Napoleon's campaign against Russia in 1812. In his opinion it would have been better if Napoleon had been satisfied to begin on the lower method with a limited territorial object, and he attributes his failure to the abuse of a method which, however well suited to his wars in Germany, was incapable of achieving success in the conditions presented by a war with Russia. Seeing how high was Napoleon's opinion of Jomini as a master of the science of war, it is curious how his views on the two natures of wars have been ignored in the present day. It is even more curious in the case of Clausewitz, since we know that in the plenitude of his powers he came to regard this classification as the master-key of the subject. The explanation is that the distinction is not very clearly formulated in his first seven books, which alone he left in anything like a finished condition. It was not till he came to write his eighth book On War Plans that he saw the vital importance of the distinction round which he had been hovering. In that book the distinction is clearly laid down, but the book unhappily was never completed. With his manuscript, however, he left a "Note" warning us against regarding his earlier books as a full presentation of his developed ideas. From the note it is also evident that he thought the classification on which he had lighted was of the utmost importance, that he believed it would clear up all the difficulties which he had encountered in his earlier books—difficulties which he had come to see arose from a too exclusive consideration of the Napoleonic method of conducting war. "I look upon the first six books," he wrote in 1827, "as only a mass of material which is still in a manner without form and which has still to be revised again. In this revision the two kinds of wars will be kept more distinctly in view all through, and thereby all ideas will gain in clearness, in precision, and in exactness of application." Evidently he had grown dissatisfied with the theory of Absolute War on which he had started. His new discovery had convinced him that that theory would not serve as a standard for all natures of wars. "Shall we," he asks in his final book, "shall we now rest satisfied with this idea and by it judge of all wars, however much they may [pg 46] [pg 47] [pg 48] differ?"2 He answers his question in the negative. "You cannot determine the requirements of all wars from the Napoleonic type. Keep that type and its absolute method before you to use when you can or when you must, but keep equally before you that there are two main natures of war." In his note written at this time, when the distinction first came to him, he defines these two natures of war as follows: "First, those in which the object is the overthrow of the enemy, whether it be we aim at his political destruction or merely at disarming him and forcing him to conclude peace on our terms; and secondly, those in which our object is merely to make some conquests on the frontiers of his country, either for the purpose of retaining them permanently or of turning them to account as a matter of exchange in settling terms of peace."3 It was in his eighth book that he intended, had he lived, to have worked out the comprehensive idea he had conceived. Of that book he says, "The chief object will be to make good the two points of view above mentioned, by which everything will be simplified and at the same time be given the breath of life. I hope in this book to iron out many creases in the heads of strategists and statesmen, and at least to show the object of action and the real point to be considered in war."4 That hope was never realised, and that perhaps is why his penetrating analysis has been so much ignored. The eighth book as we have it is only a fragment. In the spring of 1830—an anxious moment, when it seemed that Prussia would require all her best for another struggle single-handed with France—he was called away to an active command. What he left of the book on "War Plans" he describes as "merely a track roughly cleared, as it were, through the mass, in order to ascertain the points of greatest moment." It was his intention, he says, to "carry the spirit of these ideas into his first six books"—to put the crown on his work, in fact, by elaborating and insisting upon his two great propositions, viz. that war was a form of policy, and that being so it might be Limited or Unlimited. The extent to which he would have infused his new idea into the whole every one is at liberty to judge for himself; but this indisputable fact remains. In the winter in view of the threatening attitude of France in regard to Belgium he drew up a war plan, and it was designed not on the Napoleonic method of making the enemy's armed force the main strategical objective, but on seizing a limited territorial object and forcing a disadvantageous counter-offensive upon the French. The revolutionary movement throughout Europe had broken the Holy Alliance to pieces. Not only did Prussia find herself almost single-handed against France, but she herself was sapped by revolution. To adopt the higher form of war and seek to destroy the armed force of the enemy was beyond her power. But she could still use the lower form, and by seizing Belgium she could herself force so exhausting a task on France that success was well within her strength. It was exactly so we endeavoured to begin the Seven Years' War; and it was exactly so the Japanese successfully conducted their war with Russia; and what is more striking, it was on similar lines that in 1859 Moltke in similar circumstances drew up his first war plan against France. His idea at that time was on the lines which Jomini held should have been Napoleon's in 1812. It was not to strike directly at Paris or the French main army, but to occupy Alsace-Lorraine and hold that territory till altered conditions should give him the necessary preponderance for proceeding to the higher form or forcing a favourable peace. In conclusion, then, we have to note that the matured fruit of the Napoleonic period was a theory of war based not on the single absolute idea, but on the dual distinction of Limited and Unlimited. Whatever practical importance we may attach to the distinction, so much must be admitted on the clear and emphatic pronouncements of Clausewitz and Jomini. The practical importance is another matter. It may fairly be argued that in continental warfare—in spite of the instances quoted by both the classical writers—it is not very great, for reasons that will appear directly. But it must be remembered that continental warfare is not the only form in which great international issues are decided. Standing at the final point which Clausewitz and Jomini reached, we are indeed only on the threshold of the subject. We have to begin where they left off and inquire what their ideas have to tell for the modern conditions of worldwide imperial States, where the sea becomes a direct and vital factor. CHAPTER FOUR LIMITED WAR AND MARITIME EMPIRES— Development of Clausewitz's and Jomini's Theory of a Limited Territorial Object, and Its [pg 49] [pg 50] [pg 51] [pg 52] Application to Modern Imperial Conditions The German war plans already cited, which were based respectively on the occupation of Belgium and Alsace- Lorraine, and Jomini's remarks on Napoleon's disastrous Russian campaign serve well to show the point to which continental strategists have advanced along the road which Clausewitz was the first to indicate clearly. We have now to consider its application to modern imperial conditions, and above all where the maritime element forcibly asserts itself. We shall then see how small that advance has been compared with its far-reaching effects for a maritime and above all an insular Power. It is clear that Clausewitz himself never apprehended the full significance of his brilliant theory. His outlook was still purely continental, and the limitations of continental warfare tend to veil the fuller meaning of the principle he had framed. Had he lived, there is little doubt he would have worked it out to its logical conclusion, but his death condemned his theory of limited war to remain in the inchoate condition in which he had left it. It will be observed, as was natural enough, that all through his work Clausewitz had in his mind war between two contiguous or at least adjacent continental States, and a moment's consideration will show that in that type of war the principle of the limited object can rarely if ever assert itself in perfect precision. Clausewitz himself put it quite clearly. Assuming a case where "the overthrow of the enemy"—that is, unlimited war—is beyond our strength, he points out that we need not therefore necessarily act on the defensive. Our action may still be positive and offensive, but the object can be nothing more than "the conquest of part of the enemy's country." Such a conquest he knew might so far weaken your enemy or strengthen your own position as to enable you to secure a satisfactory peace. The path of history is indeed strewn with such cases. But he was careful to point out that such a form of war was open to the gravest objections. Once you had occupied the territory you aimed at, your offensive action was, as a rule, arrested. A defensive attitude had to be assumed, and such an arrest of offensive action he had previously shown was inherently vicious, if only for moral reasons. Added to this you might find that in your effort to occupy the territorial object you had so irretrievably separated your striking force from your home-defence force as to be in no position to meet your enemy if he was able to retort by acting on unlimited lines with a stroke at your heart. A case in point was the Austerlitz campaign, where Austria's object was to wrest North Italy from Napoleon's empire. She sent her main army under the Archduke Charles to seize the territory she desired. Napoleon immediately struck at Vienna, destroyed her home army, and occupied the capital before the Archduke could turn to bar his way. The argument is this: that, as all strategic attack tends to leave points of your own uncovered, it always involves greater or less provision for their defence. It is obvious, therefore, that if we are aiming at a limited territorial object the proportion of defence required will tend to be much greater than if we are directing our attack on the main forces of the enemy. In unlimited war our attack will itself tend to defend everything elsewhere, by forcing the enemy to concentrate against our attack. Whether the limited form is justifiable or not therefore depends, as Clausewitz points out, on the geographical position of the object. So far British experience is with him, but he then goes on to say the more closely the territory in question is an annex of our own the safer is this form of war, because then our offensive action will the more surely cover our home country. As a case in point he cites Frederick the Great's opening of the Seven Years' War with the occupation of Saxony—a piece of work which materially strengthened Prussian defence. Of the British opening in Canada he says nothing. His outlook was too exclusively continental for it to occur to him to test his doctrine with a conspicuously successful case in which the territory aimed at was distant from the home territory and in no way covered it. Had he done so he must have seen how much stronger an example of the strength of limited war was the case of Canada than the case of Saxony. Moreover, he would have seen that the difficulties, which in spite of his faith in his discovery accompanied his attempt to apply it, arose from the fact that the examples he selected were not really examples at all. When he conceived the idea, the only kind of limited object he had in his mind was, to use his own words, "some conquests on the frontiers of the enemy's country," such as Silesia and Saxony for Frederick the Great, Belgium in his own war plan, and Alsace-Lorraine in that of Moltke. Now it is obvious that such objects are not truly limited, for two reasons. In the first place, such territory is usually an organic part of your enemy's country, or otherwise of so much importance to him that he will be willing to use unlimited effort to retain it. In the second place, there will be no strategical obstacle to his being able to use his whole force to that end. To satisfy the full conception of a limited object, one of two conditions is essential. Firstly, it must be not merely limited in area, but of really limited political importance; and secondly, it must be so situated as to be strategically isolated or to be capable of being reduced to practical isolation by strategical operations. Unless this condition exists, it is in the power of either belligerent, as Clausewitz himself saw, to pass to unlimited war if he so desires, and, ignoring the territorial objective, to strike at the heart of his enemy and force him to desist. [pg 53] [pg 54] [pg 55] If, then, we only regard war between contiguous continental States, in which the object is the conquest of territory on either of their frontiers, we get no real generic difference between limited and unlimited war. The line between them is in any case too shadowy or unstable to give a classification of any solidity. It is a difference of degree rather than of kind. If, on the other hand, we extend our view to wars between worldwide empires, the distinction at once becomes organic. Possessions which lie oversea or at the extremities of vast areas of imperfectly settled territory are in an entirely different category from those limited objects which Clausewitz contemplated. History shows that they can never have the political importance of objects which are organically part of the European system, and it shows further that they can be isolated by naval action sufficiently to set up the conditions of true limited war. Jomini approaches the point, but without clearly detaching it. In his chapter "On Great Invasions and Distant Expeditions," he points out how unsafe it is to take the conditions of war between contiguous States and apply them crudely to cases where the belligerents are separated by large areas of land or sea. He hovers round the sea factor, feeling how great a difference it makes, but without getting close to the real distinction. His conception of the inter-action of fleets and armies never rises above their actual co-operation in touch one with the other in a distant theatre. He has in mind the assistance which the British fleet afforded Wellington in the Peninsula, and Napoleon's dreams of Asiatic conquest, pronouncing such distant invasions as impossible in modern times except perhaps in combination with a powerful fleet that could provide the army of invasion with successive advanced bases. Of the paramount value of the fleet's isolating and preventive functions he gives no hint. Even when he deals with oversea expeditions, as he does at some length, his grip of the point is no closer. It is indeed significant of how entirely continental thought had failed to penetrate the subject that in devoting over thirty pages to an enumeration of the principles of oversea expeditions, he, like Clausewitz, does not so much as mention the conquest of Canada; and yet it is the leading case of a weak military Power succeeding by the use of the limited form of war in forcing its will upon a strong one, and succeeding because it was able by naval action to secure its home defence and isolate the territorial object. For our ideas of true limited objects, therefore, we must leave the continental theatres and turn to mixed or maritime wars. We have to look to such cases as Canada and Havana in the Seven Years' War, and Cuba in the Spanish-American War, cases in which complete isolation of the object by naval action was possible, or to such examples as the Crimea and Korea, where sufficient isolation was attainable by naval action owing to the length and difficulty of the enemy's land communications and to the strategical situation of the territory at stake. These examples will also serve to illustrate and enforce the second essential of this kind of war. As has been already said, for a true limited object we must have not only the power of isolation, but also the power by a secure home defence of barring an unlimited counterstroke. In all the above cases this condition existed. In all of them the belligerents had no contiguous frontiers, and this point is vital. For it is obvious that if two belligerents have a common frontier, it is open to the superior of them, no matter how distant or how easy to isolate the limited object may be, to pass at will to unlimited war by invasion. This process is even possible when the belligerents are separated by a neutral State, since the territory of a weak neutral will be violated if the object be of sufficient importance, or if the neutral be too strong to coerce, there still remains the possibility that his alliance may be secured. We come, then, to this final proposition—that limited war is only permanently possible to island Powers or between Powers which are separated by sea, and then only when the Power desiring limited war is able to command the sea to such a degree as to be able not only to isolate the distant object, but also to render impossible the invasion of his home territory. Here, then, we reach the true meaning and highest military value of what we call the command of the sea, and here we touch the secret of England's success against Powers so greatly superior to herself in military strength. It is only fitting that such a secret should have been first penetrated by an Englishman. For so it was, though it must be said that except in the light of Clausewitz's doctrine the full meaning of Bacon's famous aphorism is not revealed. "This much is certain," said the great Elizabethan on the experience of our first imperial war; "he that commands the sea is at great liberty and may take as much or as little of the war as he will, whereas those that be strongest by land are many times nevertheless in great straits." It would be difficult to state more pithily the ultimate significance of Clausewitz's doctrine. Its cardinal truth is clearly indicated—that limited wars do not turn upon the armed strength of the belligerents, but upon the amount of that strength which they are able or willing to bring to bear at the decisive point. It is much to be regretted that Clausewitz did not live to see with Bacon's eyes and to work out the full comprehensiveness of his doctrine. His ambition was to formulate a theory which would explain all wars. He believed he had done so, and yet it is clear he never knew how complete was his success, nor how wide was the [pg 56] [pg 57] [pg 58] field he had covered. To the end it would seem he was unaware that he had found an explanation of one of the most inscrutable problems in history—the expansion of England—at least so far as it has been due to successful war. That a small country with a weak army should have been able to gather to herself the most desirable regions of the earth, and to gather them at the expense of the greatest military Powers, is a paradox to which such Powers find it hard to be reconciled. The phenomenon seemed always a matter of chance-an accident without any foundation in the essential constants of war. It remained for Clausewitz, unknown to himself, to discover that explanation, and he reveals it to us in the inherent strength of limited war when means and conditions are favourable for its use. We find, then, if we take a wider view than was open to Clausewitz and submit his latest ideas to the test of present imperial conditions, so far from failing to cover the ground they gain a fuller meaning and a firmer basis. Apply them to maritime warfare and it becomes clear that his distinction between limited and unlimited war does not rest alone on the moral factor. A war may be limited not only because the importance of the object is too limited to call forth the whole national force, but also because the sea may be made to present an insuperable physical obstacle to the whole national force being brought to bear. That is to say, a war may be limited physically by the strategical isolation of the object, as well as morally by its comparative unimportance. CHAPTER FIVE WARS OF INTERVENTION—LIMITED INTERFERENCE IN UNLIMITED WAR Before leaving the general consideration of limited war, we have still to deal with a form of it that has not yet been mentioned. Clausewitz gave it provisionally the name of "War limited by contingent," and could find no place for it in his system. It appeared to him to differ essentially from war limited by its political object, or as Jomini put it, war with a territorial object. Yet it had to be taken into account and explained, if only for the part it had played in European history. For us it calls for the most careful examination, not only because it baffled the great German strategist to reconcile it with his theory of war, but also because it is the form in which Great Britain most successfully demonstrated the potentiality for direct continental interference of a small army acting in conjunction with a dominant fleet. The combined operations which were the normal expression of the British method of making war on the limited basis were of two main classes. Firstly, there were those designed purely for the conquest of the objects for which we went to war, which were usually colonial or distant oversea territory; and secondly, operations more or less upon the European seaboard designed not for permanent conquest, but as a method of disturbing our enemy's plans and strengthening the hands of our allies and our own position. Such operations might take the form of insignificant coastal diversions, or they might rise through all degrees of importance till, as in Wellington's operations in the Peninsula, they became indistinguishable in form from regular continental warfare. It would seem, therefore, that these operations were distinguished not so much by the nature of the object as by the fact that we devoted to them, not the whole of our military strength, but only a certain part of it which was known as our "disposal force." Consequently, they appear to call for some such special classification, and to fall naturally into the category which Clausewitz called "War limited by contingent." It was a nature of war well enough known in another form on the Continent. During the eighteenth century there had been a large number of cases of war actually limited by contingent—that is, cases where a country not having a vital interest in the object made war by furnishing the chief belligerent with an auxiliary force of a stipulated strength. It was in the sixth chapter of his last book that Clausewitz intended to deal with this anomalous form of hostility. His untimely death, however, has left us with no more than a fragment, in which he confesses that such cases are "embarrassing to his theory." If, he adds, the auxiliary force were placed unreservedly at the disposal of the chief belligerent, the problem would be simple enough. It would then, in effect, be the same thing as unlimited war [pg 59] [pg 60] [pg 61] with the aid of a subsidised force. But in fact, as he observes, this seldom happened, for the contingent was always more or less controlled in accordance with the special political aims of the Government which furnished it. Consequently, the only conclusion he succeeded in reaching was that it was a form of war that had to be taken into account, and that it was a form of limited war that appeared to differ essentially from war limited by object. We are left, in fact, with an impression that there must be two kinds of limited war. But if we pursue his historical method and examine the cases in which this nature of war was successful, and those in which it was unsuccessful, we shall find that wherever success is taken as an index of its legitimate employment, the practical distinction between the two kinds of limited war tends to disappear. The indications are that where the essential factors which justify the use of war limited by object are present in war limited by contingent, then that form of war tends to succeed, but not otherwise. We are brought, in fact, to this proposition, that the distinction "Limited by contingent" is not one that is inherent in war, and is quite out of line with the theory in hand—that, in reality, it is not a form of war, but a method which may be employed either for limited or unlimited war. In other words, war limited by contingent, if it is to be regarded as a legitimate form of war at all, must take frankly the one shape or the other. Either the contingent must act as an organic unit of the force making unlimited war without any reservations whatever, or else it should be given a definite territorial object, with an independent organisation and an independent limited function. Our own experience seems to indicate that war by contingent or war with "a disposal force" attains the highest success when it approaches most closely to true limited war—that is, as in the case of the Peninsula and the Crimea, where its object is to wrest or secure from the enemy a definite piece of territory that to a greater or less extent can be isolated by naval action. Its operative power, in fact, appears to bear some direct relation to the intimacy with which naval and military action can be combined to give the contingent a weight and mobility that are beyond its intrinsic power. If, then, we would unravel the difficulties of war limited by contingent, it seems necessary to distinguish between the continental and the British form of it. The continental form, as we have seen, differs but little in conception from unlimited war. The contingent is furnished at least ostensibly with the idea that it is to be used by the chief belligerent to assist him in overthrowing the common enemy, and that its objective will be the enemy's organised forces or his capital. Or it may be that the contingent is to be used as an army of observation to prevent a counterstroke, so as to facilitate and secure the main offensive movement of the chief belligerent. In either case, however small may be our contribution to the allied force, we are using the unlimited form and aiming at an unlimited and not a mere territorial object. If now we turn to British experience of war limited by contingent, we find that the continental form has frequently been used, but we also find it almost invariably accompanied by a popular repugnance, as though there were something in it antagonistic to the national instinct. A leading case is the assistance we sent to Frederick the Great in the Seven Years' War. At the opening of the war, so great was the popular repugnance that the measure was found impossible, and it was not till Frederick's dazzling resistance to the Catholic powers had clothed him with the glory of a Protestant hero, that Pitt could do what he wanted. The old religious fire was stirred. The most potent of all national instincts kindled the people to a generous warmth which overcame their inborn antipathy to continental operations, and it was possible to send a substantial contingent to Frederick's assistance. In the end the support fully achieved its purpose, but it must be noted that even in this case the operations were limited not only by contingent but also by object. It is true that Frederick was engaged in an unlimited war in which the continued existence of Prussia was at stake, and that the British force was an organic element in his war plan. Nevertheless, it formed part of a British subsidised army under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, who though nominated by Frederick was a British commander-in-chief. His army was in organisation entirely distinct from that of Frederick, and it was assigned the very definite and limited function of preventing the French occupying Hanover and so turning the Prussian right flank. Finally it must be noted that its ability to perform this function was due to the fact that the theatre of operations assigned to it was such that in no probable event could it lose touch with the sea, nor could the enemy cut its lines of supply and retreat. These features of the enterprise should be noted. They differentiate it from our earlier use of war limited by contingent in the continental manner, of which Marlborough's campaigns were typical, and they exhibit the special form which Marlborough would have chosen had political exigencies permitted and which was to become characteristic of British effort from Pitt's time onward. In the method of our greatest War Minister we have not only the limit by contingent but also the limit of a definite and independent function, and finally we have touch with the sea. This is the really vital factor, and upon it, as will presently appear, depends the strength of the method. In the earlier part of the Great War we employed the same form in our operations in North-Western Europe. There we had also the limited function of securing Holland, and also complete touch with the sea, but our theatre of [pg 62] [pg 63] [pg 64] [pg 65] operations was not independent. Intimate concerted action with other forces was involved, and the result in every case was failure. Later on in Sicily, where absolute isolation was attainable, the strength of the method enabled us to achieve a lasting result with very slender means. But the result was purely defensive. It was not till the Peninsular War developed that we found a theatre for war limited by contingent in which all the conditions that make for success were present. Even there so long as our army was regarded as a contingent auxiliary to the Spanish army the usual failure ensued. Only in Portugal, the defence of which was a true limited object, and where we had a sea-girt theatre independent of extraneous allies, was success achieved from the first. So strong was the method here, and so exhausting the method which it forced on the enemy, that the local balance of force was eventually reversed and we were able to pass to a drastic offensive. The real secret of Wellington's success—apart from his own genius—was that in perfect conditions he was applying the limited form to an unlimited war. Our object was unlimited. It was nothing less than the overthrow of Napoleon. Complete success at sea had failed to do it, but that success had given us the power of applying the limited form, which was the most decisive form of offence within our means. Its substantial contribution to the final achievement of the object is now universally recognised. The general result, then, of these considerations is that war by contingent in the continental form seldom or never differs generically from unlimited war, for the conditions required by limited war are seldom or never present. But what may be called the British or maritime form is in fact the application of the limited method to the unlimited form, as ancillary to the larger operations of our allies—a method which has usually been open to us because the control of the sea has enabled us to select a theatre in effect truly limited.5 But what if the conditions of the struggle in which we wish to intervene are such that no truly limited theatre is available? In that case we have to choose between placing a contingent frankly at the disposal of our ally, or confining ourselves to coastal diversion, as we did at Frederick the Great's request in the early campaigns of the Seven Years' War. Such operations can seldom be satisfactory to either party. The small positive results of our efforts to intervene in this way have indeed done more than anything to discredit this form of war, and to brand it as unworthy of a first-class Power. Yet the fact remains that all the great continental masters of war have feared or valued British intervention of this character even in the most unfavourable conditions. It was because they looked for its effects rather in the threat than in the performance. They did not reckon for positive results at all. So long as such intervention took an amphibious form they knew its disturbing effect upon a European situation was always out of all proportion to the intrinsic strength employed or the positive results it could give. Its operative action was that it threatened positive results unless it were strongly met. Its effect, in short, was negative. Its value lay in its power of containing force greater than its own. That is all that can be claimed for it, but it may be all that is required. It is not the most drastic method of intervention, but it has proved itself the most drastic for a Power whose forces are not adapted for the higher method. Frederick the Great was the first great soldier to recognise it, and Napoleon was the last. For years he shut his eyes to it, laughed at it, covered it with a contempt that grew ever more irritable. In 1805 he called Craig's expedition a "pygmy combination," yet the preparation of another combined force for an entirely different destination caused him to see the first as an advance guard of a movement he could not ignore, and he sacrificed his fleet in an impotent effort to deal with it. It was not, however, till four years later that he was forced to place on record his recognition of the principle. Then, curiously enough, he was convinced by an expedition which we have come to regard as above all others condemnatory of amphibious operations against the Continent. The Walcheren expedition is now usually held as the leading case of fatuous war administration. Historians can find no words too bad for it. They ignore the fact that it was a step—the final and most difficult step—in our post-Trafalgar policy of using the army to perfect our command of the sea against a fleet acting stubbornly on the defensive. It began with Copenhagen in 1807. It failed at the Dardanelles because fleet and army were separated; it succeeded at Lisbon and at Cadiz by demonstration alone. Walcheren, long contemplated, had been put off till the last as the most formidable and the least pressing. Napoleon had been looking for the attempt ever since the idea was first broached in this country, but as time passed and the blow did not fall, the danger came to be more and more ignored. Finally, the moment came when he was heavily engaged in Austria and forced to call up the bulk of his strength to deal with the Archduke Charles. The risks were still great, but the British Government faced them boldly with open eyes. It was now or never. They were bent on developing their utmost military strength in the Peninsula, and so long as a potent and growing fleet remained in the North Sea it would always act as an increasing drag on such development. The prospective gain of success was in the eyes of the Government out of all proportion to the probable loss by failure. So when Napoleon least expected it they determined to act, and caught him napping. The defences of Antwerp had been left incomplete. There was no army to meet the blow—nothing but a polyglot rabble without staff or even officers. For a week at least success was in our hands. Napoleon's fleet only escaped by twenty-four hours, and yet the failure was not only complete but disastrous. Still so entirely were the causes of failure accidental, and so near had it come to success, that Napoleon received a thorough shock and looked for a [pg 66] [pg 67] [pg 68] [pg 69] quick repetition of the attempt. So seriously indeed did he regard his narrow escape that he found himself driven to reconsider his whole system of home defence. Not only did he deem it necessary to spend large sums in increasing the fixed defences of Antwerp and Toulon, but his Director of Conscription was called upon to work out a scheme for providing a permanent force of no less than 300,000 men from the National Guard to defend the French coasts. "With 30,000 men in transports at the Downs," the Emperor wrote, "the English can paralyse 300,000 of my army, and that will reduce us to the rank of a second-class Power."6 The concentration of the British efforts in the Peninsula apparently rendered the realisation of this project unnecessary—that is, our line of operation was declared and the threat ceased. But none the less Napoleon's recognition of the principle remains on record—not in one of his speeches made for some ulterior purpose, but in a staff order to the principal officer concerned. It is generally held that modern developments in military organisation and transport will enable a great continental Power to ignore such threats. Napoleon ignored them in the past, but only to verify the truth that in war to ignore a threat is too often to create an opportunity. Such opportunities may occur late or early. As both Lord Ligonier and Wolfe laid it down for such operations, surprise is not necessarily to be looked for at the beginning. We have usually had to create or wait for our opportunity—too often because we were either not ready or not bold enough to seize the first that occurred. The cases in which such intervention has been most potent have been of two classes. Firstly, there is the intrusion into a war plan which our enemy has designed without allowing for our intervention, and to which he is irrevocably committed by his opening movements. Secondly, there is intervention to deprive the enemy of the fruits of victory. This form finds its efficacy in the principle that unlimited wars are not always decided by the destruction of armies. There usually remains the difficult work of conquering the people afterwards with an exhausted army. The intrusion of a small fresh force from the sea in such cases may suffice to turn the scale, as it did in the Peninsula, and as, in the opinion of some high authorities, it might have done in France in 1871. Such a suggestion will appear to be almost heretical as sinning against the principle which condemns a strategical reserve. We say that the whole available force should be developed for the vital period of the struggle. No one can be found to dispute it nowadays. It is too obviously true when it is a question of a conflict between organised forces, but in the absence of all proof we are entitled to doubt whether it is true for that exhausting and demoralising period which lies beyond the shock of armies. CHAPTER SIX CONDITIONS OF STRENGTH IN LIMITED WAR The elements of strength in limited war are closely analogous to those generally inherent in defence. That is to say, that as a correct use of defence will sometimes enable an inferior force to gain its end against a superior one, so are there instances in which the correct use of the limited form of war has enabled a weak military Power to attain success against a much stronger one, and these instances are too numerous to permit us to regard the results as accidental. An obvious element of strength is that where the geographical conditions are favourable we are able by the use of our navy to restrict the amount of force our army will have to deal with. We can in fact bring up our fleet to redress the adverse balance of our land force. But apart from this very practical reason there is another, which is rooted in the first principles of strategy. It is that limited war permits the use of the defensive without its usual drawbacks to a degree that is impossible in unlimited war. These drawbacks are chiefly that it tends to surrender the initiative to the enemy and that it deprives us of the moral exhilaration of the offensive. But in limited war, as we shall see, this need not be the case, and if without making these sacrifices we are able to act mainly on the defensive our position becomes exceedingly strong. [pg 70] [pg 71] [pg 72] The proposition really admits of no doubt. For even if we be not in whole-hearted agreement with Clausewitz's doctrine of the strength of defence, still we may at least accept Moltke's modification of it. He held that the strongest form of war—that is, the form which economically makes for the highest development of strength in a given force—is strategic offensive combined with tactical defensive. Now these are in effect the conditions which limited war should give—that is, if the theatre and method be rightly chosen. Let it be remembered that the use of this form of war presupposes that we are able by superior readiness or mobility or by being more conveniently situated to establish ourselves in the territorial object before our opponent can gather strength to prevent us. This done, we have the initiative, and the enemy being unable by hypothesis to attack us at home, must conform to our opening by endeavouring to turn us out. We are in a position to meet his attack on ground of our own choice and to avail ourselves of such opportunities of counter-attack as his distant and therefore exhausting offensive movements are likely to offer. Assuming, as in our own case we always must assume, that the territorial object is sea-girt and our enemy is not able to command the sea, such opportunities are certain to present themselves, and even if they are not used will greatly embarrass the main attack—as was abundantly shown in the Russian nervousness during their advance into the Liaotung Peninsula, due to the fear of a counter-stroke from the Gulf of Pe-chi-li. The actual situation which this method of procedure sets up is that our major strategy is offensive—that is, our main movement is positive, having for its aim the occupation of the territorial object. The minor strategy that follows should be in its general lines defensive, designed, so soon as the enemy sets about dislodging us, to develop the utmost energy of counter-attack which our force and opportunities justify. Now if we consider that by universal agreement it is no longer possible in the present conditions of land warfare to draw a line between tactics and minor strategy, we have in our favour for all practical purposes the identical position which Moltke regarded as constituting the strongest form of war. That is to say, our major strategy is offensive and our minor strategy is defensive. If, then, the limited form of war has this element of strength over and above the unlimited form, it must be correct to use it when we are not strong enough to use the more exhausting form and when the object is limited; just as much as it is correct to use the defensive when our object is negative and we are too weak for the offensive. The point is of the highest importance, for it is a direct negation of the current doctrine that in war there can be but one legitimate object, the overthrow of the enemy's means of resistance, and that the primary objective must always be his armed forces. It raises in fact the whole question as to whether it is not sometimes legitimate and even correct to aim directly at the ulterior object of the war. An impression appears to prevail—in spite of all that Clausewitz and Jomini had to say on the point—that the question admits of only one answer. Von der Goltz, for instance, is particularly emphatic in asserting that the overthrow of the enemy must always be the object in modern war. He lays it down as "the first principle of modern warfare," that "the immediate objective against which all our efforts must be directed is the hostile main army." Similarly Prince Kraft has the maxim that "the first aim should be to overcome the enemy's army. Everything else, the occupation of the country, &c., only comes in the second line." It will be observed that he here admits that the process of occupying the enemy's territory is an operation distinct from the overthrow of the enemy's force. Von der Goltz goes further, and protests against the common error of regarding the annihilation of the enemy's principal army as synonymous with the complete attainment of the object. He is careful to assert that the current doctrine only holds good "when the two belligerent states are of approximately the same nature." If, then, there are cases in which the occupation of territory must be undertaken as an operation distinct from defeating the enemy's forces, and if in such cases the conditions are such that we can occupy the territory with advantage without first defeating the enemy, it is surely mere pedantry to insist that we should put off till to-morrow what we can do better to-day. If the occupation of the enemy's whole territory is involved, or even a substantial part of it, the German principle of course holds good, but all wars are not of that character. Insistence on the principle of "overthrow," and even its exaggeration, was of value, in its day, to prevent a recurrence to the old and discredited methods. But its work is done, and blind adherence to it without regard to the principles on which it rests tends to turn the art of war into mere bludgeon play. Clausewitz, at any rate, as General Von Caemmerer has pointed out,7 was far too practical a soldier to commit himself to so abstract a proposition in all its modern crudity. If it were true, it would never be possible for a weaker Power to make successful war against a stronger one in any cause whatever—a conclusion abundantly refuted by historical experience. That the higher form like the offensive is the more drastic is certain, if conditions are suitable for its use, but Clausewitz, it must be remembered, distinctly lays it down that such conditions presuppose in the belligerent employing the higher form a great physical or moral superiority or a great spirit of [pg 73] [pg 74] [pg 75] [pg 76] [pg 77] enterprise—an innate propensity for extreme hazards. Jomini did not go even so far as this. He certainly would have ruled out "an innate propensity to extreme hazards," for in his judgment it was this innate propensity which led Napoleon to abuse the higher form to his own undoing. So entirely indeed does history, no less than theory, fail to support the idea of the one answer, that it would seem that even in Germany a reaction to Clausewitz's real teaching is beginning. In expounding it Von Caemmerer says, "Since the majority of the most prominent military authors of our time uphold the principle that in war our efforts must always be directed to their utmost limits and that a deliberate employment of lower means betrays more or less weakness, I feel bound to declare that the wideness of Clausewitz's views have inspired me with a high degree of admiration." Now what Clausewitz held precisely was this—that when the conditions are not favourable for the use of the higher form, the seizure of a small part of the enemy's territory may be regarded as a correct alternative to destroying his armed forces. But he clearly regards this form of war only as a make-shift. His purely continental outlook prevented his considering that there might be cases where the object was actually so limited in character that the lower form of war would be at once the more effective and the more economical to use. In continental warfare, as we have seen, such cases can hardly occur, but they tend to declare themselves strongly when the maritime factor is introduced to any serious extent. The tendency of British warfare to take the lower or limited form has always been as clearly marked as is the opposite tendency on the Continent. To attribute such a tendency, as is sometimes the fashion, to an inherent lack of warlike spirit is sufficiently contradicted by the results it has achieved. There is no reason indeed to put it down to anything but a sagacious instinct for the kind of war that best accords with the conditions of our existence. So strong has this instinct been that it has led us usually to apply the lower form not only where the object of the war was a well-defined territorial one, but to cases in which its correctness was less obvious. As has been explained in the last chapter, we have applied it, and applied it on the whole with success, when we have been acting in concert with continental allies for an unlimited object—where, that is, the common object has been the overthrow of the common enemy. The choice between the two forms really depends upon the circumstances of each case. We have to consider whether the political object is in fact limited, whether if unlimited in the abstract it can be reduced to a concrete object that is limited, and finally whether the strategical conditions are such as lend themselves to the successful application of the limited form. What we require now is to determine those conditions with greater exactness, and this will be best done by changing our method to the concrete and taking a leading case. The one which presents them in their clearest and simplest form is without doubt the recent war between Russia and Japan. Here we have a particularly striking example of a small Power having forced her will upon a much greater Power without "overthrowing" her—that is, without having crushed her power of resistance. That was entirely beyond the strength of Japan. So manifest was the fact that everywhere upon the Continent, where the overthrow of your enemy was regarded as the only admissible form of war, the action of the Japanese in resorting to hostilities was regarded as madness. Only in England, with her tradition and instinct for what an island Power may achieve by the lower means, was Japan considered to have any reasonable chance of success. The case is particularly striking; for every one felt that the real object of the war was in the abstract unlimited, that it was in fact to decide whether Russia or Japan was to be the predominant power in the Far East. Like the Franco-German War of 1870 it had all the aspect of what the Germans call "a trial of strength." Such a war is one which above all appears incapable of decision except by the complete overthrow of the one Power or the other. There was no complication of alliances nor any expectation of them. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty had isolated the struggle. If ever issue hung on the sheer fighting force of the two belligerents it would seem to have been this one. After the event we are inclined to attribute the result to the moral qualities and superior training and readiness of the victors. These qualities indeed played their part, and they must not be minimised; but who will contend that if Japan had tried to make her war with Russia, as Napoleon made his, she could have fared even as well as he did? She had no such preponderance as Clausewitz laid down as a condition precedent to attempting the overthrow of her enemy—the employment of unlimited war. Fortunately for her the circumstances did not call for the employment of such extreme means. The political and geographical conditions were such that she was able to reduce the intangible object of asserting her prestige to the purely concrete form of a territorial objective. The penetration of Russia into Manchuria threatened the absorption of Korea into the Russian Empire, and this Japan regarded as fatal to her own position and future development. Her power to maintain Korean integrity would be the outward and visible sign of her ability to assert herself as a Pacific Power. Her abstract quarrel with Russia could therefore be crystallised into a concrete [pg 78] [pg 79] objective in the same way as the quarrel of the Western Powers with Russia in 1854 crystallised into the concrete objective of Sebastopol. In the Japanese case the immediate political object was exceptionally well adapted for the use of limited war. Owing to the geographical position of Korea and to the vast and undeveloped territories which separate it from the centre of Russian power, it could be practically isolated by naval action. Further than this, it fulfilled the condition to which Clausewitz attached the greatest importance—that is to say, the seizure of the particular object so far from weakening the home defence of Japan would have the effect of greatly increasing the strength of her position. Though offensive in effect and intention it was also, like Frederick's seizure of Saxony, a sound piece of defensive work. So far from exposing her heart, it served to cover it almost impregnably. The reason is plain. Owing to the wide separation of the two Russian arsenals at Port Arthur and Vladivostock, with a defile controlled by Japan interposed, the Russian naval position was very faulty. The only way of correcting it was for Russia to secure a base in the Straits of Korea, and for this she had been striving by diplomatic means at Seoul for some time. Strategically the integrity of Korea was for Japan very much what the integrity of the Low Countries was for us, but in the case of the Low Countries, since they were incapable of isolation, our power of direct action was always comparatively weak. Portugal, with its unrivalled strategical harbour at Lisbon, was an analogous case in our old oceanic wars, and since it was capable of being in a measure isolated from the strength of our great rival by naval means we were there almost uniformly successful. On the whole it must be said that notwithstanding the success we achieved in our long series of wars waged on a limited basis, in none of them were the conditions so favourable for us as in this case they were for Japan. In none of them did our main offensive movement so completely secure our home defence. Canada was as eccentric as possible to our line of home defence, while in the Crimea so completely did our offensive uncover the British Islands, that we had to supplement our movement against the limited object by sending our main fighting fleet to hold the exit of the Baltic against the danger of an unlimited counter-stroke.8 Whether or not it was on this principle that the Japanese conceived the war from the outset matters little. The main considerations are that with so favourable a territorial object as Korea limited war was possible in its most formidable shape, that the war did in fact develop on limited lines, and that it was entirely successful. Without waiting to secure the command of the sea, Japan opened by a surprise seizure of Seoul, and then under cover of minor operations of the fleet proceeded to complete her occupation of Korea. As she faced the second stage, that of making good the defence of her conquest, the admirable nature of her geographical object was further displayed. The theoretical weakness of limited war at this point is the arrest of your offensive action. But in this case such arrest was neither necessary nor possible, and for these reasons. To render the conquest secure not only must the Korean frontier be made inviolable, but Korea must be permanently isolated by sea. This involved the destruction of the Russian fleet, and this in its turn entailed the reduction of Port Arthur by military means. Here, then, in the second stage Japan found herself committed to two lines of operation with two distinct objectives, Port Arthur and the Russian army that was slowly concentrating in Manchuria—a thoroughly vicious situation. So fortunate, however, was the geographical conformation of the theatre that by promptitude and the bold use of an uncommanded sea it could be reduced to something far more correct. By continuing the advance of the Korean army into Manchuria and landing another force between it and the Port Arthur army the three corps could be concentrated and the vicious separation of the lines of operations turned to good account. They could be combined in such a way as to threaten an enveloping counter-attack on Liao-yang before the Russian offensive concentration could be completed. Not only was Liao-yang the Russian point of concentration, but it also was a sound position both for defending Korea and covering the siege of Port Arthur. Once secured, it gave the Japanese all the advantages of defence and forced the Russians to exhaust themselves in offensive operations which were beyond their strength. Nor was it only ashore that this advantage was gained. The success of the system, which culminated in the fall of Port Arthur, went further still. Not only did it make Japan relatively superior at sea, but it enabled her to assume a naval defensive and so to force the final naval decision on Russia with every advantage of time, place, and strength in her own favour. By the battle of Tsushima the territorial object was completely isolated by sea, and the position of Japan in Korea was rendered as impregnable as that of Wellington at Torres Vedras. All that remained was to proceed to the third stage and demonstrate to Russia that the acceptance of the situation that had been set up was more to her advantage than the further attempt to break it down. This the final advance to Mukden accomplished, and Japan obtained her end very far short of having overthrown her enemy. The offensive power of Russia had never been so strong, while that of Japan was almost if not quite exhausted. Approached in this way, the Far Eastern struggle is seen to develop on the same lines as all our great maritime wars of the past, which continental strategists have so persistently excluded from their field of study. It presents the normal three phases—the initial offensive movement to seize the territorial object, the secondary phase, which forces an attenuated offensive on the enemy, and the final stage of pressure, in which there is a return to [pg 80] [pg 81] [pg 82] [pg 83] the offensive "according," as Jomini puts it, "to circumstances and your relative force in order to obtain the cession desired." It must not of course be asked that these phases shall be always clearly defined. Strategical analysis can never give exact results. It aims only at approximations, at groupings which will serve to guide but will always leave much to the judgment. The three phases in the Russo-Japanese War, though unusually well defined, continually overlapped. It must be so; for in war the effect of an operation is never confined to the limits of its immediate or primary intention. Thus the occupation of Korea had the secondary defensive effect of covering the home country, while the initial blow which Admiral Togo delivered at Port Arthur to cover the primary offensive movement proved, by the demoralisation it caused in the Russian fleet, to be a distinct step in the secondary phase of isolating the conquest. In the later stages of the war the line between what was essential to set up the second phase of perfecting the isolation and the third phase of general pressure seems to have grown very nebulous. It was at this stage that the Japanese strategy has been most severely criticised, and it was just here they seem to have lost hold of the conception of a limited war, if in fact they had ever securely grasped the conception as the elder Pitt understood it. It has been argued that in their eagerness to deal a blow at the enemy's main army they neglected to devote sufficient force to reduce Port Arthur, an essential step to complete the second phase. Whether or not the exigencies of the case rendered such distribution of force inevitable or whether it was due to miscalculation of difficulties, the result was a most costly set-back. For not only did it entail a vast loss of time and life at Port Arthur itself, but when the sortie of the Russian fleet in June brought home to them their error, the offensive movement on Liao-yang had to be delayed, and the opportunity passed for a decisive counter-stroke at the enemy's concentration ashore. This misfortune, which was to cost the Japanese so dear, may perhaps be attributed at least in part to the continental influences under which their army had been trained. We at least can trace the unlimited outlook in the pages of the German Staff history. In dealing with the Japanese plan of operations it is assumed that the occupation of Korea and the isolation of Port Arthur were but preliminaries to a concentric advance on Liao- yang, "which was kept in view as the first objective of the operations on land." But surely on every theory of the war the first objective of the Japanese on land was Seoul, where they expected to have to fight their first important action against troops advancing from the Yalu; and surely their second was Port Arthur, with its fleet and arsenal, which they expected to reduce with little more difficulty than they had met with ten years before against the Chinese. Such at least was the actual progression of events, and a criticism which regards operations of such magnitude and ultimate importance as mere incidents of strategic deployment is only to be explained by the domination of the Napoleonic idea of war, against the universal application of which Clausewitz so solemnly protested. It is the work of men who have a natural difficulty in conceiving a war plan that does not culminate in a Jena or a Sedan. It is a view surely which is the child of theory, bearing no relation to the actuality of the war in question and affording no explanation of its ultimate success. The truth is, that so long as the Japanese acted on the principles of limited war, as laid down by Clausewitz and Jomini and plainly deducible from our own rich experience, they progressed beyond all their expectations, but so soon as they departed from them and suffered themselves to be confused with continental theories they were surprised by unaccountable failure. The expression "Limited war" is no doubt not entirely happy. Yet no other has been found to condense the ideas of limited object and limited interest, which are its special characteristics. Still if the above example be kept in mind as a typical case, the meaning of the term will not be mistaken. It only remains to emphasise one important point. The fact that the doctrine of limited war traverses the current belief that our primary objective must always be the enemy's armed forces is liable to carry with it a false inference that it also rejects the corollary that war means the use of battles. Nothing is further from the conception. Whatever the form of war, there is no likelihood of our ever going back to the old fallacy of attempting to decide wars by manoeuvres. All forms alike demand the use of battles. By our fundamental theory war is always "a continuation of political intercourse, in which fighting is substituted for writing notes." However great the controlling influence of the political object, it must never obscure the fact that it is by fighting we have to gain our end. It is the more necessary to insist on this point, for the idea of making a piece of territory your object is liable to be confused with the older method of conducting war, in which armies were content to manoeuvre for strategical positions, and a battle came almost to be regarded as a mark of bad generalship. With such parading limited war has nothing to do. Its conduct differs only from that of unlimited war in that instead of having to destroy our enemy's whole power of resistance, we need only overthrow so much of his active force as he is able or willing to bring to bear in order to prevent or terminate our occupation of the territorial object. The first consideration, then, in entering on such a war is to endeavour to determine what the force will amount to. It will depend, firstly, on the importance the enemy attaches to the limited object, coupled with the nature and [pg 84] [pg 85] [pg 86] [pg 87] extent of his preoccupations elsewhere, and, secondly, it will depend upon the natural difficulties of his lines of communication and the extent to which we can increase those difficulties by our conduct of the initial operations. In favourable circumstances therefore (and here lies the great value of the limited form) we are able to control the amount of force we shall have to encounter. The most favourable circumstances and the only circumstances by which we ourselves can profit are such as permit the more or less complete isolation of the object by naval action, and such isolation can never be established until we have entirely overthrown the enemy's naval forces. Here, then, we enter the field of naval strategy. We can now leave behind us the theory of war in general and, in order to pave the way to our final conclusions, devote our attention to the theory of naval warfare in particular. PART TWO THEORY OF NAVAL WAR CHAPTER ONE THEORY OF THE OBJECT—COMMAND OF THE SEA The object of naval warfare must always be directly or indirectly either to secure the command of the sea or to prevent the enemy from securing it. The second part of the proposition should be noted with special care in order to exclude a habit of thought, which is one of the commonest sources of error in naval speculation. That error is the very general assumption that if one belligerent loses the command of the sea it passes at once to the other belligerent. The most cursory study of naval history is enough to reveal the falseness of such an assumption. It tells us that the most common situation in naval war is that neither side has the command; that the normal position is not a commanded sea, but an uncommanded sea. The mere assertion, which no one denies, that the object of naval warfare is to get command of the sea actually connotes the proposition that the command is normally in dispute. It is this state of dispute with which naval strategy is most nearly concerned, for when the command is lost or won pure naval strategy comes to an end. This truth is so obvious that it would scarcely be worth mentioning were it not for the constant recurrence of such phrases as: "If England were to lose command of the sea, it would be all over with her." The fallacy of the idea is that it ignores the power of the strategical defensive. It assumes that if in the face of some extraordinary hostile coalition or through some extraordinary mischance we found ourselves without sufficient strength to keep the command, we should therefore be too weak to prevent the enemy getting it—a negation of the whole theory of war, which at least requires further support than it ever receives. And not only is this assumption a negation of theory; it is a negation both of practical experience and of the expressed opinion of our greatest masters. We ourselves have used the defensive at sea with success, as under William the Third and in the War of American Independence, while in our long wars with France she habitually used it in such a way that sometimes for years, though we had a substantial preponderance, we could not get command, and for years were unable to carry out our war plan without serious interruption from her fleet. So far from the defensive being a negligible factor at sea, or even the mere pestilent heresy it is generally represented, it is of course inherent in all war, and, as we have seen, the paramount questions of strategy both at [pg 89] [pg 91] [pg 92] sea and on land turn on the relative possibilities of offensive and defensive, and upon the relative proportions in which each should enter into our plan of war. At sea the most powerful and aggressively-minded belligerent can no more avoid his alternating periods of defence, which result from inevitable arrests of offensive action, than they can be avoided on land. The defensive, then, has to be considered; but before we are in a position to do so with profit, we have to proceed with our analysis of the phrase, "Command of the Sea," and ascertain exactly what it is we mean by it in war. In the first place, "Command of the Sea" is not identical in its strategical conditions with the conquest of territory. You cannot argue from the one to the other, as has been too commonly done. Such phrases as the "Conquest of water territory" and "Making the enemy's coast our frontier" had their use and meaning in the mouths of those who framed them, but they are really little but rhetorical expressions founded on false analogy, and false analogy is not a secure basis for a theory of war. The analogy is false for two reasons, both of which enter materially into the conduct of naval war. You cannot conquer sea because it is not susceptible of ownership, at least outside territorial waters. You cannot, as lawyers say, "reduce it into possession," because you cannot exclude neutrals from it as you can from territory you conquer. In the second place, you cannot subsist your armed force upon it as you can upon enemy's territory. Clearly, then, to make deductions from an assumption that command of the sea is analogous to conquest of territory is unscientific, and certain to lead to error. The only safe method is to inquire what it is we can secure for ourselves, and what it is we can deny the enemy by command of the sea. Now, if we exclude fishery rights, which are irrelevant to the present matter, the only right we or our enemy can have on the sea is the right of passage; in other words, the only positive value which the high seas have for national life is as a means of communication. For the active life of a nation such means may stand for much or it may stand for little, but to every maritime State it has some value. Consequently by denying an enemy this means of passage we check the movement of his national life at sea in the same kind of way that we check it on land by occupying his territory. So far the analogy holds good, but no further. So much for the positive value which the sea has in national life. It has also a negative value. For not only is it a means of communication, but, unlike the means of communication ashore, it is also a barrier. By winning command of the sea we remove that barrier from our own path, thereby placing ourselves in position to exert direct military pressure upon the national life of our enemy ashore, while at the same time we solidify it against him and prevent his exerting direct military pressure upon ourselves. Command of the sea, therefore, means nothing but the control of maritime communications, whether for commercial or military purposes. The object of naval warfare is the control of communications, and not, as in land warfare, the conquest of territory. The difference is fundamental. True, it is rightly said that strategy ashore is mainly a question of communications, but they are communications in another sense. The phrase refers to the communications of the army alone, and not to the wider communications which are part of the life of the nation. But on land also there are communications of a kind which are essential to national life—the internal communications which connect the points of distribution. Here again we touch an analogy between the two kinds of war. Land warfare, as the most devoted adherents of the modern view admit, cannot attain its end by military victories alone. The destruction of your enemy's forces will not avail for certain unless you have in reserve sufficient force to complete the occupation of his inland communications and principal points of distribution. This power is the real fruit of victory, the power to strangle the whole national life. It is not until this is done that a high-spirited nation, whose whole heart is in the war, will consent to make peace and do your will. It is precisely in the same way that the command of the sea works towards peace, though of course in a far less coercive manner, against a continental State. By occupying her maritime communications and closing the points of distribution in which they terminate we destroy the national life afloat, and thereby check the vitality of that life ashore so far as the one is dependent on the other. Thus we see that so long as we retain the power and right to stop maritime communications, the analogy between command of the sea and the conquest of territory is in this aspect very close. And the analogy is of the utmost practical importance, for on it turns the most burning question of maritime war, which it will be well to deal with in this place. It is obvious that if the object and end of naval warfare is the control of communications it must carry with it the right to forbid, if we can, the passage of both public and private property upon the sea. Now the only means we have of enforcing such control of commercial communications at sea is in the last resort the capture or destruction of sea-borne property. Such capture or destruction is the penalty which we impose upon our enemy for attempting to use the communications of which he does not hold the control. In the language of jurisprudence, it is the ultimate sanction of the interdict which we are seeking to enforce. The current term "Commerce [pg 93] [pg 94] [pg 95] destruction" is not in fact a logical expression of the strategical idea. To make the position clear we should say "Commerce prevention." The methods of this "Commerce prevention" have no more connection with the old and barbarous idea of plunder and reprisal than orderly requisitions ashore have with the old idea of plunder and ravaging. No form of war indeed causes so little human suffering as the capture of property at sea. It is more akin to process of law, such as distress for rent, or execution of judgment, or arrest of a ship, than to a military operation. Once, it is true, it was not so. In the days of privateers it was accompanied too often, and particularly in the Mediterranean and the West Indies, with lamentable cruelty and lawlessness, and the existence of such abuses was the real reason for the general agreement to the Declaration of Paris by which privateering was abolished. But it was not the only reason. The idea of privateering was a survival of a primitive and unscientific conception of war, which was governed mainly by a general notion of doing your enemy as much damage as possible and making reprisal for wrongs he had done you. To the same class of ideas belonged the practice of plunder and ravaging ashore. But neither of these methods of war was abolished for humanitarian reasons. They disappeared indeed as a general practice before the world had begun to talk of humanity. They were abolished because war became more scientific. The right to plunder and ravage was not denied. But plunder was found to demoralise your troops and unfit them for fighting, and ravaging proved to be a less powerful means of coercing your enemy than exploiting the occupied country by means of regular requisitions for the supply of your own army and the increase of its offensive range. In short, the reform arose from a desire to husband your enemy's resources for your own use instead of wantonly wasting them. In a similar way privateering always had a debilitating effect upon our own regular force. It greatly increased the difficulty of manning the navy, and the occasional large profits had a demoralising influence on detached cruiser commanders. It tended to keep alive the mediaeval corsair spirit at the expense of the modern military spirit which made for direct operations against the enemy's armed forces. It was inevitable that as the new movement of opinion gathered force it should carry with it a conviction that for operating against sea-borne trade sporadic attack could never be so efficient as an organised system of operations to secure a real strategical control of the enemy's maritime communications. A riper and sounder view of war revealed that what may be called tactical commercial blockade—that is, the blockade of ports—could be extended to and supplemented by a strategical blockade of the great trade routes. In moral principle there is no difference between the two. Admit the principle of tactical or close blockade, and as between belligerents you cannot condemn the principle of strategical or distant blockade. Except in their effect upon neutrals, there is no juridical difference between the two. Why indeed should this humane yet drastic process of war be rejected at sea if the same thing is permitted on land? If on land you allow contributions and requisitions, if you permit the occupation of towns, ports, and inland communications, without which no conquest is complete and no effective war possible, why should you refuse similar procedure at sea where it causes far less individual suffering? If you refuse the right of controlling communications at sea, you must also refuse the right on land. If you admit the right of contributions on land, you must admit the right of capture at sea. Otherwise you will permit to military Powers the extreme rights of war and leave to the maritime Powers no effective rights at all. Their ultimate argument would be gone. In so far as the idea of abolishing private capture at sea is humanitarian, and in so far as it rests on a belief that it would strengthen our position as a commercial maritime State, let it be honourably dealt with. But so far as its advocates have as yet expressed themselves, the proposal appears to be based on two fallacies. One is, that you can avoid attack by depriving yourself of the power of offence and resting on defence alone, and the other, the idea that war consists entirely of battles between armies or fleets. It ignores the fundamental fact that battles are only the means of enabling you to do that which really brings wars to an end-that is, to exert pressure on the citizens and their collective life. "After shattering the hostile main army," says Von der Goltz, "we still have the forcing of a peace as a separate and, in certain circumstances, a more difficult task ... to make the enemy's country feel the burdens of war with such weight that the desire for peace will prevail. This is the point in which Napoleon failed.... It may be necessary to seize the harbours, commercial centres, important lines of traffic, fortifications and arsenals, in other words, all important property necessary to the existence of the people and army." If, then, we are deprived of the right to use analogous means at sea, the object for which we fight battles almost ceases to exist. Defeat the enemy's fleets as we may, he will be but little the worse. We shall have opened the way for invasion, but any of the great continental Powers can laugh at our attempts to invade single-handed. If we cannot reap the harvest of our success by deadening his national activities at sea, the only legitimate means of pressure within our strength will be denied us. Our fleet, if it would proceed with such secondary operations as are essential for forcing a peace, will be driven to such barbarous expedients as the bombardment of seaport towns and destructive raids upon the hostile coasts. [pg 96] [pg 97] [pg 98] If the means of pressure which follow successful fighting were abolished both on land and sea there would be this argument in favour of the change, that it would mean perhaps for civilised States the entire cessation of war; for war would become so impotent, that no one would care to engage in it. It would be an affair between regular armies and fleets, with which the people had little concern. International quarrels would tend to take the form of the mediaeval private disputes which were settled by champions in trial by battle, an absurdity which led rapidly to the domination of purely legal procedure. If international quarrels could go the same way, humanity would have advanced a long stride. But the world is scarcely ripe for such a revolution. Meanwhile to abolish the right of interference with the flow of private property at sea without abolishing the corresponding right ashore would only defeat the ends of humanitarians. The great deterrent, the most powerful check on war, would be gone. It is commerce and finance which now more than ever control or check the foreign policy of nations. If commerce and finance stand to lose by war, their influence for a peaceful solution will be great; and so long as the right of private capture at sea exists, they stand to lose in every maritime war immediately and inevitably whatever the ultimate result may be. Abolish the right, and this deterrent disappears; nay, they will even stand to win immediate gains owing to the sudden expansion of Government expenditure which the hostilities will entail, and the expansion of sea commerce which the needs of the armed forces will create. Any such losses as maritime warfare under existing conditions must immediately inflict will be remote if interference with property is confined to the land. They will never indeed be serious except in the case of complete defeat, and no one enters upon war expecting defeat. It is in the hope of victory and gain that aggressive wars are born. The fear of quick and certain loss is their surest preventive. Humanity, then, will surely beware how in a too hasty pursuit of peaceful ideals it lets drop the best weapon it has for scotching the evil it has as yet no power to kill. In what follows, therefore, it is intended to regard the right of private capture at sea as still subsisting. Without it, indeed, naval warfare is almost inconceivable, and in any case no one has any experience of such a truncated method of war on which profitable study can be founded. The primary method, then, in which we use victory or preponderance at sea and bring it to bear on the enemy's population to secure peace, is by the capture or destruction of the enemy's property, whether public or private. But in comparing the process with the analogous occupation of territory and the levying of contributions and requisitions we have to observe a marked difference. Both processes are what may be called economic pressure. But ashore the economic pressure can only be exerted as the consequence of victory or acquired domination by military success. At sea the process begins at once. Indeed, more often than not, the first act of hostility in maritime wars has been the capture of private property at sea. In a sense this is also true ashore. The first step of an invader after crossing the frontier will be to control to a less or greater extent such private property as he is able to use for his purposes. But such interference with private property is essentially a military act, and does not belong to the secondary phase of economic pressure. At sea it does, and the reason why this should be so lies in certain fundamental differences between land and sea warfare which are implicit in the communication theory of naval war. To elucidate the point, it must be repeated that maritime communications, which are the root of the idea of command of the sea, are not analogous to military communications in the ordinary use of the term. Military communications refer solely to the army's lines of supply and retreat. Maritime communications have a wider meaning. Though in effect embracing the lines of fleet supply, they correspond in strategical values not to military lines of supply, but to those internal lines of communication by which the flow of national life is maintained ashore. Consequently maritime communications are on a wholly different footing from land communications. At sea the communications are, for the most part, common to both belligerents, whereas ashore each possesses his own in his own territory. The strategical effect is of far-reaching importance, for it means that at sea strategical offence and defence tend to merge in a way that is unknown ashore. Since maritime communications are common, we as a rule cannot attack those of the enemy without defending our own. In military operations the converse is the rule. Normally, an attack on our enemy's communications tends to expose their own. The theory of common communications will become clear by taking an example. In our wars with France our communications with the Mediterranean, India, and America ran down from the Channel mouth past Finisterre and St. Vincent; and those of France, at least from her Atlantic ports, were identical for almost their entire distance. In our wars with the Dutch the identity was even closer. Even in the case of Spain, her great trade routes followed the same lines as our own for the greater part of their extent. Consequently the opening moves which we generally made to defend our trade by the occupation of those lines placed us in a position to attack our enemy's trade. The same situation arose even when our opening dispositions were designed as defence against home invasion or against attacks upon our colonies, for the positions our fleet had to take up to those ends always lay on or about the terminal and focal points of trade routes. Whether our immediate object were to bring the enemy's main fleets to action or to exercise economic pressure, it made but little difference. If the enemy were equally [pg 99] [pg 100] [pg 101] anxious to engage, it was at one of the terminal or focal areas we were almost certain to get contact. If he wished to avoid a decision, the best way to force him to action was to occupy his trade routes at the same vital points. Thus it comes about that, whereas on land the process of economic pressure, at least in the modern conception of war, should only begin after decisive victory, at sea it starts automatically from the first. Indeed such pressure may be the only means of forcing the decision we seek, as will appear more clearly when we come to deal with the other fundamental difference between land and sea warfare. Meanwhile we may note that at sea the use of economic pressure from the commencement is justified for two reasons. The first is, as we have seen, that it is an economy of means to use our defensive positions for attack when attack does not vitiate those positions, and it will not vitiate them if fleet cruisers operate with restraint. The second is, that interference with the enemy's trade has two aspects. It is not only a means of exerting the secondary economic pressure, it is also a primary means towards overthrowing the enemy's power of resistance. Wars are not decided exclusively by military and naval force. Finance is scarcely less important. When other things are equal, it is the longer purse that wins. It has even many times redressed an unfavourable balance of armed force and given victory to the physically weaker Power. Anything, therefore, which we are able to achieve towards crippling our enemy's finance is a direct step to his overthrow, and the most effective means we can employ to this end against a maritime State is to deny him the resources of seaborne trade. It will be seen, therefore, that in naval warfare, however closely we may concentrate our efforts on the destruction of our enemy's armed forces as the direct means to his overthrow, it would be folly to stay our hands when opportunities occur, as they will automatically, for undermining his financial position on which the continued vigour of those armed forces so largely depends. Thus the occupation of our enemy's sea communications and the confiscatory operations it connotes are in a sense primary operations, and not, as on land, secondary. Such, then, are the abstract conclusions at which we arrive in our attempt to analyse the idea of command of the sea and to give it precision as the control of common communications. Their concrete value will appear when we come to deal with the various forms which naval operations may take, such as, "seeking out the enemy's fleet," blockade, attack and defence of trade, and the safeguarding of combined expeditions. For the present it remains to deal with the various kinds of sea command which flow from the communication idea. If the object of the command of the sea is to control communications, it is obvious it may exist in various degrees. We may be able to control the whole of the common communications as the result either of great initial preponderance or of decisive victory. If we are not sufficiently strong to do this, we may still be able to control some of the communications; that is, our control may be general or local. Obvious as the point is, it needs emphasising, because of a maxim that has become current that "the sea is all one." Like other maxims of the kind, it conveys a truth with a trail of error in its wake. The truth it contains seems to be simply this, that as a rule local control can only avail us temporarily, for so long as the enemy has a sufficient fleet anywhere, it is theoretically in his power to overthrow our control of any special sea area. It amounts indeed to little more than a rhetorical expression, used to emphasise the high mobility of fleets as contrasted with that of armies and the absence of physical obstacles to restrict that mobility. That this vital feature of naval warfare should be consecrated in a maxim is well, but when it is caricatured into a doctrine, as it sometimes is, that you cannot move a battalion oversea till you have entirely overthrown your enemy's fleet, it deserves gibbeting. It would be as wise to hold that in war you must never risk anything. It would seem to have been the evil influence of this travestied maxim which had much to do with the cramped and timorous strategy of the Americans in their late war with Spain. They had ample naval force to secure such a local and temporary command of the Gulf of Mexico as to have justified them at once in throwing all the troops they had ready into Cuba to support the insurgents, in accordance with their war plan. They had also sufficient strength to ensure that the communications with the expeditionary force could not be interrupted permanently. And yet, because the Spaniards had an undefeated fleet at sea somewhere, they hesitated, and were nearly lost. The Japanese had no such illusions. Without having struck a naval blow of any kind, and with a hostile fleet actually within the theatre of operations, they started their essential military movement oversea, content that though they might not be able to secure the control of the line of passage, they were in a position to deny effective control to the enemy. Our own history is full of such operations. There are cases in plenty where the results promised by a successful military blow oversea, before permanent command had been obtained, were great enough to justify a risk which, like the Japanese, we knew how to minimise by judicious use of our favourable geographical position, and of a certain system of protection, which must be dealt with later. For the purpose, then, of framing a plan of war or campaign, it must be taken that command may exist in various states or degrees, each of which has its special possibilities and limitations. It may be general or local, and it may be permanent or temporary. General command may be permanent or temporary, but mere local command, except [pg 102] [pg 103] [pg 104] in very favourable geographical conditions, should scarcely ever be regarded as more than temporary, since normally it is always liable to interruption from other theatres so long as the enemy possesses an effective naval force. Finally, it has to be noted that even permanent general command can never in practice be absolute. No degree of naval superiority can ensure our communications against sporadic attack from detached cruisers, or even raiding squadrons if they be boldly led and are prepared to risk destruction. Even after Hawke's decisive victory at Quiberon had completed the overthrow of the enemy's sea forces, a British transport was captured between Cork and Portsmouth, and an Indiaman in sight of the Lizard, while Wellington's complaints in the Peninsula of the insecurity of his communications are well known.9 By general and permanent control we do not mean that the enemy can do nothing, but that he cannot interfere with our maritime trade and oversea operations so seriously as to affect the issue of the war, and that he cannot carry on his own trade and operations except at such risk and hazard as to remove them from the field of practical strategy. In other words, it means that the enemy can no longer attack our lines of passage and communication effectively, and that he cannot use or defend his own. To complete our equipment for appreciating any situation for which operations have to be designed, it is necessary to remember that when the command is in dispute the general conditions may give a stable or an unstable equilibrium. It may be that the power of neither side preponderates to any appreciable extent. It may also be that the preponderance is with ourselves, or it may be that it lies with the enemy. Such preponderance of course will not depend entirely on actual relative strength, either physical or moral, but will be influenced by the inter-relation of naval positions and the comparative convenience of their situation in regard to the object of the war or campaign. By naval positions we mean, firstly, naval bases and, secondly, the terminals of the greater lines of communication or trade-routes and the focal areas where they tend to converge, as at Finisterre, Gibraltar, Suez, the Cape, Singapore, and many others. Upon the degree and distribution of this preponderance will depend in a general way the extent to which our plans will be governed by the idea of defence or offence. Generally speaking, it will be to the advantage of the preponderating side to seek a decision as quickly as possible in order to terminate the state of dispute. Conversely, the weaker side will as a rule seek to avoid or postpone a decision in hope of being able by minor operations, the chances of war, or the development of fresh strength, to turn the balance in its favour. Such was the line which France adopted frequently in her wars with us, sometimes legitimately, but sometimes to such an excess as seriously to demoralise her fleet. Her experience has led to a hasty deduction that the defensive at sea for even a weaker Power is an unmixed evil. Such a conclusion is foreign to the fundamental principles of war. It is idle to exclude the use of an expectant attitude because in itself it cannot lead to final success, and because if used to excess it ends in demoralisation and the loss of will to attack. The misconception appears to have arisen from insistence on the drawbacks of defence by writers seeking to persuade their country to prepare in time of peace sufficient naval strength to justify offence from the outset. Having now determined the fundamental principles which underlie the idea of Command of the Sea, we are in a position to consider the manner in which fleets are constituted in order to fit them for their task. CHAPTER TWO THEORY OF THE MEANS—THE CONSTITUTION OF FLEETS In all eras of naval warfare fighting ships have exhibited a tendency to differentiate into groups in accordance with the primary function each class was designed to serve. These groupings or classifications are what is meant by the constitution of a fleet. A threefold differentiation into battleships, cruisers, and flotilla has so long dominated naval thought that we have come to regard it as normal, and even essential. It may be so, but such a classification has been by no means constant. Other ideas of fleet constitution have not only existed, but have stood the test of war for long periods, and it is unscientific and unsafe to ignore such facts if we wish to arrive at sound doctrine. [pg 105] [pg 106] [pg 107] The truth is, that the classes of ships which constitute a fleet are, or ought to be, the expression in material of the strategical and tactical ideas that prevail at any given time, and consequently they have varied not only with the ideas, but also with the material in vogue. It may also be said more broadly that they have varied with the theory of war, by which more or less consciously naval thought was dominated. It is true that few ages have formulated a theory of war, or even been clearly aware of its influence; but nevertheless such theories have always existed, and even in their most nebulous and intangible shapes seem to have exerted an ascertainable influence on the constitution of fleets. Going back to the dawn of modern times, we note that at the opening of the sixteenth century, when galley warfare reached its culmination, the constitution was threefold, bearing a superficial analogy to that which we have come to regard as normal. There were the galeasses and heavy galleys corresponding to our battleships, light galleys corresponding to our cruisers, while the flotilla was represented by the small "frigates," "brigantines," and similar craft, which had no slave gang for propulsion, but were rowed by the fighting crew. Such armed sailing ships as then existed were regarded as auxiliaries, and formed a category apart, as fireships and bomb-vessels did in the sailing period, and as mine-layers do now. But the parallel must not be overstrained. The distinction of function between the two classes of galleys was not so strongly marked as that between the lighter craft and the galleys; that is to say, the scientific differentiation between battleships and cruisers had not yet been so firmly developed as it was destined to become in later times, and the smaller galleys habitually took their place in the fighting line. With the rise of the sailing vessel as the typical ship-of-war an entirely new constitution made its appearance. The dominating classification became twofold. It was a classification into vessels of subservient movement using sails, and vessels of free movement using oars. It was on these lines that our true Royal Navy was first organised by Henry the Eighth, an expert who, in the science of war, was one of the most advanced masters in Europe. In this constitution there appears even less conception than in that of the galley period of a radical distinction between battleships and cruisers. As Henry's fleet was originally designed, practically the whole of the battleships were sailing vessels, though it is true that when the French brought up galleys from the Mediterranean, he gave some of the smartest of them oars. The constitution was in fact one of battleships and flotilla. Of cruisers there were none as we understand them. Fleet scouting was done by the "Row-barges" and newly introduced "Pinnaces" of the flotilla, while as for commerce protection, merchant vessels had usually to look after themselves, the larger ones being regularly armed for their own defence. The influence of this twofold constitution continued long after the conditions of its origin had passed away. In ever-lessening degree indeed it may be said to have lasted for two hundred years. During the Dutch wars of the seventeenth century, which finally established the dominant status of the sailing warship, practically all true sailing vessels—that is, vessels that had no auxiliary oar propulsion—took station in the line. The "Frigates" of that time differed not at all from the "Great Ship" in their functions, but only in their design. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, however, the old tendency to a threefold organisation began to reassert itself, but it was not till the middle of the century that the process of development can be regarded as complete. Down to the end of the War of the Austrian Succession—a period which is usually deemed to be one of conspicuous depression in the naval art—the classification of our larger sailing vessels was purely arbitrary. The "Rates" (which had been introduced during the Dutch wars) bore no relation to any philosophical conception of the complex duties of a fleet. In the first rate were 100-gun ships; in the second, 90-gun ships—all three-deckers. So far the system of rating was sound enough, but when we come to the third rate we find it includes 80-gun ships, which were also of three decks, while the bulk of the rest were 70-gun two-deckers. The fourth rate was also composed of two-decked ships—weak battle-units of 60 and 50 guns—and this was far the largest class. All these four rates were classed as ships-of-the-line. Below them came the fifth rates, which, though they were used as cruisers, had no distinct class name. They differed indeed only in degree from the ship-of-the-line, being all cramped two-deckers of 44 and 40 guns, and they must be regarded, in so far as they expressed any logical idea of naval warfare, as the forerunners of the "Intermediate" class, represented in the succeeding epochs by 50-gun ships, and in our own time by armoured cruisers. The only true cruiser is found in the sixth rate, which comprised small and weakly armed 20-gun ships, and between them and the "Forties" there was nothing. Below them, but again without any clear differentiation, came the unrated sloops representing the flotilla. In such a system of rating there is no logical distinction either between large and small battleships or between battleships and cruisers, or between cruisers and flotilla. The only marked break in the gradual descent is that between the 40-gun two-deckers and the 20-gun cruisers. As these latter vessels as well as the sloops used sweeps for auxiliary propulsion, we are forced to conclude that the only basis of the classification was that adopted by Henry the Eighth, which, sound as it was in his time, had long ceased to have any real relation to the actuality of naval war. [pg 108] [pg 109] [pg 110] It was not till Anson's memorable administration that a scientific system of rating was re-established and the fleet at last assumed the logical constitution which it retained up to our own time. In the first two rates appear the fleet flagship class, three-deckers of 100 and 90 guns respectively. All smaller three-deckers are eliminated. In the next two rates we have the rank and file of the battle-line, two-deckers of increased size-namely, seventy-fours in the third rate, and sixty-fours in the fourth. Here, however, is a slight break in the perfection of the system, for the fourth rate also included 50-gun ships of two decks, which, during the progress of the Seven Years' War, ceased to be regarded as ships-of-the-line. War experience was eliminating small battleships, and therewith it called for a type intermediate between battleships and cruisers, with whose functions we shall have to deal directly. In practice these units soon formed a rate by themselves, into which, by the same tendency, 60-gun ships were destined to sink half a century later. But most pregnant of all Anson's reforms was the introduction of the true cruiser, no longer a small battleship, but a vessel specialised for its logical functions, and distinct in design both from the battle rates and the flotilla. Both 40-gun and 20-gun types were abolished, and in their place appear two cruiser rates, and the fifth consisting of 32-gun true frigates, and the sixth of 28-gun frigates, both completely divorced from any battle function. Finally, after a very distinct gap, came the unrated sloops and smaller craft, which formed the flotilla for coastwise and inshore work, despatch service, and kindred duties. The reforms of the great First Lord amounted in fact to a clearly apprehended threefold constitution, in which the various groups were frankly specialised in accordance with the functions each was expected to perform. Specialisation, it will be observed, is the note of the process of development. We have no longer an endeavour to adapt the fleet to its multifarious duties by multiplying a comparatively weak nature of fighting-ship, which could act in the line and yet be had in sufficient numbers to protect commerce, but which was not well fitted for either service. Instead we note a definite recognition of the principle that battleships should be as powerful as possible, and that in order to permit of their due development they must be relieved of their cruising functions by a class of vessel specially adapted for the purpose. The question we have to consider is, was this specialisation, which has asserted itself down to our own times, in the true line of development? Was it, in fact, a right expression of the needs which are indicated by the theory of naval war? By the theory of naval war it must be reiterated we mean nothing but an enunciation of the fundamental principles which underlie all naval war. Those principles, if we have determined them correctly, should be found giving shape not only to strategy and tactics, but also to material, whatever method and means of naval warfare may be in use at any given time. Conversely, if we find strategy, tactics, or organisation exhibiting a tendency to reproduce the same forms under widely differing conditions of method and material, we should be able to show that those forms bear a constant and definite relation to the principles which our theory endeavours to express. In the case of Anson's threefold organisation, the relation is not far to seek, though it has become obscured by two maxims. The one is, that "the command of the sea depends upon battleships," and the other, that "cruisers are the eyes of the fleet." It is the inherent evil of maxims that they tend to get stretched beyond their original meaning. Both of these express a truth, but neither expresses the whole truth. On no theory of naval warfare can we expect to command the sea with battleships, nor, on the communication theory, can we regard the primary function of cruisers as being to scout for a battle-fleet. It is perfectly true that the control depends ultimately on the battle- fleet if control is disputed by a hostile battle-fleet, as it usually is. It is also true that, so far as is necessary to enable the battle-fleet to secure the control, we have to furnish it with eyes from our cruiser force. But it does not follow that this is the primary function of cruisers. The truth is, we have to withdraw them from their primary function in order to do work for the battle-fleet which it cannot do for itself. Well established as is the "Eyes of the fleet" maxim, it would be very difficult to show that scouting was ever regarded as the primary function of cruisers by the highest authorities. In Nelson's practice at least their paramount function was to exercise the control which he was securing with his battle-squadron. Nothing is more familiar in naval history than his incessant cry from the Mediterranean for more cruisers, but the significance of that cry has become obscured. It was not that his cruisers were not numerous in proportion to his battleships— they were usually nearly double in number—but it was rather that he was so deeply convinced of their true function, that he used them to exercise control to an extent which sometimes reduced his fleet cruisers below the limit of bare necessity. The result on a memorable occasion was the escape of the enemy's battle-fleet, but the further result is equally important. It was that the escape of that fleet did not deprive him of the control which he was charged to maintain. His judgment may have been at fault, but the strategical distribution of his force was consistent throughout the whole period of his Mediterranean command. Judged by his record, no man ever grasped more clearly than Nelson that the object of naval warfare was to control communications, and if he found that he had not a sufficient number of cruisers to exercise that control and to furnish eyes for his battle-fleet as well, it was the battle-fleet that was made to suffer, and surely this is at least the logical view. Had the French been ready to risk settling the question of the control in a fleet action, it would have been different. He would [pg 111] [pg 112] [pg 113] [pg 114] then have been right to sacrifice the exercise of control for the time in order to make sure that the action should take place and end decisively in his favour. But he knew they were not ready to take such a risk, and he refused to permit a purely defensive attitude on the part of the enemy to delude him from the special function with which he had been charged. If the object of naval warfare is to control communications, then the fundamental requirement is the means of exercising that control. Logically, therefore, if the enemy holds back from battle decision, we must relegate the battle-fleet to a secondary position, for cruisers are the means of exercising control; the battle-fleet is but the means of preventing their being interfered with in their work. Put it to the test of actual practice. In no case can we exercise control by battleships alone. Their specialisation has rendered them unfit for the work, and has made them too costly ever to be numerous enough. Even, therefore, if our enemy had no battle-fleet we could not make control effective with battleships alone. We should still require cruisers specialised for the work and in sufficient numbers to cover the necessary ground. But the converse is not true. We could exercise control with cruisers alone if the enemy had no battle-fleet to interfere with them. If, then, we seek a formula that will express the practical results of our theory, it would take some such shape as this. On cruisers depends our exercise of control; on the battle-fleet depends the security of control. That is the logical sequence of ideas, and it shows us that the current maxim is really the conclusion of a logical argument in which the initial steps must not be ignored. The maxim that the command of the sea depends on the battle-fleet is then perfectly sound so long as it is taken to include all the other facts on which it hangs. The true function of the battle-fleet is to protect cruisers and flotilla at their special work. The best means of doing this is of course to destroy the enemy's power of interference. The doctrine of destroying the enemy's armed forces as the paramount object here reasserts itself, and reasserts itself so strongly as to permit for most practical purposes the rough generalisation that the command depends upon the battle-fleet. Of what practical use then, it may be asked, is all this hairsplitting? Why not leave untainted the conviction that our first and foremost business is to crush the enemy's battle-fleet, and that to this end our whole effort should be concentrated? The answer is to point to Nelson's dilemma. It was a dilemma which, in the golden age of naval warfare, every admiral at sea had had to solve for himself, and it was always one of the most difficult details of every naval war plan. If we seek to ensure the effective action of the battle-fleet by giving it a large proportion of cruisers, by so much do we weaken the actual and continuous exercise of control. If we seek to make that control effective by devoting to the service a large proportion of cruisers, by so much do we prejudice our chance of getting contact with and defeating the enemy's battle-fleet, which is the only means of perfecting control. The correct solution of the dilemma will of course depend upon the conditions of each case—mainly upon the relative strength and activity of the hostile battle-fleet and our enemy's probable intentions. But no matter how completely we have tabulated all the relevant facts, we can never hope to come to a sound conclusion upon them without a just appreciation of all the elements which go to give command, and without the power of gauging their relative importance. This, and this alone, will ultimately settle the vital question of what proportion of our cruiser force it is right to devote to the battle-fleet. If the doctrine of cruiser control be correct, then every cruiser attached to the battle-fleet is one withdrawn from its true function. Such withdrawals are inevitable. A squadron of battleships is an imperfect organism unable to do its work without cruiser assistance, and since the performance of its work is essential to cruiser freedom, some cruisers must be sacrificed. But in what proportion? If we confine ourselves to the view that command depends on the battle-fleet, then we shall attach to it such a number as its commander may deem necessary to make contact with the enemy absolutely certain and to surround himself with an impenetrable screen. If we knew the enemy was as anxious for a decision as ourselves, such a course might be justified. But the normal condition is that if we desire a decision it is because we have definite hopes of success, and consequently the enemy will probably seek to avoid one on our terms. In practice this means that if we have perfected our arrangements for the destruction of his main fleet he will refuse to expose it till he sees a more favourable opportunity. And what will be the result? He remains on the defensive, and theoretically all the ensuing period of inaction tends to fall into his scale. Without stirring from port his fleet is doing its work. The more closely he induces us to concentrate our cruiser force in face of his battle-fleet, the more he frees the sea for the circulation of his own trade, and the more he exposes ours to cruiser raids. Experience, then, and theory alike dictate that as a general principle cruisers should be regarded as primarily concerned with the active occupation of communications, and that withdrawals for fleet purposes should be reduced to the furthest margin of reasonable risk. What that margin should be can only be decided on the circumstances of each case as it arises, and by the personal characteristics of the officers who are responsible. Nelson's practice was to reduce fleet cruisers lower than perhaps any other commander. So small indeed was the margin of efficiency he left, that in the campaign already cited, when his judgment was ripest, one stroke of ill- [pg 115] [pg 116] [pg 117] luck—a chance betrayal of his position by a neutral—availed to deprive him of the decision he sought, and to let the enemy's fleet escape. We arrive, then, at this general conclusion. The object of naval warfare is to control maritime communications. In order to exercise that control effectively we must have a numerous class of vessels specially adapted for pursuit. But their power of exercising control is in proportion to our degree of command, that is, to our power of preventing their operations being interfered with by the enemy. Their own power of resistance is in inverse proportion to their power of exercising control; that is to say, the more numerous and better adapted they are for preying on commerce and transports, the weaker will be their individual fighting power. We cannot give them as a whole the power of resisting disturbance without at the same time reducing their power of exercising control. The accepted solution of the difficulty during the great period of Anson's school was to provide them with a covering force of battle units specially adapted for fighting. But here arises a correlative difficulty. In so far as we give our battle units fighting power we deny them scouting power, and scouting is essential to their effective operation. The battle-fleet must have eyes. Now, vessels adapted for control of communications are also well adapted for "eyes." It becomes the practice, therefore, to withdraw from control operations a sufficient number of units to enable the battle-fleet to cover effectively the operations of those that remain. Such were the broad principles on which the inevitable dilemma always had to be solved, and on which Anson's organisation was based. They flow naturally from the communication theory of maritime war, and it was this theory which then dominated naval thought, as is apparent from the technical use of such phrases as "lines of passage and communication." The war plans of the great strategists from Anson and Barham can always be resolved into these simple elements, and where we find the Admiralty grip of them loosened, we have the confusion and quite unnecessary failures of the War of American Independence. In that mismanaged contest the cardinal mistake was that we suffered the enemy's battle-fleets to get upon and occupy the vital lines of "passage and communication" without first bringing them to action, an error partly due to the unreadiness of a weak administration, and partly to an insufficient allocation of cruisers to secure contact at the right places. So far, then, the principles on which our naval supremacy was built up are clear. For the enemies with whom we had to deal Anson's system was admirably conceived. Both Spain and France held the communication theory so strongly, that they were content to count as success the power of continually disturbing our control without any real attempt to secure it for themselves. To defeat such a policy Anson's constitution and the strategy it connoted were thoroughly well adapted and easy to work. But it by no means follows that his doctrine is the last word. Even in his own time complications had begun to develop which tended to confuse the precision of his system. By the culminating year of Trafalgar there were indications that it was getting worn out, while the new methods and material used by the Americans in 1812 made a serious rent in it. The disturbances then inaugurated have continued to develop, and it is necessary to consider how seriously they have confused the problem of fleet constitution. Firstly, there is the general recognition, always patent to ourselves, that by far the most drastic, economical, and effective way of securing control is to destroy the enemy's means of interfering with it. In our own service this "overthrow" idea always tended to assert itself so strongly, that occasionally the means became for a time more important than the end; that is to say, circumstances were such that on occasions it was considered advisable to sacrifice the exercise of control for a time in order quickly and permanently to deprive the enemy of all means of interference. When there was reasonable hope of the enemy risking a decision this consideration tended to override all others; but when, as in Nelson's case in the Mediterranean, the hope was small, the exercise of control tended to take the paramount place. The second complexity arose from the fact that however strong might be our battleship cover, it is impossible for it absolutely to secure cruiser control from disturbance by sporadic attack. Isolated heavy ships, taking advantage of the chances of the sea, could elude even the strictest blockade, and one such ship, if she succeeded in getting upon a line of communication, might paralyse the operations of a number of weaker units. They must either run or concentrate, and in either case the control was broken. If it were a squadron of heavy ships that caused the disturbance, the practice was to detach against it a division of the covering battle-fleet. But it was obviously highly inconvenient and contrary to the whole idea on which the constitution of the fleet was based to allow every slight danger to cruiser control to loosen the cohesion of the main fleet. It was necessary, then, to give cruiser lines some power of resistance. This necessity once admitted, there seemed no point at which you could stop increasing the fighting power of your cruisers, and sooner or later, unless some means of checking the process were found, the distinction between cruisers and battleships would practically disappear. Such a means was found in what may be called the "Intermediate" ship. Frigates did indeed continue to increase in size and fighting power throughout the remainder of the sailing era, but it was not only in this manner that the power of resistance was gained. The evil results of the movement were checked by the introduction of a [pg 118] [pg 119] [pg 120] supporting ship, midway between frigates and true ships-of-the-line. Sometimes classed as a battleship, and taking her place in the line, the 50-gun ship came to be essentially a type for stiffening cruiser squadrons. They most commonly appear as the flagships of cruiser commodores, or stationed in terminal waters or at focal points where sporadic raids were likely to fall and be most destructive. The strategical effect of the presence of such a vessel in a cruiser line was to give the whole line in some degree the strength of the intermediate ship; for any hostile cruiser endeavouring to disturb the line was liable to have to deal with the supporting ship, while if a frigate and a 50-gun ship got together they were a match even for a small ship-of-the-line. In sailing days, of course, this power of the supporting ship was weak owing to the imperfection of the means of distant communication between ships at sea and the non-existence of such means beyond extreme range of vision. But as wireless telegraphy develops it is not unreasonable to expect that the strategic value of the supporting or intermediate ship will be found greater than it ever was in sailing days, and that for dealing with sporadic disturbance the tendency will be for a cruiser line to approximate more and more in power of resistance to that of its strongest unit. For fleet service a cruiser's power of resistance was hardly less valuable; for though we speak of fleet cruisers as the eyes of the fleet, their purpose is almost equally to blindfold the enemy. Their duty is not only to disclose the movements of the enemy, but also to act as a screen to conceal our own. The point was specially well marked in the blockades, where the old 50-gun ships are almost always found with the inshore cruiser squadron, preventing that squadron being forced by inquisitive frigates. Important as this power of resistance in the screen was in the old days, it is tenfold more important now, and the consequent difficulty of keeping cruisers distinct from battleships is greater than ever. The reason for this is best considered under the third and most serious cause of complexity. The third cause is the acquisition by the flotilla of battle power. It is a feature of naval warfare that is entirely new.10 For all practical purposes it was unknown until the full development of the mobile torpedo. It is true that the fireship as originally conceived was regarded as having something of the same power. During the Dutch wars —the heyday of its vogue—its assigned power was on some occasions actually realised, as in the burning of Lord Sandwich's flagship at the battle of Solebay, and the destruction of the Spanish-Dutch fleet at Palermo by Duquesne. But as the "nimbleness" of great-ships increased with the ripening of seamanship and naval architecture, the fireship as a battle weapon became almost negligible, while a fleet at anchor was found to be thoroughly defensible by its own picket-boats. Towards the middle of the eighteenth century indeed the occasions on which the fireship could be used for its special purpose was regarded as highly exceptional, and though the type was retained till the end of the century, its normal functions differed not at all from those of the rest of the flotilla of which it then formed part. Those functions, as we have seen, expressed the cruising idea in its purest sense. It was numbers and mobility that determined flotilla types rather than armament or capacity for sea-endurance. Their primary purpose was to control communications in home and colonial waters against weakly armed privateers. The type which these duties determined fitted them adequately for the secondary purpose of inshore and despatch work with a fleet. It was, moreover, on the ubiquity which their numbers gave them, and on their power of dealing with unarmed or lightly armed vessels, that we relied for our first line of defence against invasion. These latter duties were of course exceptional, and the Navy List did not carry as a rule sufficient numbers for the purpose. But a special value of the class was that it was capable of rapid and almost indefinite expansion from the mercantile marine. Anything that could carry a gun had its use, and during the period of the Napoleonic threat the defence flotilla rose all told to considerably over a thousand units. Formidable and effective as was a flotilla of this type for the ends it was designed to serve, it obviously in no way affected the security of a battle-fleet. But so soon as the flotilla acquired battle power the whole situation was changed, and the old principles of cruiser design and distribution were torn to shreds. The battle-fleet became a more imperfect organism than ever. Formerly it was only its offensive power that required supplementing. The new condition meant that unaided it could no longer ensure its own defence. It now required screening, not only from observation, but also from flotilla attack. The theoretical weakness of an arrested offensive received a practical and concrete illustration to a degree that war had scarcely ever known. Our most dearly cherished strategical traditions were shaken to the bottom. The "proper place" for our battle-fleet had always been "on the enemy's coasts," and now that was precisely where the enemy would be best pleased to see it. What was to be done? So splendid a tradition could not lightly be laid aside, but the attempt to preserve it involved us still deeper in heresy. The vital, most difficult, and most absorbing problem has become not how to increase the power of a battle-fleet for attack, which is a comparatively simple matter, but how to defend it. As the offensive power of the flotilla developed, the problem pressed with an almost bewildering intensity. With every increase in the speed and sea-keeping power of torpedo craft, the problem of the screen grew more exacting. To keep the hostile flotilla out [pg 121] [pg 122] [pg 123] of night range the screen must be flung out wider and wider, and this meant more and more cruisers withdrawn from their primary function. And not only this. The screen must not only be far flung, but it must be made as far as possible impenetrable. In other words, its own power of resistance must be increased all along the line. Whole squadrons of armoured cruisers had to be attached to battle-fleets to support the weaker members of the screen. The crying need for this type of ship set up a rapid movement for increasing their fighting power, and with it fell with equal rapidity the economic possibility of giving the cruiser class its essential attribute of numbers. As an inevitable result we find ourselves involved in an effort to restore to the flotilla some of its old cruiser capacity, by endowing it with gun armament, higher sea-keeping power, and facilities for distant communication, all at the cost of specialisation and of greater economic strain. Still judged by past experience, some means of increasing numbers in the cruising types is essential, nor is it clear how it is possible to secure that essential in the ranks of the true cruiser. No point has been found at which it was possible to stop the tendency of this class of vessel to increase in size and cost, or to recall it to the strategical position it used to occupy. So insecure is the battle-squadron, so imperfect as a self-contained weapon has it become, that its need has overridden the old order of things, and the primary function of the cruising ship inclines to be no longer the exercise of control under cover of the battle-fleet. The battle-fleet now demands protection by the cruising ship, and what the battle-fleet needs is held to be the first necessity. Judged by the old naval practice, it is an anomalous position to have reached. But the whole naval art has suffered a revolution beyond all previous experience, and it is possible the old practice is no longer a safe guide. Driven by the same necessities, every naval Power is following the same course. It may be right, it may be wrong; no one at least but the ignorant or hasty will venture to pass categorical judgment. The best we can do is to endeavour to realise the situation to which, in spite of all misgivings, we have been forced, and to determine its relations to the developments of the past. It is undoubtedly a difficult task. As we have seen, there have prevailed in the constitution of fleets at various times several methods of expressing the necessities of naval war. The present system differs from them all. On the one hand, we have the fact that the latest developments of cruiser power have finally obliterated all logical distinction between cruisers and battleships, and we thus find ourselves hand in hand with the fleet constitution of the old Dutch wars. On the other, however, we have armoured cruisers organised in squadrons and attached to battle-fleets not only for strategical purposes, but also with as yet undeveloped tactical functions in battle. Here we come close to the latest development of the sailing era, when "Advanced" or "Light" squadrons began to appear in the organisation of battle-fleets. The system arose towards the end of the eighteenth century in the Mediterranean, where the conditions of control called for so wide a dispersal of cruisers and so great a number of them, that it was almost imperative for a battle- squadron in that sea to do much of its own scouting. It was certainly for this purpose that the fastest and lightest ships-of-the-line were formed into a separate unit, and the first designation it received was that of "Observation Squadron." It remained for Nelson to endeavour to endow it with a tactical function, but his idea was never realised either by himself or any of his successors. Side by side with this new element in the organisation of a battle-fleet, which perhaps is best designated as a "Light Division," we have another significant fact. Not only was it not always composed entirely of ships-of-the- line, especially in the French service, but in 1805, the year of the full development, we have Sir Richard Strachan using the heavy frigates attached to his battle-squadron as a "Light Division," and giving them a definite tactical function. The collapse of the French Navy put a stop to further developments of either idea. Whither they would have led we cannot tell. But it is impossible to shut our eyes to the indication of a growing tendency towards the system that exists at present. It is difficult at least to ignore the fact that both Nelson and Strachan in that culminating year found the actuality of war calling for something for which there was then no provision in the constitution of the fleet, but which it does contain to-day. What Nelson felt for was a battleship of cruiser speed. What Strachan desired was a cruiser fit to take a tactical part in a fleet action. We have them both, but with what result? Anson's specialisation of types has almost disappeared, and our present fleet constitution is scarcely to be distinguished from that of the seventeenth century. We retain the three-fold nomenclature, but the system itself has really gone. Battleships grade into armoured cruisers, armoured cruisers into protected cruisers. We can scarcely detect any real distinction except a twofold one between vessels whose primary armament is the gun and vessels whose primary armament is the torpedo. But even here the existence of a type of cruiser designed to act with flotillas blurs the outline, while, as we have seen, the larger units of the flotilla are grading up to cruiser level. We are thus face to face with a situation which has its closest counterpart in the structureless fleets of the seventeenth century. That naval thought should have so nearly retraced its steps in the course of two centuries is curious enough, but it is still more striking when we consider how widely the underlying causes differ in each [pg 124] [pg 125] [pg 126] case. The pressure which has forced the present situation is due most obviously to two causes. One is the excessive development of the "intermediate" ship originally devised for purposes of commerce protection, and dictated by a menace which the experience of the American War had taught us to respect. The other is the introduction of the torpedo, and the consequent vulnerability of battle-squadrons that are not securely screened. Nothing of the kind had any influence on the fleet constitution of the seventeenth century. But if we seek deeper, there is a less obvious consideration which for what it is worth is too striking to be ignored. It has been suggested above that the constitution of fleets appears to have some more or less recognisable relation to the prevalent theory of war. Now, amongst all our uncertainty we can assert with confidence that the theory which holds the field at the present day bears the closest possible resemblance to that which dominated the soldier-admirals of the Dutch war. It was the "Overthrow" theory, the firm faith in the decisive action as the key of all strategical problems. They carried it to sea with them from the battlefields of the New Model Army, and the Dutch met them squarely. In the first war at least their commerce had to give place to the exigencies of throwing into the battle everything that could affect the issue. It is not of course pretended that this attitude was dictated by any clearly conceived theory of absolute war. It was due rather to the fact that, owing to the relative geographical conditions, all attempts to guard trade communications were useless without the command of the home waters in the North Sea, and the truth received a clinching moral emphasis from the British claim to the actual dominion of the Narrow Seas. It was, in fact, a war which resembled rather the continental conditions of territorial conquest than the naval procedure that characterised our rivalry with France. Is it then possible, however much we may resist the conclusion in loyalty to the eighteenth-century tradition, that the rise of a new naval Power in the room of Holland must bring us back to the drastic, if crude, methods of the Dutch wars, and force us to tread under foot the nicer ingenuity of Anson's system? Is it this which has tempted us to mistrust any type of vessel which cannot be flung into the battle? The recurrence of a formidable rival in the North Sea was certainly not the first cause of the reaction. It began before that menace arose. Still it has undoubtedly forced the pace, and even if it be not a cause, it may well be a justification. CHAPTER THREE THEORY OF THE METHOD—CONCENTRATION AND DISPERSAL OF FORCE From the point of view of the method by which its ends are obtained, strategy is often described as the art of assembling the utmost force at the right time and place; and this method is called "Concentration." At first sight the term seems simple and expressive enough, but on analysis it will be found to include several distinct ideas, to all of which the term is applied indifferently. The result is a source of some confusion, even to the most lucid writers. "The word concentration," says one of the most recent of them, "evokes the idea of a grouping of forces. We believe, in fact, that we cannot make war without grouping ships into squadrons and squadrons into fleets."11 Here in one sentence the word hovers between the formation of fleets and their strategical distribution. Similar looseness will embarrass the student at every turn. At one time he will find the word used to express the antithesis of division or dispersal of force; at another, to express strategic deployment, which implies division to a greater or less extent. He will find it used of the process of assembling a force, as well as of the state of a force when the process is complete. The truth is that the term, which is one of the most common and most necessary in strategical discussion, has never acquired a very precise meaning, and this lack of precision is one of the commonest causes of conflicting opinion and questionable judgments. No strategical term indeed calls more urgently for a clear determination of the ideas for which it stands. Military phraseology, from which the word is taken, employs "concentration" in three senses. It is used for assembling the units of an army after they have been mobilised. In this sense, concentration is mainly an administrative process; logically, it means the complement of the process of mobilisation, whereby the army realises its war organisation and becomes ready to take the field. In a second sense it is used for the process of moving the army when formed, or in process of formation, to the localities from which operations can best begin. This is a true strategical stage, and it culminates in what is known as strategic deployment. Finally, it is used for [pg 127] [pg 128] [pg 129] the ultimate stage when the army so deployed is closed up upon a definite line of operations in immediate readiness for tactical deployment—gathered up, that is, to deal a concentrated blow. Well as this terminology appears to serve on land, where the processes tend to overlap, something more exact is required if we try to extend it to the sea. Such extension magnifies the error at every step, and clear thinking becomes difficult. Even if we set aside the first meaning, that is, the final stage of mobilisation, we have still to deal with the two others which, in a great measure, are mutually contradictory. The essential distinction of strategic deployment, which contemplates dispersal with a view to a choice of combinations, is flexibility and free movement. The characteristic of an army massed for a blow is rigidity and restricted mobility. In the one sense of concentration we contemplate a disposal of force which will conceal our intention from the enemy and will permit us to adapt our movements to the plan of operations he develops. In the other, strategic concealment is at an end. We have made our choice, and are committed to a definite operation. Clearly, then, if we would apply the principles of land concentration to naval warfare it is desirable to settle which of the two phases of an operation we mean by the term. Which meaning, then, is most closely connected with the ordinary use of the word? The dictionaries define concentration as "the state of being brought to a common point or centre," and this coincides very exactly with the stage of a war plan which intervenes between the completion of mobilisation and the final massing or deployment for battle. It is an incomplete and continuing act. Its ultimate consequence is the mass. It is a method of securing mass at the right time and place. As we have seen, the essence of the state of strategic deployment to which it leads is flexibility. In war the choice of time and place will always be influenced by the enemy's dispositions and movements, or by our desire to deal him an unexpected blow. The merit of concentration, then, in this sense, is its power of permitting us to form our mass in time at one of the greatest number of different points where mass may be required. It is for this stage that the more recent text-books incline to specialise concentration—qualifying it as "strategic concentration." But even that term scarcely meets the case, for the succeeding process of gathering up the army into a position for tactical deployment is also a strategical concentration. Some further specialisation is required. The analytical difference between the two processes is that the first is an operation of major strategy and the other of minor, and if they are to be fully expressed, we have to weight ourselves with the terms "major and minor strategic concentration." Such cumbrous terminology is too forbidding to use. It serves only to mark that the middle stage differs logically from the third as much as it does from the first. In practice it comes to this. If we are going to use concentration in its natural sense, we must regard it as something that comes after complete mobilisation and stops short of the formation of mass. In naval warfare at least this distinction between concentration and mass is essential to clear appreciation. It leads us to conclusions that are of the first importance. For instance, when once the mass is formed, concealment and flexibility are at an end. The further, therefore, from the formation of the ultimate mass we can stop the process of concentration the better designed it will be. The less we are committed to any particular mass, and the less we indicate what and where our mass is to be, the more formidable our concentration. To concentration, therefore, the idea of division is as essential as the idea of connection. It is this view of the process which, at least for naval warfare, a weighty critical authority has most strongly emphasised. "Such," he says, "is concentration reasonably understood—not huddled together like a drove of sheep, but distributed with a regard to a common purpose, and linked together by the effectual energy of a single will."12 Vessels in a state of concentration he compares to a fan that opens and shuts. In this view concentration connotes not a homogeneous body, but a compound organism controlled from a common centre, and elastic enough to permit it to cover a wide field without sacrificing the mutual support of its parts. If, then, we exclude the meaning of mere assembling and the meaning of the mass, we have left a signification which expresses coherent disposal about a strategical centre, and this it will be seen gives for naval warfare just the working definition that we want as the counterpart of strategic deployment on land. The object of a naval concentration like that of strategic deployment will be to cover the widest possible area, and to preserve at the same time elastic cohesion, so as to secure rapid condensations of any two or more of the parts of the organism, and in any part of the area to be covered, at the will of the controlling mind; and above all, a sure and rapid condensation of the whole at the strategical centre. Concentration of this nature, moreover, will be the expression of a war plan which, while solidly based on an ultimate central mass, still preserves the faculty of delivering or meeting minor attacks in any direction. It will permit us to exercise control of the sea while we await and work for the opportunity of a decision which shall permanently secure control, and it will permit this without prejudicing our ability of bringing the utmost force to [pg 130] [pg 131] [pg 132] bear when the moment for the decision arrives. Concentration, in fact, implies a continual conflict between cohesion and reach, and for practical purposes it is the right adjustment of those two tensions—ever shifting in force—which constitutes the greater part of practical strategy. In naval warfare this concentration stage has a peculiar significance in the development of a campaign, and at sea it is more clearly detached than ashore. Owing to the vast size of modern armies, and the restricted nature of their lines of movement, no less than their lower intrinsic mobility as compared with fleets, the processes of assembly, concentration, and forming the battle mass tend to grade into one another without any demarcation of practical value. An army frequently reaches the stage of strategic deployment direct from the mobilisation bases of its units, and on famous occasions its only real concentration has taken place on the battlefield. In Continental warfare, then, there is less difficulty in using the term to cover all three processes. Their tendency is always to overlap. But at sea, where communications are free and unrestricted by obstacles, and where mobility is high, they are susceptible of sharper differentiation. The normal course is for a fleet to assemble at a naval port; thence by a distinct movement it proceeds to the strategical centre and reaches out in divisions as required. The concentration about that centre may be very far from a mass, and the final formation of the mass will bear no resemblance to either of the previous movements, and will be quite distinct. But free as a fleet is from the special fetters of an army, there always exist at sea peculiar conditions of friction which clog its freedom of disposition. One source of this friction is commerce protection. However much our war plan may press for close concentration, the need of commerce protection will always be calling for dispersal. The other source is the peculiar freedom and secrecy of movements at sea. As the sea knows no roads to limit or indicate our own lines of operation, so it tells little about those of the enemy. The most distant and widely dispersed points must be kept in view as possible objectives of the enemy. When we add to this that two or more fleets can act in conjunction from widely separated bases with far greater certainty than is possible for armies, it is obvious that the variety of combinations is much higher at sea than on land, and variety of combination is in constant opposition to the central mass. It follows that so long as the enemy's fleet is divided, and thereby retains various possibilities of either concentrated or sporadic action, our distribution will be dictated by the need of being able to deal with a variety of combinations and to protect a variety of objectives. Our concentrations must therefore be kept as open and flexible as possible. History accordingly shows us that the riper and fresher our experience and the surer our grip of war, the looser were our concentrations. The idea of massing, as a virtue in itself, is bred in peace and not in war. It indicates the debilitating idea that in war we must seek rather to avoid than to inflict defeat. True, advocates of the mass entrench themselves in the plausible conception that their aim is to inflict crushing defeats. But this too is an idea of peace. War has proved to the hilt that victories have not only to be won, but worked for. They must be worked for by bold strategical combinations, which as a rule entail at least apparent dispersal. They can only be achieved by taking risks, and the greatest and most effective of these is division. The effect of prolonged peace has been to make "concentration" a kind of shibboleth, so that the division of a fleet tends almost to be regarded as a sure mark of bad leadership. Critics have come to lose sight of the old war experience, that without division no strategical combinations are possible. In truth they must be founded on division. Division is bad only when it is pushed beyond the limits of well-knit deployment. It is theoretically wrong to place a section of the fleet in such a position that it may be prevented from falling back on its strategical centre when it is encountered by a superior force. Such retreats of course can never be made certain; they will always depend in some measure on the skill and resource of the opposing commanders, and on the chances of weather: but risks must be taken. If we risk nothing, we shall seldom perform anything. The great leader is the man who can measure rightly to what breadth of deployment he can stretch his concentration. This power of bold and sure adjustment between cohesion and reach is indeed a supreme test of that judgment which in the conduct of war takes the place of strategical theory. In British naval history examples of faulty division are hard to find. The case most commonly cited is an early one. It occurred in 1666 during the second Dutch war. Monk and Rupert were in command of the main fleet, which from its mobilisation bases in the Thames and at Spithead had concentrated in the Downs. There they were awaiting De Ruyter's putting to sea in a position from which they could deal with him whether his object was an attack on the Thames or to join hands with the French. In this position a rumour reached them that the Toulon squadron was on its way to the Channel to co-operate with the Dutch. Upon this false intelligence the fleet was divided, and Rupert went back to Portsmouth to cover that position in case it might be the French objective. De Ruyter at once put to sea with a fleet greatly superior to Monk's division. Monk, however, taking advantage of thick weather that had supervened, surprised him at anchor, and believing he had a sufficient tactical advantage attacked him impetuously. Meanwhile the real situation became known. There was no French fleet, and Rupert was recalled. He succeeded in rejoining Monk after his action with De Ruyter had lasted three days. In the course [pg 133] [pg 134] [pg 135] [pg 136] of it Monk had been very severely handled and forced to retreat to the Thames, and it was generally believed that it was only the belated arrival of Rupert that saved us from a real disaster. The strategy in this case is usually condemned out of hand and made to bear the entire blame of the reverse. Monk, who as a soldier had proved himself one of the finest strategists of the time, is held to have blundered from sheer ignorance of elementary principles. It is assumed that he should have kept his fleet massed; but his critics fail to observe that at least in the opinion of the time this would not have met the case. Had he kept the whole to deal with De Ruyter, it is probable that De Ruyter would not have put to sea, and it is certain Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight would have lain open to the French had they come. If he had moved his mass to deal with the French, he would have exposed the Thames to De Ruyter. It was a situation that could not be solved by a simple application of what the French call the masse centrale. The only way to secure both places from attack was to divide the fleet, just as in 1801 Nelson in the same theatre was compelled to divide his defence force. In neither case was division a fault, because it was a necessity. The fault in Monk's and Rupert's case was that they extended their reach with no proper provision to preserve cohesion. Close cruiser connection should have been maintained between the two divisions, and Monk should not have engaged deeply till he felt Rupert at his elbow. This we are told was the opinion of most of his flag-officers. They held that he should not have fought when he did. His correct course, on Kempenfelt's principle, would have been to hang on De Ruyter so as to prevent his doing anything, and to have slowly fallen back, drawing the Dutch after him till his loosened concentration was closed up again. If De Ruyter had refused to follow him through the Straits, there would have been plenty of time to mass the fleet. If De Ruyter had followed, he could have been fought in a position from which there would have been no escape. The fault, in fact, was not strategical, but rather one of tactical judgment. Monk over- estimated the advantage of his surprise and the relative fighting values of the two fleets, and believed he saw his way to victory single-handed. The danger of division is being surprised and forced to fight in inferiority. This was not Monk's case. He was not surprised, and he could easily have avoided action had he so desired. To judge such a case simply by using concentration as a touchstone can only tend to set up such questionable habits of thought as have condemned the more famous division which occurred in the crisis of the campaign of 1805, and with which we must deal later. Apart from the general danger of using either words or maxims in this way, it is obviously specially unwise in the case of concentration and division. The current rule is that it is bad to divide unless you have a great superiority; yet there have been numerous occasions when, being at war with an inferior enemy, we have found our chief embarrassment in the fact that he kept his fleet divided, and was able thereby to set up something like a deadlock. The main object of our naval operations would then be to break it down. To force an inferior enemy to concentrate is indeed the almost necessary preliminary to securing one of those crushing victories at which we must always aim, but which so seldom are obtained. It is by forcing the enemy to attempt to concentrate that we get our opportunity by sagacious dispersal of crushing his divisions in detail. It is by inducing him to mass that we simplify our problem and compel him to choose between leaving to us the exercise of command and putting it to the decision of a great action. Advocates of close concentration will reply that that is true enough. We do often seek to force our enemy to concentrate, but that does not show that concentration is sometimes a disadvantage, for we ourselves must concentrate closely to force a similar concentration on the enemy. The maxim, indeed, has become current that concentration begets concentration, but it is not too much to say that it is a maxim which history flatly contradicts. If the enemy is willing to hazard all on a battle, it is true. But if we are too superior, or our concentration too well arranged for him to hope for victory, then our concentration has almost always had the effect of forcing him to disperse for sporadic action. So certain was this result, that in our old wars, in which we were usually superior, we always adopted the loosest possible concentrations in order to prevent sporadic action. True, the tendency of the French to adopt this mode of warfare is usually set down to some constitutional ineptitude that is outside strategical theory, but this view is due rather to the irritation which the method caused us, than to sober reasoning. For a comparatively weak belligerent sporadic action was better than nothing, and the only other alternative was for him to play into our hands by hazarding the decision which it was our paramount interest to obtain. Sporadic action alone could never give our enemy command of the sea, but it could do us injury and embarrass our plans, and there was always hope it might so much loosen our concentration as to give him a fair chance of obtaining a series of successful minor decisions. Take, now, the leading case of 1805. In that campaign our distribution was very wide, and was based on several concentrations. The first had its centre in the Downs, and extended not only athwart the invading army's line of passage, but also over the whole North Sea, so as to prevent interference with our trade or our system of coast defence either from the Dutch in the Texel or from French squadrons arriving north-about. The second, which was known as the Western Squadron, had its centre off Ushant, and was spread over the whole Bay of Biscay by means of advanced squadrons before Ferrol and Rochefort. With a further squadron off the coast of Ireland, it [pg 137] [pg 138] [pg 139] was able also to reach far out into the Atlantic in order to receive our trade. It kept guard, in fact, not only over the French naval ports, but over the approaches to the Channel, where were the home terminals of the great southern and western trade-routes. A third concentration was in the Mediterranean, whose centre under Nelson was at Sardinia. It had outlying sub-centres at Malta and Gibraltar, and covered the whole ground from Cape St. Vincent outside the Straits to Toulon, Trieste, and the Dardanelles. When war broke out with Spain in 1804, it was considered advisable to divide this command, and Spanish waters outside the Straits were held by a fourth concentration, whose centre was off Cadiz, and whose northern limit was Cape Finisterre, where it joined the Ushant concentration. For reasons which were personal rather than strategical this arrangement was not continued long, nor indeed after a few months was there the same need for it, for the Toulon squadron had changed its base to Cadiz. By this comprehensive system the whole of the European seas were controlled both for military and trade purposes. In the distant terminal areas, like the East and West Indies, there were nucleus concentrations with the necessary connective machinery permanently established, and to render them effective, provision was made by which the various European squadrons could throw off detachments to bring up their force to any strength which the movements of the enemy might render necessary. Wide as was this distribution, and great as its reach, a high degree of cohesion was maintained not only between the parts of each concentration, but between the several concentrations themselves. By means of a minor cruiser centre at the Channel Islands, the Downs and Ushant concentrations could rapidly cohere. Similarly the Cadiz concentration was linked up with that of Ushant at Finisterre, and but for personal friction and repulsion, the cohesion between the Mediterranean and Cadiz concentrations would have been equally strong. Finally, there was a masterly provision made for all the concentrations to condense into one great mass at the crucial point off Ushant before by any calculable chance a hostile mass could gather there. For Napoleon's best admirals, "who knew the craft of the sea," the British fleet thus disposed was in a state of concentration that nothing but a stroke of luck beyond the limit of sober calculation could break. Decrès and Bruix had no doubt of it, and the knowledge overpowered Villeneuve when the crisis came. After he had carried the concentration which Napoleon had planned so far as to have united three divisions in Ferrol, he knew that the outlying sections of our Western Squadron had disappeared from before Ferrol and Rochefort. In his eyes, as well as those of the British Admiralty, this squadron, in spite of its dispersal in the Bay of Biscay, had always been in a state of concentration. It was not this which caused his heart to fail. It was the news that Nelson had reappeared at Gibraltar, and had been seen steering northward. It meant for him that the whole of his enemy's European fleet was in a state of concentration. "Their concentration of force," he afterwards wrote, "was at the moment more serious than in any previous disposition, and such that they were in a position to meet in superiority the combined forces of Brest and Ferrol," and for that reason, he explained, he had given up the game as lost. But to Napoleon's unpractised eye it was impossible to see what it was he had to deal with. Measuring the elasticity of the British naval distribution by the comparatively cumbrous and restricted mobility of armies, he saw it as a rash and unwarlike dispersal. Its looseness seemed to indicate so great a tenderness for the distant objectives that lay open to his scattered squadrons, that he believed by a show of sporadic action he could further disperse our fleet, and then by a close concentration crush the essential part in detail. It was a clear case of the enemy's dispersal forcing us to adopt the loosest concentration, and of our comparative dispersal tempting the enemy to concentrate and hazard a decision. It cannot be said we forced the fatal move upon him intentionally. It was rather the operation of strategical law set in motion by our bold distribution. We were determined that his threat of invasion, formidable as it was, should not force upon us so close a concentration as to leave our widespread interests open to his attack. Neither can it be said that our first aim was to prevent his attempting to concentrate. Every one of his naval ports was watched by a squadron, but it was recognised that this would not prevent concentration. The escape of one division might well break the chain. But that consideration made no difference. The distribution of our squadrons before his naval ports was essential for preventing sporadic action. Their distribution was dictated sufficiently by the defence of commerce and of colonial and allied territory, by our need, that is, to exercise a general command even if we could not destroy the enemy's force. The whole of Nelson's correspondence for this period shows that his main object was the protection of our Mediterranean trade and of Neapolitan and Turkish territory. When Villeneuve escaped him, his irritation was caused not by the prospect of a French concentration, which had no anxieties for him, for he knew counter- concentrations were provided for. It was caused rather by his having lost the opportunity which the attempt to concentrate had placed within his reach. He followed Villeneuve to the West Indies, not to prevent concentration, but, firstly, to protect the local trade and Jamaica, and secondly, in hope of another chance of dealing the blow he had missed. Lord Barham took precisely the same view. When on news of Villeneuve's return from the West Indies he moved out the three divisions of the Western Squadron, that is, the Ushant concentration, to meet him, he expressly stated, not that his object was to prevent concentration, but that it was to deter the French from attempting sporadic action. "The interception of the fleet in question," he wrote, "on its return to Europe would be a greater object than any I know. It would damp all future expeditions, and would show to Europe that it might be [pg 140] [pg 141] [pg 142] advisable to relax in the blockading system occasionally for the express purpose of putting them in our hands at a convenient opportunity." Indeed we had no reason for preventing the enemy's concentration. It was our best chance of solving effectually the situation we have to confront. Our true policy was to secure permanent command by a great naval decision. So long as the enemy remained divided, no such decision could be expected. It was not, in fact, till he attempted his concentration, and its last stage had been reached, that the situation was in our hands. The intricate problem with which we had been struggling was simplified down to closing up our own concentration to the strategical centre off Ushant. But at the last stage the enemy could not face the formidable position we held. His concentration was stopped. Villeneuve fell back on Cadiz, and the problem began to assume for us something of its former intricacy. So long as we held the mass off Ushant which our great concentration had produced, we were safe from invasion. But that was not enough. It left the seas open to sporadic action from Spanish ports. There were convoys from the East and West Indies at hand, and there was our expedition in the Mediterranean in jeopardy, and another on the point of sailing from Cork. Neither Barham at the Admiralty nor Cornwallis in command off Ushant hesitated an hour. By a simultaneous induction they both decided the mass must be divided. The concentration must be opened out again, and it was done. Napoleon called the move an insigne betise, but it was the move that beat him, and must have beaten him, whatever the skill of his admirals, for the two squadrons never lost touch. He found himself caught in a situation from which there was nothing to hope. His fleet was neither concentrated for a decisive blow nor spread for sporadic action. He had merely simplified his enemy's problem. Our hold was surer than ever, and in a desperate attempt to extricate himself he was forced to expose his fleet to the final decision we required. The whole campaign serves well to show what was understood by concentration at the end of the great naval wars. To Lord Barham and the able admirals who interpreted his plans it meant the possibility of massing at the right time and place. It meant, in close analogy to strategic deployment on land, the disposal of squadrons about a strategical centre from which fleets could condense for massed action in any required direction, and upon which they could fall back when unduly pressed. In this case the ultimate centre was the narrows of the Channel, where Napoleon's army lay ready to cross, but there was no massing there. So crude a distribution would have meant a purely defensive attitude. It would have meant waiting to be struck instead of seeking to strike, and such an attitude was arch-heresy to our old masters of war. So far we have only considered concentration as applied to wars in which we have a preponderance of naval force, but the principles are at least equally valid when a coalition places us in inferiority. The leading case is the home campaign of 1782. It was strictly on defensive lines. Our information was that France and Spain intended to end the war with a great combined effort against our West Indian islands, and particularly Jamaica. It was recognised that the way to meet the threat was to concentrate for offensive action in the Caribbean Sea everything that was not absolutely needed for home defence. Instead, therefore, of trying to be strong enough to attempt the offensive in both areas, it was decided to make sure of the area that was most critical. To do this the home fleet had to be reduced so low relatively to what the enemy had in European waters that offence was out of the question. While Rodney took the offensive area, Lord Howe was given the other. His task was to prevent the coalition obtaining such a command of home waters as would place our trade and coasts at their mercy, and it was not likely to prove a light one. We knew that the enemy's plan was to combine their attack on the West Indies with an attempt to control the North Sea, and possibly the Straits of Dover, with a Dutch squadron of twelve to fifteen of the line, while a combined Franco-Spanish fleet of at least forty sail would occupy the mouth of the Channel. It was also possible that these two forces would endeavour to form a junction. In any case the object of the joint operations would be to paralyse our trade and annoy our coasts, and thereby force us to neglect the West Indian area and the two Spanish objectives, Minorca and Gibraltar. All told we had only about thirty of the line on the home station, and though a large proportion of these were three-deckers, a good many could not be ready for sea till the summer. Inferior as was the available force, there was no thought of a purely passive defence. It would not meet the case. Something must be done to interfere with the offensive operations of the allies in the West Indies and against Gibraltar, or they would attain the object of their home campaign. It was resolved to effect this by minor counterstrokes on their line of communications to the utmost limit of our defensive reach. It would mean a considerable stretch of our concentration, but we were determined to do what we could to prevent reinforcements from reaching the West Indies from Brest, to intercept French trade as occasion offered, and, finally, at almost any risk to relieve Gibraltar. In these conditions the defensive concentration was based on a central mass or reserve at Spithead, a squadron in the Downs to watch the Texel for the safety of the North Sea trade, and another to the westward to watch Brest [pg 143] [pg 144] [pg 145] [pg 146] and interrupt its transatlantic communications. Kempenfelt in command of the latter squadron had just shown what could be done by his great exploit of capturing Guichen's convoy of military and naval stores for the West Indies. Early in the spring he was relieved by Barrington, who sailed on April 5th to resume the Ushant position. His instructions were not to fight a superior enemy unless in favourable circumstances, but to retire on Spithead. He was away three weeks, and returned with a French East India convoy with troops and stores, and two of the ships of-the-line which formed its escort. Up to this time there had been no immediate sign of the great movement from the south. The Franco-Spanish fleet which had assembled at Cadiz was occupied ineffectually in trying to stop small reliefs reaching Gibraltar and in covering their own homeward-bound trade. The Dutch, however, were becoming active, and the season was approaching for our Baltic trade to come home. Ross in the North Sea had but four of the line to watch the Texel, and was in no position to deal with the danger. Accordingly early in May the weight of the home concentration was thrown into the North Sea. On the 10th Howe sailed with Barrington and the bulk of the fleet to join Ross in the Downs, while Kempenfelt again took the Ushant position. Only about half the Brest Squadron had gone down to join the Spaniards at Cadiz, and he was told his first duty was to intercept the rest if it put to sea, but, as in Barrington's instructions, if he met a superior squadron he was to retire up Channel under the English coast and join hands with Howe. In spite of the fact that influenza was now raging in the fleet, he succeeded in holding the French inactive. Howe with the same difficulty to face was equally successful. The Dutch had put to sea, but returned immediately they knew of his movement, and cruising off the Texel, he held them there, and kept complete command of the North Sea till our Baltic trade was safe home. By the end of May it was done, and as our intelligence indicated that the great movement from Cadiz was at last about to begin, Howe, to whom a certain discretion had been left, decided it was time to shift the weight to his other wing and close on Kempenfelt. The Government, however, seemed to think that he ought to be able to use his position for offensive operations against Dutch trade, but in the admiral's opinion this was to lose hold of the design and sacrifice cohesion too much to reach. He informed them that he had not deemed it advisable to make detachments from his squadron against the trade, "not knowing how suddenly there might be a call, for the greater part of it at least, to the westward." In accordance, therefore, with his general instructions he left with Ross a strong squadron of nine of the line, sufficient to hold in check, and even "to take and destroy," the comparatively weak ships of the Dutch, and with the rest returned to the westward.13 His intention was to proceed with all possible expedition to join Kempenfelt on the coast of France, but this, owing to the ravages of the influenza, he was unable to do. Kempenfelt was forced to come in, and on June 5th the junction was made at Spithead. For three weeks, so severe was the epidemic, they could not move. Then came news that the Cadiz fleet under Langara had sailed the day Howe had reached Spithead, and he resolved to make a dash with every ship fit to put to sea to cut it off from Brest. He was too late. Before he could get into position the junction between Langara and the Brest squadron was made, and in their full force the allies had occupied the mouth of the Channel. With the addition of the Brest ships the combined fleet numbered forty of the line, while all Howe could muster was twenty-two, but amongst them were seven three-deckers and three eighties, and he would soon be reinforced. Three of Ross's smallest ships were recalled, and five others were nearly ready, but for these Howe could not wait. The homeward-bound Jamaica convoy was at hand, and at all hazards it must be saved. What was to be done? So soon as he sighted the enemy he realised that a successful action was out of the question. Early in the morning of July 12th, "being fifteen leagues S.S.E. from Scilly," Langara with thirty-six of the line was seen to the westward. "As soon," wrote Howe, "as their force had been ascertained, I thought proper to avoid coming to battle with them as then circumstanced, and therefore steered to the north to pass between Scilly and the Land's End. My purpose therein was to get to the westward of the enemy, both for protecting the Jamaica convoy and to gain the advantage of situation for bringing them to action which the difference in our numbers renders desirable." By a most brilliant effort of seamanship the dangerous movement was effected safely that night, and it proved an entire success. Till Howe was met with and defeated, the allies would not venture into the Channel, and his unprecedented feat had effectually thrown them off. Assuming apparently that he must have passed round their rear to seaward, they sought him to the southward, and there for a month beat up and down in ineffective search. Meanwhile Howe, sending his cruisers ahead to the convoy's rendezvous off the south-west coast of Iceland, had taken his whole fleet about two hundred miles west of the Skelligs to meet it. Northerly winds prevented his reaching the right latitude in time, but it mattered little. The convoy passed in between him and the south of Ireland, and as the enemy had taken a cast down to Ushant, it was able to enter the Channel in safety without sighting an enemy's sail. Ignorant of what had happened, Howe cruised for a week practising the ships "in connected movements so particularly necessary on the present occasion." Then with his fleet in fine condition to [pg 147] [pg 148] [pg 149] [pg 150] carry out preventive tactics in accordance with Kempenfelt's well-known exposition,14 he returned to seek the enemy to the eastward, in order to try to draw them from their station at Scilly and open the Channel. On his way he learnt the convoy had passed in, and with this anxiety off his mind he bore up for the Lizard, where his reinforcements were awaiting him. There he found the Channel was free. From lack of supplies the enemy had been forced to retire to port, and he returned to Spithead to make preparations for the relief of Gibraltar. While this work was going on, the North Sea squadron was again strengthened that it might resume the blockade of the Texel and cover the arrival of the autumn convoys from the Baltic. It was done with complete success. Not a single ship fell into the enemy's hands, and the campaign, and indeed the war, ended by Howe taking the mass of his force down to Gibraltar and performing his remarkable feat of relieving it in the face of the Spanish squadron. For the power and reach of a well-designed concentration there can be no finer example. If, now, we seek from the above and similar examples for principles to serve as a guide between concentration and division we shall find, firstly, this one. The degree of division we shall require is in proportion to the number of naval ports from which the enemy can act against our maritime interests and to the extent of coastline along which they are spread. It is a principle which springs from the soul of our old tradition that we must always seek, not merely to prevent the enemy striking at our heart, but also to strike him the moment he attempts to do anything. We must make of his every attempt an opportunity for a counterstroke. The distribution this aim entailed varied greatly with different enemies. In our wars with France, and particularly when Spain and Holland were in alliance with her, the number of the ports to be dealt with was very considerable and their distribution very wide. In our wars with the Dutch alone, on the other hand, the number and distribution were comparatively small, and in this case our concentration was always close. This measure of distribution, however, will never stand alone. Concentration will not depend solely upon the number and position of the enemy's naval ports. It will be modified by the extent to which the lines of operation starting from those ports traverse our own home waters. The reason is plain. Whatever the enemy opposed to us, and whatever the nature of the war, we must always keep a fleet at home. In any circumstances it is essential for the defence of our home trade terminals, and it is essential as a central reserve from which divisions can be thrown off to reinforce distant terminals and to seize opportunities for counterstrokes. It is "the mainspring," as Lord Barham put it, "from which all offensive operations must proceed." This squadron, then, being permanent and fixed as the foundation of our whole system, it is clear that if, as in the case of the French wars, the enemy's lines of operation do not traverse our home waters, close concentration upon it will not serve our turn. If, on the other hand, as in the case of the Dutch wars, the lines do traverse home waters, a home concentration is all that is required. Our division will then be measured by the amount of our surplus strength, and by the extent to which we feel able to detach squadrons for offensive action against the enemy's distant maritime interests without prejudicing our hold on the home terminals of his lines of operation and our power of striking directly he moves. These remarks apply, of course, to the main fleet operations. If such an enemy has distant colonial bases from which he can annoy our trade, minor concentrations must naturally be arranged in those areas. Next we have to note that where the enemy's squadrons are widely distributed in numerous bases, we cannot always simplify the problem by leaving some of them open so as to entice him to concentrate and reduce the number of ports to be watched. For if we do this, we leave the unwatched squadrons free for sporadic action. Unless we are sure he intends to concentrate with a view to a decisive action, our only means of simplifying the situation is to watch every port closely enough to interfere effectually with sporadic action. Then, sporadic action being denied him, the enemy must either do nothing or concentrate. The next principle is flexibility. Concentration should be so arranged that any two parts may freely cohere, and that all parts may quickly condense into a mass at any point in the area of concentration. The object of holding back from forming the mass is to deny the enemy knowledge of our actual distribution or its intention at any given moment, and at the same time to ensure that it will be adjusted to meet any dangerous movement that is open to him. Further than this our aim should be not merely to prevent any part being overpowered by a superior force, but to regard every detached squadron as a trap to lure the enemy to destruction. The ideal concentration, in short, is an appearance of weakness that covers a reality of strength. PART THREE [pg 151] [pg 152] [pg 153] CONDUCT OF NAVAL WAR CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTORY I. INHERENT DIFFERENCES IN THE CONDITIONS OF WAR ON LAND AND ON SEA Before attempting to apply the foregoing general principles in a definite manner to the conduct of naval war, it is necessary to clear the ground of certain obstacles to right judgment. The gradual elucidation of the theory of war, it must be remembered, has been almost entirely the work of soldiers, but so admirable is the work they have done, and so philosophical the method they have adopted, that a very natural tendency has arisen to assume that their broad-based conclusions are of universal application. That the leading lines which they have charted are in a certain sense those which must govern all strategy no one will deny. They are the real pioneers, and their methods must be in the main our methods, but what we have to remember is that the country we have to travel is radically different from that in which they acquired their skill. A moment's consideration will reveal how far-reaching the differences are. Let us ask ourselves what are the main ideas around which all the military lore turns. It may be taken broadly that the general principles are three in number. Firstly, there is the idea of concentration of force, that is, the idea of overthrowing the enemy's main strength by bringing to bear upon it the utmost accumulation of weight and energy within your means; secondly, there is the idea that strategy is mainly a question of definite lines of communication; and thirdly, there is the idea of concentration of effort, which means keeping a single eye on the force you wish to overthrow without regard to ulterior objects. Now if we examine the conditions which give these principles so firm a footing on land, we shall find that in all three cases they differ at sea, and differ materially. Take the first, which, in spite of all the deductions we have to make from it in the case of limited wars, is the dominating one. The pithy maxim which expresses its essence is that our primary objective is the enemy's main force. In current naval literature the maxim is applied to the sea in some such form as this: "The primary object of our battle-fleet is to seek out and destroy that of the enemy." On the surface nothing could look sounder, but what are the conditions which underlie the one and the other? The practical value of the military maxim is based upon the fact that in land warfare it is always theoretically possible to strike at your enemy's army, that is, if you have the strength and spirit to overcome the obstacles and face the risks. But at sea this is not so. In naval warfare we have a far-reaching fact which is entirely unknown on land. It is simply this—that it is possible for your enemy to remove his fleet from the board altogether. He may withdraw it into a defended port, where it is absolutely out of your reach without the assistance of an army. No amount of naval force, and no amount of offensive spirit, can avail you. The result is that in naval warfare an embarrassing dilemma tends to assert itself. If you are in a superiority that justifies a vigorous offensive and prompts you to seek out your enemy with a view to a decision, the chances are you will find him in a position where you cannot touch him. Your offence is arrested, and you find yourself in what, at least theoretically, is the weakest general position known to war. This was one of our earliest discoveries in strategy. It followed indeed immediately and inevitably upon our discovery that the most drastic way of making war was to concentrate every effort on the enemy's armed forces. In dealing with the theory of war in general a caveat has already been entered against the too common assumption that this method was an invention of Napoleon's or Frederick's, or that it was a foreign importation at all. In the view at least of our own military historians the idea was born in our Civil Wars with Cromwell and the New Model Army. It was the conspicuous feature that distinguished our Civil War from all previous wars of modern times. So astonishing was its success—as foreign observers remarked—that it was naturally applied by our [pg 155] [pg 156] [pg 157] soldier-admirals at sea so soon as war broke out with the Dutch. Whatever may be the claims of the Cromwellian soldiers to have invented for land warfare what is regarded abroad as the chief characteristic of the Napoleonic method, it is beyond doubt that they deserve the credit of it at sea. All three Dutch wars had a commercial object, and yet after the first campaign the general idea never was to make the enemy's commerce a primary objective. That place was occupied throughout by their battle-fleets, and under Monk and Rupert at least those objectives were pursued with a singleness of purpose and a persistent vehemence that was entirely Napoleonic. But in the later stages of the struggle, when we began to gain a preponderance, it was found that the method ceased to work. The attempt to seek the enemy with a view to a decisive action was again and again frustrated by his retiring to his own coasts, where either we could not reach him or his facilities for retreat made a decisive result impossible. He assumed, in fact, a defensive attitude with which we were powerless to deal, and in the true spirit of defence he sprang out from time to time to deal us a counterstroke as he saw his opportunity. It was soon perceived that the only way of dealing with this attitude was to adopt some means of forcing the enemy to sea and compelling him to expose himself to the decision we sought. The most cogent means at hand was to threaten his commerce. Instead, therefore, of attempting to seek out his fleet directly, our own would sit upon the fairway of his homeward-bound trade, either on the Dogger Bank or elsewhere, thereby setting up a situation which it was hoped would cost him either his trade or his battle-fleet, or possibly both. Thus in spite of the fact that with our increasing preponderance our preoccupation with the idea of battle decision had become stronger than ever, we found ourselves forced to fall back upon subsidiary operations of an ulterior strategical character. It is a curious paradox, but it is one that seems inherent in the special feature of naval war, which permits the armed force to be removed from the board altogether. The second distinguishing characteristic of naval warfare which relates to the communication idea is not so well marked, but it is scarcely less important. It will be recalled that this characteristic is concerned with lines of communication in so far as they tend to determine lines of operation. It is a simple question of roads and obstacles. In land warfare we can determine with some precision the limits and direction of our enemy's possible movements. We know that they must be determined mainly by roads and obstacles. But afloat neither roads nor obstacles exist. There is nothing of the kind on the face of the sea to assist us in locating him and determining his movements. True it is that in sailing days his movements were to some extent limited by prevailing winds and by the elimination of impossible courses, but with steam even these determinants have gone, and there is practically nothing to limit the freedom of his movement except the exigencies of fuel. Consequently in seeking to strike our enemy the liability to miss him is much greater at sea than on land, and the chances of being eluded by the enemy whom we are seeking to bring to battle become so serious a check upon our offensive action as to compel us to handle the maxim of "Seeking out the enemy's fleet" with caution. The difficulty obtruded itself from the moment the idea was born. It may be traced back—so far at least as modern warfare is concerned—to Sir Francis Drake's famous appreciation in the year of the Armada. This memorable despatch was written when an acute difference of opinion had arisen as to whether it were better to hold our fleet back in home waters or to send it forward to the coast of Spain. The enemy's objective was very uncertain. We could not tell whether the blow was to fall in the Channel or Ireland or Scotland, and the situation was complicated by a Spanish army of invasion ready to cross from the Flemish coast, and the possibility of combined action by the Guises from France. Drake was for solving the problem by taking station off the Armada's port of departure, and fully aware of the risk such a move entailed, he fortified his purely strategical reasons with moral considerations of the highest moment. But the Government was unconvinced, not as is usually assumed out of sheer pusillanimity and lack of strategical insight, but because the chances of Drake's missing contact were too great if the Armada should sail before our own fleet could get into position. Our third elementary principle is the idea of concentration of effort, and the third characteristic of naval warfare which clashes with it is that over and above the duty of winning battles, fleets are charged with the duty of protecting commerce. In land warfare, at least since laying waste an undefended part of your enemy's country ceased to be a recognised strategical operation, there is no corresponding deflection of purely military operations. It is idle for purists to tell us that the deflection of commerce protection should not be permitted to turn us from our main purpose. We have to do with the hard facts of war, and experience tells us that for economic reasons alone, apart from the pressure of public opinion, no one has ever found it possible to ignore the deflection entirely. So vital indeed is financial vigour in war, that more often than not the maintenance of the flow of trade has been felt as a paramount consideration. Even in the best days of our Dutch wars, when the whole plan was based on ignoring the enemy's commerce as an objective, we found ourselves at times forced to protect our own trade with seriously disturbing results. Nor is it more profitable to declare that the only sound way to protect your commerce is to destroy the enemy's fleet. As an enunciation of a principle it is a truism—no one would dispute it. As a canon of practical strategy, it is [pg 158] [pg 159] [pg 160] untrue; for here our first deflection again asserts itself. What are you to do if the enemy refuses to permit you to destroy his fleets? You cannot leave your trade exposed to squadronal or cruiser raids while you await your opportunity, and the more you concentrate your force and efforts to secure the desired decision, the more you will expose your trade to sporadic attack. The result is that you are not always free to adopt the plan which is best calculated to bring your enemy to a decision. You may find yourself compelled to occupy, not the best positions, but those which will give a fair chance of getting contact in favourable conditions, and at the same time afford reasonable cover for your trade. Hence the maxim that the enemy's coast should be our frontier. It is not a purely military maxim like that for seeking out the enemy's fleet, though the two are often used as though they were interchangeable. Our usual positions on the enemy's coast were dictated quite as much by the exigencies of commerce protection as by primary strategical reasons. To maintain a rigorous watch close off the enemy's ports was never the likeliest way to bring him to decisive action—we have Nelson's well-known declaration on the point—but it was the best way, and often the only way, to keep the sea clear for the passage of our own trade and for the operations of our cruisers against that of the enemy. For the present these all-important points need not be elaborated further. As we proceed to deal with the methods of naval warfare they will gather force and lucidity. Enough has been said to mark the shoals and warn us that, admirably constructed as is the craft which the military strategists have provided for our use, we must be careful with our navigation. But before proceeding further it is necessary to simplify what lies before us by endeavouring to group the complex variety of naval operations into manageable shape. II. TYPICAL FORMS OF NAVAL OPERATIONS In the conduct of naval war all operations will be found to relate to two broad classes of object. The one is to obtain or dispute the command of the sea, and the other to exercise such control of communications as we have, whether the complete command has been secured or not. It was on the logical and practical distinction between these two kinds of naval object, as we have seen, that the constitution of fleets was based in the fulness of the sailing period, when maritime wars were nearly incessant and were shaping the existing distribution of power in the world. During that period at any rate the dual conception lay at the root of naval methods and naval policy, and as it is also the logical outcome of the theory of war, we may safely take it as the basis of our analysis of the conduct of naval operations. Practically, of course, we can seldom assert categorically that any operation of war has but one clearly defined object. A battle-squadron whose primary function was to secure command was often so placed as to enable it to exercise control; and, vice versa, cruiser lines intended primarily to exercise control upon the trade routes were regarded as outposts of the battle-fleet to give it warning of the movements of hostile squadrons. Thus Cornwallis during his blockade of Brest had sometimes to loosen his hold in order to cover the arrival of convoys against raiding squadrons; and thus also when Nelson was asked by Lord Barham for his views on cruiser patrol lines, he expressed himself as follows: "Ships on this service would not only prevent the depredations of privateers, but be in the way to watch any squadron of the enemy should they pass on their track.... Therefore intelligence will be quickly conveyed, and the enemy never, I think, lost sight of."15 Instructions in this sense were issued by Lord Barham to the commodores concerned. In both cases, it will be seen, the two classes of operation overlapped. Still for purposes of analysis the distinction holds good, and is valuable for obtaining a clear view of the field. Take, first, the methods of securing command, by which we mean putting it out of the enemy's power to use effectually the common communications or materially to interfere with our use of them. We find the means employed were two: decision by battle, and blockade. Of the two, the first was the less frequently attainable, but it was the one the British service always preferred. It was only natural that it should be so, seeing that our normal position was one of preponderance over our enemy, and so long as the policy of preponderance is maintained, the chances are the preference will also be maintained. But further than this, the idea seems to be rooted in the oldest traditions of the Royal Navy. As we have seen, the conviction of the sea service that war is primarily a question of battles, and that battles once joined on anything like equal terms must be pressed to the last gasp, is one that has had nothing to learn from more recent continental discoveries. The Cromwellian admirals handed down to us the memory of battles lasting three, and even four, days. Their creed is enshrined in the robust article of war under which Byng and Calder were condemned; and in the apotheosis of Nelson the service has deified the battle idea. It is true there were periods when the idea seemed to have lost its colour, but nevertheless it is so firmly embedded in the British conception of naval warfare, that there would be nothing left to say but for the [pg 161] [pg 162] [pg 163] [pg 164] unavoidable modification with which we have to temper the doctrine of overthrow. "Use that means," said its best-known advocate, "when you can and when you must." Devoutly as we may hold the battle faith, it is not always possible or wise to act upon it. If we are strong, we press to the issue of battle when we can. If we are weak, we do not accept the issue unless we must. If circumstances are advantageous to us, we are not always able to effect a decision; and if they are disadvantageous, we are not always obliged to fight. Hence we find the apparently simple doctrine of the battle was almost always entangled in two of the most difficult problems that beset our old admirals. The most thorny questions they had to decide were these. In the normal case of strength, it was not how to defeat the enemy, but how to bring him to action; and in casual cases of temporary weakness, it was not how to sell your life dearly, but how to maintain the fleet actively on the defensive so as at once to deny the enemy the decision he sought and to prevent his attaining his ulterior object. From these considerations it follows that we are able to group all naval operations in some such way as this. Firstly, on the only assumption we can permit ourselves, namely, that we start with a preponderance of force or advantage, we adopt methods for securing command. These methods, again, fall under two heads. Firstly, there are operations for securing a decision by battle, under which head, as has been explained, we shall be chiefly concerned with methods of bringing an unwilling enemy to action, and with the value to that end of the maxim of "Seeking out the enemy's fleet." Secondly, there are the operations which become necessary when no decision is obtainable and our war plan demands the immediate control of communications. Under this head it will be convenient to treat all forms of blockade, whether military or commercial, although, as we shall see, certain forms of military, and even commercial, blockade are primarily concerned with forcing the enemy to a decision. Our second main group covers operations to which we have to resort when our relative strength is not adequate for either class of operations to secure command. In these conditions we have to content ourselves with endeavouring to hold the command in dispute; that is, we endeavour by active defensive operations to prevent the enemy either securing or exercising control for the objects he has in view. Such are the operations which are connoted by the true conception of "A fleet in being." Under this head also should fall those new forms of minor counter-attack which have entered the field of strategy since the introduction of the mobile torpedo and offensive mining. In the third main group we have to deal with the methods of exercising control of passage and communication. These operations vary in character according to the several purposes for which the control is desired, and they will be found to take one of three general forms. Firstly, the control of the lines of passage of an invading army; secondly, the control of trade routes and trade terminals for the attack and defence of commerce; and thirdly, the control of passage and communication for our own oversea expeditions, and the control of their objective area for the active support of their operations. For clearness we may summarise the whole in tabulated analysis, thus:— 1. Methods of securing command: (a) By obtaining a decision. (b) By blockade. 2. Methods of disputing command: (a) Principle of "the fleet in being." (b) Minor counter-attacks. 3. Methods of exercising command: (a) Defence against invasion. (b) Attack and defence of commerce. (c) Attack, defence, and support of military expeditions. CHAPTER TWO METHODS OF SECURING COMMAND I. ON OBTAINING A DECISION [pg 165] [pg 166] [pg 167] Whatever the nature of the war in which we are engaged, whether it be limited or unlimited, permanent and general command of the sea is the condition of ultimate success. The only way of securing such a command by naval means is to obtain a decision by battle against the enemy's fleet. Sooner or later it must be done, and the sooner the better. That was the old British creed. It is still our creed, and needs no labouring. No one will dispute it, no one will care even to discuss it, and we pass with confidence to the conclusion that the first business of our fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. No maxim can so well embody the British spirit of making war upon the sea, and nothing must be permitted to breathe on that spirit. To examine its claim to be the logical conclusion of our theory of war will even be held dangerous, yet nothing is so dangerous in the study of war as to permit maxims to become a substitute for judgment. Let us examine its credentials, and as a first step put it to the test of the two most modern instances. Both of them, it must be noted, were instances of Limited War, the most usual form of our own activities, and indeed the only one to which our war organisation, with its essential preponderance of the naval element, has ever been really adapted. The first instance is the Spanish-American War, and the second that between Russia and Japan. In the former case the Americans took up arms in order to liberate Cuba from Spanish domination—a strictly limited object. There is no evidence that the nature of the war was ever clearly formulated by either side, but in just conformity with the general political conditions the American war plan aimed at opening with a movement to secure the territorial object. At the earliest possible moment they intended to establish themselves in the west of Cuba in support of the Colonial insurgents. Everything depended on the initiative being seized with decision and rapidity. Its moral and physical importance justified the utmost risk, and such was the conformation of the sea which the American army had to pass, that a strictly defensive or covering attitude with their fleet could reduce the risk almost to security. Yet so unwisely dominated were the Americans by recently rediscovered maxims, that when on the eve of executing the vital movement they heard a Spanish squadron was crossing the Atlantic, their own covering force was diverted from its defensive position and sent away to "seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it." Puerto Rico was the most obvious point at which to seek it, and thither Admiral Sampson was permitted to go, regardless of the elementary truth that in such cases what is obvious to you is also usually obvious to your enemy. The result was that not only did the Americans fail to get contact, but they also uncovered their own army's line of passage and paralysed the initial movement. In the end it was only pure chance that permitted them to retrieve the mistake they had made. Had the Spanish squadron put into a Cuban port in railway communication with the main Royalist army, such as Cienfuegos or Havana, instead of hurrying into Santiago, the whole campaign must have been lost. "It appears now," wrote Admiral Mahan, in his Lessons of the War with Spain, "not only that the eastward voyage of our Havana division was unfortunate, but it should have been seen beforehand to be a mistake, because inconsistent with a well and generally accepted principle of war, the non-observance of which was not commanded by the conditions. The principle is that which condemns eccentric movements. By the disregard of rule in this case we uncovered both Havana and Cienfuegos, which it was our object to close to the enemy's division." Whether or not we regard Admiral Mahan's exposition of the error as penetrating to the real principle that was violated, the movement was in fact not only eccentric, but unnecessary. Had the Americans been content to keep their fleet concentrated in its true defensive position, not only would they have covered their army's line of passage and their blockade of the territorial objective, but they would have had a far better chance of bringing the Spaniards to action. The Spaniards were bound to come to them or remain outside the theatre of operations where they could in no way affect the issue of the war except adversely to themselves by sapping the spirit of their own Cuban garrison. It is a clear case of the letter killing the spirit, of an attractive maxim being permitted to shut the door upon judgment. Strategical offence in this case was not the best defence. "Seeking out the enemy's fleet" was almost bound to end in a blow in the air, which not only would fail to gain any offensive result, but would sacrifice the main defensive plank in the American war plan upon which their offensive relied for success. To stigmatise such a movement as merely eccentric is to pass very lenient censure. In the Russo-Japanese War we have a converse case, in which judgment kept the aphorism silent. It is true that during the earlier stage of the naval operations the Japanese did in a sense seek out the enemy's fleet, in so far as they advanced their base close to Port Arthur; but this was done, not with any fixed intention of destroying the Russian fleet—there was small hope of that at sea—but rather because by no other means could they cover the army's lines of passage, which it was the function of the fleet to secure, the true offensive operations being on land. Never except once, under express orders from Tokio, did either Admiral Togo or Admiral Kamimura press offensive movements in such a way as to jeopardise the preventive duty with which the war plan charged them. Still less in the later stage, when everything depended on the destruction of the Baltic fleet, did Admiral Togo [pg 168] [pg 169] [pg 170] "seek it out." He was content, as the Americans should have been content, to have set up such a situation that the enemy must come and break it down if they were to affect the issue of the war. So he waited on the defensive, assured his enemy must come to him, and thereby he rendered it, as certain as war can be, that when the moment for the tactical offensive came his blow should be sure and sudden, in overwhelming strength of concentration, and decisive beyond all precedent. Clearly, then, the maxim of "seeking out" for all its moral exhilaration, for all its value as an expression of high and sound naval spirit, must not be permitted to displace well-reasoned judgment. Trusty servant as it is, it will make a bad master, as the Americans found to their serious jeopardy. Yet we feel instinctively that it expresses, as no other aphorism does, the secret of British success at sea. We cannot do without it; we cannot do with it in its nakedness. Let us endeavour to clothe it with its real meaning, with the true principles that it connotes. Let us endeavour to determine the stuff that it is made of, and for this purpose there is no better way than to trace its gradual growth from the days when it was born of the crude and virile instinct of the earliest masters. The germ is to be found in the despatch already mentioned which Drake wrote from Plymouth at the end of March in 1588. His arguments were not purely naval, for it was a combined problem, a problem of defence against invasion, that had to be solved. What he wished to persuade the Government was, that the kernel of the situation was not so much Parma's army of invasion in Flanders, as the fleet that was preparing in Spain to clear its passage. The Government appeared to be acting on the opposite view. Howard with the bulk of the fleet was at the base in the Medway within supporting distance of the light squadron that was blockading the Flemish ports in concert with the Dutch. Drake himself with another light squadron had been sent to the westward with some indeterminate idea of his serving as an observation squadron, or being used in the mediaeval fashion for an eccentric counterstroke. Being invited to give his opinion on this disposition, he pronounced it vicious. In his eyes, what was demanded was an offensive movement against the enemy's main fleet. "If there may be such a stay or stop made," he urged, "by any means of this fleet in Spain, so that they may not come through the seas as conquerors, then shall the Prince of Parma have such a check thereby as were meet." What he had in his mind is clearly not so much a decision in the open as an interruption of the enemy's incomplete mobilisation, such as he had so brilliantly effected the previous year. For later on he says that "Next under God's mighty protection the advantage of time and place will be the only and chief means for our good, wherein I most humbly beseech your good lordships to persevere as you have begun, for with fifty sail of shipping we shall do more upon their own coast than a great many more will do here at home; and the sooner we are gone, the better we shall be able to impeach them." He does not say "destroy." "Impeach" meant "to prevent." Clearly, then, what he had in his mind was a repetition of the previous year's strategy, whereby he had been able to break up the Spanish mobilisation and "impeach" the Armada from sailing. He did not even ask for a concentration of the whole fleet for the purpose, but only that his own squadron should be reinforced as was thought convenient. The actual reasons he gave for his advice were purely moral—that is, he dwelt on the enheartening effect of striking the first blow, and attacking instead of waiting to be attacked. The nation, he urged, "will be persuaded that the Lord will put into Her Majesty and her people courage and boldness not to fear invasion, but to seek God's enemies and Her Majesty's where they may be found." Here is the germ of the maxim. The consequence of his despatch was a summons to attend the Council. The conference was followed, not by the half measure, which was all he had ventured to advise in his despatch, but by something that embodied a fuller expression of his general idea, and closely resembled what was to be consecrated as our regular disposition in such cases. The whole of the main fleet, except the squadron watching the Flemish coast, was massed to the westward to cover the blockade of Parma's transports, but the position assigned to it was inside the Channel instead of outside, which tactically was bad, for it was almost certain to give the Armada the weather gage. No movement to the coast of Spain was permitted—not necessarily, be it remembered, out of pusillanimity or failure to grasp Drake's idea, but for fear that, as in the recent American case, a forward movement was likely to result in a blow in the air, and to uncover the vital position without bringing the enemy to action. When, however, the sailing of the Armada was so long delayed Drake's importunity was renewed, with that of Howard and all his colleagues to back it. It brought eventually the desired permission. The fleet sailed for Coruña, where it was known the Armada, after an abortive start from Lisbon, had been driven by bad weather, and something like what the Government feared happened. Before it could reach its destination it met southerly gales, its offensive power was exhausted, and it had to return to Plymouth impotent for immediate action as the Armada finally sailed. When the Spaniards appeared it was still in port refitting and victualling. It was only by an unprecedented feat of seamanship that the situation was saved, and Howard was able to gain the orthodox position to seaward of his enemy. [pg 171] [pg 172] [pg 173] [pg 174] So far, then, the Government's cautious clinging to a general defensive attitude, instead of seeking out the enemy's fleet, was justified, but it must be remembered that Drake from the first had insisted it was a question of time as well as place. If he had been permitted to make the movement when he first proposed it, there is good reason to believe that the final stages of the Spanish mobilisation could not have been carried out that year; that is to say, the various divisions of the Armada could not have been assembled into a fleet. But information as to its condition was at the time very uncertain, and in view of the negotiations that were on foot, there were, moreover, high political reasons for our not taking too drastic an offensive if a reasonable alternative existed. The principles, then, which we distil from this, the original case of "seeking out," are, firstly, the moral value of seizing the initiative, and, secondly, the importance of striking before the enemy's mobilisation is complete. The idea of overthrow by a great fleet action is not present, unless we find it in a not clearly formulated idea of the Elizabethan admirals of striking a fleet when it is demoralised, as the Armada was by its first rebuff, or immediately on its leaving port before it had settled down. In our next naval struggle with the Dutch in the latter half of the seventeenth century the principle of overthrow, as we have seen, became fully developed. It was the keynote of the strategy which was evolved, and the conditions which forced it to recognition also emphasised the principles of seeking out and destroying. It was a case of a purely naval struggle, in which there were no military considerations to deflect naval strategy. It was, moreover, a question of narrow seas, and the risk of missing contact which had cramped the Elizabethans in their oceanic theatre was a negligible factor. Yet fresh objections to using the "seeking out" maxim as a strategical panacea soon declared themselves. The first war opened without any trace of the new principle. The first campaign was concerned in the old fashion entirely with the attack and defence of trade, and such indecisive actions as occurred were merely incidental to the process. No one appears to have realised the fallacy of such method except, perhaps, Tromp. The general instructions he received were that "the first and principal object was to do all possible harm to the English," and to that end "he was given a fleet in order to sail to the damage and offence of the English fleet, and also to give convoy to the west." Seeing at once the incompatibility of the two functions, he asked for more definite instructions. What, for instance, was he to do if he found a chance of blockading the main English fleet at its base? Was he to devote himself to the blockade and "leave the whole fleet of merchantmen to be a prey to a squadron of fast-sailing frigates," or was he to continue his escort duty? Full as he was of desire to deal with the enemy's main fleet, he was perplexed with the practical difficulty—too often forgotten—that the mere domination of the enemy's battle strength does not solve the problem of control of the sea. No fresh instructions were forthcoming to clear his perplexity, and he could only protest again. "I could wish," he wrote, "to be so fortunate as to have only one of these two duties—to seek out the enemy, or to give convoy, for to do both is attended with great difficulties." The indecisive campaign which naturally resulted from this lack of strategical grip and concentration of effort came to an end with Tromp's partial defeat of Blake off Dungeness on 30th November 1652. Though charged in spite of his protests with a vast convoy, the Dutch admiral had sent it back to Ostend when he found Blake was in the Downs, and then, free from all preoccupation, he had gone to seek out his enemy. It was the effect which this unexpected blow had upon the strong military insight of the Cromwellian Government that led to those famous reforms which made this winter so memorable a landmark in British naval history. Monk, the most finished professional soldier in the English service, and Deane, another general, were joined in the command with Blake, and with their coming was breathed into the sea service the high military spirit of the New Model Army. To that winter we owe not only the Articles of War, which made discipline possible, and the first attempt to formulate Fighting Instructions, in which a regular tactical system was conceived, but also two other conceptions that go to make up the modern idea of naval warfare. One was the conviction that war upon the sea meant operations against the enemy's armed fleets in order to destroy his power of naval resistance as distinguished from operations by way of reprisal against his trade; and the other, that such warfare required for its effective use a fleet of State-owned ships specialised for war, with as little assistance as possible from private-owned ships. It was not unnatural that all four ideas should have taken shape together, so closely are they related. The end connotes the means. Discipline, fleet tactics, and a navy of warships were indispensable for making war in the modern sense of the term. The results were seen in the three great actions of the following spring, the first under the three Generals, and the other two under Monk alone. In the last, he carried the new ideas so far as to forbid taking possession of disabled vessels, that nothing might check the work of destruction. All were to be sunk with as much tenderness for human life as destruction would permit. In like manner the second war was characterised by three great naval actions, one of which, after Monk had resumed command, lasted no less than four days. The new doctrine was indeed carried to exaggeration. So entirely was naval thought centred on the action of the battle-fleets, that no provision [pg 175] [pg 176] [pg 177] was made for an adequate exercise of control. In our own case at least, massing for offensive action was pressed so far that no thought was given to sustaining it by reliefs. Consequently our offensive power suffered periods of exhaustion when the fleet had to return to its base, and the Dutch were left sufficient freedom not only to secure their own trade, but to strike severely at ours. Their counterstrokes culminated in the famous attack upon Sheerness and Chatham. That such an opportunity was allowed them can be traced directly to an exaggeration of the new doctrine. In the belief of the British Government the "St. James's Fight"—the last of the three actions— had settled the question of command. Negotiations for peace were opened, and they were content to reap the fruit of the great battles in preying on Dutch trade. Having done its work, as was believed, the bulk of the battle-fleet for financial reasons was laid up, and the Dutch seized the opportunity to demonstrate the limitations of the abused doctrine. The lesson is one we have never forgotten, but its value is half lost if we attribute the disaster to lack of grasp of the battle-fleet doctrine rather than to an exaggeration of its possibilities. The truth is, that we had not obtained a victory sufficiently decisive to destroy the enemy's fleet. The most valuable lesson of the war was that such victories required working for, and particularly in cases where the belligerents face each other from either side of a narrow sea. In such conditions it was proved that owing to the facility of retreat and the restricted possibilities of pursuit a complete decision is not to be looked for without very special strategical preparation. The new doctrine in fact gave that new direction to strategy which has been already referred to. It was no longer a question of whether to make the enemy's trade or his fleet the primary objective, but of how to get contact with his fleet in such a way as to lead to decisive action. Merely to seek him out on his own coasts was to ensure that no decisive action would take place. Measures had to be taken to force him to sea away from his own bases. The favourite device was to substitute organised strategical operations against his trade in place of the old sporadic attacks; that is, the fleet took a position calculated to stop his trade altogether, not on his own coasts, but far to sea in the main fairway. The operations failed for lack of provision for enabling the fleet by systematic relief to retain its position, but nevertheless it was the germ of the system which afterwards, under riper organisation, was to prove so effective, and to produce such actions as the "Glorious First of June." In the third war, after this device had failed again and again, a new one was tried. It was Charles the Second's own conception. His idea was to use the threat of a military expedition. Some 15,000 men in transports were brought to Yarmouth in the hope that the Dutch would come out to bar their passage across the open North Sea, and would thus permit our fleet to cut in behind them. There was, however, no proper coordination of the two forces, and the project failed. This method of securing a decision was not lost sight of; Anson tried to use it in the Seven Years' War. For two years every attempt to seek out the enemy's fleet had led to nothing but the exhaustion of our own. But when Pitt began his raids on the French coast, Anson, who had little faith in their value for military purposes, thought he saw in them definite naval possibilities. Accordingly when, in 1758, he was placed in command of the Channel Fleet to cover the expedition against St. Malo, he raised the blockade of Brest, and took up a position near the Isle of Batz between the enemy's main fleet and the army's line of passage. The Brest fleet, however, was in no condition to move, and again there was no result. It was not till 1805 that there was any clear case of the device succeeding, and then it was not used deliberately. It was a joint Anglo-Russian expedition in the Mediterranean that forced from Napoleon his reckless order for Villeneuve to put to sea from Cadiz, and so solved the problem out of which Nelson had seen no issue. Lissa may be taken as an analogous case. But there the Italians, treating the territorial attack as a real attack instead of as a strategical device, suffered themselves to be surprised by the Austrian fleet and defeated. This instance serves well to introduce the important fact, that although our own military expeditions have seldom succeeded in leading to a naval decision, the converse was almost always true. The attempt of the enemy to use his army against our territory has been the most fertile source of our great naval victories. The knowledge that our enemy intends to invade these shores, or to make some serious expedition against our oversea dominions or interests, should always be welcomed. Unless History belie herself, we know that such attempts are the surest means of securing what we want. We have the memories of La Hogue, Quiberon, and the Nile to assure us that sooner or later they must lead to a naval decision, and the chance of a real decision is all we can ask of the Fortune of War. Enough has now been said to show that "seeking out the enemy's fleet" is not in itself sufficient to secure such a decision. What the maxim really means is that we should endeavour from the first to secure contact in the best position for bringing about a complete decision in our favour, and as soon as the other parts of our war plan, military or political, will permit. If the main offensive is military, as it was in the Japanese and American cases, then if possible the effort to secure such control must be subordinated to the movement of the army, otherwise we give the defensive precedence of the offensive. If, however, the military offensive cannot be ensured until the [pg 178] [pg 179] [pg 180] [pg 181] naval defensive is perfected, as will be the case if the enemy brings a fleet up to our army's line of passage, then our first move must be to secure naval contact. The vice of the opposite method of procedure is obvious. If we assume the maxim that the first duty of our fleet is to seek out the enemy wherever he may be, it means in its nakedness that we merely conform to the enemy's dispositions and movements. It is open to him to lead us wherever he likes. It was one of the fallacies that underlay all Napoleon's naval combinations, that he believed that our hard-bitten admirals would behave in this guileless manner. But nothing was further from their cunning. There is a typical order of Cornwallis's which serves well to mark their attitude. It was one he gave to Admiral Cotton, his second in command, in July 1804 on handing over to his charge the Western Squadron off Ushant: "If the French put to sea," he says, "without any of your vessels seeing them, do not follow them, unless you are absolutely sure of the course they have taken. If you leave the entrance of the Channel without protection, the enemy might profit by it, and assist the invasion which threatens His Majesty's dominions, the protection of which is your principal object." It is indeed a common belief that Nelson never permitted himself but a single purpose, the pursuit of the enemy's fleet, and that, ignoring the caution which Cornwallis impressed upon Cotton, he fell into the simple trap. But it has to be noted that he never suffered himself to be led in pursuit of a fleet away from the position he had been charged to maintain, unless and until he had made that position secure behind him. His famous chase to the West Indies is the case which has led to most misconception on the point from an insufficient regard to the surrounding circumstances. Nelson did not pursue Villeneuve with the sole, or even the primary, object of bringing him to action. His dominant object was to save Jamaica from capture. If it had only been a question of getting contact, he would certainly have felt in a surer position by waiting for Villeneuve's return off St. Vincent or closing in to the strategical centre off Ushant. Further, it must be observed that Nelson by his pursuit did not uncover what it was his duty to defend. The Mediterranean position was rendered quite secure before he ventured on his eccentric movement. Finally, we have the important fact that though the moral effect of Nelson's implacable persistence and rapidity was of priceless value, it is impossible to show that as a mere strategical movement it had any influence on the course of the campaign. His appearance in the West Indies may have saved one or two small islands from ransom and a good deal of trade from capture. It may also have hastened Villeneuve's return by a few days, but that was not to our advantage. Had he returned even a week later there would have been no need to raise the Rochefort blockade. Barham would have had enough ships at his command to preserve the whole of his blockades, as he had intended to do till the Curieux's news of Villeneuve's precipitate return forced his hand before he was ready. If we desire a typical example of the way the old masters used the doctrine of seeking out, it is to be found, not in Nelson's magnificent chase, but in the restrained boldness of Barham's orders to Cornwallis and Calder. Their instructions for seeking out Villeneuve were to move out on his two possible lines of approach for such a time and such a distance as would make decisive action almost certain, and at the same time, if contact were missed, would ensure the preservation of the vital defensive positions. Barham was far too astute to play into Napoleon's hands, and by blindly following his enemy's lead to be jockeyed into sacrificing the position which his enemy wished to secure. If our maxim be suffered to usurp the place of instructed judgment, the almost inevitable result will be that it will lead us into just the kind of mistake which Barham avoided. II. BLOCKADE Under the term blockade we include operations which vary widely in character and in strategical intention. In the first place, blockade may be either naval or commercial. By naval blockade we seek either to prevent an enemy's armed force leaving port, or to make certain it shall be brought to action before it can carry out the ulterior purpose for which it puts to sea. That armed force may be purely naval, or it may consist wholly or in part of a military expedition. If it be purely naval, then our blockade is a method of securing command. If it be purely military, it is a method of exercising command, and as such will be dealt with when we come to consider defence against invasion. But in so far as military expeditions are normally accompanied by a naval escort, operations to prevent their sailing are not purely concerned with the exercise of command. Naval blockade, therefore, may be regarded for practical purposes as a method of securing command and as a function of battle-squadrons. Commercial blockade, on the other hand, is essentially a method of exercising command, and is mainly an affair of cruisers. Its immediate object is to stop the flow of the enemy's sea-borne trade, whether carried in his own or neutral bottoms, by denying him the use of trade communications. From the point of view of the conduct of war, therefore, we have two well-defined categories of blockade, naval and commercial. But our classification must go further; for naval blockade itself is equally varied in intention, and must be subdivided. Strictly speaking, the term implies a desire to close the blockaded port and to prevent the enemy putting to sea. But this was not always the intention. As often as not our wish was that he should put to sea [pg 182] [pg 183] [pg 184] that we might bring him to action, and in order to do this, before he could effect his purpose, we had to watch the port with a fleet more or less closely. For this operation there was no special name. Widely as it differed in object from the other, it was also usually called blockade, and Nelson's protest against the consequent confusion of thought is well known. "It is not my intention," he said, "to close-watch Toulon"; and again, "My system is the very contrary of blockading. Every opportunity has been offered the enemy to put to sea." It is desirable, therefore, to adopt terms to distinguish the two forms. "Close" and "open" express the antithesis suggested by Nelson's letter, and the two terms serve well enough to mark the characteristic feature of each operation. Close blockade, it is true, as formerly conceived, is generally regarded as no longer practicable; but the antithetical ideas, which the two forms of blockade connote, can never be eliminated from strategical consideration. It must always be with the relations of these two forms, whatever shape they may take in future, that the strategy of naval blockade is chiefly concerned. With regard to commercial blockade, in strict analysis it should be eliminated from an inquiry that concerns methods of securing command and postponed to that section of exercising command which deals with the attack and defence of trade. It is, however, necessary to treat certain of its aspects in conjunction with naval blockade for two reasons: one, that as a rule naval blockade is indissolubly united to a subordinate commercial blockade; and the other, that the commercial form, though its immediate object is the exercise of control, has almost invariably an ulterior object which is concerned with securing control; that is to say, while its immediate object was to keep the enemy's commercial ports closed, its ulterior object was to force his fleet to sea. Commercial blockade, therefore, has an intimate relation with naval blockade in its open form. We adopt that form when we wish his fleet to put to sea, and commercial blockade is usually the most effective means we have of forcing upon him the movement we leave him free to attempt. By closing his commercial ports we exercise the highest power of injuring him which the command of the sea can give us. We choke the flow of his national activity afloat in the same way that military occupation of his territory chokes it ashore. He must, therefore, either tamely submit to the worst which a naval defeat can inflict upon him, or he must fight to release himself. He may see fit to choose the one course or the other, but in any case we can do no more by naval means alone to force our will upon him. In the long run a rigorous and uninterrupted blockade is almost sure to exhaust him before it exhausts us, but the end will be far and costly. As a rule, therefore, we have found that where we had a substantial predominance our enemy preferred to submit to commercial blockade in hope that by the chances of war or the development of fresh force he might later on be in a better position to come out into the open. That he should come out and stake the issue in battle was nearly always our wish, and it was obvious that too rigorous a naval blockade was not the way to achieve the desired end, or to reap the strategical result which we might expect from paralysing his commerce. Consequently where the desire for a decision at sea was not crossed by higher military considerations, as in the case of imminent invasion, or where we ourselves had an important expedition in hand, it was to our interest to incline the enemy's mind towards the bolder choice. The means was to tempt him with a prospect of success, either by leading him to believe the blockading force was smaller than it was, or by removing it to such a distance as would induce him to attempt to evade it, or both. A leading case of such an open blockade was Nelson's disposition of his fleet off Cadiz when he was seeking to bring Villeneuve to action in 1805. But merely to leave a port open does not fulfil the idea of open blockade, and in this case to opportunity and temptation Nelson added the pressure of a commercial blockade of the adjacent ports in hope of starving Villeneuve into the necessity of taking to the sea. Finally, in a general comparison of the two forms, we have to observe that close blockade is characteristically a method of securing local and temporary command. Its dominating purpose will usually be to prevent the enemy's fleet acting in a certain area and for a certain purpose. Whereas open blockade, in that it aims at the destruction of an enemy's naval force, is a definite step towards securing permanent command. Enough has now been said to show that the question of choice between close and open blockade is one of extreme complexity. Our naval literature, it is true, presents the old masters as divided into two schools on the subject, implying that one was in favour of the close form always, and the other of the open form. We are even led to believe that the choice depended on the military spirit of the officer concerned. If his military spirit was high, he chose the close and more exacting form; if it were low, he was content with the open and less exacting form. True, we are told that men of the latter school based their objections to close blockade on the excessive wear and tear of a fleet that it involved, but it is too often suggested that this attitude was no more than a mask for a defective spirit. Seldom if ever are we invited to compare their decisions with the attendant strategical intention, with the risks which the conditions justified, or with the expenditure of energy which the desired result could legitimately demand. Yet all these considerations must enter into the choice, and on closer examination of the [pg 185] [pg 186] [pg 187] leading cases it will be found that they bear a striking and almost constant relation to the nature of the blockade employed. In considering open blockade, three postulates must be kept in mind. Firstly, since our object is to get the enemy to sea, our position must be such as will give him an opportunity of doing so. Secondly, since we desire contact for a decisive battle, that position must be no further away from his port than is compatible with bringing him to action before he can effect his purpose. Thirdly, there is the idea of economy—that is, the idea of adopting the method which is least exhausting to our fleet, and which will best preserve its battle fitness. It is on the last point that the greatest difference of opinion has existed. A close blockade always tended to exhaust a fleet, and always must do so. But, on the other hand, it was contended that the exhaustion is compensated by the high temper and moral domination which the maintenance of a close blockade produces in a good fleet, whereas the comparative ease of distant and secure watch tended to deterioration. Before considering these opposed views, one warning is necessary. It is usually assumed that the alternative to close blockade is watching the enemy from one of our own ports, but this is not essential. What is required is an interior and, if possible, a secret position which will render contact certain; and with modern developments in the means of distant communication, such a position is usually better found at sea than in port. A watching position can in fact be obtained free from the strain of dangerous navigation and incessant liability to attack without sacrifice of sea training. With this very practical point in mind, we may proceed to test the merits of the two forms on abstract principles. It was always obvious that a close naval blockade was one of the weakest and least desirable forms of war. Here again when we say "weakest" we do not mean "least effective," but that it was exhausting, and that it tended to occupy a force greater than that against which it was acting. This was not because a blockading fleet, tempered and toughened by its watch, and with great advantage of tactical position, could not be counted on to engage successfully a raw fleet of equal force issuing from port, but because in order to maintain its active efficiency it required large reserves for its relief. So severe was the wear and tear both to men and ships, that even the most strenuous exponents of the system considered that at least a fifth of the force should always be refitting, and in every case two admirals were employed to relieve one another. In 1794 one of the highest authorities in the service considered that to maintain an effective close blockade of Brest two complete sets of flag-officers were necessary, and that no less than one-fourth of the squadron should always be in port.16 Now these weaknesses, being inherent in close blockade, necessarily affected the appreciation of its value. The weight of the objection tended of course to decrease as seamanship, material, or organisation improved, but it was always a factor. It is true also that it seems to have had more weight with some men than with others, but it will appear equally true, if we endeavour to trace the movement of opinion on the subject, that it was far from being the sole determinant. It was in the Seven Years' War under Anson's administration that continuous and close blockade was first used systematically, but it was Hawke who originated it. In the first three campaigns the old system of watching Brest from a British western port had been in vogue, but it had twice failed to prevent a French concentration in the vital Canadian theatre. In the spring of 1759 Hawke was in command of the Channel Fleet with the usual instructions for watching, but being directed to stand over and look into Brest, he intimated his intention, unless he received orders to the contrary, to remain off the port instead of returning to Torbay. His reason was that he had found there a squadron which he believed was intended for the West Indies, and he considered it better to prevent its sailing than to let it put to sea and try to catch it. In other words, he argued that none of the usual western watching ports afforded a position interior to the usual French route from Brest to the West Indies. Since rumours of invasion were in the air, it was obviously the better course to deal with the enemy's squadrons in home waters and avoid dispersal of the fleet in seeking them out. In spite of extraordinarily bad weather, therefore, he was permitted to act as he advised. With Boscawen as relief, the new form of blockade was kept up thenceforward, and with entire success. But it must be noted that this success was rather due to the fact that the French made no further effort to cross the Atlantic, than to the fact that the blockade was maintained with sufficient strictness to prevent their doing so. In certain states of weather our fleet was forced to raise the blockade and run to Torbay or Plymouth. Such temporary reversions to the open form nearly always afforded an opportunity for the French to get away to the southward with two or three days' start. Against any attempt, however, to get to the east or the north in order to dispute command of the Channel or other home waters the system was thoroughly efficient, and was unaffected by the intervals of the open form. It may have been these considerations which in the War of American Independence induced so fine an officer as Howe to be strongly in favour of a reversion to the old system. The vital theatre was then again across the Atlantic, and there was no serious preparation for invasion. It should also be borne in mind in judging Howe against Hawke, that in the Seven Years' War we had such a preponderance at sea as permitted ample reserves to nourish a close blockade, whereas in the latter war we were numerically inferior to the hostile coalition. Since it [pg 188] [pg 189] [pg 190] was impossible to prevent the French reaching the West Indies and North America if they so determined, our policy was to follow them with equal fleets and reduce the home force as low as that policy demanded and as was consistent with a reasonable degree of safety. The force required might well be inferior to the enemy, since it was certain that all attempts upon the Channel would be made with an unwieldy and ill-knit force composed of Spanish and French units. In Howe's opinion this particular situation was not to be solved by attempting to close Brest, and nothing can be more misleading than to stretch such an opinion beyond the circumstances it was intended to meet. He did not consider it was in his power to close the port. The enemy, he held, could always be in readiness to escape after a gale of wind by which the blockading squadron would be drawn off or dispersed, the ships much damaged, and the enemy enheartened. "An enemy," he said, "is not to be restrained from putting to sea by a station taken off their port with a barely superior squadron." The experience of 1805 appears to contradict him. Then a barely superior squadron did succeed in preventing Ganteaume's exit, but though the squadron actually employed was barely superior, it had ample fleet reserves to sustain its numbers in efficiency. It was, moreover, only for a short time that it had to deal with any real effort to escape. After May 20th, Ganteaume was forbidden to put to sea. There were certainly several occasions during that famous blockade when he could have escaped to the southward had Napoleon wished it. This case, then, cannot be taken to condemn Howe's judgment. His special function in the war plan was, with a force reduced to defensive strength, to prevent the enemy obtaining command of our home waters. It was certainly not his duty to undertake operations to which his force was not equal. His first duty was to keep it in being for its paramount purpose. To this end he decided on open blockade based on a general reserve at Spithead or St. Helen's, where he could husband the ships and train his recruits, while at the same time he protected our trade and communications and harassed those of the enemy. Kempenfelt, than whom there was no warmer advocate of activity, entirely approved the policy at least for the winter months, and in his case no one will be found to suggest that the idea was prompted by lack of spirit or love of ease. So far as the summer was concerned there was really little difference of opinion as to whether the fleet should be kept at sea or not, for sea-training during summer more than compensated for the exhaustion of material likely to be caused by intermittent spells of bad weather. Even for the winter the two policies came to much the same thing. Thus in Hawke's blockade at the end of 1759, during the critical month from mid-October to mid-November, he was unable to keep his station for nearly half the time, and when he did get contact with Conflans it was from Torbay and not Ushant. Still it may be doubted if without the confidence bred of his stormy vigil the battle of Quiberon would have been fought as it was. With all this experience fresh in his mind Kempenfelt frankly advocated keeping the fleet in port for the winter. "Suppose," he wrote from Torbay in November 1779, "the enemy should put to sea with their fleet (that is, from Brest)—a thing much to be wished for by us—let us act wisely and keep ours in port. Leave them to the mercy of long nights and hard gales. They will do more in favour of you than your fleet can." Far better he thought to devote the winter to preparing the fleet for the next campaign so as to have "the advantage of being the first in the field." "Let us," he concluded, "keep a stout squadron to the westward ready to attend the motions of the enemy. I don't mean to keep them at sea, disabling themselves in buffeting the winds, but at Torbay ready to act as intelligence may suggest."17 It will be seen, therefore, that the conclusion that close blockade was always the best means of rendering the fleet most efficient for the function it had to perform must not be accepted too hastily. The reasons which induced Howe and Kempenfelt to prefer open blockade were mainly based on this very consideration. Having in mind the whole of the surrounding conditions, in their highly experienced opinion careful preparation in the winter and tactical evolutions in the summer were the surest road to battle fitness in the force available. On the other hand, we have the fact that during the War of American Independence the open system was not very successful. But before condemning it out of hand, it must be remembered that the causes of failure were not all inherent in the system. In the first place, the need of relieving Gibraltar from time to time prevented the Western Squadron devoting itself entirely to its watch. In the next place, owing to defective administration the winters were not devoted with sufficient energy to preparing the fleet to be first in the field in the spring. Finally, we have to recognise that the lack of success was due not so much to permitting the French to cross the Atlantic, as to the failure to deal faithfully with them when contact was obtained at their destination. Obviously there is nothing to be said for the policy of "seeking out" as against that of preventing exit unless you are determined when you find to destroy or to be destroyed. It was here that Rodney and his fellows were found wanting. The system failed from defective execution quite as much as from defective design. In the next war Howe was still in the ascendant and in command of the Channel fleet. He retained his system. Leaving Brest open he forced the French by operating against their trade to put to sea, and he was rewarded with [pg 191] [pg 192] [pg 193] [pg 194] the battle of the First of June. No attempt was made to maintain a close blockade during the following winter. The French were allowed to sail, and their disastrous cruise of January 1795 fully justified Kempenfelt's anticipations. So great was the damage done that they abandoned all idea of using their fleet as a whole. Howe's system was continued, but no longer with entirely successful results. In 1796 the French were able to make descents upon Ireland, and Howe in consequence has come in for the severest castigations. His method is contemptuously contrasted with that which St. Vincent adopted four years later, without any regard to the situation each admiral had to meet, and again on the assumption that the closing of Brest would have solved the one problem as well as it did the other. In 1796 we were not on the defensive as we were in 1800. The French fleet had been practically destroyed. No invasion threatened. With a view to forcing peace our policy was directed to offensive action against French trade and territory in order by general pressure to back our overtures for a settlement. The policy may have been mistaken, but that is not the question. The question is, whether or not the strategy fitted the policy. We were also, it must be remembered, at war with Holland and expecting war with Spain, an eventuality which forced us to keep an eye on the defence of Portugal. In these circumstances nothing was further from our desire than to keep what was left of the Brest fleet in port. Our hope was by our offensive action against French maritime interests to force it to expose itself for their defence. To devote the fleet to the closing of Brest was to cripple it for offensive action and to play the enemy's game. The actual disposition of the home fleet was designed so as to preserve its offensive activity, and at the same time to ensure superiority in any part of the home waters in which the enemy might attempt a counterstroke. It was distributed in three active squadrons, one in the North Sea, one before Brest, and one cruising to the westward, with a strong reserve at Portsmouth. It is the location of the reserve that has been most lightly ridiculed, on the hasty assumption that it was merely the reserve of the squadron before Brest; whereas in truth it was a general reserve designed to act in the North Sea or wherever else it might be needed. At the same time it served as a training and depot squadron for increasing our power at sea in view of the probable addition of the Spanish fleet to Napoleon's naval force. To have exhausted our fleet merely to prevent raids leaving Brest which might equally well leave the Texel or Dunkirk was just what the enemy would have desired. The disposition was in fact a good example of concentration—that is, disposal about a strategical centre to preserve flexibility for offence without risking defensive needs, and yet it is by the most ardent advocates of concentration and the offensive that Howe's dispositions at this time have been most roundly condemned. In the end the disposition did fail to prevent the landing of part of the force intended for Ireland, but it made the venture so difficult that it had to be deferred till mid-winter, and then the weather which rendered evasion possible broke up the expedition and denied it all chance of serious success. It was, in fact, another example of the working of Kempenfelt's rule concerning winter weather. So far as naval defence can go, the disposition was all that was required. The Irish expedition was seen leaving Brest by our inshore cruiser squadron. It was reported to Colpoys, who had the battle-squadron outside, and it was only a dense fog that enabled it to escape. It was, in fact, nothing more than the evasion of a small raiding force—an eventuality against which no naval defence can provide certain guarantee, especially in winter. It was under wholly different conditions that at the end of 1800 Hawke's system was revived. St. Vincent's succession to the control of the fleet coincided with Napoleon's definite assumption of the control of the destinies of France. Our great duel with him had begun. The measures he was taking made it obvious we were once more facing the old life and death struggle for naval supremacy; we were openly threatened with invasion, and we had a distinct preponderance at sea. In short, we have to recognize the fact that the methods of the Seven Years' War were revived when the problems and factors of that war were renewed. As those problems grew more intense, as they did after the Peace of Amiens, and the threat of invasion became really formidable, so did the rigour of the close blockade increase. Under Cornwallis and Gardner it was maintained in such a way as to deny, so far as human effort could go, all possibility of exit without fighting. In spite of the importance of dealing with the enemy's squadrons in detail no risks were taken to bring Ganteaume to decisive action. Our first necessity was absolute local command. The acuteness of the invasion crisis demanded that the Brest fleet should be kept in port, and every time Ganteaume showed a foot the British admiral flew at him and drove him back. Once only during the continuation of the crisis was the rigour of this attitude relaxed, and that was to deal with what for the moment was the higher object. It was to meet Villeneuve on his return from the West Indies, but even then so nicely was the relaxation calculated, that Ganteaume was given no time to take advantage of it. The analogy between the conditions of the blockade which St. Vincent inaugurated and those of the Seven Years' War becomes all the more significant when we note that while Cornwallis and Gardner in home waters were pressing close blockade to its utmost limit of rigour, Nelson in the Mediterranean was not using it at all. Yet with him also the chief concern was to prevent an invasion. His main function, as he and his Government saw it, was to prevent a descent from Southern France upon Neapolitan or Levantine territory. Why, then, did he not employ close blockade? It is usually assumed that it was because of his overpowering desire to bring the Toulon squadron [pg 195] [pg 196] [pg 197] [pg 198] to action. Occasional expressions in his letters give colour to such a view, but his dispositions show clearly that his desire to bring the fleet to action was kept in scientific subordination to the defensive duty with which he was charged. Close blockade was the most effectual means of securing this end, but in his case one of the conditions, which we have found always accompanying successful close blockade, was absent. He had no such preponderance of force as would enable him to nourish it up to the point of perfect continuity. In the circumstances the close form was too weak or exhausting for him to use with the force at his disposal. If this case be not considered conclusive as to Nelson's views, we have a perfectly clear endorsement from his pen in 1801. It is a particularly strong testimony, for he was at the time actually charged with defence against the invasion of England. With several cruiser squadrons he had to prevent the enemy's force issuing from a number of ports extending from Flushing to Dieppe, and he was directing the operations from the Downs. On the approach of winter he was impressed with the inexpediency of attempting to continue a close blockade, and wrote to the Admiralty as follows: "I am of opinion, and submit to their Lordships' better judgment, that care should be taken to keep our squadrons compact and in good order ... under Dungeness to be their principal station.... In fine weather our squadrons to go out and show themselves, but never to risk either being crippled or drawn into the North Sea; thus we shall always be sure of an effective force, ready to act as occasion calls for it."18 The case of course is not entirely in point, for it concerns the question of direct resistance to invasion and not to securing general command. Its value is that it gives Nelson's views on the broad question of balancing the risks— that is, the risk of relaxing close watch against the risk of destroying the efficiency of the ships by maintaining it too rigorously. With Nelson holding this view, it is not surprising to find that as late as 1804 naval opinion was not quite settled on the relative advantages of close and open blockade even in the case of threatened invasion. Just a year before Trafalgar was fought, Cornwallis pressed the Admiralty for more strength to enable him to keep his blockade efficient. Lord Melville, who at this time had Barham at his elbow, replied recommending the "policy of relaxing the strictness of blockade, formerly resorted to." He protested the means available were insufficient for "sustaining the necessary extent of naval force, if your ships are to be torn to pieces by an eternal conflict with the elements during the tempestuous months of winter."19 Melville was craving for a decisive action to end the insupportable strain. "Allow me to remind you," he added, "that the occasions when we have been able to bring our enemy to battle and our fleets to victory have generally been when we were at a distance from the blockading station." In the end, as we know, Cornwallis had his way, and the verdict of history has been to approve the decision for its moral effect alone. Such conflicts must always arise. "War," as Wolfe said, "is an option of difficulties," and the choice must sway to the one side or the other as the circumstances tend to develop the respective advantages of each form. We can never say that close blockade is better than open, or the reverse. It must always be a matter of judgment. Are there, then, no principles which we can deduce from the old practice for the strengthening of judgment? Certain broad lines of guidance at least are to be traced. The main question will be, is it to our advantage, in regard to all the strategical conditions, to keep the enemy in and get him to sea for a decision? Presumably it will always be our policy to get a decision as soon as possible. Still that desire may be overridden by the necessity or special advantage of closely blockading one or more of his squadrons. This situation may arise in two ways. Firstly, it may be essential to provide for the local and temporary command of a certain theatre of operations, as when an invasion threatens in that area, or when we wish to pass a military expedition across it, or from special exigencies in regard to the attack or defence of commerce. Secondly, even where we are seeking a great decision, we may blockade one squadron closely in order to induce a decision at the point most advantageous to ourselves; that is to say, we may blockade one or more squadrons in order to induce the enemy to attempt with one or more other squadrons to break that blockade. In this way we may lead him either to expose himself to be struck in detail, or to concentrate where we desire his concentration. For any of these reasons we may decide that the best way of realising our object is to use close blockade, but the matter does not end there. We have still to consider whether close blockade is within the limit of the force we have available, and whether it is the best method of developing the fullest potentialities of that force. Close blockade being the more exhausting form will require the greater strength; we cannot blockade closely for any length of time without a force relatively superior; but if by open blockade of a squadron we permit it to put to sea with contact assured, we know that, even with a slightly inferior force, we can so deal with it as to prevent its getting local control sufficient to break down our mobile flotilla defence or to interfere seriously with our trade. Finally, there is the question of risk. In the old days, before free movement and wireless telegraphy, and before the flotilla had acquired battle power, there was always to be faced the risk of not getting contact in time to prevent mischief. This consideration was specially dominant where the enemy had a squadron within or near the [pg 199] [pg 200] [pg 201] critical theatre of operations. Therefore when the invasion threatened, our developed policy was to blockade Brest closely at almost any sacrifice. There was always a vague possibility that by evasion or chance of wind a squadron so close to the line of invasion might get sufficient temporary command in the vital area before it could be brought to action. It was a possibility that was never realised in the Narrow Seas, and since mobility of fleets and means of distant communication have so greatly increased in range and certainty, and since the power of resistance in the flotilla has become so high, the risk is probably much less than ever, and the field for open blockade is consequently less restricted. There is no need, however, to accept these principles as incontrovertible. Even if we take the great blockade of 1803-5, which has most firmly dominated thought on the subject ever since, it may be argued with some plausibility that the situation could have been solved more quickly and effectually by letting Ganteaume get out from Brest into the open, at least as far as Admiral Togo was forced to permit the Russians to emerge from Port Arthur, though his reasons for keeping them in were even stronger than ours in 1805. But in any case, the whole trend of the evidence will admit no doubt as to the inherent weakness of close blockade as a form of war. As under modern developments the possibilities of open blockade have increased, so the difficulties and dangers of close blockade have certainly not decreased. It is also probable that certain advantages which in the sailing era went far to compensate for its weakness have lost much of their force. A sailing fleet cooped up in port not only rapidly lost its spirit, but, being barred from sea-training, could not be kept in a condition of efficiency, whereas the blockading fleet was quickly raised to the highest temper by the stress of vigilance and danger that was its incessant portion. So long as the strain did not pass the limit of human endurance, it was all to the good. In the old days, with very moderate reliefs, the limit was never reached, and the sacrifices that were made to those exhausting vigils were rewarded twentyfold in exuberant confidence on the day of battle. Can we expect the same compensation now? Will the balance of strength and weakness remain as it used to be? In the face of the vast change of conditions and the thinness of experience, it is to general principles we must turn for the answer. What, in fact, is the inherent weakness of close blockade? Strategical theory will at once reply that it is an operation which involves "an arrest of the offensive," a situation which is usually taken to exhibit every kind of drawback. Close blockade is essentially an offensive operation, although its object is usually negative; that is, it is a forward movement to prevent the enemy carrying out some offensive operation either direct or by way of counterstroke. So far the common tendency to confuse "Seeking out the enemy's fleet" with "Making the enemy's coast your frontier" may be condoned. But the two operations are widely different in that they have different objectives. In "seeking out," our objective is the enemy's armed force. In "making the enemy's coast our frontier," the objective is inseparable from the ulterior object of the naval war. In this case the objective is the common communications. By establishing a blockade we operate offensively against those communications. We occupy them, and then we can do no more. Our offensive is arrested; we cannot carry it on to the destruction of the enemy's fleet. We have to wait in a defensive attitude, holding the communications we have seized, till he chooses to attack in order to break our hold; and during that period of arrest the advantage of surprise—the all- important advantage in war—passes by a well recognised rule to our enemy. We, in fact, are held upon the defensive, with none of the material advantages of the defensive. The moral advantage of having taken the initiative remains, but that is all. The advantage which we thus gain will of course have the same kind of depressing effect upon the blockaded fleet as it had of old, but scarcely in so high a degree. The degradation of a steam fleet in port can scarcely be so rapid or debilitating as it was when nine-tenths of seamanship lay in the smart handling of sails. For the blockading fleet it is also true that the effects of weather, which formerly were the main cause of wear and tear, can scarcely be so severe. But, on the other hand, the physical strain to officers and men, and the difficulty of supply, will be far greater, so long at least as coal is the chief fuel. The wind no longer sets a measure on the enemy's movements. Vigilance close and unremitting beyond all our predecessors knew is the portion of the blockaders to prevent surprise. Furthermore, in the old days surprise meant at worst the enemy's escape; now it may mean our own destruction by mine or torpedo. It is unnecessary to labour the point. It is too obvious that a close blockade of the old type exhibits under present conditions the defects of "arrested offence" in so high a degree as practically to prohibit its use. What, then, can be done? Must we rest content in all situations with Howe's system, which riper experience condemned for cases of extreme necessity? Cannot the old close blockade be given a modern form? Assuredly it can. In old days the shoreward limit of the blockading fleet was just beyond the range of the coast batteries, and this position it held continuously by means of an inshore squadron. In these days of mobile defence that limit is by analogy the night range of destroyers and the day range of submarines, that is, half the distance they can traverse between dark and dawn or dawn and dark respectively, unless within that limit a torpedo-proof base can be established. A blockade of this nature will correspond in principle to a close blockade of the old type; nor in practice, as was proved in the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur, will its incidents be materially different. The distance at which the battle-squadron must keep will seem at first sight to deny it certainty of immediate contact —the essence of close blockade. But in truth other new factors already noticed will reduce that distance [pg 202] [pg 203] [pg 204] [pg 205] relatively. Quicker and more certain means of communication between the admiral and his scouts, the absolute freedom of movement and the power of delaying the enemy's actual exit by mining, may go far to bring things back to their old relations. At Port Arthur they did so entirely. If then, as in that case, our paramount object is to keep the enemy in, there seems still no reason why we should not make our dispositions on the principle of close blockade. Distances will be greater, but that is all. Nor must it be forgotten that for a squadron to take station off a port in the old manner is not the only means of close blockade. It may still effect its purpose, at least temporarily, by supporting mining vessels or block ships —"sinkers," as they used to be called. The latter expedient, it is true, had little success in the latest experiments, but even in the Russo-Japanese War its possibilities were by no means exhausted. We have therefore to conclude that where the strategical conditions call obviously for close blockade, our plan of operations will be modified in that direction with the means still at our disposal. If, however, our object is not so sharply defined, if in spite of our desire to deny the enemy the sea we are ready to take risks in order to bring about a decision, the case is not so clear. It will be observed that the looseness which the new conditions force upon close blockade-increasing as they are in intensity year by year-must tend more and more to approximate it in practice to open blockade. The question will therefore present itself whether it would not be more in accordance with the fundamental elements of strength to adopt open blockade frankly for all purposes. We should thus substitute a true defensive disposition for an arrested offence, and, theoretically, that in itself is a great advantage. The practical benefits, whatever the correlative drawbacks, are equally clear, nor are they less great now than they appeared to Howe and Kempenfelt. We avoid exhaustion of machinery, coal, and men, and this, at least for the necessary flotilla screen, will be greater than anything that had to be faced in former days. We have at least the opportunity of occupying a position secure from surprise, and of keeping the fleet continually up to its highest striking energy. Finally, assuming the geographical conditions give reasonable promise of contact, a quick decision, which modern war demands with ever greater insistence, is more probable. In such a disposition of course contact can rarely be made certain. The enemy, whom the hypothesis of blockade assumes to be anxious to avoid action, will always have a chance of evasion, but this will always be so, even with the closest blockade now possible. We may even go further and claim for open blockade that in favourable conditions it may give the better chance of contact. For by adopting the principle of open blockade we shall have, in accordance with the theory of defence, the further advantages of being able the better to conceal our dispositions, and consequently to lay traps for our enemy, such as that which Nelson prepared for Villeneuve in the Gulf of Lyons in 1805. The objection to such a course which appears to have the most weight with current opinion is the moral one, which is inseparable from all deliberate choices of the defensive. If the watching fleet remains in a home fortified base, it may be assumed that the usual moral degradation will set in. But the method does not entail the inglorious security of such a base. A sound position may well be found at a spot such as Admiral Togo occupied while waiting for the Baltic fleet, and in that case there was no observable degradation of any kind. Nor is there much evidence that this objection weighed materially with the opponents of Howe's view. Their objection was of a purely physical kind. Open blockade left the enemy too much freedom to raid our trade routes. The watching system might be sufficient to keep an unwilling battle-fleet in port or to bring a more adventurous one to action, but it could not control raiding squadrons. This was certainly Barham's objection. "If," he wrote to Pitt in 1794, "the French should have any intention of sending their fleet to sea with this easterly wind, and Lord Howe continues at Torbay, our Mediterranean and Jamaica convoys are in a very critical situation. Both fleets must by this time be drawing near the Channel, and cannot enter it while the easterly wind holds." This danger must always be with us, especially in narrow waters such as the North Sea. In more open theatres the difficulty is not so obtrusive, for with sufficient sea room trade may take naturally or by direction a course which our watching dispositions will cover. Thus with Nelson in the case of Toulon, his normal positions on the Sardinian coast covered effectually the flow of our trade to the Levant and the Two Sicilies, which was all there was at the time. The truth is, that in endeavouring to decide between open and close blockade we find ourselves confronted with those special difficulties which so sharply distinguish naval warfare from warfare on land. We cannot choose on purely naval considerations. In naval warfare, however great may be our desire to concentrate our effort on the enemy's main forces, the ulterior object will always obtrude itself. We must from the first do our best to control sea communications, and since those communications are usually common, we cannot refrain from occupying those of the enemy without at the same time neglecting and exposing our own. Thus in the case of Brest a close blockade was always desirable, and especially at convoy seasons, because the great trade routes which passed within striking distance of the port were all common, whereas in the region of Toulon the main lines were not common except along the coasts of Africa and Southern Italy, and these Nelson's open blockade amply secured. The general conclusion, then, is that however high may be the purely naval and strategical reasons for adopting open blockade as the best means of securing a decision against the enemy's fleet, yet the inevitable intrusion of [pg 206] [pg 207] [pg 208] the ulterior object in the form of trade protection or the security of military expeditions will seldom leave us entirely free to use the open method. We must be prepared, in fact, to find ourselves at least at times faced with the necessity of using a form of blockade as nearly modelled on the old close blockade as changed conditions will permit. CHAPTER THREE METHODS OF DISPUTING COMMAND I. DEFENSIVE FLEET OPERATIONS—"A FLEET IN BEING" In dealing with the theory of sea command, attention was called to the error of assuming that if we are unable to win the command we therefore lose it. It was pointed out that this proposition, which is too often implied in strategical discussion, denies in effect that there can be such a thing as strategical defensive at sea, and ignores the fact that the normal condition in war is for the command to be in dispute. Theory and history are at one on the point. Together they affirm that a Power too weak to win command by offensive operations may yet succeed in holding the command in dispute by assuming a general defensive attitude. That such an attitude in itself cannot lead to any positive result at sea goes without saying, but nevertheless even over prolonged periods it can prevent an enemy securing positive results, and so give time for the other belligerent to dominate the situation by securing his ends ashore. It is seldom that we have been forced even for a time to adopt such an attitude, but our enemies have done so frequently to our serious annoyance and loss. In the Seven Years' War, for instance, the French by avoiding offensive operations likely to lead to a decision, and confining themselves to active defence, were able for five campaigns to prevent our reducing Canada, which was the object of the war. Had they staked the issue on a great fleet action in the first campaign, and had the result been against them, we could certainly have achieved our object in half the time. In the end, of course, they failed to prevent the conquest, but during all the time the catastrophe was postponed France had abundant opportunity of gaining offensively elsewhere territory which, as she at all events believed, would have compelled us to give up our conquest at the peace. Again, in our last great naval war Napoleon by avoiding general actions was able to keep the command in dispute till by alliances and otherwise he had gathered force which he deemed sufficient to warrant a return to the offensive. Eventually that force proved unequal to the task, yet when it failed and the command passed to his enemy, he had had time to consolidate his power so far that the loss of his fleet seemed scarcely to affect it, and for nine years more he was able to continue the struggle. Such examples—and there are many of them—serve to show how serious a matter is naval defence in the hands of a great military Power with other means of offence. They tell us how difficult it is to deal with, and how serious therefore for even the strongest naval Power is the need to give it careful study. And not for this reason only, but also because the strongest naval Power, if faced with a coalition, may find it impossible to exert a drastic offensive anywhere without temporarily reducing its force in certain areas to a point relatively so low as to permit of nothing higher than the defensive. The leading case of such a state of affairs, which we must further consider presently, was our own position in the War of American Independence, when, as we have seen, in order to secure an adequate concentration for offence in the West Indies we were forced to reduce our home fleet to defensive level. What, then, do we mean by naval defence? To arrive at a right answer we must first clear our mind of all confusing shadows cast by the accidents of land defence. Both on land and at sea defence means of course taking certain measures to defer a decision until military or political developments so far redress the balance of strength that we are able to pass to the offensive. In the operations of armies the most usual means employed are the holding of positions and forcing our superior enemy to exhaust his strength in attacking them. Consequently the idea of military defence is dominated by the conception of entrenched positions and fortresses. [pg 209] [pg 210] [pg 211] In naval warfare this is not so. At sea the main conception is avoiding decisive action by strategical or tactical activity, so as to keep our fleet in being till the situation develops in our favour. In the golden age of our navy the keynote of naval defence was mobility, not rest. The idea was to dispute the control by harassing operations, to exercise control at any place or at any moment as we saw a chance, and to prevent the enemy exercising control in spite of his superiority by continually occupying his attention. The idea of mere resistance was hardly present at all. Everything was counterattack, whether upon the enemy's force or his maritime communications. On land, of course, such methods of defence are also well known, but they belong much more to guerilla warfare than to regular operations. In regular warfare with standing armies, however brilliantly harassing operations and counter- attack are used, the fundamental conception is the defended or defensible position. Similarly at sea, although the essence of defence is mobility and an untiring aggressive spirit rather than rest and resistance, yet there also defended and defensible positions are not excluded. But they are only used in the last resort. A fleet may retire temporarily into waters difficult of access, where it can only be attacked at great risk, or into a fortified base, where it is practically removed from the board and cannot be attacked at all by a fleet alone. But the occasions on which such expedients can be used at sea are far rarer than on land. Indeed except for the most temporary purposes they can scarcely be regarded as admissible at sea, however great their value on land. The reason is simple. A fleet withdrawing to such a position leaves open to the enemy the ulterior object, which is the control of sea communications, whereas on land an army in a good position may even for a prolonged period cover the ulterior object, which is usually territory. An army in position, moreover, is always doing something to exhaust its opponent and redress the unfavourable balance, but a fleet in inactivity is too often permitting the enemy to carry on operations which tend to exhaust the resources of its own country. For a maritime Power, then, a naval defensive means nothing but keeping the fleet actively in being-not merely in existence, but in active and vigorous life. No phrase can better express the full significance of the idea than "A fleet in being," if it be rightly understood. Unfortunately it has come to be restricted, by a misunderstanding of the circumstances in which it was first invented, to one special class of defence. We speak of it as though it were essentially a method of defence against invasion, and so miss its fuller meaning. If, however, it be extended to express defence against any kind of maritime attack, whether against territory or sea communications, its broad truth will become apparent, and it will give us the true conception of the idea as held in the British service. The occasion on which it was first used was one that well exhibits the special possibilities of a naval defensive. It was in the year 1690, when, in alliance with the Dutch, we were at war with France, and though really superior, had been caught in a situation which placed us temporarily at a great disadvantage in home waters. The French by a surprising rapidity of mobilisation and concentration had stolen a march on us before either our mobilisation or our concentration was complete. King William, with the best of the army, was in Ireland dealing with a French invasion in support of James, and a squadron of seven sail under Sir Cloudesley Shovel had been detached into the Irish Sea to guard his communications. Another squadron, consisting of sixteen of the line, British and Dutch, had been sent to Gibraltar under Admiral Killigrew to take down the trade and to keep an eye on Chateaurenault, who with a slightly inferior squadron was at Toulon. It was assumed he would probably make a push for Brest, where the French main fleet was mobilising under the Comte de Tourville, and Killigrew had orders to follow him if he got through the Straits. Chateaurenault did get through; Killigrew failed to bring him to action, and instead of following him immediately, he went into Cadiz to complete his arrangements for forwarding his outward-bound convoy and escorting the one he was to bring home. What of course he should have done, according to the practice of more experienced times, was to have left this work to a cruiser detachment, and failing contact with Chateaurenault, should have closed at once to the strategical centre with his battle-squadron. Meanwhile the home fleet, which Lord Torrington was to command, was still unformed. It lay in three divisions, at the Downs, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, while a considerable part of the promised Dutch contingent had not made its appearance. It was a splendid chance for the French to seize the command of the Channel before the concentration could take place and to crush the British in detail. Accordingly, on June 13th, as soon as Chateaurenault had arrived, Tourville put to sea with some seventy of the line. The day before, however, Torrington, having hoisted his flag in the Downs, had massed his two main divisions at Portsmouth, and by the time Tourville appeared off the Isle of Wight he had with later arrivals, both Dutch and British, about fifty-six of the line in St. Helen's Road. Not knowing that the Toulon contingent had joined, he put to sea intending to fight, but on discovering the great superiority of the French, he decided in concert with his council of war to act on the defensive, and before offering battle to endeavour to secure a concentration with Killigrew and Shovel and the Plymouth division by getting to the westward. If he found this course impossible without fighting an action, his plan was to retire before Tourville "even to the Gunfleet," where amidst the shoals of the Thames estuary he felt he would have a good chance of repelling an attack with success. There, too, he counted on being reinforced not only by the ships still at Chatham, but also possibly by ships from the westward which might steal along the coast and join him "over the flats" by channels unknown to the French. To fight as he was he considered to be only [pg 212] [pg 213] [pg 214] [pg 215] playing the enemy's game. "If we are beaten," he said in communicating his plan to the Government, "they being absolute masters of the sea will be at great liberty of doing many things which they dare not do whilst we observe them and are in a possibility of joining Admiral Killigrew and our ships to the westward." It was a plan conceived on the best principles of defence—waiting till the acquisition of fresh force justified a return to the offensive. It is further interesting as a pure case of naval defence, with no ulterior object other than control of home waters. In the minds of the Government there was no apprehension of any definite attempt to invade across the Channel, but the invasion of Ireland was in full progress, and all nourishment of it must be stopped and our own communications kept free. There was, moreover, serious anxiety lest the French should extend their operations to Scotland, and there was Killigrew's homeward-bound convoy approaching. The situation was one that obviously could not be solved effectually except by winning a general command of the sea, but in Torrington's judgment it could be rendered innocuous by holding the command in dispute. His design, therefore, was to act upon the defensive and prevent the enemy achieving any positive result until he was in a position to fight them with a fair chance of victory. A temporary defensive he considered was the only way to win the command, while to hazard a decision in inferior strength was the best way to lose it. Nothing could be in closer harmony with the principles of good strategy as we understand them now. It was undoubtedly in advance of anything that had been done up to that time, and it was little wonder if the Government, as is usually said, failed to appreciate the design. Their rejection of it has come in for very severe criticism. But it would seem that they misunderstood rather than failed to appreciate. The Earl of Nottingham, who was at the head of the Government, believed, as his reply to the admiral clearly shows, that Torrington meant to retire to the Gunfleet at once; whereas it is equally clear to us that the Gunfleet was to be his extreme point, and that he did not mean to retire so far unless the French forced him. The Minister failed, as others have done since, to grasp what the admiral meant by "A fleet in being." He thought that in Torrington's view a fleet safe in port and not in contact with the enemy was "in being," whereas Torrington had no such idea. As Nottingham conceived the admiral's intention he saw that although it might preserve the fleet, it would expose everything else to destruction; that is, he was oppressed with the special characteristic of naval warfare which always permits action against the ulterior object when the enemy denies you any chance of acting against his armed force. Under this misapprehension, which indeed was not justified by the words of Torrington's despatch, he procured from the Queen an order in these terms: "We apprehend," it ran, "the consequences of your retiring to the Gunfleet to be so fatal, that we choose rather you should upon any advantage of the wind give battle to the enemy than retreat farther than is necessary to get an advantage upon the enemy." It was, however, left to his discretion to proceed to the westward to complete his concentration that way, provided, it said, "you by no means ever lose sight of the French fleet whereby they may have opportunity of making attempts upon the shore or in the rivers of Medway or Thames, or get away without fighting." This order has been very hardly dealt with by modern critics, although it clearly contemplates true preventive observation, and even, as the last words suggest, the idea contained in Nelson's well-known saying, "that by the time the enemy had beat our fleet soundly they would do us no more harm this year." It is true that Nelson could rely on the proved superiority of the British at that time unit for unit, but it is also true that Nottingham and his colleagues in the Government had information which led them greatly to underestimate Tourville's strength. This was evident on the face of Nottingham's despatch which covered the order, so evident indeed that Torrington might well perhaps have suspended the execution of an order so obviously based on incorrect information. But knowing probably what intrigues were going on against him at Court, he chose to regard it as a peremptory command to engage whenever he found himself to windward. Much as a more scientific view of naval strategy may admire Torrington's conception, there seems no reason for losing temper over the Government's plan. It was certainly one way of solving the problem, and seeing how large were our reserves, a defeat need not have meant disaster. Still, it was doubtless dictated by an inability to grasp, the strategical strength of Torrington's novel plan, a plan which was not only safer, but was calculated to achieve greater positive results in the end. The real fallacy of the Government's plan was that although it had a specious appearance of a bold offensive, it could have achieved nothing but a negative result. The most a battle could have given in the circumstances could only have left the command in dispute, and the worst would have given the enemy a positive result, which must have gravely compromised William's campaign in Ireland. On these lines Torrington replied to the Government. Dealing with their anxiety for the ships to the westward and the Mediterranean convoy, whose danger was their expressed reason for forbidding him the Gunfleet, he pointed out that they could not run much hazard if they took care of themselves. For, as he repeated, "while we observe the French, they cannot make any attempt on ships or shore without running great hazard, and if we are beaten, all is exposed to their mercy." Thus without specially noticing the Minister's misinterpretation of his despatch, he intimated that his intention was observation, and not simple retreat. [pg 216] [pg 217] [pg 218] By the time Torrington sent this reply he had been pressed back as far as Beachy Head; it was no longer possible to get to the westward; and the following day, finding himself to windward, he attacked. But still confirmed in his idea of defence, and carrying it on to his tactics, he refused to give the French the chance of a real decision, and disengaged as soon as a drop in the wind permitted. So far he felt justified in interpreting orders which he knew were founded on false information. He was sure, as he said in justification of the way he fought the action, "that the Queen could not have been prevailed with to sign an order for it, had not both our weakness and the strength of the enemy been disguised to her." So severely was his fleet crippled that he believed his plan could no longer act. "What the consequences of this unfortunate battle may be," he wrote in his Journal, "God Almighty only knows, but this I dare be positive in, had I been left to my liberty I had prevented any attempt upon the land, and secured the western ships, Killigrew, and the merchantmen." Actually in all this he was successful. Slowly retiring eastward he drew the French after him as far as Dover before he ran to the Nore; and Tourville was unable to get back to the westward, till all the endangered ships were safe in Plymouth. In spite of Torrington's being forced to fight an action at the wrong time and place, his design had so far succeeded. Not only had he prevented the French doing anything that could affect the issue of the war, but he had completely foiled Tourville's plan of destroying the British fleet in detail. That he had done, but retribution by passing to the offensive was no longer in his power. That Tourville or his Government was impressed with the efficacy of the method was demonstrated the following year, when he in his turn found himself in an inferiority that denied him hope of a successful battle decision. During the summer he kept his fleet hovering off the mouth of the Channel without giving the British admiral a chance of contact. His method, however, differed from that of Torrington, and he only achieved his negative object by keeping out of sight of his enemy altogether. In his opinion, if a fleet remained at sea in close observation of an active enemy an action could not be avoided. "If (the admiral)," he wrote in his memorandum on the subject, "be ordered to keep the sea to try to amuse the enemy and to let them know we are in a position to attack in case they attempt a descent, I think it my duty to say that in that case we must make up our mind to have to fight them in the end; for if they have really sought an action, they will have been able to fight, seeing that it is impossible to pirouette so long near a fleet without coming to grips."20 This is as much as to say that a sure point of temporary retreat is necessary to "a fleet in being," and this was an essential part of Torrington's idea. In Torrington's and Tourville's time, when ships were unhandy and fleet tactics in their infancy, the difficulty of avoiding action, when a determined enemy had once got contact, were undoubtedly great, unless a port of retreat was kept open. But as the art of naval warfare developed, the possibilities of "a fleet in being" were regarded as much wider, at least in the British service. It was nearly a hundred years before we were again forced to use the same device on a large scale, and then it was believed that superior speed and tactical precision were factors that could be counted on to an almost unlimited extent. In the darkest days of the War of American Independence we have a memorandum of the subject by Kempenfelt, which not only gives the developed idea of "a fleet in being" and the high aggressive spirit that is its essence, but also explains its value, not merely as a defensive expedient, but as a means of permitting a drastic offensive even when you are as a whole inferior. "When you know the enemy's designs," he says, "in order to do something effectual you must endeavour to be superior to them in some part where they have designs to execute, and where, if they succeed, they would most injure you. If your fleet is divided as to be in all places inferior to the enemy, they will have a fair chance of succeeding everywhere in their attempts. If a squadron cannot be formed sufficient to face the enemy's at home, it would be more advantageous to let your inferiority be still greater in order by it to gain the superiority elsewhere." "When inferior to the enemy, and you have only a squadron of observation to watch and attend upon their motions, such a squadron should be composed of two-decked ships only [that is, ships of the highest mobility] as to assure it purpose. It must have the advantage of the enemy in sailing, else under certain circumstances it will be liable to be forced to battle or to give up some of its heavy sailers. It is highly necessary to have such a flying squadron to hang on the enemy's large fleet, as it will prevent their dividing into separate squadrons for intercepting your trade or spreading their ships for a more extensive view. You will be at hand to profit from any accidental separation or dispersion of their fleet from hard gales, fogs, or other causes. You may intercept supplies, intelligence, &c, sent to them. In fine, such a squadron will be a check and restraint upon their motions, and prevent a good deal of the mischief they might otherwise do." Three years before, when first called to be Chief of the Staff in the Channel, he had emphasised the same points. "Much," he wrote in July 1779, "I may say all, depends upon this fleet. 'Tis an inferior against a superior fleet. Therefore the greatest skill and address is requisite to counteract the designs of the enemy, to watch and seize the favourable opportunity for action, and to catch the advantage of making the effort at some or other feeble part of the enemy's line; or if such opportunities don't offer, to hover near the enemy, keep him at bay, and prevent his [pg 219] [pg 220] [pg 221] [pg 222] attempting anything but at risk and hazard; to command their attention, and oblige them to think of nothing but being on their guard against your attack."21 It was on these lines the war was conducted. The West Indian area, in which lay the enemy's principal object, was treated as the offensive theatre and the home waters as the defensive. Inferior as was the Channel fleet to the home fleet of the allies, its defensive operations proved adequate to prevent their achieving any success. Nor was this all, for Kempenfelt was able to demonstrate the positive side of his theory in the most brilliant and convincing manner. In dealing with concentration we have seen how, in command of such a flying squadron as he postulated, he was able off Ushant to seize a favourable opportunity for action, which resulted in his capturing a convoy of military stores essential to the French operations in the West Indies under the nose of De Guichen with an escort of nearly twice his force. Nelson certainly shared Kempenfelt's views as to the possibilities of an inferior fleet kept actively in being. "As to our fleet," he wrote from the Mediterranean in 1796, "under such a commander-in-chief as Sir John Jervis nobody has any fear ... We are now twenty-two sail of the line. The combined fleet will not be above thirty-five.... I will venture my life Sir John Jervis defeats them. I do not mean by a regular battle, but by the skill of our admiral and the activity and spirit of our officers and seamen. This country is the most favourable possible for that skill with an inferior fleet; for the winds are so variable, that some one time in twenty-four hours you must be able to attack a part of a large fleet, and the other will be becalmed or have a contrary wind. Therefore I hope the Government will not be alarmed for our safety." Such a conception of the defensive may indeed be said to have become current in the British service. It was part of the reasoning which in 1805, after Villeneuve's escape from the Mediterranean, decided Sir John Orde to fall back on Ushant instead of entering the Straits. "I dare believe," he wrote, "Lord Nelson will be found in condition with his twelve of the line and numerous frigates to act on the defensive without loss and even to hang on to the skirts of the enemy's fleet should it attempt any material service, especially when encumbered with troops." In all this consideration of the potentialities of "a fleet in being" operating defensively it must never be forgotten that we are dealing with its possibilities in relation to a general command of the sea—to its general power of holding such command in dispute, as Torrington used it. Its power of preventing a particular operation, such as oversea invasion, is another matter, which will always depend upon the local conditions. If the "fleet in being" can be contained in such a way that it is impossible for it to reach the invading line of passage, it will be no bar to invasion. In 1690, so far as Torrington's fleet was concerned, the French, had they been so minded, might have made a descent, say, at Portsmouth while Torrington was at the Nore. But Torrington's fleet was not the only factor. His retreat forced Tourville to leave behind him unfought the squadrons of Shovel and Killigrew, and so far as commanding a line of invasion passage was concerned Tourville was himself as well contained as Torrington. The conditions of naval defence against invasion are in fact so complex compared with those of general naval defence that they must be treated later as a special branch of the subject. The doctrine of the "Fleet in being" as formulated and practised by Torrington and developed by Kempenfelt goes no further than this, that where the enemy regards the general command of a sea area as necessary to his offensive purposes, you may be able to prevent his gaining such command by using your fleet defensively, refusing what Nelson called a regular battle, and seizing every opportunity for a counterstroke. To use it as it was used by the French in the case of Tourville's famous deterrent cruise, where the whole object of the French was offensive and could not be obtained except by offence, is quite another thing. It is indeed difficult to understand the admiration with which his campagne au large has been treated in France. He kept the sea off the mouth of the Channel for fifty days in the summer of 1691, and for forty of those days our Channel fleet was making no systematic effort to seek him out. He had been sent to sea in hope of intercepting our great "Smyrna convoy," which was then the backbone of our oversea trade. Russell with the British main fleet simply took positions to cover its approach until it was safe, knowing presumably that Tourville must come to him if he wished to accomplish his purpose. When the convoy was safe Russell proceeded off Ushant, that is, between the enemy and his base. Tourville's communications were thus cut, his line of retreat threatened, and he seized the first opportunity to elude Russell and to return into port. Beyond taking a few ships from one of the West India convoys, he accomplished nothing. The central French offensive in Ireland was broken at the battle of the Boyne, and the prestige of England at sea was restored. It is true our trade suffered in the North Sea, but this was not directly due to the concentration which Tourville's cruise forced upon us, but rather to the failure of the Dutch—apparently by a misunderstanding-to provide for an effective blockade of Dunkirk. To British eyes it will seem that the heresy which was latent in Tourville's instructions was a seed that choked all the finer aspirations of the French navy. In 1691 the plan of his cruise may possibly be defended as sufficiently aggressive, since, seeing how unstable was William's new throne, a resounding blow at British trade, combined [pg 223] [pg 224] [pg 225] [pg 226] with an expected victory in Ireland, might have been enough to upset it. But afterwards the idea was stretched to occasions it would not fit. It seems to have bred a belief that where the object of the war plainly depended on winning a real command of the sea, that object could yet be attained by naval defensive operations. Many times it is true a policy which had starved the navy of France left no other course open to her seamen, and had they in their inferiority attempted the offensive, the end must have been swifter if not more certain. In criticising the maritime history of France we must be careful to distinguish policy from strategy. It was not always the defensive strategy that was bad, but the policy that condemned her admirals to negative operations. Seeing that she was a continental Power with continental aspirations, it was often a policy from which her military exigencies permitted no escape. Nevertheless the policy was twice accursed: it cursed her when she was weak, and cursed her when she was strong. The prolonged use of the defensive bred a habit of mind which seems to have rendered her incapable of striking hard when she had the strength. In no other way at least can we account for the behaviour of so high-spirited a nation when her chance of revenge came in the War of American Independence. It is here in its moral reactions lies the danger of the defensive, a danger so insidious in its working as to tempt us never to utter the word. Yet with the voice of Torrington, Kempenfelt, and Nelson in our ears, it would be folly to ignore it for ourselves, and still more to ignore the exhausting strain its use by our enemy may impose upon us. It must be studied, if for no other reasons than to learn how to break it down. Nor will the study have danger, if only we keep well in view the spirit of restless and vigilant counter-attack which Kempenfelt and Nelson regarded as its essence. True, some of the conditions which in the days of sails made for opportunity have passed away, but many still remain. Shifts of wind and calms will no longer bring them, but weather thick or violent can yet make seamanship, nimbleness, and cohesion tell as it always did; and there is no reason to doubt that it is still possible for hard sea-training to make "the activity and spirit of our officers and seamen" give the results which Nelson so confidently expected. II. MINOR COUNTER-ATTACKS For the weaker of two belligerents minor-attack has always exercised a certain fascination. Where a Power was so inferior in naval force that it could scarcely count even on disputing command by fleet operations, there remained a hope of reducing the relative inferiority by putting part of the enemy's force out of action. Such hopes were rarely realised. In 1587 Drake succeeded in stopping the Spanish invasion by such a counter-attack on the Cadiz division of the Armada while it was still unmobilised. In 1667 the Dutch achieved a similar success against our Chatham division when it was demobilised and undefended, and thereby probably secured rather more favourable terms of peace. But it cannot be said that the old wars present any case where the ultimate question of command was seriously affected by a minor counterattack. The advent of the torpedo, however, has given the idea a new importance that cannot be overlooked. The degree of that importance is at present beyond calculation. There is at least no evidence that it would be very high in normal conditions and between ordinarily efficient fleets. The comparative success of the opening Japanese attack on the Port Arthur squadron is the only case in point, and where only one case exists, it is necessary to use extreme caution in estimating its significance. Before we can deduce anything of permanent value we must consider very carefully both its conditions and results. To begin with, it was a new experience of a new class of weapon, and it by no means follows that the success of a new expedient will be repeated with anything like equal result. It will not be irrelevant again to recall the case of fireships. At the outset of the sailing era in 1588, this device prepared the way for a decisive success against a fleet in the open. In the succeeding wars the new weapon found a prominent place in the organisation of sea- going fleets, but its success was never repeated. Against ships in ill-defended harbours it did occasionally produce good results, and during the infancy of tactics its moral and even material effects in fleet actions were frequently demonstrated. But as naval science developed and the limitations of the weapon were more accurately measured, it was able to achieve less and less, till in the eighteenth century it was regarded as almost negligible. Even its moral effect was lost, and it ceased to be considered as a battle unit. Now, if we examine closely the Port Arthur case, we shall find it pointing to the existence of certain inherent conditions not dissimilar from those which discredited fireships as a decisive factor in war. In spite of the apparently formidable nature of a surprise attack by torpedo the indications from the one case in point are that these conditions make for greater power in the defence than in the attack. The first condition relates to the difficulty of locating the objective accurately. It is obvious that for this kind of operation the most precise intelligence is essential, and of all intelligence the most difficult to obtain in war is the distribution of an enemy's fleet from day to day. The Japanese had fairly certain information that the bulk of the Port Arthur squadron was lying in the outer anchorage, but it had been constantly moving, and there was a report that three battleships had just been detached from it. The report was false, but the result was that of the five divisions of destroyers which [pg 227] [pg 228] [pg 229] the Japanese had available, two were diverted against Dalny, where no enemy was found. Such uncertainty must always exist, and in no circumstances is it likely to be less than where, as in the Japanese case, the attack is made before declaration, and while the ordinary channels of intelligence are still open. Further, it is to be noted that in spite of the fact that relations for some weeks had been highly strained, and a surprise torpedo attack was regarded as probable, the Russians had taken no precautions to confuse their enemy. It is obvious that measures to prevent accurate locating can, and should, be taken in such cases. We may go further. From confusing the enemy by such means it is but a step to lead him to a wrong conclusion, and to lay for him a trap which may swallow up the bulk of his destroyer force in the first hours of the war. It is to be feared, however, that the risks of such an eventuality are so great in minor counter-attacks of this nature, that it will probably be very difficult to tempt an inferior enemy to expose his flotilla in this way. This view receives emphasis from the second point which the Port Arthur case serves to demonstrate, and that is the great power of even the flimsiest defence against such attacks; in other words, the chances of success can scarcely ever be great enough to justify the risk. Everything was in favour of the Japanese. Orders had been issued in the Russian squadron for two or three nights previously to prepare for a torpedo attack, but so low had discipline fallen, that the orders were obeyed in a very perfunctory manner. Guns were not loaded, their crews were not at quarters, nor were the nets got out. The only real precaution taken was that two destroyers and no more had been sent out as guard patrol, but even they were forbidden to fire on anything they met until they had reported to the admiral or had themselves been fired on. Defence against a surprise attack could scarcely have been more feeble, and yet so high was the nervous tension in the attacking force, that it proved stronger than could reasonably have been expected. The mere existence of the patrol and the necessity of evading it threw the Japanese approach into a confusion from which it was unable to recover entirely, and the attack lost its essential momentum and cohesion. Again, defective as were the arrangements in the squadron itself, and lax as were its training and discipline, no torpedo hits were made, so far as we can judge, after the Russian guns and searchlights got into play. Such development of strength in the defence seems inherent in the conditions of minor attack, and there appears to be no reason for expecting better results for such attacks in normal cases. But in deducing principles from the Port Arthur case, it must always be remembered that it was far from normal. It was a blow before declaration, when the menace of strained relations, though realised, had been almost entirely ignored by the Russians. In such exceptional and almost incredible circumstances a minor attack might always be counted on for a certain measure of success. To this we have to add the fact that the Russian squadron was not ordinarily efficient, but appears to have fallen into a lax condition such as could scarcely recur in the case of any other naval Power. Finally, we must ask what, with every condition abnormally in favour of the attack, was the actual material result? Did it have any real influence on the ultimate question of command? It is true that it so far swung the balance in favour of the Japanese that they were able to exercise the local control long enough to land their troops and isolate Port Arthur. But the Japanese plan for securing ultimate command rested on their power of taking Port Arthur by military operation and sustaining the siege from the sea. Yet in spite of every condition of success the physical effect of the blow was so small, that even without the help of an adequate dockyard the squadron recovered from it and became potent again before the siege could even be formed. The minor attacks which followed the first blow were all failures, and whether delivered at the port or upon the squadron in the open had no appreciable effect whatever. At the same time it must be remembered that since that war the art of torpedo warfare has developed very rapidly. Its range and offensive power have increased in a higher ratio than the means of resisting it. Still those means have advanced, and it is probable that a squadron in a naval port or in a properly defended anchorage is not more easy to injure than it ever was; while a squadron at sea, so long as it constantly shifts its position, still remains very difficult to locate with sufficient precision for successful minor attack. The unproved value of submarines only deepens the mist which overhangs the next naval war. From a strategical point of view we can say no more than that we have to count with a new factor, which gives a new possibility to minor counterattack. It is a possibility which on the whole tells in favour of naval defence, a new card which, skilfully played in combination with defensive fleet operations, may lend fresh importance to the "Fleet in being." It may further be expected that whatever the effective possibilities of minor operations may ultimately prove to be in regard to securing command, the moral influence will be considerable, and at least at the beginning of a future war will tend to deflect and hamper the major operations and rob of their precision the lines which formerly led so frankly to the issue by battle. In the absence of a sufficient volume of experience it would be idle to go further, particularly as torpedo attack, like fireship attack, depends for success more than any other on the spirit and skill of officers and men. With [pg 230] [pg 231] [pg 232] regard to the torpedo as the typical arm of mobile coastal defence, it is a different matter. What has been said applies only to its power towards securing command of the sea, and not to the exercise or to disputing the exercise of command. This is a question which is concerned with defence against invasion, and to that we must now turn. CHAPTER FOUR METHODS OF EXERCISING COMMAND I. DEFENCE AGAINST INVASION In methods of exercising command are included all operations not directly concerned with securing command or with preventing its being secured by the enemy. We engage in exercising command whenever we conduct operations which are directed not against the enemy's battle-fleet, but to using sea communications for our own purposes, or to interfering with the enemy's use of them. Such operations, though logically of secondary importance, have always occupied the larger part of naval warfare. Naval warfare does not begin and end with the destruction of the enemy's battle-fleet, nor even with breaking his cruiser power. Beyond all this there is the actual work of preventing his passing an army across the sea and of protecting the passage of our own military expeditions. There is also the obstruction of his trade and the protection of our own. In all such operations we are concerned with the exercise of command. We are using the sea, or interfering with its use by the enemy; we are not endeavouring to secure the use or to prevent the enemy from securing it. The two categories of operation differ radically in conception and purpose, and strategically they are on wholly different planes. Logically, of course, operations for exercising command should follow those for securing command; that is to say, that since the attainment of command is the special object of naval warfare, and since that command can only be obtained permanently by the destruction of the enemy's armed forces afloat, it follows that in strictness no other objects should be allowed to interfere with our concentration of effort on the supreme end of securing command by destruction. War, however, is not conducted by logic, and the order of proceeding which logic prescribes cannot always be adhered to in practice. We have seen how, owing to the special conditions of naval warfare, extraneous necessities intrude themselves which make it inevitable that operations for exercising command should accompany as well as follow operations for securing command. War being, as it is, a complex sum of naval, military, political, financial, and moral factors, its actuality can seldom offer to a naval staff a clean slate on which strategical problems can be solved by well-turned syllogisms. The naval factor can never ignore the others. From the outset one or more of them will always call for some act of exercising command which will not wait for its turn in the logical progression. To a greater or less extent in all ordinary cases both categories of operation will have to be put in motion from the beginning. Hence the importance of realising the distinction between the two generic forms of naval activity. In the hurry and stress of war confusion between them is easy. By keeping a firm grip upon the difference we can see at least what we are doing. We can judge how far any given operation that may be called for is a sacrifice of security to exercise, how far such a sacrifice may be justified, and how far the one end may be made to serve the other. By applying the distinction as a test much error may be avoided. The risk we take may be great, but we shall be able to weigh it accurately against the value of the end, and we shall take it with our eyes open and of set purpose. Above all, it will enable the Staff to settle clearly for each squadronal commander what is to be his primary objective, and what the object or purpose of the operations entrusted to him. It is above all in this last consideration, and particularly in the determination of the objective, that lies the main practical value of the distinction. This will become clear the moment we begin to consider defence against invasion, which naturally takes the first place amongst operations for the exercise of control. Of all the current assumptions, not one is so confusing for the finer adjustments of strategy as that which affirms that the primary objective of our fleet is always the enemy's fleet. Of the battle-fleet and its attendant units it is of course true, so long at least as the enemy has a battle-fleet in being. It is true, that is, of all operations for securing control, but of operations for exercising control it is not true. In the case we have now to consider-defence against invasion-the objective of the special operations is, and always has been, the enemy's army. On this fundamental postulate our plans for resisting invasion have always been constructed from the year of the Armada to 1805. [pg 233] [pg 234] [pg 235] In the old service tradition the point was perfectly well established. Admirals' instructions constantly insist on the fact that the transports are the "principal object." The whole disposition of the fleet during Hawke's blockade in 1759 was based on keeping a firm hold on the transports in the Morbihan, and when he sought to extend his operations against the Rochefort squadron, he was sharply reminded by Anson that "the principal object of attention at this time" was, firstly, "the interception of the embarkations of the enemy at Morbihan," and secondly, "the keeping of the ships of war from coming out of Brest." Similarly Commodore Warren in 1796, when he had the permanent frigate guard before Brest, issued orders to his captains that in case of encountering enemy's transports under escort they were "to run them down or destroy them in the most expeditious manner possible previous to attacking the ships of war, but to preserve such a situation as to effect that purpose when directed by signal." Lord Keith's orders when watching Napoleon's flotilla were to the same effect. "Directing your chief attention," they run, "to the destruction of the ships, vessels, or boats having men, horses, or artillery on board (in preference to that of the vessels by which they are protected), and in the strict execution of this important duty losing sight entirely of the possibility of idle censure for avoiding contact with an armed force, because the prevention of debarkation is the object of primary importance to which every other consideration must give way."22 In tactics, then, the idea was the same as in strategy. The army was the primary objective round which all dispositions turned. In the French service the strength and soundness of the British practice was understood at least by the best men. When in 1805 Napoleon consulted Ganteaume as to the possibility of the flotilla of transports effecting its passage by evasion, the admiral told him it was impossible, since no weather could avail to relax the British hold sufficiently. "In former wars," he said, "the English vigilance was miraculous." To this rule there was no exception, not even when circumstances rendered it difficult to distinguish between the enemy's fleet and army as objectives. This situation could occur in two ways. Firstly, when the invading army was designed to sail with the battle-fleet, as in the case of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt; and secondly, when, although the design was that the two should operate on separate lines, our system of defence forced the fleet to come up to the army's line of passage in order to clear it, as happened in the case of the Armada and the French attempt of 1744. In the latter case the invading army, whose objective was unknown, was at Dunkirk, and a French fleet was coming up the Channel to cover the passage. Sir John Norris, in command of the home fleet, was in the Downs. Though his name is now almost forgotten, he was one of the great founders of our naval tradition, and a strategist of the first order. In informing the Government of his plan of operations, he said he intended to proceed with his whole squadron off Dunkirk to prevent the transports sailing. "But," he says, "if they should unfortunately get out and pass us in the night and go northward, I intend to detach a superior force to endeavour to overtake and destroy them; and with the remainder of my squadron either to fight the French fleet now in the Channel, or observe them and cover the country as our circumstances will admit of; or I shall pursue the embarkation with all my strength." In this case there had been no time to organise a special squadron or flotilla, in the usual way, to bar the line of passage, and the battle-fleet had to be used for the purpose. This being so, Norris was not going to allow the presence of an enemy's battle-fleet to entice him away from his grip on the invading army, and so resolutely did he hold to the principle, that he meant if the transports put to sea to direct his offensive against them, while he merely contained the enemy's battle-fleet by defensive observation. In the Egyptian case there was no distinction between the two objectives at all. Napoleon's expedition sailed in one mass. Yet in the handling of his fleet Nelson preserved the essential idea. He organised it into three "sub- squadrons," one of six sail and two of four each. "Two of these sub-squadrons," says Berry, his flag-captain, "were to attack the ships of war, while the third was to pursue the transports and to sink and destroy as many as it could"; that is, he intended, in order to make sure of Napoleon's army, to use no more than ten, and possibly only eight, of his own battleships against the eleven of the enemy. Many other examples could be given of British insistence on making the enemy's army the primary objective and not his fleet in cases of invasion. No point in the old tradition was more firmly established. Its value was of course more strongly marked where the army and the fleet of the enemy endeavoured to act on separate lines of operation; that is, where the army took the real offensive line and the fleet the covering or preventive line, and where consequently for our own fleet there was no confusion between the two objectives. This was the normal case, and the reason it was so is simple enough. It may be stated at once, since it serves to enunciate the general principle upon which our traditional system of defence was based. An invasion of Great Britain must always be an attempt over an uncommanded sea. It may be that our fleet predominates or it may be that it does not, but the command must always be in dispute. If we have gained complete command, no invasion can take place, nor will it be attempted. If we have lost it completely no invasion will be necessary, since, quite apart from the threat of invasion, we must make peace on the best terms we can [pg 236] [pg 237] [pg 238] [pg 239] get. Now, if the sea be uncommanded, there are obviously two ways in which an invasion may be attempted. Firstly, the enemy may endeavour to force it through our naval defence with transports and fleet in one mass. This was the primitive idea on which the Spanish invasion of Philip the Second was originally planned by his famous admiral, Santa-Cruz. Ripening military science, however, was able to convince him of its weakness. A mass of transports and warships is the most cumbrous and vulnerable engine of war ever known. The weaker the naval defence of the threatened country, the more devoutly will it pray the invader may use this device. Where contact with the enemy's fleet is certain, and particularly in narrow seas, as it was in this case, such a course will give the defender all the chances he could desire, and success for the invader is inconceivable, provided always we resolutely determine to make the army in its transports our main objective, and are not to be induced to break our head against its escort. Where, however, contact is not certain, the invasion over an uncommanded sea may succeed by evasion of the defender's battle-fleet, as it did in the case of Napoleon's invasion of Egypt. But that operation belongs to an entirely different category from that which we are now considering. None of the factors on which the traditional system of British defence is based were present. It was an operation over an open sea against a distant and undetermined objective that had no naval defence of its own, whereas in our own case the determining factors are permanent naval defence, an approximately determined objective, and a narrow sea where evasion by any force of invasion strength is impossible. Napoleon's exploit was in fact nothing more than the evasion of an open blockade which had no naval defence beyond it. The vital importance of these things will appear as we proceed and note the characteristics which marked every attempt to invade England. From such attempts we of course exclude the various descents upon Ireland, which, not being of invasion strength, fall into another class, to be dealt with hereafter. Since the expedient of forcing an invasion by the strength of a powerful battleship escort has always been rejected as an inadmissible operation, the invader has had no choice but to adopt a separate line for his army, and operate with his fleet in such a way as may promise to prevent the enemy controlling that line. That, in short, is the problem of invasion over an uncommanded sea. In spite of an unbroken record of failure scored at times with naval disaster, continental strategists from Parma to Napoleon have clung obstinately to the belief that there is a solution short of a complete fleet decision. They have tried every conceivable expedient again and again. They have tried it by simple surprise evasion and by evasion through diversion or dispersal of our naval defence. They have tried it by seeking local control through a local naval success prepared by surprise, or by attempting to entice our fleet away from home waters to a sufficient extent to give them temporarily local superiority. But the end has always been the same. Try as they would, they were faced ultimately by one of two alternatives—they must either defeat our covering battle-fleet in battle, or they must close their own battle-fleet on the transports, and so set up the very situation which it was their main design to avoid. The truth is, that all attempts to invade England without command of the sea have moved in a vicious circle, from which no escape was ever found. No matter how ingenious or complex the enemy's design, a determined hold on their army as the primary naval objective has always set up a process of degradation which rendered the enterprise impracticable. Its stages are distinct and recurrent, and may be expressed as it were diagrammatically as follows:— Two lines of operation having been decided on, the invading army is gathered at a point as close as possible to the coast to be invaded; that is, where the intervening sea is narrowest, and where the army's passage will be exposed to interference for the shortest time. The covering fleet will operate from a point as distant as convenient, so as to entice the enemy as far as possible from the army's line of passage. The defender replies by blockading the army's ports of departure with a flotilla of light vessels capable of dealing with transports, or by establishing a mobile defence of the threatened coasts which transports cannot break unaided, or more probably he will combine both expedients. The first fallacy of the invasion plan is then apparent. The narrower the sea, the easier it is to watch. Pure evasion becomes impossible, and it is necessary to give the transports sufficient armed strength by escort or otherwise to protect them against flotilla attack. The defender at once stiffens his flotilla defence with cruisers and intermediate ships, and the invader has to arrange for breaking the barrier with a battle-squadron. So weak and disturbing a position is then set up that the whole scheme begins to give way, if, that is, the defender has clung stubbornly to the strategy we always used. Our battle-fleet refused to seek out that of the invader. It has always held a position between the invader's fleet and the blockaded invasion base, covering the blockade and flotilla defence. To enable a battle-squadron to break our hold and to reinforce the army escort, the invader must either force this covering position by battle, or disturb it so effectively as to permit the reinforcing squadron to evade it. But since ex hypothesi he is trying to invade without securing the command by battle, he will first try to reinforce his transport escort by evasion. At once he is faced with new difficulty. The reinforcement entails dividing his fleet, and this is an expedient so vicious and disturbing to morale, that no invader has ever been found to risk it. And for this reason. To make evasion possible for the detached squadron, he must bring up the [pg 240] [pg 241] [pg 242] rest of his force and engage the attention of the enemy's fleet, and thus unless he is in very great superiority, and by hypothesis is not—he runs the hazard of having his two divisions beaten in detail. This method has sometimes been urged by Governments, but so loud have been the protests both from the fleet and the army, that it has always been dropped, and the invader finds himself at the end of the vicious circle. Unable to reinforce his transport escort sufficiently without dividing his battle-fleet, he is forced to bring his whole force up to the army or abandon the attempt till command shall have been secured by battle. Thus the traditional British system has never failed to bring about the deadlock, and it will be observed it is founded on making the invading army the primary objective. We keep a hold on it, firstly, by flotilla blockade and defence stiffened as circumstances may dictate by higher units, and secondly, by battle-fleet cover. It is on the flotilla hold that the whole system is built up. It is the local danger to that hold which determines the amount of stiffening the flotilla demands, and it is the security of that hold which determines the position and action of the battle-fleet. A few typical examples will serve to show how the system worked in practice under all kinds of conditions. The first scientific attempt to work on two lines of operation, as distinguished from the crude mass methods of the Middle Ages, was the Spanish enterprise of 1588. Though internal support from Catholic malcontents was expected, it was designed as a true invasion, that is, a continuing operation for permanent conquest. Parma, the military commander-in-chief, laid it down that the Spanish fleet would have not only to protect his passage and support his landing, but also "to keep open his communications for the flow of provisions and munition." In advising the dual line of operation, Parma's original intention was to get his army across by surprise. As always, however, it proved impossible to conceal the design, and long before he was ready he found himself securely blockaded by a Dutch flotilla supported by an English squadron. So firm indeed was the English hold on the army, that for a time it was overdone. The bulk of the English fleet was kept on the line of passage under Howard, while Drake alone was sent to the westward. It was only under the great sailor's importunity that the disposition, which was to become traditional, was perfected, and the whole fleet, with the exception of the squadron supporting the flotilla blockade, was massed in a covering position to the westward. The normal situation was then set up, and it could only have one result. Surprise was out of the question. Parma could not move till the blockade was broken, nor in face of the covering fleet could the Spanish fleet hope to break it by a sudden intrusion. The vague prospects the Spaniards had conceived of keeping the English fleet away from the line of passage by threatening a descent in the West Country or blockading it in a western port would no longer do. No such expedient would release Parma, and the Duke of Medina-Sidonia was ordered to proceed direct to Dunkirk if possible without fighting, there to break the blockade and secure the passage. There was some idea in the King's mind that he would be able to do this without a battle, but Parma and every seasoned Spanish sailor knew that the English fleet would have to be totally defeated before the transports could venture out of port. Such a battle was indeed inevitable, and the English dispositions secured that the Spaniards would have to fight it under every disadvantage which was inherent in the plan of dual lines of operation. The English would secure certain contact at such a distance from the line of passage as would permit prolonged harassing attacks in waters unfamiliar to the enemy and close to their own sources of support and supply. No battle to the death would be necessary until the Spaniards were herded into the confined and narrow waters which the army's passage demanded, and where both sections of the British fleet would be massed for the final struggle. They must arrive there dispirited with indecisive actions and with the terrors of unknown and difficult seas at the highest point. All this was no matter of chance. It was inherent in the strategical and geographical conditions. The English dispositions had taken every advantage of them, and the result was that not only was the Spanish army unable even to move, but the English advantages in the final battle were so great, that it was only a lucky shift of wind that saved the Armada from being driven to total destruction upon the Dutch banks. In this case, of course, there had been ample time to make the necessary dispositions. It will be well to follow it with an example in which surprise came as near to being complete as it is possible to conceive, and where the arrangements for defence had to be improvised on the spur of the moment. A case in point was the French attempt of 1744. In that year everything was in favour of the invader. England was undermined with Jacobite sedition; Scotland was restless and threatening; the navy had sunk to what is universally regarded as its worst for spirit, organisation, and command; and the government was in the hands of the notorious "Drunken Administration." For three years we had been making unsuccessful war with Spain, and had been supporting Maria Theresa on the Continent against France, with the result that our home defence was reduced to its lowest ebb. The navy then numbered 183 sail—about equal to that of France and Spain combined —but owing to the strain of the war in the Mediterranean and Transatlantic stations only forty-three, including eighteen of the line, were available for home waters. Even counting all cruising ships "within call," as the phrase then was, the Government had barely one-fourth of the fleet at hand to meet the crisis. With the land forces it was [pg 243] [pg 244] [pg 245] [pg 246] little better. Considerably more than half the home army was abroad with the King, who was assisting the Empress-Queen as Elector of Hanover. Between France and England, however, there was no war. In the summer the King won the battle of Dettingen; a formal alliance with Maria Theresa followed in the autumn; France responded with a secret alliance with Spain; and to prevent further British action on the Continent, she resolved to strike a blow at London in combination with a Jacobite insurrection. It was to be a "bolt from the blue" before declaration and in mid-winter, when the best ships of the home fleet were laid up. The operation was planned on dual lines, the army to start from Dunkirk, the covering fleet from Brest. The surprise was admirably designed. The port of Dunkirk had been destroyed under the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, and though the French had been restoring it secretly for some time, it was still unfit to receive a fleet of transports. In spite of the warnings of Sir John Norris, the senior admiral in the service, the assembling of troops in its neighbourhood from the French army in Flanders could only be taken for a movement into winter quarters, and that no suspicion might be aroused the necessary transports were secretly taken up in other ports under false charter-parties, and were only to assemble off Dunkirk at the last moment. With equal skill the purpose of the naval mobilisation at Brest was concealed. By false information cleverly imparted to our spies and by parade of victualling for a long voyage, the British Government was led to believe that the main fleet was intended to join the Spaniards in the Mediterranean, while a detachment, which was designed to escort the transports, was ostensibly equipped for a raid in the West Indies. So far as concealment was concerned the arrangement was perfect. Yet it contained within it the fatal ingredient. The army was to strike in the Thames at Tilbury; but complete as was the secrecy, Marshal Saxe, who was to command, could not face the passage without escort. There were too many privateers and armed merchantmen always in the river, besides cruisers moving to and fro on commerce-protection duty. The division, therefore, which we supposed to be for the West Indies was to be detached from the Brest fleet after it entered the Channel and was to proceed to join the transports off Dunkirk, while the Marquis de Roquefeuil with the main fleet held what British ships might be ready in Portsmouth either by battle or blockade. Nothing could look simpler or more certain of success. The British Government seemed quite asleep. The blow was timed for the first week in January, and it was mid-December before they even began to watch Brest with cruisers regularly. On these cruisers' reports measures were taken to prepare an equal squadron for sea by the new year. By this time nearly twenty of the line were ready or nearly so at the Nore, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, and a press was ordered to man them. Owing to various causes the French had now to postpone their venture. Finally it was not till February 6th that Roquefeuil was seen to leave Brest with nineteen of the line. The news reached London on the 12th, and next day Norris was ordered to hoist his flag at Spithead. His instructions were "to take the most effectual measures to prevent the making of any descent upon the kingdoms." It was nothing but news that the young Pretender had left Rome for France that led to this precaution. The Government had still no suspicion of what was brewing at Dunkirk. It was not till the 20th that a Dover smuggler brought over information which at last opened their eyes. A day or two later the French transports were seen making for Dunkirk, and were mistaken for the Brest fleet. Orders were consequently sent down to Norris to follow them. In vain he protested at the interference. He knew the French were still to the westward of him, but his orders were repeated, and he had to go. Tiding it up-Channel against easterly winds, he reached the Downs and joined the Nore Division there on the 28th. History usually speaks of this false movement as the happy chance which saved the country from invasion. But it was not so. Saxe had determined not to face the Thames ships without escort. They were ample to destroy him had he done so. In truth the move which the Government forced on Norris spoilt the campaign and prevented his destroying the Brest fleet as well as stopping the invasion. Roquefeuil had just received his final orders off the Start. He was instructed by all possible means to bring the main British fleet to action, or at least to prevent further concentration, while he was also to detach the special division of four of the line under Admiral Barraille to Dunkirk to escort the transports. It was in fact the inevitable order, caused by our hold on the army, to divide the fleet. Both officers as usual began to be upset, and as with Medina-Sidonia, they decided to keep company till they reached the Isle of Wight and remain there till they could get touch with Saxe and pilots for the Dover Strait. They were beset with the nervousness that seems inseparable from this form of operation. Roquefeuil explained to his Government that it was impossible to tell what ships the enemy had passed to the Downs, and that Barraille when he arrived off Dunkirk might well find himself in inferiority. He ended in the usual way by urging that the whole fleet must move in a body to the line of passage. On arriving off Portsmouth, however, a reconnaissance in thick weather led him to believe that the whole of Norris's fleet was still there, and he therefore detached Barraille, who reached Dunkirk in safety. Not knowing that Norris was in the Downs, Saxe began immediately to embark his troops, but bad weather delayed the operation for three days, and so saved the expedition, exposed as it was in the open roads, from [pg 247] [pg 248] [pg 249] destruction by an attack which Norris was on the point of delivering with his flotilla of fireships and bomb vessels. The Brest squadron had an equally narrow escape. Saxe and his staff having heard rumours of Norris's movement to the Downs had become seized with the sea-sickness which always seems to afflict an army as it waits to face the dangers of an uncommanded passage. They too wanted the whole fleet to escort them, and orders had been sent to Roquefeuille to do as he had suggested. All unconscious of Norris's presence in the Downs with a score of the line more powerful than his own, he came on with the fifteen he had still with his flag to close on Barraille. Norris was informed of his approach, and it was now he wrote his admirable appreciation, already quoted, for dealing with the situation. "As I think it," he said, "of the greatest consequence to his Majesty's service to prevent the landing of these troops in any part of the country, I have ... determined to anchor without the sands of Dunkirk, where we shall be in the fairest way for keeping them in." That is, he determined to keep hold of the army regardless of the enemy's fleet, and as Saxe's objective was not quite certain, he would do it by close blockade. "But if," he continued, "they should unfortunately get out and pass in the night and go northward [that is, for Scotland], I intend to detach a superior force to endeavour to overtake and destroy them, and with the remainder of my squadron either fight the French fleet now in the Channel, or observe them and cover the country as our circumstances will admit of; or I shall pursue the embarkation [that is, follow the transports] with all my strength." This meant he would treat the enemy's army offensively and their fleet defensively, and his plan was entirely approved by the King. As to which of the two plans he would adopt, the inference is that his choice would depend on the strength of the enemy, for it was reported the Rochefort squadron had joined Roquefeuille. The doubt was quickly settled. On the morrow he heard that Roquefeuille was at Dungeness with only fifteen of the line. In a moment he seized all the advantage of the interior position which Roquefeuille's necessity to close on the army had given him. With admirable insight he saw there was time to fling his whole force at the enemy's fleet without losing his hold on the army's line of passage. The movement was made immediately. The moment the French were sighted "General chase" was signalled, and Roquefeuille was within an ace of being surprised at his anchorage when a calm stopped the attack. The calm was succeeded by another furious gale, in which the French escaped in a disastrous sauve qui peut, and the fleet of transports was destroyed. The outcome of it all was not only the failure of the invasion, but that we secured the command of home waters for the rest of the war. The whole attempt, it will be seen, with everything in its favour, had exhibited the normal course of degradation. For all the nicely framed plan and the perfect deception, the inherent difficulties, when it came to the point of execution, had as usual forced a clumsy concentration of the enemy's battle-fleet with his transports, and we on our part were able to forestall it with every advantage in our favour by the simple expedient of a central mass on a revealed and certain line of passage. In the next project, that of 1759, a new and very clever plan was devised for turning the difficulty. The first idea of Marshal Belleisle, like that of Napoleon, was to gather the army at Ambleteuse and Boulogne, and to avoid the assemblage of transports by passing it across the Strait by stealth in flat boats. But this idea was abandoned before it had gone very far for something much more subtle. The fallacious advantage of a short passage was dropped, and the army was to start from three widely separated points all in more open waters—a diversionary raid from Dunkirk and two more formidable forces from Havre and the Morbihan in South Brittany. To secure sufficient control there was to be a concentration on the Brest fleet from the Mediterranean and the West Indies. The new feature, it will be observed, was that our covering fleet—that is, the Western Squadron off Brest—would have two cruiser blockades to secure, one on either side of it. Difficult as the situation looked, it was solved on the old lines. The two divisions of the French army at Dunkirk and Morbihan were held by cruiser squadrons capable of following them over the open sea if by chance they escaped, while the third division at Havre, which had nothing but flat boats for transport, was held by a flotilla well supported. Its case was hopeless. It could not move without a squadron to release it, and no fortune of weather could possibly bring a squadron from Brest. Hawke, who had the main blockade, might be blown off, but he could scarcely fail to bring to action any squadron that attempted to enter the Channel. With the Morbihan force it was different. Any time that Hawke was blown off a squadron could reach it from Brest and break the cruiser blockade. The French Government actually ordered a portion of the fleet to make the attempt. Conflans however, who was in command, protested his force was too weak to divide, owing to the failure of the intended concentration. Boscawen had caught and beaten the Mediterranean squadron off Lagos, and though the West Indian squadron got in, it proved, as in Napoleon's great plan of concentration, unfit for further service. The old situation had arisen, forced by the old method of defence; and in the end there was nothing for it but for Conflans to take his whole fleet to the Morbihan transports. Hawke was upon him at once, and the disastrous day of Quiberon was the result. The Dunkirk division alone got free, but the smallness of its size, which permitted it to evade the watch, also prevented its doing any harm. Its escort, after [pg 250] [pg 251] [pg 252] [pg 253] landing its handful of troops in Ireland, was entirely destroyed; and so again the attempt of the French to invade over an uncommanded sea produced no effect but the loss of their fleet. The project of 1779 marked these principles even more strongly, for it demonstrated them working even when our home fleet was greatly inferior to that of the enemy. In this case the invader's idea was to form two expeditionary forces at Cherbourg and Havre, and under cover of an overwhelming combination of the Spanish and French fleets, to unite them at sea and seize Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. It was in the early summer we got wind of the scheme, and two cruiser squadrons and flotillas were at once formed at the Downs and Channel Islands to watch the French coasts and prevent the concentration of transports. Spain had not yet declared war, but she was suspected, and the main fleet, under the veteran Sir Charles Hardy, who had been Norris's second in command in 1744, was ordered to proceed off Brest and prevent any Spanish squadron that might appear from entering that port. The French, however, outmanoeuvred us by putting to sea before Hardy could reach his station and forming a junction with the Spaniards off Finisterre. The combined fleet contained about fifty of the line, nearly double our own. The army of invasion, with Dumouriez for its Chief of the Staff, numbered some 50,000 men, a force we were in no condition to meet ashore. Everything, therefore, was in favour of success, and yet in the navy, at least, a feeling of confidence prevailed that no invasion could take place. The brains of the naval defence were Lord Barham (then Sir Charles Middleton) at the Admiralty and Kempenfelt as Chief of the Staff in the fleet; and it is to their correspondence at this time that we owe some of the most valuable strategical appreciations we possess. The idea of the French was to come into the Channel in their overwhelming force, and while they destroyed or held Hardy, to detach a sufficient squadron to break the cruiser blockade and escort the troops across. Kempenfelt was confident that it could not be done. He was sure that the unwieldy combined mass could be rendered powerless by his comparatively homogeneous and mobile fleet, inferior as it was, so long as he could keep it at sea and to the westward. The appreciation of the power of a nimble inferior fleet which he wrote at this time has already been given.23 When the worst of the position was fully known, and the enemy was reported off the mouth of the Channel, he wrote another to Middleton. His only doubt was whether his fleet had the necessary cohesion and mobility. "We don't seem," he said, "to have considered sufficiently a certain fact that the comparative force of two fleets depends much upon their sailing. The fleet that sails fastest has much the advantage, as they can engage or not as they please, and so have always in their power to choose the favourable opportunity to attack. I think I may safely hazard an opinion that twenty- five sail of the line coppered would be sufficient to harass and tease this great unwieldy combined Armada so as to prevent their effecting anything, hanging continually upon them, ready to catch at any opportunity of a separation from night, gale or fog, to dart upon the separated, to cut off convoys of provisions coming to them, and if they attempted an invasion, to oblige their whole fleet to escort the transports, and even then it would be impossible to protect them entirely from so active and nimble a fleet." Here we have from the pen of one of the greatest masters the real key of the solution—the power, that is, of forcing the mass of the enemy's fleet to escort the transports. Hardy, of course, knew it well from his experience of 1744, and acted accordingly. This case is the more striking, since defence against the threatened invasion was not the whole of the problem he had to solve. It was complicated by instructions that he must also prevent a possible descent on Ireland, and cover the arrival of the great convoys. In reply, on August 1st, he announced his intention of taking station ten to twenty leagues W.S.W. of Scilly, "which I am of opinion," he said, "is the most proper station for the security of the trade expected from the East and West Indies, and for the meeting of the fleets of the enemy should they attempt to come into the Channel." He underlined the last words, indicating, apparently, his belief that they would not venture to do so so long as he could keep his fleet to the westward and undefeated. This at least he did, till a month later he found it necessary to come in for supplies. Then, still avoiding the enemy, he ran not to Plymouth, but right up to St. Helen's. The movement is always regarded as an unworthy retreat, and it caused much dissatisfaction in the fleet at the time. But it is to be observed that his conduct was strictly in accordance with the principle which makes the invading army the primary objective. If Hardy's fleet was no longer fit to keep the sea without replenishment, then the proper place to seek replenishment was on the invader's line of passage. So long as he was there, invasion could not take place till he was defeated. The allies, it was true, were now free to join their transports, but the prospect of such a movement gave the admiral no uneasiness, for it would bring him the chance of serving his enemy as the Spaniards were served in 1588. "I shall do my utmost," he said, "to drive them up the Channel." It is the old principle. If the worst comes to the worst, so long as you are able to force the covering fleet upon the transports, and especially in narrow waters, invasion becomes an operation beyond the endurable risks of war. So it proved. On August 14th Count d'Orvilliers, the allied commander-in-chief, had made the Lizard, and for a fortnight had striven to bring Hardy to decisive action. Until he had done so he dared neither enter the Channel with his fleet nor detach a squadron to break the cruiser blockades at the invasion bases. His ineffectual efforts exhausted his fleet's endurance, which the distant concentration at Finisterre had already severely sapped, and he [pg 254] [pg 255] [pg 256] [pg 257] was forced to return impotent to Brest before anything had been accomplished. The allies were not able to take the sea again that campaign, but even had it been in their power to do so, Hardy and Kempenfelt could have played their defensive game indefinitely, and with ever-increasing chances, as the winter drew near, of dealing a paralysing blow. There was never any real chance of success, though it is true Dumouriez thought otherwise. He believed the enterprise might have gone through if a diversion had been made by the bulk of the fleet against Ireland, and under cover of it a coup de main delivered upon the Isle of Wight, "for which," he said, "six or eight of the line would have been enough." But it is inconceivable that old hands like Hardy and Kempenfelt would have been so easily beguiled of their hold on the line of passage. Had such a division been detached up the Channel from the allied fleet they would surely, according to tradition, have followed it with either a superior force or their whole squadron. The well-known projects of the Great War followed the same course. Under Napoleon's directions they ran the whole gamut of every scheme that ever raised delusive hope before. Beginning from the beginning with the idea of stealing his army across in flat-boats, he was met with the usual flotilla defence. Then came his only new idea, which was to arm his transport flotilla to the point of giving it power to force a passage for itself. We replied by strengthening our flotilla. Convinced by experiment that his scheme was now impracticable, he set his mind on breaking the blockade by the sudden intrusion of a flying squadron from a distance. To this end various plausible schemes were worked out, but plan after plan melted in his hand, till he was forced to face the inevitable necessity of bringing an overwhelming battle force up to his transports. The experience of two centuries had taught him nothing. By a more distant concentration than had ever been attempted before he believed he could break the fatal hold of his enemy. The only result was so severely to exhaust his fleet that it never could get within reach of the real difficulties of its task, a task which every admiral in his service knew to be beyond the strength of the Imperial Navy. Nor did Napoleon even approach a solution of the problem he had set himself— invasion over an uncommanded sea. With our impregnable flotilla hold covered by an automatic concentration of battle-squadrons off Ushant, his army could never even have put forth, unless he had inflicted upon our covering fleet such a defeat as would have given him command of the sea, and with absolute control of the sea the passage of an army presents no difficulties. Of the working of these principles under modern conditions we have no example. The acquisition of free movement must necessarily modify their application, and since the advent of steam there have been only two invasions over uncommanded seas—that of the Crimea in 1854, and that of Manchuria in 1904—and neither of these cases is in point, for in neither was there any attempt at naval defence. Still there seems no reason to believe that such defence applied in the old manner would be less effective than formerly. The flotilla was its basis, and since the introduction of the torpedo the power of the flotilla has greatly increased. Its real and moral effect against transports must certainly be greater than ever, and the power of squadrons to break a flotilla blockade is more restricted. Mines, again, tell almost entirely in favour of defence, so much so indeed as to render a rapid coup de main against any important port almost an impossibility. In the absence of all experience it is to such theoretical considerations we must turn for light. Theoretically stated, the success of our old system of defence depended on four relations. Firstly, there is the relation between the rapidity with which an invasion force could be mobilised and embarked, and the rapidity with which restlessness in foreign ports and places d'armes could be reported; that is to say, the chance of surprise and evasion are as the speed of preparation to the speed of intelligence. Secondly, there is the relation of the speed of convoys to the speed of cruisers and flotilla; that is to say, our ability to get contact with a convoy after it has put to sea and before the expedition can be disembarked is as the speed of our cruisers and flotilla to the speed of the convoy. Thirdly, there is the relation between the destructive power of modern cruisers and flotillas against a convoy unescorted or weakly escorted and the corresponding power in sailing days. Fourthly, there is the relation between the speed of convoys and the speed of battle-squadrons, which is of importance where the enemy's transports are likely to be strongly escorted. On this relation depends the facility with which the battle-squadron covering our mobile defence can secure an interior position from which it may strike either the enemy's battle-squadron if it moves or his convoy before it can complete its passage and effect the landing. All these relations appear to have been modified by modern developments in favour of the defence. In the first ratio, that of speed of mobilisation to speed of intelligence, it is obviously so. Although military mobilisation may be still relatively as rapid as the mobilisation of fleets, yet intelligence has outstripped both. This is true both for gaining and for conveying intelligence. Preparations for oversea invasion were never easy to conceal, owing to [pg 258] [pg 259] the disturbance of the flow of shipping that they caused. Elaborate precautions were taken to prevent commercial leakage of intelligence, but they never entirely succeeded. Yet formerly, in the condition of comparative crudeness with which international trade was then organised, concealment was relatively easy, at least for a time. But the ever-growing sensitiveness of world-wide commerce, when market movements are reported from hour to hour instead of from week to week, has greatly increased the difficulty. And apart from the rapidity with which information may be gathered through this alert and intimate sympathy between Exchanges, there is the still more important fact that with wireless the speed of conveying naval intelligence has increased in a far higher ratio than the speed of sea transit. As regards the ratio between cruiser and convoy speeds, on which evasion so much depends, it is the same. In frigate days the ratio appears to have been not more than seven to five. Now in the case at any rate of large convoys it would be nearly double. Of the destructive power of the flotilla, growing as it does from year to year, enough has been said already. With the advent of the torpedo and submarine it has probably increased tenfold. In a lesser degree the same is true of cruisers. In former days the physical power of a cruiser to injure a dispersing convoy was comparatively low, owing to her relatively low excess of speed and the restricted range and destructive power of her guns. With higher speed and higher energy and range in gun power the ability of cruisers to cut up a convoy renders its practical annihilation almost certain if once it be caught, and consequently affords a moral deterrent against trusting to evasion beyond anything that was known before. The increased ratio of battle-fleet speed to that of large convoys is equally indisputable and no less important, for the facility of finding interior positions which it implies goes to the root of the old system. So long as our battle- fleet is in a position whence it can cover our flotilla blockade or strike the enemy's convoy in transit, it forces his battle-fleet in the last resort to close up on the convoy, and that, as Kempenfelt pointed out, is practically fatal to the success of invasion. From whatever point of view, then, we regard the future chances of successful invasion over an uncommanded sea, it would seem that not only does the old system hold good, but that all modern developments which touch the question bid fair to intensify the results which our sea service at least used so confidently to expect, and which it never failed to secure. II. ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF TRADE The base idea of the attack and defence of trade may be summed up in the old adage, "Where the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together." The most fertile areas always attracted the strongest attack, and therefore required the strongest defence; and between the fertile and the infertile areas it was possible to draw a line which for strategical purposes was definite and constant. The fertile areas were the terminals of departure and destination where trade tends to be crowded, and in a secondary degree the focal points where, owing to the conformation of the land, trade tends to converge. The infertile areas were the great routes which passed through the focal points and connected the terminal areas. Consequently attack on commerce tends to take one of two forms. It may be terminal or it may be pelagic, terminal attack being the more profitable, but demanding the greater force and risk, and pelagic attack being the more uncertain, but involving less force and risk. These considerations lead us directly to the paradox which underlies the unbroken failure of our enemies to exercise decisive pressure upon us by operations against our trade. It is that where attack is most to be feared, there defence is easiest. A plan of war which has the destruction of trade for its primary object implies in the party using it an inferiority at sea. Had he superiority, his object would be to convert that superiority to a working command by battle or blockade. Except, therefore, in the rare cases where the opposed forces are equal, we must assume that the belligerent who makes commerce destruction his primary object will have to deal with a superior fleet. Now, it is true that the difficulty of defending trade lies mainly in the extent of sea it covers. But, on the other hand, the areas in which it tends to congregate, and in which alone it is seriously vulnerable, are few and narrow, and can be easily occupied if we are in superior force. Beyond those areas effective occupation is impossible, but so also is effective attack. Hence the controlling fact of war on commerce, that facility of attack means facility of defence. Beside this fundamental principle we must place another that is scarcely less important. Owing to the general common nature of sea communications, attack and defence of trade are so intimately connected that the one operation is almost indistinguishable from the other. Both ideas are satisfied by occupying the common communications. The strongest form of attack is the occupation of the enemy's terminals, and the establishment of a commercial blockade of the ports they contain. But as this operation usually requires the blockade of an adjacent naval port, it also constitutes, as a rule, a defensive disposition for our own trade, even when the enemy's [pg 260] [pg 261] [pg 262] terminal area does not overlap one of our own. In the occupation of focal areas the two ideas are even more inseparable, since most, if not all, such areas are on lines of communication that are common. It will suffice, therefore, to deal with the general aspect of the subject from the point of view of defence. It was in conformity with the distinction between fertile and infertile areas that our old system of trade defence was developed. Broadly speaking, that system was to hold the terminals in strength, and in important cases the focal points as well. By means of a battle-squadron with a full complement of cruisers they were constituted defended areas, or "tracts" as the old term was, and the trade was regarded as safe when it entered them. The intervening trade-routes were left as a rule undefended. Thus our home terminals were held by two battle- squadrons, the Western Squadron at the mouth of the Channel, and the North Sea or Eastern Squadron with its headquarters usually in the Downs. To these was added a cruiser squadron on the Irish station based at Cork, which was sometimes subordinate to the Western Squadron and sometimes an independent organisation. The area of the Western Squadron in the French wars extended, as we have seen, over the whole Bay of Biscay, with the double function, so far as commerce was concerned, of preventing the issue of raiding squadrons from the enemy's ports, and acting offensively against his Atlantic trade. That of the North Sea squadron extended to the mouth of the Baltic and the north-about passage. Its main function during the great naval coalitions against us was to check the operations of Dutch squadrons or to prevent the intrusion of French ones north-about against our Baltic trade. Like the Western Squadron, it threw out divisions usually located at Yarmouth and Leith for the protection of our coastwise trade from privateers and sporadic cruisers acting from ports within the defended area. Similarly, between the Downs and the Western Squadron was usually one or more smaller squadrons, mainly cruisers, and generally located about Havre and the Channel Islands, which served the same purpose for the Norman and North Breton ports. To complete the system there were flotilla patrols acting under the port admirals and doing their best to police the routes of the coastwise and local traffic, which then had an importance long since lost. The home system of course differed at different times, but it was always on these general lines. The naval defence was supplemented by defended ports of refuge, the principal ones being on the coast of Ireland to shelter the ocean trade, but others in great numbers were provided within the defended areas against the operations of privateers, and the ruins of batteries all round the British shores testify how complete was the organisation. A similar system prevailed in the colonial areas, but there the naval defence consisted normally of cruiser squadrons stiffened with one or two ships-of-the-line mainly for the purpose of carrying the flag. They were only occupied by battle-squadrons when the enemy threatened operations with a similar force. The minor or interior defence against local privateers was to a large extent local; that is, the great part of the flotilla was furnished by sloops built or hired on the spot, as being best adapted for the service. Focal points were not then so numerous as they have become since the development of the Far Eastern trade. The most important of them, the Straits of Gibraltar, was treated as a defended area. From the point of view of commerce-protection it was held by the Mediterranean squadron. By keeping watch on Toulon that squadron covered not only the Straits, but also the focal points within the sea. It too had its extended divisions, sometimes as many as four, one about the approaches to Leghorn, one in the Adriatic, a third at Malta, and the fourth at Gibraltar. In cases of war with Spain the latter was very strong, so as to secure the focal area against Cartagena and Cadiz. On one occasion indeed, in 1804-5, as we have seen, it was constituted for a short time an independent area with a special squadron. But in any case the Gibraltar area had its own internal flotilla guard under the direction of the port admiral as a defence against local privateers and pirates. The general theory of these defended terminal and focal areas, it will be seen, was to hold in force those waters which converging trade made most fertile, and which therefore furnished an adequate field for the operations of raiding squadrons. In spite of the elaborate defensive system, such squadrons might, and sometimes did, intrude by surprise or stealth, and were then able to set at defiance both convoy escorts and the cruiser outposts. But, as experience proved, the system of terminal defence by battle-squadrons made it impossible for such raiding squadrons to remain long enough on the ground to cause any serious interruption or to do serious harm. It was only by a regular fleet of superior strength that the system could be broken down. In other words, the defence could only fall when our means of local control was destroyed by battle. So much for the defended areas. With regard to the great routes that connected them, it has been said they were left undefended. By this is meant that the security of ships passing along them was provided for, not by patrols but by escort. The convoy system was adopted, and the theory of that system is that while vessels are on the great routes they are normally liable only to sporadic attack, and they are consequently collected into fleets and furnished with an escort sufficient to repel sporadic attack. In theory, cruiser escort is sufficient, but in practice it was found convenient and economical to assign the duty in part to ships-of-the-line which were going out to join the distant terminal squadron or returning from it for a refit or some other reason; in other words, the system of foreign reliefs was made to work in with the supplementary escort system. Where no such ships were available [pg 263] [pg 264] [pg 265] and the convoys were of great value, or enemy's ships-of-the-line were known to be out, similar units were specially detailed for convoy duty to go and return, but this use of battle units was exceptional. Such a method of dealing with the great routes is the corollary of the idea of defended areas. As those areas were fertile and likely to attract raiding squadrons, so the great routes were infertile, and no enemy could afford to spend squadrons upon them. It is obvious, however, that the system had its weak side, for the mere fact that a convoy was upon a great route tended to attract a squadron, and the comparative immunity of those routes was lost. The danger was provided for to a great extent by the fact that the enemy's ports from which a squadron could issue were all within defended areas and watched by our own squadrons. Still, the guard could not be made impenetrable. There was always the chance of a squadron escaping, and if it escaped towards a critical trade- route, it must be followed. Hence there were times when the convoy system seriously disturbed our dispositions, as, for instance, in the crisis of the Trafalgar campaign, when for a short time our chain of defended areas was broken down by the escape of the Toulon squadron. That escape eventually forced a close concentration on the Western Squadron, but all other considerations apart, it was felt to be impossible to retain the mass for more than two days owing to the fact that the great East and West Indies convoys were approaching, and Villeneuve's return to Ferrol from Martinique exposed them to squadronal attack. It was, in fact, impossible to tell whether the mass had not been forced upon us with this special end in view. In the liability to deflection of this kind lay the most serious strategical objection to the convoy system. It was sought to minimise it by giving the convoys a secret route when there was apprehension of squadronal interference. It was done in the case just cited, but the precaution seemed in no way to lessen the anxiety. It may have been because in those days of slow communication there could be no such certainty that the secret route had been received as there would be now. Modern developments and changes in shipping and naval material have indeed so profoundly modified the whole conditions of commerce protection, that there is no part of strategy where historical deduction is more difficult or more liable to error. To avoid such error as far as possible, it is essential to keep those developments in mind at every step. The more important of them are three in number. Firstly, the abolition of privateering; secondly, the reduced range of action for all warships; and thirdly, the development of wireless telegraphy. There are others which must be dealt with in their place, but these three go to the root of the whole problem. Difficult as it is to arrive at exact statistics of commerce destruction in the old wars, one thing seems certain— that the bulk of captures, which were reckoned in hundreds and sometimes even in thousands, were due to the action of privateers. Further, it seems certain that, reckoning at least by numbers, the greater part of the damage was done by small privateers operating close to their bases, either home or colonial, against coastwise and local traffic. The complaints of merchants, so far as they are known, relate mainly to this kind of work in the West Indies and home waters, while accounts of serious captures by large privateers on the high seas are comparatively rare. The actual damage done by the swarm of small vessels may not have been great, but its moral effects were very serious. It was impossible for the strongest Governments to ignore them, and the consequence was a chronic disturbance of the larger strategical dispositions. While these dispositions were adequate to check the operations of large privateers acting in the same way as regular cruisers, the smaller ones found very free play amidst the ribwork of the protective system, and they could only be dealt with by filling up the spaces with a swarm of small cruisers to the serious detriment of the larger arrangements. Even so, the proximity of the enemy's ports made escape so easy, that the work of repression was very ineffective. The state of the case was indeed almost identical with a people's war. The ordinary devices of strategy failed to deal with it, as completely as Napoleon's broadly planned methods failed to deal with the guerilleros in Spain, or as our own failed for so long in South Africa. By the abolition of privateering, then, it would seem that the most disturbing part of the problem has been eliminated. It is, of course, uncertain how far the Declaration of Paris will hold good in practice. It is still open even to the parties to it to evade its restrictions to a greater or less extent by taking up and commissioning merchantmen as regular ships of war. But it is unlikely that such methods will extend beyond the larger privately owned vessels. Any attempt to revive in this way the old picaresque methods could only amount to a virtual repudiation of statutory international law, which would bring its own retribution. Moreover, for home waters at least, the conditions which favoured this picaresque warfare no longer exist. In the old wars the bulk of our trade came into the Thames, and thence the greater part of it was distributed in small coasting vessels. It was against this coastwise traffic that the small, short-range privateers found their opportunity and their richest harvest. But, now that so many other great centres of distribution have established themselves, and that the bulk of the distribution is done by internal lines of communication, the Channel is no longer the sole artery, and the old troublesome disturbance can be avoided without a vital dislocation of our commercial system. The probability, then, is that in the future the whole problem will be found to be simplified, and that the work of commerce protection will lie much more within the scope of large strategical treatment than it ever did before, [pg 266] [pg 267] [pg 268] with the result that the change should be found to tell substantially in favour of defence and against attack. The reduction of range of action is scarcely less important. In the old days a cruising ship could be stored for six months, and so long as she could occasionally renew her fuel and water, she was free to range the sea outside the defended areas for the whole of the period with unimpaired vitality. For such pelagic operations her movement was practically unrestricted. She could run for two or three days from a superior enemy or chase for as long without loss of energy, and she could wait indefinitely at a likely spot, or change her ground, as danger or hope of plunder dictated. So long as she had men left to man her prizes, her power of mischief was almost unlimited. All this is now changed. The capacity of each cruise of a ship to-day is very small. She is confined to short dashes within a strategically defended area, or if she is bent on pelagic operations, is compelled to proceed so far to find undefended waters that her coal will scarcely permit of more than a few days' actual cruising. A couple of chases at high speed during that period may force her to return at once, subject only to the precarious possibility of renewing her coal from a prize. She has, further, to face the fact that manning prizes must necessarily reduce her capacity for speed, which depends so much on a fully manned engine-room. This will tend to jeopardise her chances of return through or near defended areas. The only escape from this difficulty is to sink the captured ship. But this course has objections scarcely less weighty than the other. No Power will incur the odium of sinking a prize with all hands, and their removal to the captor's ship takes time, especially in bad weather, and the presence of such prisoners in a cruiser in any number soon becomes a serious check on her fighting power. In the case of large ships, moreover, the work of destruction is no easy matter. In the most favourable circumstances it takes a considerable time, and thus not only eats into the cruiser's endurance, but decreases her chances of evasion. From these and similar considerations it is obvious that the possibilities of operations on the great trade-routes are much less extensive than they were formerly, while to speak of cruisers "infesting" those routes is sheer hyperbole. Under modern conditions it is scarcely more feasible than it would be to keep up a permanent blockade of the British Islands. It would require a flow of ships in such numbers as no country but our own can contemplate possessing, and such as could not be maintained without having first secured a very decided preponderance at sea. The loss of radius of action therefore, though it does not increase the power of defence, sensibly lessens that of attack by pelagic operations. For the great increase in the powers of defence we must turn to the extraordinary development in the means of distant communication. Under former conditions it was possible for a cruising ship to remain for days upon a fertile spot and make a number of captures before her presence was known. But since most large merchantmen have been fitted with wireless installations, she cannot now attack a single one of them without fear of calling down upon her an adversary. Moreover, when she is once located, every ship within wireless reach can be warned of her presence and avoid her. She must widely and constantly shift her position, thereby still further reducing her staying power. On the whole, then, it would appear that in so far as modern developments affect the problem, they certainly render pelagic operations far more difficult and uncertain than they used to be. Upon the great routes the power of attack has been reduced and the means of evasion has increased to such an extent as to demand entire reconsideration of the defence of trade between terminal areas. The whole basis of the old system would seem to be involved. That basis was the convoy system, and it now becomes doubtful whether the additional security which convoys afforded is sufficient to outweigh their economical drawbacks and their liability to cause strategical disturbance. Over and above the considerations already noticed, there are three others, all of which favour the security of our trade by permitting a much more extended choice of route. The first is, that steam vessels are not forced by prevailing winds to keep to particular courses. The second is, that the improvements in the art of navigation no longer render it so necessary to make well-known landfalls during transit. The third is, that the multiplication of our great ports of distribution have divided the old main flow of trade to the Channel into a number of minor streams that cover a much wider area and demand a greater distribution of force for effective attack. It will be obvious that the combined effect of these considerations is to increase still further the chances of individual vessels evading the enemy's cruisers and to lessen the risk of dispensing with escort. Nor are the new practical difficulties of sporadic operations on the great routes the only arguments that minimise the value of convoys. We have also to remember that while the number of vessels trading across the ocean has enormously increased since 1815, it is scarcely possible, even if the abolition of privateering prove abortive, that the number of cruisers available for pelagic attack could exceed, or even equal, the number employed in sailing days. This consideration, then, must also be thrown into the scale against convoys; for it is certain that the amount of serious operative damage which an enemy can do to our trade by pelagic operation is mainly determined by the ratio which his available cruiser strength bears to the volume of that trade. This aspect of the question is, however, part of a much wider one, which concerns the relation which the volume of our trade bears to the difficulty of its defence, and this must be considered later. [pg 269] [pg 270] [pg 271] It remains, first, to deal with the final link in the old system of defence. The statement that the great routes were left undefended will seem to be in opposition to a prevailing impression derived from the fact that frigates are constantly mentioned as being "on a cruise." The assumption is that they in effect patrolled the great routes. But this was not so, nor did they rove the sea at will. They constituted a definite and necessary part of the system. Though that system was founded on a distinction between defended terminals and undefended routes, which was a real strategical distinction, it was impossible to draw an actual line where the one sphere began and the other ended. Outside the regularly defended areas lay a region which, as the routes began to converge, was comparatively fertile. In this region enemies' cruisers and their larger privateers found the mean between risk and profit. Here too convoys, as they entered the zone, were in their greatest danger for fear of their escorts being overpowered by raiding squadrons. Consequently it was the practice, when the approach of convoys was expected, to throw forward from the defended area groups of powerful cruisers, and even battleship divisions, to meet them and reinforce their escorts. Outward-bound convoys had their escorts similarly strengthened till they were clear of the danger zone. The system was in regular use both for home and colonial areas. In no sense did it constitute a patrol of the routes. It was in practice and conception a system of outposts, which at seasons of special risk amounted to an extension of the defended areas combining with a reinforcement of the convoy escorts. Focal points of lesser importance, such as Capes Finisterre and St. Vincent, were similarly held by one or two powerful cruisers, and if necessary by a squadron. As has been already explained, owing to the peculiar conditions of the sea and the common nature of maritime communications, these dispositions were adopted as well for attack as defence, and the fertile areas, for the defence of which a frigate captain was sent "on a cruise," were always liable to bring him rich reward. His mission of defence carried with it the best opportunities for attack. In the full development of the system patrol lines did exist, but not for the great routes. They were established to link up adjacent defended areas and as a more scientific organisation of the cruiser outposts. In 1805 the Gibraltar and the home areas were thus connected by a patrol line which stretched from Cape St. Vincent through the Finisterre focal area to Cape Clear, with a branch extending to the strategical centre off Ushant. The new system was introduced at a time when we had reason to expect that the French and Spanish fleets were to be devoted entirely to operations in small raiding squadrons against our trade and colonies. Special provision was therefore necessary to locate any such squadrons that might elude the regular blockades, and to ensure that they should be adequately pursued. The new lines were in fact intelligence patrols primarily, though they were also regarded as the only means of protecting efficiently the southern trade-route where it was flanked by French and Spanish ports.24 The whole system, it will be observed, though not conflicting with the main object of bringing the enemy's fleets to action, did entail an expenditure of force and deflecting preoccupations such as are unknown in land warfare. Large numbers of cruisers had to be employed otherwise than as the eyes of the battle-squadrons, while the coming and going of convoys produced periodical oscillations in the general distribution. Embarrassing as was this commercial deflection in the old wars, an impression appears to prevail that in the future it must be much more serious. It is argued plausibly enough not only that our trade is far larger and richer than it was, but also that, owing to certain well-known economic changes, it is far more a matter of life and death to the nation than in the days when food and raw material did not constitute the bulk of our imports. In view of the new conditions it is held that we are more vulnerable through our trade now than formerly, and that, consequently, we must devote relatively more attention and force to its defence. If this were true, it is obvious that war with a strong naval combination would present difficulties of the most formidable kind, greater indeed than we have ever experienced; for since with modern developments the demand for fleet cruisers is much greater than formerly, the power of devoting cruisers to trade defence is relatively much less. It cannot be denied that at first sight the conclusion looks irreproachable. But on analysis it will be found to involve two assumptions, both of which are highly questionable. The first is, that the vulnerability of a sea Power through its maritime trade is as the volume of that trade. The second is, that the difficulty of defending sea-borne trade is also as its volume—that is to say, the larger the amount of the trade, the larger must be the force devoted to its protection. This idea indeed is carried so far, that we are frequently invited to fix the standard of our naval strength by comparing it with the proportion which the naval strength of other Powers bears to their sea-borne trade. It is hoped that the foregoing sketch of our traditional system of trade defence will avail to raise a doubt whether either assumption can be accepted without very careful consideration. In the history of that system there is no indication that it was affected by the volume of the trade it was designed to protect. Nor has any one succeeded in [pg 272] [pg 273] [pg 274] showing that the pressure which an enemy could exert upon us through our commerce increased in effect with the volume of our seaborne trade. The broad indications indeed are the other way—that the greater the volume of our trade, the less was the effective impression which an enemy could make upon it, even when he devoted his whole naval energies to that end. It is not too much to say that in every case where he took this course his own trade dwindled to nothing, while ours continually increased. It may be objected that this was because the only periods in which he devoted his main efforts to trade destruction were when we had dominated his navy, and being no longer able to dispute the command, he could do no more than interfere with its exercise. But this must always be so whether we have positively dominated his navy or not. If he tries to ignore our battle-fleets, and devotes himself to operations against trade, he cannot dispute the command. Whatever his strength, he must leave the command to us. He cannot do both systematically, and unless he attacks our trade systematically by sustained strategical operation, he cannot hope to make any real impression. If, now, we take the two assumptions and test them by the application of elementary principles, both will appear theoretically unsound. Let us take first the relation of vulnerability to volume. Since the object of war is to force our will upon the enemy, the only way in which we can expect war on commerce to serve our end is to inflict so much damage upon it as will cause our enemy to prefer peace on our terms to a continuation of the struggle. The pressure on his trade must be insupportable, not merely annoying. It must seriously cripple his finance or seriously threaten to strangle his national life and activities. If his total trade be a hundred millions, and we succeed in destroying five, he will feel it no more than he does the ordinary fluctuations to which he is accustomed in time of peace. If, however, we can destroy fifty millions, his trade equilibrium will be overthrown, and the issue of the war will be powerfully affected. In other words, to affect the issue the impression made on trade must be a percentage or relative impression. The measure of a nation's vulnerability through its trade is the percentage of destruction that an enemy can effect. Now, it is true that the amount of damage which a belligerent can inflict with a given force on an enemy's commerce will vary to some extent with its volume; for the greater the volume of commerce, the more fertile will be the undefended cruising grounds. But no matter how fertile such areas might be, the destructive power of a cruiser was always limited, and it must be still more limited in the future. It was limited by the fact that it was physically impossible to deal with more than a certain number of prizes in a certain time, and, for the reasons already indicated, this limit has suffered a very marked restriction. When this limit of capacity in a given force is passed, the volume of commerce will not affect the issue; and seeing how low that capacity must be in the future and how enormous is the volume of our trade, the limit of destructive power, at least as against ourselves, provided we have a reasonably well-organised system of defence, must be relatively low. It must, in fact, be passed at a percentage figure well within what we have easily supported in the past. There is reason, therefore, to believe that so far from the assumption in question being true, the effective vulnerability of sea-borne trade is not in direct but in inverse proportion to its volume. In other words, the greater the volume, the more difficult it is to make an effective percentage impression. Similarly, it will be observed that the strain of trade defence was proportioned not to the volume of that trade, but to the number and exposure of its terminals and focal points. Whatever the volume of the trade these remained the same in number, and the amount of force required for their defence varied only with the strength that could readily be brought to bear against them. It varied, that is, with the distribution of the enemy's bases and the amount of his naval force. Thus in the war of 1812 with the United States, the West Indian and North American areas were much more exposed than they had been when we were at war with France alone and when American ports were not open to her as bases. They became vulnerable not only to the United States fleet, but also in a much higher degree to that of France, and consequently the force we found necessary to devote to trade defence in the North Atlantic was out of all proportion to the naval strength of the new belligerent. Our protective force had to be increased enormously, while the volume of our trade remained precisely the same. This relation of trade defence to terminal and focal areas is of great importance, for it is in the increase of such areas in the Far East that lies the only radical change in the problem. The East Indian seas were always of course to some extent treated as a defended area, but the problem was simplified by the partial survival in those regions of the old method of defence. Till about the end of the seventeenth century long-range trade was expected to defend itself, at least outside the home area, and the retention of their armament by East Indiamen was the last survival of the practice. Beyond the important focal area of St. Helena they relied mainly on their own power of resistance or to such escort as could be provided by the relief ships of the East Indian station. As a rule, their escort proper went no farther outward-bound than St. Helena, whence it returned with the homeward-bound vessels that gathered there from India, China, and the South Sea whaling grounds. The idea of the system was to provide escort for that part of the great route which was exposed to attack from French or Spanish colonial bases on the African coasts and in the adjacent islands. [pg 275] [pg 276] [pg 277] For obvious reasons this system would have to be reconsidered in the future. The expansion of the great European Powers have changed the conditions for which it sufficed, and in a war with any one of them the system of defended terminal and focal areas would require a great extension eastward, absorbing an appreciable section of our force, and entailing a comparatively weak prolongation of our chain of concentrations. Here, then, we must mark a point where trade defence has increased in difficulty, and there is one other. Although minor hostile bases within a defended area have lost most of their menace to trade, they have acquired as torpedo bases a power of disturbing the defence itself. So long as such bases exist with a potent flotilla within them, it is obvious that the actual provision for defence cannot be so simple a matter as it was formerly. Other and more complex arrangements may have to be made. Still, the principle of defended areas seems to remain unshaken, and if it is to work with its old effectiveness, the means and the disposition for securing those areas will have to be adapted to the new tactical possibilities. The old strategical conditions, so far as can be seen, are unaltered except in so far as the reactions of modern material make them tell in favour of defence rather than of attack. If we desire to formulate the principles on which this conclusion rests we shall find them in the two broad rules, firstly, that the vulnerability of trade is in inverse ratio to its volume, and secondly, that facility of attack means facility of defence. The latter, which was always true, receives special emphasis from modern developments. Facility of attack means the power of exercising control. For exercise of control we require not only numbers, but also speed and endurance, qualities which can only be obtained in two ways: it must be at the cost of armour and armament, or at the cost of increased size. By increasing size we at once lose numbers. If by sacrificing armament and armour we seek to maintain numbers and so facilitate attack, we at the same time facilitate defence. Vessels of low fighting power indeed cannot hope to operate in fertile areas without support to overpower the defence. Every powerful unit detached for such support sets free a unit on the other side, and when this process is once begun, there is no halting-place. Supporting units to be effective must multiply into squadrons, and sooner or later the inferior Power seeking to substitute commerce destruction for the clash of squadrons will have squadronal warfare thrust upon him, provided again the superior Power adopts a reasonably sound system of defence. It was always so, and, so far as it is possible to penetrate the mists which veil the future, it would seem that with higher mobility and better means of communication the squadronal stage must be reached long before any adequate percentage impression can have been made by the sporadic action of commerce destroyers. Ineffectual as such warfare has always been in the past, until a general command has been established, its prospects in the future, judged by the old established principles, are less promising than ever. Finally, in approaching the problem of trade protection, and especially for the actual determination of the force and distribution it requires, there is a dominant limitation to be kept in mind. By no conceivable means is it possible to give trade absolute protection. We cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs. We cannot make war without losing ships. To aim at a standard of naval strength or a strategical distribution which would make our trade absolutely invulnerable is to march to economic ruin. It is to cripple our power of sustaining war to a successful issue, and to seek a position of maritime despotism which, even if it were attainable, would set every man's hand against us. All these evils would be upon us, and our goal would still be in the far distance. In 1870 the second naval Power in the world was at war with an enemy that could not be considered a naval Power at all, and yet she lost ships by capture. Never in the days of our most complete domination upon the seas was our trade invulnerable, and it never can be. To seek invulnerability is to fall into the strategical vice of trying to be superior everywhere, to forfeit the attainment of the essential for fear of risking the unessential, to base our plans on an assumption that war may be waged without loss, that it is, in short, something that it never has been and never can be. Such peace-bred dreams must be rigorously abjured. Our standard must be the mean of economic strength —the line which on the one hand will permit us to nourish our financial resources for the evil day, and on the other, when that day comes, will deny to the enemy the possibility of choking our financial vigour by sufficiently checking the flow of our trade. III. ATTACK, DEFENCE, AND SUPPORT OF MILITARY EXPEDITIONS The attack and defence of oversea expeditions are governed in a large measure by the principles of attack and defence of trade. In both cases it is a question of control of communications, and in a general way it may be said, if we control them for the one purpose, we control them for the other. But with combined expeditions freedom of passage is not the only consideration. The duties of the fleet do not end with the protection of the troops during transit, as in the case of convoys, unless indeed, as with convoys, the destination is a friendly country. In the normal case of a hostile destination, where resistance is to be expected from the commencement of the operations, the fleet is charged with further duties of a most exacting kind. They may be described generally as [pg 278] [pg 279] [pg 280] duties of support, and it is the intrusion of these duties which distinguish the naval arrangements for combined operations most sharply from those for the protection of trade. Except for this consideration there need be no difference in the method of defence. In each case the strength required would be measured by the dangers of interference in transit. But as it is, that standard will not serve for combined expeditions; for however small those risks, the protective arrangements must be sufficiently extensive to include arrangements for support. Before dealing with this, the most complex aspect of the question, it will be well to dismiss attack. From the strategical point of view its principles differ not at all from those already laid down for active resistance of invasion. Whether the expedition that threatens us be small or of invasion strength, the cardinal rule has always been that the transports and not the escort must be the primary objective of the fleet. The escort, according to the old practice, must be turned or contained, but never treated as a primary objective unless both turning and containing prove to be impracticable. It is needless to repeat the words of the old masters in which this principle lies embalmed. It is seldom that we find a rule of naval strategy laid down in precise technical terms, but this one is an exception. In the old squadronal instructions, "The transports of the enemy are to be your principal object," became something like a common form. Nor did this rule apply only to cases where the transports were protected by a mere escort. It held good even in the exceptional cases where the military force was accompanied or guarded by the whole available battle strength of the enemy. We have seen how in 1744 Norris was prepared to follow the French transports if necessary with his whole force, and how in 1798 Nelson organised his fleet in such a way as to contain rather than destroy the enemy's battle-squadron, so that he might provide for an overwhelming attack upon the transports. Exceptions to this as to all strategical rules may be conceived. Conditions might exist in which, if the enemy's battle-fleet accompanied his transports, it would be worth our while, for ulterior objects of our own, to risk the escape of the transports in order to seize the opportunity of destroying the fleet. But even in such a case the distinction would be little more than academical; for our best chance of securing a decisive tactical advantage against the enemy's fleet would usually be to compel it to conform to our movements by threatening an attack on the transports. It is well known that it is in the embarrassment arising from the presence of transports that lies the special weakness of a fleet in charge of them. There is, however, one condition which radically differentiates comparatively small expeditions from great invasions and that is the power of evasion. Our experience has proved beyond dispute that the navy alone cannot guarantee defence against such expeditions. It cannot be sure of preventing their sailing or of attacking them in transit, and this is especially the case where an open sea gives them a free choice of route, as in the case of the French expeditions against Ireland. It is for this reason that, although an adequate navy has always proved sufficient to prevent an invasion, for defence against expeditions it must be supplemented by a home army. To perfect our defence, or, in other words, our power of attack, such an army must be adequate to ensure that all expeditions small enough to evade the fleet shall do no effective harm when they land. If in numbers, training, organisation, and distribution it is adequate for this purpose, an enemy cannot hope to affect the issue of the war except by raising his expeditions to invasion strength, and so finding himself involved in a problem that no one has ever yet solved for an uncommanded sea. Still, even for expeditions below invasion strength the navy will only regard the army as a second line, and its strategy must provide in the event of evasion for co-operation with that line. By means of a just distribution of its coastal flotilla it will provide for getting contact with the expedition at the earliest moment after its destination is declared. It will press the principle of making the army its objective to the utmost limit by the most powerful and energetic cruiser pursuit, and with wireless and the increased ratio of cruiser speed, such pursuit is far more formidable than it ever was. No expedition nowadays, however successful its evasion, can be guaranteed against naval interruption in the process of landing. Still less can it be guaranteed against naval interference in its rear or flanks while it is securing its front against the home army. It may seek by using large transports to reduce their number and secure higher speed, but while that will raise its chance of evasion, it will prolong the critical period of landing. If it seek by using smaller transports to quicken disembarkation, that will decrease its chances of evasion by lowering its speed and widening the sea area it will occupy in transit. All the modern developments in fact which make for defence in case of invasion over an uncommanded sea also go to facilitate timely contact with an expedition seeking to operate by evasion. Nor must it be forgotten, since the problem is a combined one, that the corresponding developments ashore tell with little less force in favour of the defending army. Such appear to be the broad principles which govern an enemy's attempts to act with combined expeditions in our own waters, where by hypothesis we are in sufficient naval strength to deny him permanent local command. We may now turn to the larger and more complex question of the conduct of such expeditions where the naval conditions are reversed. [pg 281] [pg 282] [pg 283] By the conduct, be it remembered, we mean not only their defence but also their support, and for this reason the starting-point of our inquiry is to be found, as above indicated, in the contrast of combined expeditions with convoys. A convoy consists of two elements—a fleet of merchantmen and an escort. But a combined expedition does not consist simply of an army and a squadron. It is an organism at once more complex and more homogeneous. Its constitution is fourfold. There is, firstly, the army; secondly, the transports and landing flotilla —that is, the flotilla of flat-boats and steamboats for towing them, all of which may be carried in the transports or accompany them; thirdly, the "Squadron in charge of transports," as it came to be called, which includes the escort proper and the supporting flotilla of lighter craft for inshore work; and lastly, the "Covering squadron." Such at least is a combined expedition in logical analysis. But so essentially is it a single organism, that in practice these various elements can seldom be kept sharply distinct. They may be interwoven in the most intricate manner. Indeed to a greater or less extent each will always have to discharge some of the functions of the others. Thus the covering squadron may not only be indistinguishable from the escort and support, but it will often provide the greater part of the landing flotilla and even a portion of the landing force. Similarly, the escort may also serve as transport, and provide in part not only the supporting force, but also the landing flotilla. The fourfold constitution is therefore in a great measure theoretical. Still its use is not merely that it serves to define the varied functions which the fleet will have to discharge. As we proceed it will be seen to have a practical strategical value. From a naval point of view it is the covering squadron which calls first for consideration, because of the emphasis with which its necessity marks not only the distinction between the conduct of combined expeditions and the conduct of commercial convoys, but also the fact that such expeditions are actually a combined force, and not merely an army escorted by a fleet. In our system of commerce protection the covering squadron had no place. The battle-fleet, as we have seen, was employed in holding definite terminal areas, and had no organic connection with the convoys. The convoys had no further protection than their own escort and the reinforcements that met them as they approached the terminal areas. But where a convoy of transports forming part of a combined expedition was destined for an enemy's country and would have to overcome resistance by true combined operations, a covering battle-squadron was always provided. In the case of distant objectives it might be that the covering squadron was not attached till the whole expedition assembled in the theatre of operations; during transit to that theatre the transports might have commerce protection escort only. But once the operations began from the point of concentration, a covering squadron was always in touch. It was only where the destination of the troops was a friendly country, and the line of passage was well protected by our permanent blockades, that a covering squadron could be dispensed with altogether. Thus our various expeditions for the assistance of Portugal were treated exactly like commercial convoys, but in such cases as Wolfe's expedition to Quebec or Amherst's to Louisburg, or indeed any of those which were continually launched against the West Indies, a battle-squadron was always provided as an integral part in the theatre of operations. Our arrangements in the Crimean War illustrate the point exactly. Our troops were sent out at first to land at Gallipoli in a friendly territory, and to act within that territory as an army of observation. It was not a true combined expedition, and the transports were given no covering squadron. Their passage was sufficiently covered by our Channel and Mediterranean fleets occupying the exits of the Baltic and the Black Sea. But so soon as the original war plan proved ineffective and combined offensive operations against Sebastopol were decided on, the Mediterranean fleet lost its independent character, and thenceforth its paramount function was to furnish a covering squadron in touch with the troops. Seeing how important are the support duties of such a force, the term "Covering squadron" may seem ill-chosen to describe it. But it is adopted for two reasons. In the first place, it was the one employed officially in our service on the last mentioned occasion which was our last great combined expedition. In preparing the descent on the Crimea, Sir Edmund Lyons, who was acting as Chief of the Staff to Sir James Dundas, and had charge of the combined operations, organised the fleet into a "Covering squadron" and a "Squadron in charge of transports." In the second place, the designation serves to emphasise what is its main and primary function. For important as it is to keep in mind its support duties, they must not be permitted to overshadow the fact that its paramount function is to prevent interference with the actual combined operations—that is, the landing, support, and supply of the army. Thus in 1705, when Shovel and Peterborough were operating against Barcelona, Shovel was covering the amphibious siege from the French squadron in Toulon. Peterborough required the assistance of the marines ashore to execute a coup de main, and Shovel only consented to land them on the express understanding that the moment his cruisers passed the signal that the Toulon squadron was putting to sea, they would have to be recalled to the fleet no matter what the state of the land operations. And to this Peterborough agreed. The principle involved, it will be seen, is precisely that which Lyons's term "Covering squadron" embodies. [pg 284] [pg 285] [pg 286] To quote anything that happened in the Crimean War as a precedent without such traditional support will scarcely appear convincing. In our British way we have fostered a legend that so far as organisation and staff work were concerned that war was nothing but a collection of deterrent examples. But in truth as a combined operation its opening movement both in conception and organisation was perhaps the most daring, brilliant, and successful thing of the kind we ever did. Designed as the expedition was to assist an ally in his own country, it was suddenly called upon without any previous preparation to undertake a combined operation of the most difficult kind against the territory of a well-warned enemy. It involved a landing late in the year on an open and stormy coast within striking distance of a naval fortress which contained an army of unknown strength, and a fleet not much inferior in battle power and undefeated. It was an operation comparable to the capture of Louisburg and the landing of the Japanese in the Liaotung Peninsula, but the conditions were far more difficult. Both those operations had been rehearsed a few years previously, and they had been long prepared on the fullest knowledge. In the Crimea everything was in the dark; even steam was an unproved element, and everything had to be improvised. The French had practically to demobilise their fleet to supply transport, and so hazardous did the enterprise appear, that they resisted its being undertaken with every military argument. We had in fact, besides all the other difficulties, to carry an unwilling ally upon our backs. Yet it was accomplished, and so far at least as the naval part was concerned, the methods which achieved success mark the culmination of all we had learnt in three centuries of rich experience. The first of the lessons was that for operations in uncommanded or imperfectly commanded seas there was need of a covering squadron differentiated from the squadron in charge of transports. Its main function was to secure the necessary local command, whether for transit or for the actual operations. But as a rule transit was secured by our regular blockading squadrons, and generally the covering squadron only assembled in the theatre of operations. When therefore the theatre was within a defended terminal area, as in our descents upon the northern and Atlantic coasts of France, then the terminal defence squadron was usually also sufficient to protect the actual operations. It thus formed automatically the covering squadron, and either continued its blockade, or, as in the case of our attack on St. Malo in 1758, took up a position between the enemy's squadron and the expedition's line of operation. If, however, the theatre of operation was not within a terminal area, or lay within a distant one that was weakly held, the expedition was given its own covering squadron, in which the local squadron was more or less completely merged. Whatever, in fact, was necessary to secure the local control was done, though, as we have seen, and must presently consider more fully, this necessity was not always the standard by which the strength of the covering squadron was measured. The strength of the covering squadron being determined, the next question is the position or "tract" which it should occupy. Like most other strategical problems, it is "an option of difficulties." In so far as the squadron is designed for support—that is, support from its men, boats, and guns—it will be desirable to station it as near as possible to the objective; but as a covering squadron, with the duty of preventing the intrusion of an enemy's force, it should be as far away as possible, so as to engage such a force at the earliest possible moment of its attempt to interfere. There is also the paramount necessity that its position must be such that favourable contact with the enemy is certain if he tries to interrupt. Usually such certainty is only to be found either in touch with the enemy's naval base or in touch with your own landing force. Where the objective is the local naval base of the enemy these two points, of course, tend to be identical strategically, and the position of the covering squadron becomes a tactical rather than a strategical question. But the vital principle of an independent existence holds good, and no matter how great the necessity of support, the covering squadron should never be so deeply engaged with the landing force as to be unable to disentangle itself for action as a purely naval unit in time to discharge its naval function. In other words, it must always be able to act in the same way as a free field army covering a siege. Where the objective of the expedition is not the local naval base, the choice of a position for the covering squadron will turn mainly on the amount of support which the army is likely to require. If it cannot act by surprise, and serious military resistance is consequently to be expected, or where the coast defences are too strong for the transport squadron to overpower, then the scale will incline to a position close to the army, though the extent to which, under modern conditions, ships at sea can usefully perform the delicate operation of supporting an infantry attack with gun fire, except by enfilading the enemy's position, remains to be proved. A similar choice will be indicated where strong support of men and boats is required, as when a sufficiency of flat-boats and steam towage cannot be provided by the transports and their attendant squadron; or again where the locality is such that amphibious operations beyond the actual landing are likely to be called for, and the assistance of a large number of boats and seamen acting with the army is necessary to give it the amphibious tactical mobility which it would otherwise lack. Such cases occurred at Quebec in 1759, where Saunders took his covering battle-squadron right up the St. Lawrence, although its covering functions could have been discharged even better by a position several hundreds of miles away from the objective; and again in 1800 at Alexandria, where Lord Keith ran the extremest hazard to his covering functions in order to undertake the supply of General Abercromby's army by inland waters and give him the mobility he required. [pg 287] [pg 288] [pg 289] [pg 290] If, on the other hand, the transport squadron is able to furnish all the support necessary, the covering squadron will take station as close as possible to the enemy's naval base, and there it will operate according to the ordinary laws of blockade. If nothing is desired but to prevent interference, its guard will take the form of a close blockade. But if there be a subsidiary purpose of using the expedition as a means of forcing the enemy to sea, the open form will be employed; as, for instance, in Anson's case above cited, when he covered the St. Malo expedition not by closely blockading Brest, but by taking a position to the eastward at the Isle de Batz. In the Japanese operations against Manchuria and the Kuantung Peninsula these old principles displayed themselves in undiminished vitality. In the surprise descents against Seoul and at Takusan the work of support was left entirely with the transport squadron, while Admiral Togo took up a covering position far away at Port Arthur. The two elements of the fleet were kept separate all through. But in the operations for the isolation and subsequent siege of Port Arthur they were so closely united as to appear frequently indistinguishable. Still, so far as the closeness of the landing place to the objective permitted, the two acted independently. For the actual landing of the Second Army the boats of the covering squadron were used, but it remained a live naval unit all through, and was never organically mingled with the transport squadron. Its operations throughout were, so far as modern conditions permit, on the lines of a close blockade. To prevent interference was its paramount function, undisturbed, so far as we are able to judge, by any subsidiary purpose of bringing the enemy to decisive action. All through the operations, however, there was a new influence which tended to confuse the precision of the old methods. Needless to say it was the torpedo and the mine. Their deflective pressure was curious and interesting. In our own operations against Sebastopol, to which the Port Arthur case is most closely comparable, the old rules still held good. On the traditional principle, dating from Drake's attack on San Domingo in 1585, a landing place was chosen which gave the mean between facility for a coup de main and freedom from opposition; that is, it was chosen at the nearest practicable point to the objective which was undefended by batteries and out of reach of the enemy's main army. In the handling of the covering squadron Admiral Dundas, the Commander-in-Chief, gave it its dual function. After explaining the constitution of the transport squadron he says, "The remainder of my force ... will act as a covering squadron, and where practicable assist in the general disembarkation." With these two objects in mind he took a station near enough to the landing place to support the army with his guns if it were opposed, but still in sight of his cruisers before Sebastopol, and at such a distance that at the first sign of the Russians moving he would have time to get before the port and engage them before they could get well to sea; that is, he took a position as near to the army as was compatible with preventing interference, or, it may be said, his position was as near to the enemy's base as was compatible with supporting the landing. From either aspect in fact the position was the same, and its choice presented no complexity owing mainly to the fact that for the first time steam simplified the factors of time and distance. In the Japanese case the application of these principles was not so easy. In selecting the nearest undefended point for a landing, it was not only batteries, or even the army in Port Arthur, or the troops dispersed in the Liaotung Peninsula that had to be considered, but rather, as must always be the case in the future, mines and mobile torpedo defence. The point they chose was the nearest practicable bay that was unmined. It was not strictly out of mobile defence range, but it so happened that it lay behind islands which lent themselves to the creation of fixed defences, and thus it fulfilled all the recognised conditions. But in so far as the defences could be turned by the Russian fleet a covering squadron was necessary, and the difficulty of choosing a position for it was complicated by the fact that the objective of the combined operations was not merely Port Arthur itself, but also the squadron it contained. It was necessary, therefore, not only to hold off that squadron, but to prevent its escape. This indicated a close blockade. But for close blockade a position out of night torpedo range is necessary, and the nearest point where such a position could be secured was behind the defences that covered the disembarkation. Consequently, in spite of what the strategical conditions dictated, the covering squadron was more or less continuously forced back upon the army and its supporting force, even when the support of the battle-squadron was no longer required. In the conditions that existed nothing was lost. For the lines of the Japanese fixed defences were so near to the enemy's base, that by mining the entrance of the port Admiral Togo ensured that the enemy's exit would be slow enough for him to be certain of getting contact from his defended anchorage before the Russians could get far to sea. What would happen in a case when no such position could be secured is another matter. The landing place and supply base of the army must be secured against torpedo attack, and the principle of concentration of effort would suggest that the means of defence should not be attenuated by providing the covering squadron with a defended anchorage elsewhere. Thus it would appear that unless the geographical conditions permit the covering squadron to use one of its own national bases, the drift of recent developments will be to force it back on the army, and thus tend to confuse its duties with those of the transport squadron. Hence the increased importance of keeping clear the difference in function between the two squadrons. [pg 291] [pg 292] [pg 293] To emphasise the principle of the covering squadron, these two cases may be contrasted with the Lissa episode at the end of the Austro-Italian War of 1866. In that case it was entirely neglected, with disastrous results. The Austrian admiral, Tegethoff, with an inferior fleet had by higher order been acting throughout on the defensive, and was still in Pola waiting for a chance of a counter-stroke. Persano with the superior Italian fleet was at Ancona, where he practically dominated the Adriatic. In July the Italians, owing to the failure of the army, were confronted with the prospect of being forced to make peace on unfavourable terms. To improve the position Persano was ordered to take possession of the Austrian island of Lissa. Without any attempt to organise his fleet on the orthodox British principle he proceeded to conduct the operation with his entire force. Practically the whole of it became involved in amphibious work, and as soon as Persano was thus committed, Tegethoff put to sea and surprised him. Persano was unable to disentangle a sufficient force in time to meet the attack, and having no compact squadron fit for independent naval action, he was decisively defeated by the inferior enemy. According to British practice, it was clearly a case where, if the operation were to be undertaken at all, an independent covering squadron should have been told off either to hold Tegethoff in Pola or to bring him to timely action, according to whether the island or the Austrian fleet was the primary objective. The reason it was not done may be that Persano was not given a proper landing force, and he seems to have considered that the whole strength of his fleet was needed for the successful seizure of the objective. If so, it is only one more proof of the rule that no matter what fleet support the landing operations may require, it should never be given in an imperfectly commanded sea to an extent which will deny the possibility of a covering squadron being left free for independent naval action. The length to which the supporting functions of the fleet may be carried will always be a delicate question. The suggestion that its strength must be affected by the need of the army for the men of the fleet or its boats, which imply its men as well, will appear heretical. A battle-squadron, we say, is intended to deal with the enemy's battle- squadron and its men to fight the ships, and the mind revolts at the idea of the strength of a squadron being fixed by any other standard. Theoretically nothing can seem more true, but it is an idea of peace and the study. The atmosphere of war engendered a wider and more practical view. The men of the old wars knew that when a squadron is attached to a combined expedition it is something different from a purely naval unit. They knew, moreover, that an army acting oversea against hostile territory is an incomplete organism incapable of striking its blow in the most effective manner without the assistance of the men of the fleet. It was the office, then, of the naval portion of the force not only to defend the striking part of the organism, but to complete its deficiencies and lend it the power to strike. Alone and unaided the army cannot depend on getting itself ashore, it cannot supply itself, it cannot secure its retreat, nor can it avail itself of the highest advantages of an amphibious force, the sudden shift of base or line of operation. These things the fleet must do for it, and it must do them with its men.25 The authority for this view is abundant. In 1800, for instance, when General Maitland was charged with an expedition against Belleisle, he was invited to state what naval force he would require. He found it difficult to fix with precision. "Speaking loosely, however," he wrote, "three or four sail of the line and four or five active frigates appear to me to be properly adequate to the proposed service. The frigates to blockade." (Meaning, of course, to blockade the objective and prevent reinforcements reaching it from the mainland, always one of the supporting functions of the squadron attached to the transports.) "The line-of-battle ships," he adds, "to furnish us with the number of men necessary for land operations." In this case our permanent blockading squadrons supplied the cover, and what Maitland meant was that the battleships he asked for were to be added to the transport squadron not as being required for escort, but for support. St. Vincent, who was then First Lord, not only endorsed his request, but gave him for disembarkation work one more ship-of-the-line than he had asked for. At this time our general command of the sea had been very fully secured, and we had plenty of naval force to spare for its exercise. It will be well to compare it with a case in which the circumstances were different. When in 1795 the expedition under Admiral Christian and General Abercromby was being prepared for the West Indies, the admiral in concert with Jervis drew up a memorandum as to the naval force required.26 The force he asked for was considerable. Both he and Jervis considered that the escort and local cover must be very strong, because it was impossible to count on closing either Brest or Toulon effectually by blockade. But this was not the only reason. The plan of operations involved three distinct landings, and each would require at least two of the line, and perhaps three, "not only as protection, but as the means by which flat-boats must be manned, cannon landed, and the other necessary services of fatigue executed." Christian also required the necessary frigates and three or four brigs "to cover [that is, support] the operations of the smaller vessels [that is, the landing flotillas doing inshore work]." The main attack would require at least four of the line and seven frigates, with brigs and schooners in proportion. In all he considered, the ships-of-the-line [the frigates being "otherwise employed"] would have to provide landing parties to the number of 2000 men "for the flat-boats, landing and moving guns, water, and provisions," and this would be their daily task. The military force these landing parties were to serve amounted to about 18,000 men. [pg 294] [pg 295] [pg 296] [pg 297] Lord Barham, it must be said, who as Sir Charles Middleton was then First Sea Lord, objected to the requirements as excessive, particularly in the demand for a strong escort, as he considered that the transit could be safeguarded by special vigilance on the part of the permanent blockading squadrons. The need for large shore parties he seems to have ignored. His opinion, however, is not quite convincing, for from the first he had taken up an antagonistic attitude to the whole idea of the expedition. He regarded the policy which dictated it as radically unsound, and was naturally anxious to restrict the force that was to be spent upon it. His opposition was based on the broad and far-sighted principles that were characteristic of his strategy. He believed that in view of the threatening attitude of Spain the right course was to husband the navy so as to bring it up to a two-Power standard for the coming struggle, and to keep it concentrated for decisive naval action the moment Spain showed her hand. In short, he stoutly condemned a policy which entailed a serious dissipation of naval force for a secondary object before a working command of the sea had been secured. It was, in fact, the arrangements for this expedition which forced him to resign before the preparations were complete. But it is to be observed that his objections to the plan were really due, not to the principle of its organisation, but to our having insufficient force to give it adequate naval support without prejudicing the higher consideration of our whole position at sea.27 It is obvious that the foregoing considerations, beyond the strategical reactions already noted, will have another of the first importance, in that they must influence the choice of a landing place. The interest of the army will always be to fix it as near to the objective as is compatible with an unopposed landing. The ideal was one night's march, but this could rarely be attained except in the case of very small expeditions, which could be landed rapidly at the close of day and advance in the dark. In larger expeditions, the aim was to effect the landing far enough from the objective to prevent the garrison of the place or the enemy's local forces offering opposition before a footing was secured. The tendency of the navy will usually be in the opposite direction; for normally the further they can land the army away from the enemy's strength, the surer are they of being able to protect it against naval interference. Their ideal will be a place far enough away to be out of torpedo range, and to enable them to work the covering and the transport squadron in sound strategical independence. To reduce these divergencies to a mean of efficiency some kind of joint Staff is necessary, and to ensure its smooth working it is no less desirable to ascertain, so far as possible, the principles and method on which it should proceed. In the best recent precedents the process has been for the Army Staff to present the limits of coast-line within which the landing must take place for the operation to have the desired effect, and to indicate the known practicable landing points in the order they would prefer them. It will then be for the Naval Staff to say how nearly in accordance with the views of the army they are prepared to act. Their decision will turn on the difficulties of protection and the essentials of a landing place from the point of view of weather, currents, beach and the like, and also in a secondary measure upon the extent to which the conformation of the coast will permit of tactical support by gun-fire and feints. If the Naval Staff are unwilling to agree to the point or points their colleagues most desire, a question of balance of risk is set up, which the higher Joint Staff must adjust. It will be the duty of the Naval Staff to set out frankly and clearly all the sea risks the proposal of the army entails, and if possible to suggest an alternative by which the risk of naval interference can be lessened without laying too heavy a burden on the army. Balancing these risks against those stated by the army, the superior Staff must decide which line is to be taken, and each service then will do its best to minimise the difficulties it has to face. Whether the superior Staff will incline to the naval or the military view will depend upon whether the greater danger likely to be incurred is from the sea or on land. Where the naval conditions are fairly well known the line of operations can be fixed in this way with much precision. But if, as usually happens, the probable action of the enemy at sea cannot be divined with sufficient approximation, then assuming there is serious possibility of naval interference, the final choice within the limited area must be left to the admiral. The practice has been to give him instructions which define in order of merit the points the army desire, and direct him to select the one which in the circumstances, as he finds them, he considers within reasonable risk of war. Similarly, if the danger of naval interference be small and the local conditions ashore imperfectly known, the final choice will be with the general, subject only to the practicable possibilities of the landing place he would choose. During the best period of our old wars there was seldom any difficulty in making things work smoothly on these lines. After the first inglorious failure at Rochefort in 1757 the practice was, where discretion of this kind had been allowed, for the two commanders-in-chief to make a joint coast-reconnaissance in the same boat and settle the matter amicably on the spot. It was on these lines the conduct of our combined operations was always arranged thenceforth. Since the elder Pitt's time it has never been our practice to place combined expeditions under either a naval or a military commander-in-chief and allow him to decide between naval and military exigencies. The danger of possible [pg 298] [pg 299] [pg 300] friction between two commanders-in-chief came to be regarded as small compared with the danger of a single one making mistakes through unfamiliarity with the limitations of the service to which he does not belong. The system has usually worked well even when questions arose which were essentially questions for a joint superior Staff. The exceptions indeed are very few. A fine example of how such difficulties can be settled, when the spirit is willing, occurred in the Crimea. The naval difficulties, as we have already seen, were as formidable as they could well be short of rendering the whole attempt madness. When it came to the point of execution a joint council of war was held, at which sat the allied Staffs of both services. So great were the differences of opinion between the French and British Generals, and so imperfectly was the terrain known, that they could not indicate a landing place with any precision. All the admirals knew was that it must be on an open coast, which they had not been able to reconnoitre, where the weather might at any time interrupt communications with the shore, and where they were liable to be attacked by a force which, until their own ships were cleared of troops, would not be inferior. All these objections they laid before the Council General. Lord Raglan then said the army now perfectly understood the risk, and was prepared to take it. Whereupon the allied admirals replied that they were ready to proceed and do their best to set the army ashore and support it at any point that should be chosen. There remains a form of support which has not yet been considered, and that is diversionary movements or feints by the fleet to draw the enemy's attention away from the landing place. This will naturally be a function of the covering battle-squadron or its attendant cruisers and flotilla. The device appears in Drake's attack on San Domingo in 1585, an attack which may be regarded as our earliest precedent in modern times and as the pattern to which all subsequent operations of the kind conformed so far as circumstances allowed. In that case, while Drake landed the troops a night's march from the place, the bulk of the fleet moved before it, kept it in alarm all night, and at dawn made a demonstration with the boats of forcing a direct landing under cover of its guns. The result was the garrison moved out to meet the threat and were surprised in flank by the real landing force. Passing from this simple case to the most elaborate in our annals, we find Saunders doing the same thing at Quebec. In preparation for Wolfe's night landing he made a show of arrangements for a bombardment of Montcalm's lines below the city, and in the morning with the boats of the fleet began a demonstration of landing his marines. By this device he held Montcalm away from Wolfe's landing place till a secure footing had been obtained. Similar demonstrations had been made above the city, and the combined result was that Wolfe was able to penetrate the centre of the French position unopposed. Such work belongs of course to the region of tactics rather than of strategy, but the device has been used with equal effect strategically. So great is the secrecy as well as the mobility of an amphibious force, that it is extremely difficult for an enemy to distinguish a real attack from a feint. Even at the last moment, when a landing is actually in progress, it is impossible for the defenders to tell that all the troops are being landed at the one point if a demonstration is going on elsewhere. At Quebec it was not till Montcalm was face to face with Wolfe that he knew he had to deal with the whole British force. Still less from a strategical point of view can we be certain whether a particular landing represents an advance guard or is a diversionary operation to mask a larger landing elsewhere. This is a special difficulty when in the case of large operations the landing army arrives in echelon like the Second Japanese army. In that instance the naval feint was used strategically, and apparently with conspicuous effect. The Russians were always apprehensive that the Japanese would strike for Newchuang at the head of the Gulf of Pe-chi-li, and for this reason General Stakelberg, who had command of the troops in the peninsula, was not permitted to concentrate for effective action in its southern part, where the Japanese had fixed their landing place. Admiral Togo, in spite of the strain on his fleet in effecting and securing the disembarkation of the army, detached a cruiser squadron to demonstrate in the Gulf. The precise effect of this feint upon the Russian Staff cannot be measured with certainty. All we know is that Stakelberg was held back from his concentration so long that he was unable to strike the Japanese army before it was complete for the field and able to deal him a staggering counter-stroke. This power of disturbing the enemy with feints is of course inherent in the peculiar attributes of combined expeditions, in the facility with which their line of operation can be concealed or changed, and there seems no reason why in the future it should be less than in the past. Good railway connections in the theatre of the descent will of course diminish the effect of feints, but, on the other hand, the means of making them have increased. In mine-sweeping vessels, for instance, there is a new instrument which in the Russo-Japanese War proved capable of creating a very strong impression at small cost to the fleet. Should a flotilla of such craft appear at any practicable part of a threatened coast and make a show of clearing it, it will be almost a moral impossibility to ignore the demonstration. On the whole then, assuming the old methods are followed, it would seem that with a reasonable naval preponderance the power of carrying out such operations over an uncommanded sea is not less than it has proved to be hitherto. The rapidity and precision of steam propulsion perhaps places that power higher than ever. It would at any rate be difficult to find in the past a parallel to the brilliant movement on Seoul with which the [pg 301] [pg 302] [pg 303] Japanese opened the war in 1904. It is true the Russians at the last moment decided for political reasons to permit the occupation to take place without opposition, but this was unknown to the Japanese, and their arrangements were made on the assumption that their enemy would use the formidable means at his disposal to obstruct the operation. The risk was accepted, skillfully measured, and adequately provided for on principles identical with those of the British tradition. But, on the other hand, there has been nothing to show that where the enemy has a working command of the sea the hazard of such enterprises has been reduced. Against an enemy controlling the line of passage in force, the well-tried methods of covering and protecting an oversea expedition will no more work to-day than they did in the past. Until his hold is broken by purely naval action, combined work remains beyond all legitimate risk of war. APPENDIX THE "GREEN PAMPHLET" WAR COURSE Strategical Terms and Definitions used in Lectures on Naval History BY JULIAN S. CORBETT, ESQ., L.L.M. NAVAL STRATEGY Naval strategy does not exist as a separate branch of knowledge. It is only a section of a division of the art of war. The study for officers is the art of war, specialising in Naval Strategy. The true method of procedure then is to get hold of a general theory of war, and so ascertain the exact relations of Naval Strategy to the whole. War is a form of political intercourse, a continuation of foreign politics which begins when force is introduced to attain our ends. OBJECTS. We seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be ulterior or immediate. Immediate objects (also called "Primary") are the ends of particular operations or movements. But it must be remembered that every primary object has also its ulterior object; that is, every operation must be regarded, not only from the point of view of its special object, but also as a step to the end of the campaign or war. Strategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view. Classified by the object it is Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor Strategy, with primary objects. This also means that every operation of an army or fleet must be regarded in a double light, i.e., it must be planned and conducted in relation (1) to the general progress of the war; (2) to the object to which it is [pg 304] [pg 305] [pg 307] Introductory Theory of war. [pg 308] Strategy. immediately directed. Major Strategy (always regarding the ulterior object) has for its province the plan of the war, and includes: (1) Selection of the immediate or primary objects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object; (2) Selection of the force to be used, i.e., it determines the relative functions of the naval and military forces. NOTE.—Major Strategy in its broadest sense has also to deal with the whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship. It regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled together; they are instruments of war. But it also has to keep in view constantly the politico- diplomatic position of the country (on which depends the effective action of the instrument), and its commercial and financial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is maintained). The friction of these two considerations is inherent in war, and we call it the deflection of strategy by politics. It is usually regarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every strategical problem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question of grand strategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and vice versa. For a line of action or an object which is expedient from the point of view of strategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and vice versa. To decide a question of grand strategy without consideration of its diplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither strategy or diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This interaction has to be accepted by commanding officers as part of the inevitable "friction of war." A good example is Pitt's refusal to send a fleet into the Baltic to assist Frederick the Great during the Seven Years War, for fear of compromising our relations with the Scandinavian Powers. Minor Strategy has for its province the plans of operations. It deals with— (1) The selection of the "objectives," that is, the particular forces of the enemy or the strategical points to be dealt with in order to secure the object of the particular operation. (2) The directing of the force assigned for the operation. Minor Strategy may be of three kinds:— (1) Naval, where the immediate object is to be attained by a fleet only. (2) Military, where the immediate object is to be attained by an army only. (3) Combined, where the immediate object is to be attained by army and navy together. NOTE.—It will be seen that what is usually called Naval Strategy or Fleet Strategy, is only a sub- division of a division of strategy, and that, therefore, strategy cannot be studied from the point of view of naval operations only. NOTE.—Naval Strategy, being only a part of General Strategy, is subject to the same friction as Major Strategy, though in a less degree. Individual commanders have often to take a decision independently of the central government, or headquarters; they should, therefore, always keep in mind the possible ulterior effects of any line of action they may take, endeavouring to be sure that what is strategically expedient is not diplomatically inexpedient. EXAMPLE.—Boscawen's attack on De la Motte on the eve of the Seven Years War. NATURE OF OBJECT The solution of every strategical problem, whether of Major or Minor Strategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in view. All objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative. A positive object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for ourselves. A negative object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent his gaining something. Where the object is positive, Strategy is offensive. Where the object is negative, Strategy is defensive. EXAMPLE.—When Togo attacked Rojesvensky his primary object was offensive, i.e., to capture or destroy the Russian Fleet. His ulterior object was to maintain the defensive function which had been Major Strategy. Minor Strategy. [pg 309] Nature of object. Offensive and defensive. assigned to the Japanese Fleet. NOTES.—This is a good example of true defensive; that is, Togo's operations, though drastically offensive in action, were all strictly within the strategical defensive sphere assigned to him. The Offensive, being positive in its aim is naturally the more effective form of war (i.e., it leads more directly to a final decision), and, as a rule, should be adopted by the stronger Power. The Defensive, being negative in its aim, is naturally the stronger form of war; i.e., it requires less force, and, as a rule, is adopted by the weaker Power. NOTE.—The general truth of this proposition is not affected by apparent exceptions where the contrary appears to be true. The Offensive must not be confused with the Initiative. It is possible to seize the Initiative, under certain conditions, by taking a defensive position from which the enemy is bound to dislodge us or abandon the operation. In most cases where the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive, it is due to his doing so before the enemy's mobilization or concentration is complete, whereby the attacking force is able to deal in succession with locally inferior forces of the enemy. The advantages of the Offensive are well known. Its disadvantages are:— (1) That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its communications. (2) That it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground. (3) That it continually increases the difficulty of retreat. The advantages of Defence are chiefly:— (1) Proximity to base. (2) Familiar ground. (3) Facility for arranging surprise by counter attack. NOTE.—In modern Naval warfare these advantages—that is, the advantages of fighting on your own ground—are specially high as giving greater facility for the use of mine and torpedo. The disadvantages are mainly moral or when the enemy's objective or line of operations cannot be ascertained, but this disadvantage can be neutralised when it is possible to secure an interior position. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DEFENSIVE. True Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike. NOTE.—When the Dutch burnt our ships at Chatham, we were not acting on the defensive, we had laid them up and were doing nothing at all. The strength and the essence of the defensive is the counter-stroke. A well designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack. A general defensive policy may consist of a series of minor offensive operations. The maxim is: If you are not relatively strong enough to assume the offensive, assume the defensive till you become so— (1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or otherwise; (2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or securing allies. Except as a preparation or a cover for offensive action the defensive is seldom or never of any use; for by the defensive alone we can never acquire anything, we can only prevent the enemy acquiring. But where we are too [pg 310] Relation of offensive to defensive. [pg 311] weak to assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive, and wait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and permitting us to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's; we then pass to the offensive, for which our defensive has been a preparation. As a cover or support for the offensive, the defensive will enable us to intensify the attack; for by assuming the defensive in one or more minor theatres of operation we can reduce our forces in those theatres to a minimum, and concentrate to a maximum for the offensive in the most important theatre. OFFENSIVE OPERATIONS USED WITH A DEFENSIVE INTENTION (A) Counter attacks. (B) Diversions. (A) Counter attacks are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes himself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this form of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the "surprise advantage of defence." (B) Diversions are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside the limit of his theatre of offensive operations. Diversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention, and to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they should divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be small. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less likely they are to divert a force greater than their own. It is only their power of diverting or containing a larger force than their own that justifies the breach of the law of concentration which they involve. This power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities are most highly developed in combined expeditions. NOTE.—Diversions must be carefully distinguished from eccentric attacks. Eccentric attacks are true offensive movements. They have a positive object, i.e., they aim to acquire something from the enemy; whereas diversions have a negative object, i.e., they aim at preventing the enemy doing or acquiring something. Being in the category of the weaker form of war, eccentric attacks are usually made in greater force than diversions. EXAMPLES.—Diversion.—Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force, about 4,000 men. Object, according to official instructions, "a diversion on the coasts of United States of America in favour of the army employed in the defence of Canada"; i.e., the intention was negative— preventative—defensive. 2. Eccentric Attack.—Operations against New Orleans in 1815. Intended force 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, "to obtain command of embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to occupy some important and valuable possession, by the restoration of which the conditions of peace might be improved, &c."; i.e., the intention was positive—to acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) and Belleisle (eccentric attack) in the Seven Years War. Note 2.—This distinction gives a threefold classification of combined expeditions, as used by Elizabethan strategists. Raids = Diversions. Incursions = Eccentric attacks. Invasions = True direct offence. Compare these with Sir John Ardagh's classification (Report of Royal Commission on Reserve Forces, 1904):— "Raids," not exceeding 10,000 men. "Small expeditions," not exceeding 50,000 men. "Dangerous invasion," not exceeding 150,000 men. [pg 312] [pg 313] NATURE OF ULTERIOR OBJECT From the nature of the ulterior object we get an important classification of wars, according to whether such object is limited or unlimited. (1) War with limited object ("limited war") is where we merely seek to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions, or interests; e.g., Spanish-American War, where the object was the liberation of Cuba. (2) War with an unlimited object is where we seek to overthrow the enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must agree to do our will (become subservient); e.g., Franco- German War. NOTE.—Ulterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as the immediate (primary or secondary) objects which lead up to them; e.g., ulterior objects may be offensive, while one or more of the immediate objects may be defensive, and vice versâ. EXAMPLE 1.—Japanese position in the late war. Ulterior object of the war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive (positive). Function or ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was defensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack and destroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive). EXAMPLE 2.—In the Spanish-American War the ulterior object of the war was (for the Americans) to eject the Spanish Government from Cuba. This was offensive. The ulterior object of the fleet was to prevent the Spaniards sending reinforcements or interfering with the intended American invasion. This was defensive. The primary object of the fleet was to bring the Spanish Fleet to action. This was offensive. SYSTEM OF OPERATIONS Having determined the nature of the war by the nature of its object (i.e., whether it is offensive or defensive and whether it is limited or unlimited), strategy has to decide on the system of operations or "plan of the war." This depends upon:— (1) The theatre of the war. (2) The means at our disposal. 1. Theatre of the War.—Usually defined as "all the territory upon which the hostile parties may assail each other." This is insufficient. For an island power the theatre of war will always include sea areas. Truer definition: "geographical areas within which lie the ulterior objects of the war and the subordinate objects that lead up to them." A "theatre of war" may contain several "theatres of operations." 2. Theatre of Operations.—Is generally used of the operations of one belligerent only. An "operation" is any considerable strategical undertaking. A "theatre of operations" is usually defined as embracing all the territory we seek to take possession of or to defend. A truer definition is, "the area, whether of sea or land or both, within which the enemy must be overpowered before we can secure the object of the particular operation." Consequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be defensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another. Where the operations are defensive in character any special movement or movements may be offensive. OBJECTIVE Limited and unlimited wars. [pg 314] Objective An objective is "any point or force against which an offensive movement is directed." Thus where the object in any theatre of operation is to get command of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet will usually be the objective. LINES OF OPERATION A line of operation is "the area of land or sea through which we operate from our base or starting point to reach our objectives." Lines of operation may be exterior or interior. We are said to hold the interior lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of operations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more quickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a position is called an interior position. "Exterior Lines" and "Exterior Position" are the converse of these. LINES OF COMMUNICATION This expression is used of three different things:— (1) Lines of supply, running from the base of operations to the point which the operating force has reached. (2) Lines of lateral communication by which several forces engaged in one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to each other's support. (3) Lines of retreat, which are lines of supply reversed, i.e., leading back to the base. These three ideas are best described by the term "lines of passage and communication," which we had in use at the end of the eighteenth century. Ashore, lines of passage and communication are roads, railways, waterways, &c. At sea, they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the normal course of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the force to be supplied. In Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of communication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on communications, but probably it does so even more than Land Strategy, as will appear from a consideration of maritime communications, and the extent to which they are the main preoccupation of Naval operations. MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS The various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet may have to operate are:— (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond to the communications of armies operating ashore). These tend to increase in importance strategically with the increasing hunger of modern fleets (for coal, ammunition, &c). (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea base, that is communication between the advanced and the main base. (3) Trade Routes, that is the communications upon which depend the national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the "lateral" or connecting communications between various parts of belligerents' possessions. N.B.—Such "lines of passage and communication" are the preoccupation of Naval Strategy; that is to say, problems of Naval Strategy can be reduced to terms of "passage and communication" and this is probably the best method of solving them. NAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A QUESTION OF PASSAGE AND COMMUNICATION Lines of operation. [pg 315] Lines of communica [pg 316] By "Naval Strategy" we mean the art of conducting the operations of the Fleet. Such operations must always have for their object "passage and communication"; that is, the Fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own communications and seizing those of the enemy. PROOF I.—Deductive.—We say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command of the sea. What does this mean? It is something quite different from the Military idea of occupying territory, for the sea cannot be the subject of political dominion or ownership. We cannot subsist upon it (like an army on conquered territory), nor can we exclude neutrals from it. Admiral Colomb's theory of "conquest of water territory," therefore, involves a false analogy, and is not safe as the basis of a strategical system. What then is the value of the sea in the political system of the world? Its value is as a means of communication between States and parts of States. Therefore the "command of the sea" means the control of communications in which the belligerents are adversely concerned. COROLLARY.—The command of the sea can never be, like the conquest of territory, the ulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime war, as were approximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century, but it may be a primary or immediate object, and even the ulterior object of particular operations. PROOF II.—Inductive, from history or past experience.—History shows that the actual functions of the Fleet (except in purely maritime wars) have been threefold. 1. The prevention or securing of alliances (i.e., deterring or persuading neutrals as to participating in the war). EXAMPLES.—The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the alliance of the Kingdom of Naples. In the first case there came a crisis when it was more important to demonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining Louis XIV than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the second, the Neapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not. 2. The protection or destruction of commerce. 3. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore. NOTE.—The above is the best working "Definition of Naval Strategy," as emphasising its intimate connection with diplomatic, financial, and military aspects of major strategy. These functions may be discharged in two ways:— (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed (bombardment, landing, raiding parties, &c). (2) By getting command of the sea, i.e., establishing ourselves in such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against their territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours. NOTE.—The power of the second method, by controlling communications, is out of all proportion to the first—direct attack. Indeed, the first can seldom be performed with any serious effect without the second. Thus, from this point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is mainly a question of communications. But not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the Fleet must discharge part of its function by direct action before there is time to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and military considerations may deflect normal operation of Naval Strategy.) EXAMPLE.—Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the unshaken Toulon Fleet. Japanese invasion of Manchuria. COMMAND OF THE SEA Command of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command of the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we have (a) adequate Naval positions; (b) an adequate Fleet to secure the [pg 317] [pg 318] command when war breaks out. VARIOUS CONDITIONS OF COMMAND 1. It may be (a) general; (b) local. (a) General command is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act dangerously against our line of passage and communication or to defend his own, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere seriously with our trade or our military or diplomatic operations. This condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send squadrons to sea. NOTE.—Command of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do absolutely nothing, but that he cannot seriously interfere with the undertakings by which we seek to secure the object of the war, or to force our will upon him. (b) Local command implies a state of things in which we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in one or more theatres of operation. 2. Both local and general command may be (a) temporary; (b) permanent. (a) Temporary command is when we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in all or some theatres of operation during the period required for gaining the object in view (i.e., the object of a particular operation or of a particular campaign). This condition existed after Togo's first action. (b) Permanent command is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the situation, i.e., when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his maritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This condition existed after Tsushima. 3. Command, whether general, local, or temporary, may be in three different states:— (a) With us. (b) With the enemy. (c) In dispute. If in dispute, it may be that:— (1) We have preponderance. (2) Our enemy has preponderance. (3) Neither side preponderates. COMMAND IN DISPUTE The state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it is the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and frequently all through it. The state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, i.e., till one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea. It is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of dispute by seeking a decision. Hence the French tradition to avoid decisive actions as a rule when at war with England. The truth of this appears from the fact that general command of the sea is not essential to all oversea operations. In a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate in one theatre of operations, and so secure the local or temporary command sufficient for obtaining the special object in view. The weaker Power may take advantage of such local concentration to operate safely elsewhere. Rule 1. So long as a state of dispute can force the preponderating Power to concentrate, operating by evasion is possibly open to the weaker. Rule 2. In a state of dispute although the weaker Power may not be able to obstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able to defend its own. [pg 319] [pg 320] EXAMPLES.—This condition of dispute existed during the first three years of the Seven Years War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a decision by defeating Conflans and De la Cloue; also in the Great War up to Trafalgar. SHOULD COMMAND OF THE SEA ALWAYS BE THE PRIMARY OBJECT? When the preponderating Power fails or neglects to get command (i.e., leaves the general command in dispute), the disadvantage to him is not so much the danger to his own operations as the facility given to the enemy for carrying out counter operations elsewhere. Under certain conditions, therefore, it may not be the primary function of the fleet to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it, because general command may be in dispute while local command may be with us, and political or military considerations may demand of us an operation, for which such local command is sufficient, and which cannot be delayed until we have obtained a complete decision. From the above it will appear "command of the sea" is too loose an expression for strategical discussion. For practical purposes should be substituted "control of passage and communication." The question then in the consideration of any proposed operation or line of operations will be, not "Have we the command of the sea?" but "Can we secure the necessary lines of communication from obstruction by the enemy?" METHODS OF SECURING CONTROL 1. Permanent general control can only be secured by the practical annihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions. 2. Local and temporary control may be secured by:— (a) A defensive action not necessarily entirely successful (containing). (b) Forcing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion). (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing). BLOCKADE Blockades are of two natures, according to the object review. The object may be:— (d) Blockade. i. Close blockade to prevent the enemy putting to sea. The object being usually to secure local or temporary control. ii. Observation blockade, to force the enemy to put to sea by occupying the common lines of communications (see below). In this case you are seeking a decision as a step towards general control. Both natures are operations upon the lines of passage and communication, but in case (1) the primary intention is defensive, to secure our own line; in case (2) the primary intention is offensive, to seize the enemy's line and compel him to expose himself in an attempt to recover it. GENERAL RULES FOR CONDUCTING BLOCKADES In case (1) (defensive intention) blockade should be as close as is compatible with security from torpedo attack. In case (2) (offensive intention) it should be as distant as is compatible with bringing enemy to action if he comes out. [pg 321] [pg 322] Examples:—Case (1): First stage of Togo's blockade of Port Arthur. Case (2): Nelson off Toulon. Confusion of the two: Sampson's attempt to close Santiago simultaneously with an attempt to force Cervera to sea. THE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS Since the whole idea of command of the sea and the whole theory of blockade rest on the control of communications, neither can be fully apprehended without a thorough understanding of the nature of maritime communications. Ashore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend to run more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they meet in the theatre of operations or the objective point. At sea the reverse is the case; for in maritime warfare the great lines of communications of either belligerent tend to run approximately parallel, if, indeed, they are not identical. Thus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the Eastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines of communication would be identical. This was also the case in all our imperial wars with France. This peculiarity is the controlling influence of maritime warfare. Nearly all our current maxims of Naval strategy can be traced to the pressure it exerts on Naval thought. It is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval strategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and confusion, which has arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to the sea without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the communications and operations against them in each case. On land the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's communications at once is that as a rule we cannot do so without exposing our own. At sea, on the contrary, since the great lines are common to both, we cannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's. Therefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get your fleet into such a position that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded. EXAMPLE.—This was usually done in our old wars with France, by our getting a fleet off Brest before the French could sail. Hence the maxim "that the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's coast," "the enemy's coast is our true frontier," and the like. But these maxims are not universally true, witness Togo's strategy against Rojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast. Take again the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. Here again Togo's practice was the reverse of the maxim. The true maxim is "The primary object of the fleet is to secure communications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them unsafe it must be put out of action." The enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always. EXAMPLE.—Opening of War of Spanish Succession. The operations of 1702 were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish trade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own lines of passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief theatre of operation. These last two lines were identical. 1703.—Chief operations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and particularly of Portugal, and with same object in view, Rooke's official instructions directed that the French fleet was to be ignored unless it threatened our communications. [pg 323] RESULT.—By 1704 we had gained a Naval position from which France could not eject us, and she abandoned struggle for sea communications. But nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c., is sound and applicable:— (a) Because for us general permanent command is usually essential to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the enemy's fleet. (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt to control the common communications. (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex (i.e., the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a blow which solve all the difficulties; e.g., Sir Palmes Fairborne's solution of the problem in 1703 (England in the Mediterranean, Vol. II., p. 234). Also it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective way of "seeking out the enemy's fleet" (i.e., forcing an action on him) is to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of campaign. This was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon fleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally, but by the operation of inevitable strategical law). Compare Togo's strategy and that of the Americans in 1898. Practically all great Naval actions have been brought about in this way, that is they have been the outcome on an effort to clear essential communications from the enemy's fleet, e.g., Gravelines, La Hogue, Quiberon, Trafalgar, Tsushima. Similarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about because our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade communications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet. FINAL NOTE In applying the maxim of "seeking out the enemy's fleet" it should be borne in mind:— (1) That if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably find it in a place where you cannot destroy it except at heavy cost. (2) That seeing that the defensive is a stronger form of war than the offensive, it is prima facie better strategy to make the enemy come to you than to go to him and seek a decision on his own ground. WAR COURSE Notes on Strategy PART ONE GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS INTRODUCTORY Naval strategy is a section of the Art of War. The study for officers is the Art of War, which includes Naval Strategy. War is the application of force to the attainment of political ends. MAJOR AND MINOR STRATEGY [pg 324] [pg 325] [pg 326] We seek our ends by directing force upon certain objects, which may be ulterior or primary. Primary objects are the special objects of particular operations or movements which we undertake in order to gain the ulterior object of the campaign. Consequently it must be remembered that every particular operation or movement must be regarded, not only from the point of view of its special object, but also as a step to the end of the campaign or war. Strategy is the art of directing force to the ends in view. There are two kinds—Major Strategy, dealing with ulterior objects; Minor Strategy, with primary objects. Every operation of an army or fleet must be planned and conducted in relation (1) to the general plan of the war; (2) to the object to which it is immediately directed. Major Strategy, always regarding the ulterior object, has for its province the plan of the war and includes: (1) Selection of the immediate or primary objects to be aimed at for attaining the ulterior object; (2) Selection of the force to be used, i.e., it determines the relative functions of the naval and military forces. Major Strategy in its broadest sense deals with the whole resources of the nation for war. It is a branch of statesmanship which regards the Army and Navy as parts of one force, to be handled together as the instrument of war. But it also has to keep in constant touch with the political and diplomatic position of the country (on which depends the effective action of the instrument), and the commercial and financial position (by which the energy for working the instrument is maintained). The friction due to these considerations is inherent in war, and is called the deflection of strategy by politics. It is usually regarded as a disease. It is really a vital factor in every strategical problem. It may be taken as a general rule that no question of major strategy can be decided apart from diplomacy, and vice versâ. For a line of action or an object which is expedient from the point of view of strategy may be barred by diplomatic considerations, and vice versâ. To decide a question of Major Strategy, without consideration of its diplomatic aspect, is to decide on half the factors only. Neither strategy or diplomacy has ever a clean slate. This inter-action has to be accepted as part of the inevitable "friction of war." A good example is Pitt's refusal to send a fleet into the Baltic to assist Frederick the Great during the Seven Years' War, for fear of compromising our relations with the Scandinavian Powers. Minor Strategy has for its province the plans of operations. It deals with— (1) The selection of the "objectives," that is, the particular forces of the enemy or the strategical points to be dealt with in order to secure the object of the particular operation. (2) The direction of the force assigned for the operation. Minor Strategy may, therefore, be of three kinds:— (1) Naval, where the immediate object is to be attained by a fleet only. (2) Military, where the immediate object is to be attained by an army only. (3) Combined, where the immediate object is to be attained by army and navy together. It will be seen, therefore, that what is usually called Naval Strategy or Fleet Strategy is only a sub-division of Strategy, and that therefore Strategy cannot be studied from the point of view of naval operations only. Naval Strategy, being a part of General Strategy, is subject to the same friction as Major Strategy, though in a less degree. Individual commanders have often to take a decision independently of the central government or headquarters; they should, therefore, always keep in mind the possible ulterior effects of any line of action they may take, endeavouring to be sure that what is strategically expedient is not diplomatically inexpedient. Example.—For example, take Boscawen's attack on De la Motte on the eve of the Seven Years' War in 1755. His orders were to prevent the troops and warlike stores which De la Motte was taking out from reaching Canada. It was not diplomatically expedient to open hostilities; but if Boscawen succeeded, the result would have been worth the diplomatic consequences it would entail. He missed the expedition, but captured two isolated vessels; thus striking the first blow in such a way as to entail the utmost amount of harm with the least possible good. OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE Nature of Object [pg 327] [pg 328] Upon the nature of the object depends the fundamental distinction between offensive and defensive, upon which all strategical calculation must be based. Consequently, the solution of every strategical problem, whether of Major or Minor Strategy, depends primarily on the nature of the object in view. All objects, whether ulterior or not, may be positive or negative. A positive object is where we seek to assert or acquire something for ourselves. A negative object is where we seek to deny the enemy something or prevent his gaining something. Where the object is positive, Strategy is offensive. Where the object is negative, Strategy is defensive. This is the only certain test by which we can decide whether any particular operation is offensive or defensive. Ulterior objects are not necessarily the same in their nature as the primary or secondary objects which lead up to them; e.g., ulterior objects may be offensive, while one or more of the primary objects may be defensive, and vice versâ. For example, in the Russo-Japanese War the ulterior object of the war (to drive Russians from Manchuria) was offensive (positive). The ulterior object of the fleet (to cover the invasion) was defensive (negative). Its primary object to effect this was to attack and destroy the Russian naval force. This was offensive (positive). Relation of Offensive to Defensive The Offensive, being positive in its aim, is naturally the more effective form of war and, as a rule, should be adopted by the stronger Power. The Defensive, being negative in its aim, is the more lasting form of war, since it requires less force to keep what one has than to take what is another's, and, as a rule, is adopted by the weaker Power. In most cases where the weaker side successfully assumes the offensive, it is due to his doing so before the enemy's mobilization or concentration is complete, whereby the attacking force is able to deal in succession with locally inferior forces of the enemy. The advantages of the Offensive are well known. Its disadvantages are:— That it grows weaker as it advances, by prolonging its communications, and that it tends to operations on unfamiliar ground. The advantages of the Defensive are chiefly:— Proximity to the base of supply and repair stations, familiar ground, facility for arranging surprise by counter attack, and power of organising in advance. The disadvantages of the Defensive are mainly moral. They become, however, real and practical when the enemy's objective or line of operations cannot be ascertained, for then we have to spread or attenuate our force to cover all probable objectives, but this disadvantage can be neutralised when it is possible to secure an interior position. Functions and Characteristics of the Defensive True Defensive means waiting for a chance to strike. To assume the defensive does not necessarily mean that we do not feel strong enough to attack. It may mean that we see our way by using the defensive to force certain movements on the enemy which will enable us to hit harder. A well-designed defensive will always threaten or conceal an attack. Unless it does this it will not deflect the enemy's strategy in our favour. Thus, in 1756, the French, by assuming the defensive in the Channel, threatened an attack on our coasts, and concealed their attack on Minorca. This power inherent in the defensive is peculiarly strong in naval warfare, since the mobility of fleets enables them to pass instantaneously from the defensive to the offensive without any warning. When we assume the defensive because we are too weak for the offensive, we still do not lay aside attack. The whole strength and essence of the defensive is the counter-stroke. Its cardinal idea is to force the enemy to attack us in a position where he will expose himself to a counter-stroke. [pg 329] [pg 330] The stock instance upon which naval defensive is usually condemned is the burning of our ships at Chatham by the Dutch. But in that case we were not acting on the defensive at all. We had laid up our battle fleet and were doing nothing. We were purely passive, in expectation of peace. It is really an instance of the successful use of defensive by the Dutch. Being no longer strong enough for a general offensive, they assumed the defensive, and induced us to lay up our ships and so expose ourselves to a counter-stroke. It was a counterstroke by the worsted belligerent to get better terms of peace. So far is the defensive from excluding the idea of attack, that it may consist entirely of a series of minor offensive operations. Clausewitz calls it "a shield of blows." It is often called offensive-defensive, or active defence. Neither term is really necessary. For a defensive which excludes the idea of offence or action is not war at all-at least at sea. The old Elizabethan term Preventive most closely expresses the idea. The most important function of the defensive is that of covering, buttressing, and intensifying the main attack. No plan of campaign, however strong the offensive intention, is perfect which does not contemplate the use of the defensive. Without some use of the defensive the cardinal principle of concentration can rarely be fully developed. To develop the highest possible degree of concentration upon the main object or objective, the defensive must be assumed everywhere else. Because it is only by using the defensive in the minor or less important theatres of operation that the forces in those theatres can be reduced to the minimum of security, and the maximum of concentration can thereby be obtained in the main theatre. In considering the defensive as a general plan of campaign the maxim is: If not relatively strong enough to assume the offensive, assume the defensive till you become so— (1) Either by inducing the enemy to weaken himself by attacks or otherwise; (2) Or by increasing your own strength, by developing new forces or securing allies. It must always be remembered that, except as a preparation or a cover for offensive action, the defensive is seldom or never of any use; for by the continued use of the defensive alone nothing can be acquired, though the enemy may be prevented from acquiring anything. But where we are too weak to assume the offensive it is often necessary to assume the defensive, and wait in expectation of time turning the scale in our favour and permitting us to accumulate strength relatively greater than the enemy's; we then pass to the offensive, for which our defensive has been a preparation. At sea we have had little occasion for the defensive as a general plan. But that is no reason for neglecting its study. In despising the defensive ourselves we have consistently ignored the strength it gives our enemies. The bulk of our naval history is the story of how we have been baffled and thwarted by our enemies assuming the defensive at sea in support of their offensive on land. We have seldom succeeded in treating this attitude with success, and it is only by studying the defensive we can hope to do so. Offensive Operations used with a Defensive Intention (A) Counter attacks. (B) Diversions. Counter attacks are those which are made upon an enemy who exposes himself anywhere in the theatre of his offensive operations. It is this form of attack which constitutes what Clausewitz calls the "surprise advantage of defence." Diversions are similar operations undertaken against an enemy outside the limit of his theatre of offensive operations. Diversions are designed to confuse his strategy, to distract his attention, and to draw off his forces from his main attack. If well planned, they should divert a force greater than their own. They should, therefore, be small. The nearer they approach the importance of a real attack the less likely they are to divert a force greater than their own. Diversions involve a breach of the law of concentration, and it is only their power of diverting or containing a larger force than their own that justifies their use. This power depends mainly on suddenness and mobility, and these qualities are most highly developed in combined expeditions. Diversions must be carefully distinguished from eccentric attacks. Eccentric attacks are true offensive movements. They have a positive object, i.e., they aim to acquire something from the enemy; whereas diversions [pg 331] [pg 332] have a negative object, i.e., they aim at preventing the enemy doing or acquiring something. Eccentric attacks are usually made in greater force than diversions. Examples.—Diversion.—Our raid on Washington in 1815. Landing force, about 4,000 men. Object, according to official instruction, "a diversion on the coasts of United States of America in favour of the army employed in the defence of Canada"; i.e., the intention was negative—preventive—defensive. Eccentric Attack.—Operations against New Orleans in 1815. Intended force, 15,000 to 20,000 men. Object, "to obtain command of the embouchure of the Mississippi, and, secondly, to occupy some important and valuable possession, by the restoration of which the conditions of peace might be improved, &c."; i.e., the intention was positive—to acquire. Compare Rochefort Expedition (diversion) with those against Martinique and Belleisle (eccentric attacks) in the Seven Years' War. This distinction gives a threefold classification of combined expeditions, as used by Elizabethan strategists, viz., raids, incursions, and invasions. These correspond respectively with our modern diversions, eccentric attacks, and true direct offensive. LIMITED AND UNLIMITED WARS From the nature of the ulterior object we get an important classification of wars, according to whether such object is limited or unlimited. (1) War with limited object ("limited war") is where the object is merely to take from the enemy some particular part of his possessions or interests; e.g., Spanish-American War, where the object was the liberation of Cuba. (2) War with an unlimited object is where the object is to overthrow the enemy completely, so that to save himself from destruction he must agree to do our will (become subservient); e.g., Franco- German War. PLANS OF WAR System of Operations Having determined the nature of the war by the nature of its object (i.e., whether it is offensive or defensive and whether it is limited or unlimited), Strategy has to decide on the system of operations or "plan of the war." Apart from the means at our disposal a plan of war depends mainly upon— (1) The theatre of the war. (2) The various theatres of operation available within it. 1. Theatre of the War.—Usually defined as "All the territory upon which the hostile parties may assail each other." This is insufficient. For an Island Power the theatre of war will always include sea areas. Truer definition: "Geographical areas within which must lie the operations necessary for the attainment of the ulterior objects of the war and of the subordinate objects that lead up to them." A "theatre of war" may contain several "theatres of operations." 2. Theatre of Operations.—Is generally used of the operations of one belligerent only. An "operation" is any considerable strategical undertaking. A "theatre of operations" is usually defined as embracing all the territory we seek to take possession of or to defend. A truer definition is: "The area, whether of sea or land or both, within which the enemy must be overpowered before we can secure the object of the particular operation." Consequently, since the nature of the war varies with the object, it may be defensive in one theatre of operations and offensive in another. Where the operations are defensive in character any special movement or movements may be offensive. [pg 333] As the plan of war determines the theatres of operation in the theatre of war, so in each theatre of operation it determines the lines of operation and the objectives. Objective An objective is "any point or force against which an offensive movement is directed." Thus, where the object in any theatre of operation is to get command of a certain sea in which the enemy maintains a fleet, that fleet will usually be the objective. "Objective" in ordinary use is frequently confused with "object." For purposes of strategical discussion it is desirable to keep them sharply distinguished. Objective is the end of some particular movement or operation, and is the special concern of the officer in command. Object is the end of a system of operations and is the special concern of the general staff or director of the war. An objective is some definite point which we wish to get from the enemy or prevent his occupying, or some part of his strength which we wish to destroy. It is incorrect to use the term of anything we already possess. Thus, Vladivostock is often said to have been Rojesvensky's objective. It was, strictly speaking, only his destination. To reach it and concentrate with the units already there was the primary object of the operations entrusted to him. He had no true objective before him except Togo's fleet. An objective is always subordinate to some object. It is a step to the attainment of that object. Lines of Operation A line of operation is "the area of land or sea through which we operate from our base or starting point to reach our objectives." Lines of operation may be exterior or interior. We are said to hold the interior lines when we hold such a position, in regard to a theatre of operations, that we can reach its chief objective points, or forces, more quickly than the enemy can move to their defence or assistance. Such a position is called an interior position. "Exterior Lines" and "Exterior Positions" are the converse of these. Lines of Communication This expression is used of three different things:— (1) Lines of supply, running from the base of operations to the point which the operating force has reached. (2) Lines of lateral communication by which several forces engaged in one theatre of operations can communicate with each other and move to each other's support. (3) Lines of retreat, which are usually lines of supply reversed, i.e., leading back to the base. For naval purposes these three ideas are best described by the term "lines of passage and communication," which were in use at the end of the 18th century, and they may be regarded as those waters over which passes the normal course of vessels proceeding from the base to the objective or the force to be supplied. Maritime Communications The various kinds of Maritime Communications for or against which a fleet may have to operate are:— (1) Its own communications, or those of its adversary (which correspond to the communications of armies operating ashore). These have greatly increased in importance strategically with the increased dependence of modern fleets on a regular supply of coals, stores, ammunition, &c. (2) The communications of an army operating from an advanced oversea base, that is, communication between the advanced and the main base. (3) Trade Routes, that is, the communications upon which depend the national resources and the supply of the main bases, as well as the "lateral" or connecting communications between various parts of belligerents' possessions. In Land Strategy the great majority of problems are problems of communication. Maritime Strategy has never been regarded as hinging on communications, but probably it does so, as will appear from a consideration of Maritime Communications, and the extent to which they are the main preoccupation of naval operations; that is to [pg 334] [pg 335] say, all problems of Naval Strategy can be reduced to terms of "passage and communication," and this is probably the best method of solving them. PART TWO NAVAL STRATEGY CONSIDERED AS A QUESTION OF PASSAGE AND COMMUNICATION NAVAL STRATEGY DEFINED By "Naval Strategy" we mean the art of conducting the major operations of the fleet. Such operations have for their object "passage and communication"; that is, the fleet is mainly occupied in guarding our own communications and seizing those of the enemy. We say the aim of Naval Strategy is to get command of the sea. This means something quite different from the military idea of occupying territory, for the sea cannot be the subject of political dominion or ownership. We cannot subsist upon it (like an army on conquered territory), nor can we exclude neutrals from it. The value of the sea in the political system of the world is as a means of communication between States and parts of States. Therefore the "command of the sea" means the control of communications in which the belligerents are adversely concerned. The command of the sea can never be, like the conquest of territory, the ulterior object of a war, unless it be a purely maritime war, as were approximately our wars with the Dutch in the 17th century, but it may be a primary or immediate object, and even the ulterior object of particular operations. History shows that the actual functions of the fleet (except in purely maritime wars) have been threefold:— 1. The furtherance or hindrance of military operations ashore. 2. The protection or destruction of commerce. 3. The prevention or securing of alliances (i.e., deterring or persuading neutrals as to participating in the war). EXAMPLES.—The operations of Rooke in the first years of the War of the Spanish Succession, 1702-04, to secure the adhesion of Savoy and Portugal to the Grand Alliance. Operations of Nelson to maintain the alliance of the Kingdom of Naples. In the first case, there came a crisis when it was more important to demonstrate to Savoy and Portugal what they stood to lose by joining Louis XIV, than to act immediately against the Toulon Fleet. In the second, the Neapolitan Alliance was essential to our operations in the Eastern Mediterranean; the destruction of the Toulon Fleet was not. In this way we get a Definition of the Aim of Naval Strategy, expressed in terms of the actual functions of the fleet. For practical purposes it will be found the most useful definition as emphasising the intimate connection of Naval Strategy with the diplomatic, financial, and military aspects of Major Strategy. These functions of the fleet may be discharged in two ways:— (1) By direct territorial attacks, threatened or performed (bombardment, landings, raiding parties, &c.). (2) By getting command of the sea, i.e., establishing ourselves in such a position that we can control the maritime communications of all parties concerned, so that we can operate by sea against the enemy's territory, commerce, and allies, and they cannot operate against ours. The power of the second method, by controlling communications, is out of all proportion to that of the first— direct attack. Indeed, the first can seldom be performed with any serious effect without the second. Thus, from this point of view also, it is clear that Naval Strategy is mainly a question of communications. [pg 336] [pg 337] But not entirely. Circumstances have arisen when the fleet must discharge part of its function by direct action against territory before there is time to get general control of the communications. (That is, political and military considerations may deflect the normal operation of Naval Strategy.) EXAMPLES.—Rooke's capture of Gibraltar in 1704, in the face of the unshaken Toulon Fleet. Holmes's capture of Emden in 1758. Still, the fact remains that the key to the effective performance of the fleet's duties is almost always to secure communications as soon as possible by battle. COMMAND OF THE SEA Command of the sea exists only in a state of war. If we say we have command of the sea in time of peace it is a rhetorical expression meaning that we have adequate naval positions, and an adequate fleet to secure the command when war breaks out. Command of the sea does not mean that the enemy can do absolutely nothing, but that he cannot seriously interfere with the undertakings by which we seek to secure the object of the war and to force our will upon him. Various Conditions of Command 1. It may be (a) general; (b) local. (a) General command is secured when the enemy is no longer able to act dangerously against our line of passage and communication or to use or defend his own, or (in other words) when he is no longer able to interfere seriously with our trade or our military or diplomatic operations. This condition exists practically when the enemy is no longer able to send squadrons to sea. (b) Local command implies a state of things in which we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in one or more theatres of operation. 2. Both general and local command may be (a) temporary; {b) permanent. {a) Temporary command is when we are able to prevent the enemy from interfering with our passage and communication in all or some theatres of operation during the period required for gaining the object in view (i.e., the object of a particular operation or of a particular campaign). This condition existed after Togo's first action. It was also that at which Napoleon aimed in his instructions to Villeneuve in 1805. (b) Permanent command is when time ceases to be a vital factor in the situation, i.e., when the possibility of the enemy's recovering his maritime position is too remote to be a practical consideration. This condition existed after Tsushima. Command in Dispute The state of dispute is the most important for practical strategy, since it is the normal condition, at least in the early stages of the war, and frequently all through it. The state of dispute continues till a final decision is obtained, i.e., till one side is no longer able to send a squadron to sea. It is to the advantage of the preponderating Navy to end the state of dispute by seeking a decision. Hence the French tradition to avoid decisive actions as a rule when at war with England. It must be remembered that general command of the sea is not essential to all oversea operations. In a state of dispute the preponderating Power may concentrate or be induced to concentrate in one theatre of operations, and so secure the local or temporary command sufficient for obtaining the special object in view, while the weaker Power takes advantage of such local concentration to operate safely elsewhere. Thus in a state of dispute, although the weaker Power may not be able to obstruct the passage and communication of the stronger, it may be able to defend its own. EXAMPLES.—This condition of dispute existed during the first three years of the Seven Years' War, until Hawke and Boscawen obtained a decision by defeating Conflans and De la Clue; also in the Great War up to Trafalgar. [pg 338] [pg 339] When the preponderating Power fails or neglects to get command (i.e., leaves the general command in dispute), the disadvantage to him is not so much the danger to his own operations as the facility given to the enemy for carrying out counter operations elsewhere. METHODS OF SECURING CONTROL. 1. Permanent general control can only be secured by the practical annihilation of the enemy's fleet by successful actions. 2. Local and temporary control may be secured by— (a) An action not necessarily entirely successful (containing). (b) Inducing concentration on the enemy elsewhere (diversion). (c) Superior concentration so as to render impotent the enemy's force available in the special theatre of operations (masking or containing). (d) Blockade. Action of a Fleet off an Enemy's Port A belligerent fleet off an enemy's port may carry out three different operations, for certain purposes; each quite separate from the others, and intended to obtain an entirely different result:— (1) Close Blockade.—This is to prevent the enemy's fighting ships from putting to sea. In this case the object is to secure local control for some purpose that is not purely naval, such as was carried out by the Japanese off Port Arthur in 1904, so as to enable their transports to cross the Yellow Sea without fear of molestation from any of the Russian ships in Port Arthur. Since the cruisers in Vladivostok were able to emerge (that port not being blockaded), the operation was not complete, and a danger of interference always existed. This method of blockade is far more difficult to carry out in the present day, than formerly; owing to the existence of submarines and torpedo craft, the blockading ships have to remain further away from the port; there have to be inner lines of cruisers, scouts and destroyers; and quick concentration takes longer owing to the greater space covered by the blockading force, and more ships of all natures are required for the same reason. Greater and more vigilance are required than in former days, because the enemy's ships can come out regardless of weather (thick weather would be their opportunity), and it is most important that not a single craft, from a battleship to a torpedo boat, be allowed to escape. This method of blockade includes the commercial blockade, and all countries would be informed of its having been established. (2) Commercial Blockade.—To prevent floating commerce from entering or leaving the blockaded harbour. The blockading force would not be powerful enough to prevent a squadron of battleships or cruisers from entering or leaving the port blockaded; and it would not be instituted outside a fortified military port, or one containing a strong naval force. But it would be able to stop scouts and torpedo craft from entering or emerging, unless in very great numbers; and if unable to stop them from emerging, would give warning of their escape and the direction in which they are going. In both these forms of blockade it is usual, as a matter of courtesy, to allow neutral armed ships belonging to foreign navies to enter and leave for their own purposes, presumably connected with the subjects of their own country who are in the blockaded port. This, however, is not a right, and the country to which the blockading ships belong has a right to refuse it, and to back her refusal by force. All countries must be notified of a properly instituted commercial blockade, in accordance with International Agreement. (3) Observing a Port.—This, with its subsidiary operations, should be conducted in such a way as to induce the enemy to put to sea, the object of observing the port being primarily a naval one, viz., to bring him to decisive action. The principal observing force (consisting of battleships and cruisers) would be either in one squadron, or more, provided that they were in supporting reach of each other, and so placed as to be able to cut off the enemy's fleet [pg 340] [pg 341] on emerging from the port observed before it can get dangerously near its probable objective, and yet sufficiently far out to ensure a battle before it can regain the shelter of its own ports. It is also worth noting that the battle should, if possible, be fought so as to make it difficult for the enemy's damaged ships to obtain the shelter of a friendly neutral's harbours before being captured. The observed port must be watched closely, so that immediate notice of the enemy's exit may be given; and this would be done by small cruisers, scouts and destroyers, which should be strong and numerous enough to attack any torpedo craft trying to get to sea. In order to induce the enemy's main force to put to sea it is important that every means be used to prevent his knowing that our fleet is observing the port, or if that be impossible, to do nothing which will lead him to suppose that his port is being observed. This operation is not a blockade. Subsidiary operations to induce the enemy's fleet to put to sea, may take the form of a diversion on the enemy's coast, or against some important part of his sea-borne trade, either by the observing fleet or by a force affiliated to it, or by any oversea movements calculated to interfere seriously with the enemy's war plan. Concentration The guiding feature of modern preparation for war is to be ready for rapid action. It is true at sea, more even than on land, that upon the first movements depend the initiative, the power of controlling the enemy's strategy, and of making him conform to our movements. This readiness for rapid action will depend on a proper distribution of the fleet so as to meet all the requirements. The distribution of the fleet should be dominated by the idea of concentration, but it must be understood clearly what concentration means. Clausewitz says:—"The best strategy is always to be sufficiently strong, at first generally, then at the decisive point. There is therefore no higher or simpler law for strategy than this—keep your forces together." The maxim "Keep your forces together" does not, however, necessarily mean keeping them all concentrated in one mass, but rather keeping them so disposed that they can unite readily at will. At sea it is more difficult than on land to foretell where the decisive point will be; but since it is quicker and easier at sea to concentrate forces at any particular point than on land, in applying this maxim for our purposes, the rule should be to dispose the forces at sea so as to be able to concentrate them in time at the decisive point so soon as this point is determined, and also so as to conceal from the enemy what it is intended to make the decisive point. If the forces are rightly disposed within due limits, adequate control of all the lines of passage and communication can be assured, and if the enemy undertakes any operations it should be possible to ensure that sufficient forces can be concentrated in time to defeat his object. On the other hand, if the forces are concentrated in one mass, there can be little chance of deceiving or confusing the enemy, while it gives him an opportunity of successfully carrying out some operation by evasion. THE PECULIARITY OF MARITIME COMMUNICATIONS Since the whole idea of command of the sea rests on the control of communications, it cannot be fully apprehended without a thorough understanding of the nature of maritime communications. Ashore, the respective lines of communications of each belligerent tend as a rule to run more or less approximately in opposite directions, until they meet in the theatre of operations or the objective point. At sea, the reverse is frequently the case; for in maritime warfare the great lines of communications of either belligerent often tend to run approximately parallel if, indeed, they are not identical. Thus, in the case of a war with Germany, the object of which lay in the Eastern Mediterranean, or in America, or South Africa, our respective lines of communication would be identical. This was also the case in all our imperial wars with France. This peculiarity is the controlling influence of maritime warfare. Nearly all our current maxims of Naval Strategy can be traced to the pressure it exerts on naval thought. It is at the root of the fundamental difference between Military and Naval Strategy, and affords the explanation of much strategical error and confusion which have arisen from applying the principles of land warfare to the sea [pg 342] [pg 343] without allowing for the antagonistic conditions of the communications and the operations against them in each case. On land, the chief reason for not always striking the enemy's communications at once is that, as a rule, we cannot do so without exposing our own. At sea, on the contrary, when the great lines are common to both, we cannot defend our own without striking at the enemy's. Therefore, at sea, the obvious opening is to get our fleet into such a position that it controls the common lines, unless defeated or evaded. This was usually done in our old wars with France, by our attempting to get a fleet off Brest before the French could sail. Hence the maxims "That the proper place for our fleets is off the enemy's coast," "The enemy's coast is our true frontier," and the like. But these maxims are not universally true; witness Togo's strategy against Rojesvensky, when he remained correctly upon his own coast. Take, again, the maxim that the primary object of the fleet is to seek out the enemy's fleet and destroy it. Here, again, Togo's practice was the reverse of the maxim. The true maxim is "The primary object of the fleet is to secure communications, and if the enemy's fleet is in a position to render them unsafe it must be put out of action." The enemy's fleet usually is in this position, but not always. EXAMPLE.—Opening of the War of the Spanish Succession. The operations of 1702 were to secure some point (Cadiz, Gibraltar, or Ferrol) on the Spanish trade communications, the French lateral communications, and our own lines of passage to the Mediterranean, where was to be our chief theatre of operation. These last two lines were identical. In 1703, the chief operations had for their object to secure the alliance of Savoy, and particularly of Portugal. Rooke's official instructions directed that the French fleet was to be ignored unless it threatened the common communications. RESULT.—By 1704 we had gained a naval position from which France could not eject us, and she abandoned the struggle for sea communications. But nine times out of ten the maxim of seeking out the enemy's fleet, &c., is sound and applicable— (a) Because for us general permanent command is usually essential to ultimate success, and this cannot be obtained without destroying the enemy's fleet. (b) Because usually the enemy's fleet opens with an attempt to dispute the control of the common communications. (c) Because usually the functions of the fleet are so complex (i.e., the calls upon it so numerous) that it will seek to strike a blow which will solve all the difficulties; e.g., Sir. Palmes Fairborne's solution of the problem in 1703. Also it must be remembered that nine times out of ten the most effective way of "seeking out the enemy's fleet" (i.e., forcing an action on him) is to seize a position which controls communications vital to his plan of campaign. This was what happened in 1704. Rooke was unable to seek out the Toulon Fleet, but by seizing Gibraltar he made it come to him (not intentionally, but by the operation of strategical law). Practically all great naval actions have been brought about in this way, that is, they have been the outcome of an effort to clear essential communications from the enemy's fleet; e.g., Gravelines, La Hogue, Quiberon, Trafalgar, Tsushima. Similarly the great actions of the old Dutch wars were brought about because our geographical position placed us astride the Dutch trade communications, and they were forced to seek a decision against our fleet. In applying the maxim of "seeking out the enemy's fleet" it should be borne in mind that if you seek it out with a superior force you will probably find it in a place where you cannot destroy it, except at very heavy cost. It is far better to make it come to you, and this has often been done by merely sitting on the common communications. [pg 344] Again, if you seek out the enemy's fleet without being certain of getting contact, you may merely assist it in evading you, and enable it to get into a position on your own communications, from which it may be very costly to dislodge it. It was for this reason that the Elizabethan Government kept the fleet in home waters in 1588. Sampson, in the Spanish-American War, was actually permitted to make this mistake. By going to seek out Cervera without being sure of contact, he left him a clear run into Cienfuegos or even Havana, which it was the main function of the fleet to prevent. Captain Mahan has since modified this maxim as follows:—"Seek out the enemy's fleet, if you are sure of getting contact." A truer maxim would seem to be "Seek contact with the enemy's fleet in the most certain and favourable manner that is open to you." To seek out the enemy's fleet is only one way of doing this, and not always the best way. It must be remembered that other conditions being equal, it is an obvious advantage to fight in your own waters rather than in those of the enemy, and more likely to ensure that a defeat of the enemy will be decisive.

"If anyone," he said, "wishes to know the history of this war, I will tell them it is our maritime superiority gives me the power of maintaining my army while the enemy are unable to do so." (Letters of Sir T. Byam Martin) [Navy Records Society], ii, p. 499. 6 Correspondance de Napoléon, xix, 421, 4 September. 7 Development of Strategical Science. 8 The strategical object with which the Baltic fleet was sent was certainly to prevent a counter-stroke—that is, its main function in our war plan was negative. Its positive function was minor and diversionary only. It also had a political object as a demonstration to further our efforts to form a Baltic coalition against Russia, which entirely failed. Public opinion mistaking the whole situation expected direct positive results from this fleet, even the capture of St. Petersburg. Such an operation would have converted the war from a limited one to an unlimited one. It would have meant the "overthrow of the enemy," a task quite beyond the strength of the allies without the assistance of the Baltic Powers, and even so their assistance would not have justified changing the nature of the war, unless both Sweden and Russia had been ready to make unlimited war and nothing was further from their intention. 9 In justice to Wellington, it should be said that his complaints were due to false reports that exaggerated a couple of insignificant captures into a serious interruption. 10 But not without analogous precedent. In the later Middle Ages small craft were assigned the function in battle of trying to wedge up the rudders of great ships or bore holes between wind and water. See Fighting Instructions (Navy Record Society), p. 13. 11 Daveluy, L'Esprit de la Guerre Navale, vol. i, p. 27, note. 12 Mahan, War of 1812, i, 316. 13 The Dutch were believed to have sixteen of the line—one seventy-four, seven sixty-eights, and the rest under sixty guns. In Ross's squadron were one three-decker and two eighties. 14 See post, pp. 222-24. 15 Nelson to Barham, 29 August 1805. 16 Captain Philip Patton to Sir Charles Middleton, 27 June 1794.

He was regarded as possessing a very special knowledge of personnel, and as vice admiral became second sea lord under Barham in 1804. 17 Barham Papers, i, 302. 18 To Evan Nepean, 4 September 1801.

In acknowledging the order from Ushant he wrote, "The instructions ... are nearly the same as have generally been given. I can therefore only guess why a copy of the order was sent to me."—Admiralty, In-Letters, 129, 28 September 1805. 25 The Japanese in the late war attempted to do this work by means of a highly organized Army Disembarkation Staff, but except in perfect conditions of weather and locality it does not seem to have worked well, and in almost all cases the assistance of the navy was called in. 26 Sir Hugh Cloberry Christian was an officer of high distinction with a remarkable record of battle service. He had been serving as Howe's second captain just before his promotion to flag rank in 1795, and died as Commander-in-Chief at the Cape at the early age of fifty-one. 27 On analogous grounds almost every military critic has condemned the policy of this disastrous expedition as involving a dispersal of our slender military force at a time when everything called for its concentration in Europe. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SOME PRINCIPLES OF MARITIME STRATEGY *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.

S INTRODUCTION THE SEA IS ONE hakespeare, in his immortal sea drama The Tempest, said, “We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep,” referring to the small and confined dimensions of our individual lives. It is a haunting passage, and one I have thought about a great deal. The play opens with a massive storm at sea, and the line has always had profoundly nautical implications for me. In my nearly four decades as a Navy sailor, when all the days I spent on the deep ocean, out of sight of land, are totaled, they add up to nearly eleven years. The endless vistas of the open ocean, upon which I gazed for more than a decade of my life, provide quite a setting for such dreaming. And in those days, when I looked at the ocean, I always felt a sense of seeing the same view that millions upon millions of other deep-sea mariners, coastal sailors, and even land dwellers close to the ocean saw. Like the fishermen, traders, pirates, harbor pilots, and indeed sailors of every ilk who went down to the sea in ships of all kinds, we have all seen the same ocean views. In a way, it is like looking at eternity; to gaze upon it for an hour, a day, a month, or a lifetime reminds us gently that our time is limited, and we are but a tiny part of the floating world. In addition to simply warning us not to overimagine the importance of our own small voyages on this earth, Shakespeare’s line also makes us consider quite literally what we are indeed made of. It is worth remembering that each of us is, essentially, largely made of water. When a human baby is born, it is composed of roughly 70 percent water. It has always fascinated me that roughly the same proportion of the globe is covered by water—just over 70 percent. Both our planet and our bodies are dominated by the liquid world, and anyone who has sailed extensively at sea will understand instinctively the primordial tug of the oceans upon each of us when we look upon the sea. I still dream about being on a ship, and part of why I wanted to write a book about the oceans is in response to those dreams. It often happens as I nod off on my now landlocked bed that I dream of the faint rumble of a ship’s engines and feel the rolling of the waves pushing and rocking the hull of my ship. When I rise and head up to the bridge, it is always on a bright day, with the clouds hanging in front of the bow and the ship pushing through the sea. I never know exactly where the dream will take me but I always end up approaching the shore, and when I do, I feel a pang of regret to leave the ocean. The approaches to land are always difficult in my dreams, and the ship often finds herself running out of deep water and becomes rapidly in danger of foundering on a beach or up a river or upon a reef. I always wake up before the ship finally impales herself ashore, and I always wish I had stayed farther out to sea. The British navy, which dominated the world’s oceans for so many years, truly and deeply understood the interconnected character of the global waterways. “The sea is one” is an expression you will hear from a Brit. I heard it first when I was eighteen years old and a second-year student, called a midshipman, at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. My navigation instructor was a crusty British lieutenant commander, who seemed incredibly old and salty—he was probably in his mid-thirties, and who could imagine being so ancient? This Old Man of the Sea was a crack hand with a sextant, a nautical almanac, and a tide table to be sure, but what he really taught me was the way in which all the world’s oceans are at once connected—obvious enough given the continuous flow of water around the continents—but also separate. He would painstakingly discuss each of the great global bodies of water—the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, and the Arctic oceans—as well as the major tributary bodies: the Mediterranean Sea, the South China Sea, the Caribbean. The lieutenant commander could talk for an hour about a particular strait between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and how the water looked in the winter, and why it was a crucial passage. I learned a great deal from him, not only about the science and art of navigating a destroyer, but also about oceanography, maritime history, global strategy, and how the tools of empire so often were dusted with dried salt, like the taffrails of a sailing cutter. You could drop a plumb line from my days as a teenager at Annapolis through the arc of nearly four decades as a Navy officer and finally end up on the pages of this book. The oceans were the place I spent much of the early years of my career. I sailed through them all, validating the lessons he taught me, improving my own ship handling and navigational skills, and learning to lead men and women at sea. As my understanding and appreciation of the international system increased —accelerated by a PhD at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy of Tufts University, where I am now a very deskbound admiral—I came to understand the influence of the sea on geopolitics. It is no coincidence that so many of the great national enterprises of the past two thousand years were influenced by sea power, and that continues to be true today. The sea is one indeed, particularly as a geopolitical entity, and will continue to exert an enormous influence on how global events unfold—from the high tension of the South China Sea, to the cocaine smuggling of the Caribbean, to the piracy off the coasts of Africa, to the unfortunate reemergence of a new cold war in the Greenland-Iceland–United Kingdom gap in the North Atlantic. Some observers may not be interested in the geopolitics of the oceans, but they will haunt our policy and our choices in this turbulent twenty-first century. The oceans will matter deeply to every aspect of human endeavor. When we go to sea—whether in a warship for a nine-month combat cruise, or a week on a Carnival cruise liner, or just a day sail out of sight of land—we are launching ourselves into another dimension altogether. The world shudders and shakes beneath us, the wind cuts more sharply with nothing to slow its pace, the weather skims by our unprotected hull, the dolphins sometimes swim alongside for hours—it is a very different world. In a primal sense, we are “an ocean away” every time we go to sea and can no longer see the land. When you are on a hull, however large or small, and come up on the deck and slowly pivot around to see nothing but the ocean stretching away from you, stop and measure the moment in the passage of your life: you are seeing the same view, the same endless ocean that Alexander the Great saw as he sailed the eastern Mediterranean, that Napoleon gazed upon on his long, sad voyage to exile in the South Atlantic, and that Halsey saw as he lashed his Fast Carrier Task Force into combat in the western Pacific. In that sense, as a sailor, you are at once an ocean away from the world of the land, but also connected to a long, unbroken chain of men and women who have set their course for the open ocean. It is those two important aspects of the oceans that I have tried to capture in this volume: the personal experience of a mariner at sea, and the geopolitics of the oceans and how they constantly influence events ashore. Only by understanding both the individual and personal experiences of sailors and trying to pour that distinct nautical culture into the larger questions of how the oceans drive the international system can we fully appreciate the value and the challenge of the sea. In that sense, this is a book that could have been written by many different sailors at any point in the long, long history of our collective human voyages both over the ocean and through time. Writing it now, in this century, is simply an attempt to take a vivid snapshot of those two tendrils of human experience—a sailor’s life at sea and the strategic impact of the oceans— upon the vast water world we call earth. Let’s get under way. 1. THE PACIFIC MOTHER OF ALL THE OCEANS Ortelius’s 1589 map showing what was then the Western world’s best understanding of the Pacific.

Ward Bering : Ivividly remember the first time I sailed into the Pacific. It was in 1972, on a U.S. Navy cruiser, USS Jouett. She was a beautiful and modern warship of around 8,000 tons, with a length of about 550 feet, depth of 29 feet, and beam of 55 feet—a lot of ship as a general proposition, but not so much space internally when you considered there were nearly five hundred officers and men manning her. At the time, I was seventeen years old and a very green midshipman, the lowest officer rank in the Navy, on my so-called youngster cruise out of Annapolis, which is what midshipmen did after their first year of academics instead of taking a summer break. Having grown up in a Marine Corps family (my father would eventually retire as a full colonel of Marines after combat service in Korea and Vietnam), I went to the U.S. Naval Academy with every intention of becoming a Marine infantry officer like my father. And so I went grudgingly to San Diego in the summer of 1972, grumpy about having to go to sea—like many Marines, my father’s motto in service was “don’t go near the water” (or the Pentagon either, but that’s another story). • • • JOUETT SLIPPED HER LINES from San Diego’s naval station and headed out to sea, past the beautiful shiny buildings of downtown San Diego, perhaps the nicest sea detail (the voyage from a pier to the open sea or the reverse) in the world. We passed under the Coronado Bay Bridge, passing the city skyline of San Diego to starboard and the large island of Coronado to port. I had been given the august responsibilities of “line handler, fantail,” which meant that I was to report to the back end of the ship and help haul in the wet, heavy lines after they were slipped off the bollards on the pier. Immediately thereafter, I had been told to report to the bridge of the ship to take a turn learning how to handle the helm. It was a sunny early summer’s day, relatively early in the morning, a crisp Southern California day with a temperature in the mid-seventies, and by the time we were secured from the fantail, the ship was nosing out past Ballast Point and into the Pacific Ocean. Fortunately for my landsman’s stomach, the seas were very calm, and as we pointed the bow due west, I made my way up several stories and stepped onto the bridge. As I emerged from the relatively dim passageways of the ship, I was simply stunned by all the sunshine and salt air and the vast ocean in front of me. Like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus, I had an epiphany: I wanted to be a sailor. In all my life, we had not been a family particularly oriented to the water, but the Pacific grabbed me by the throat and said quite simply, “You are home.” I’ve never looked back. We tend to think of the Pacific as the mother of all oceans because of its size. The Pacific is massive, and I do not use that word loosely. Even the people living along its periphery, from Canada to Chile, from Russia to Australia, and everywhere in between, appreciate only a small aspect of its size. A simple Google search will show a surface area of nearly 64 million square miles. But such a large number obscures its meaning unless you measure it against other benchmarks. The Pacific Ocean alone is greater than the combined landmasses of the entire earth. In our country, where geography is no longer a widely studied discipline (to say the least), it is hard to appreciate that a traveler flying from Washington, D.C., to Honolulu will spend no more time flying to her connecting flight in California than she will from California to her final destination. And perhaps more impressively, there is not a great deal of landmass inside the Pacific Ocean. All of the nations that border the Pacific—and there are many— think of the ocean as a kind of endless back porch. The sea dominates the geography of the Pacific more than anywhere else on earth. But throughout this gargantuan maritime expanse, it is worth remembering that there are small and not-so-small islands of all shapes and sizes, both inhabited and uninhabited, each with a distinct culture and often racial group, representing thousands of years of habitation—Tahiti, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Guinea, New Ireland, New Georgia, on and on, an area of the world that is often referred to not by the names of the islands but by the term “Oceania.” In many ways, it is remarkable that these isolated pockets of life have human beings on them at all. To be initially colonized, someone in a distant past had to set sail, cross enormous distances, make landfall, and survive. Conquering such distances requires ingenuity, courage, and an inhuman amount of will. It would have been incredibly impressive if these islands were settled using the technology of a few hundred years ago: large-hulled ships with massive sails and complex navigation equipment like sextants—think of the HMS Victory, Lord Nelson’s flagship in the late 1700s. Instead, humans found a way to conquer these distances ten thousand years ago. Using nothing but outrigger canoes with oars, the erratic currents, and the stars, mass migrations from Southeast Asia spread people throughout the saltwater expanse. These Austronesians, the Polynesians, Micronesians, and Melanesians who still inhabit the islands to this day, journeyed as far as Hawaii, more than five thousand miles from what most historians believe was their point of origin on the coast of East Asia. The migrations took many years as Austronesians island-hopped as far as their oars and the sea itself could take them, a drama that would unfold in reverse during World War II as Allied forces followed the island chains back toward the Asian heart of the Japanese Empire. Soon after I was commissioned as a young ensign out of Annapolis, those primitive voyages were much in my mind when I first crossed the Pacific in the late 1970s. Indeed, what I remember most about my first crossing was simply the length of the voyage. Luckily I wasn’t in a Kon-Tiki-like boat modeled on the ancient Austronesian vessels. It takes a week to get from the West Coast of the United States to the Hawaiian Islands, and that is merely the front door. From Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu in 1977, I sailed south to Fiji, New Zealand, and Australia—a long, long haul. We were in a small, three-ship squadron—just two new Spruance-class destroyers, Hewitt and Kinkaid, and a supply ship, the Niagara Falls. Crossing the Central Pacific from Hawaii south to the equator was a long, lazy sail with very little to do. There were basic chores in terms of maintaining the equipment and engineering plant on the ship, plenty of drills and practice events, underway replenishment wherein the smaller destroyers come alongside the larger supply ship and receive hoses to refuel— quite exciting at just a hundred feet between the ships. It was calm, hot, and flat, day after day after day. Although we had access to some rudimentary electronic navigation systems, our principal navigation was done by sextant and paper charts. As the youngest ensign on the ship, I was expected to shoot the stars daily, as well as drive the ship, learn about the engineering plant, and mind my division of sailors (I had charge of the high-tech sailors focused on antisubmarine warfare, who had exactly zero to do in that vast submarine-less expanse). The most exciting thing we had to look forward to was the ceremony of “crossing the line,” the day we would finally go past the equator and “enter the Kingdom of Davy Jones.” When U.S. Navy ships crossed the equator in those days, it was traditional to have a pretty rough hazing ceremony conducted by those who had crossed before (Shellbacks) at the expense of those who had not yet crossed (Pollywogs, or usually “slimy Wogs”). The ceremony consisted of being awoken well before dawn and herded up to the forecastle (the forward part of the ship) and sprayed with fire hoses and strewn with garbage. After a few hours of crawling around the rough decks of the ship (called nonskid, very abrasive), knees and palms are quite chewed up. It ends up with a crawl through a few canvas chutes full of very ripe garbage, dosed with this and that, before finally being made to kiss the well-greased stomach of a fat sailor dressed up as “Davy Jones” and being dunked (baptized) in salt water pulled up from the equator. It was quite a day, to say the least. Luckily for me, my commanding officer had never been across the equator before, so the hazing was sort of adjusted to a more gentlemanly level in his vicinity. I stayed close by his side. Fiji is an interesting place, and as our ships pulled in, I was struck by its multicultural quality. At the time, about 50 percent of the population were Melanesian islanders, about 40 percent of Indian descent (from the indentured Indians brought by the British to work the sugar plantations more than a century earlier), and 10 percent East Asian or Anglo. The Melanesian percentage has gradually increased over the years, but it remains a multicultural society today. We arrived in the mid-1970s, shortly after Fiji had declared independence from the British crown. • • • I REMEMBER THE CLUSTERS of islands as we approached Suva, the fairly primitive capital, where we spent several easy days on the beach and playing tennis on the grass courts at the governor general’s palace. Of note, today Fiji has an uneasy political climate, having just emerged from a military coup undertaken by a commodore, of all people (normally it is an army general who takes over a country, not a senior navy officer). But a recent election—largely deemed credible—seems to have put this small, beautiful archipelago back on a relatively stable footing, much to the relief of the Australians, who keep a close eye on the region and worry about refugees streaming out in the case of real violence. We sailed on to New Zealand, spending time on both the North and South islands. The New Zealand of the 1970s was a lot like the United States in the 1950s—quiet, kind, sensible, and slightly boring but in a very nice way. The two islands that constitute the country are both spectacular and beautiful, ranging from the tropical reaches of the North Island to the high Alps of the South, where the Lord of the Rings films were made by Kiwi director Peter Jackson. After a week or so of liberty and saddled with a colossal hangover from drinking New Zealand’s spectacular Sauvignon Blanc at a wine bar, I was given the job of junior officer of the deck, driving my ship, Hewitt, out of Auckland’s harbor in a hard-blowing squall. It was pitch black and raining sideways, and the conning officer, a lieutenant junior grade who was even greener than I, was noticeably seasick, which did not enhance his already minimal ship handling skills. Our increasingly nervous captain watched us nearly swing the stern into a channel buoy in a too-tight turn and snapped at me to take the conn (drive the ship). That sobered me up swiftly, and with the help and oversight of the ship’s operations officer (a very experienced and skilled mariner) we somehow got out of the channel and into the open sea without further incident. The Pacific was hardly pacific that night, to say the least. We then pushed on to Australia, thus completing a crossing of both the equator and the Pacific from San Diego to the incredible natural harbor of Sydney. We were all in our dress whites and the sun was shining, with the iconic Sydney Opera House, whose gorgeous architecture to me conjures up white sails at sea, gleaming across the harbor as we tied up on Garden Island, a naval dockyard on a promontory jutting into the harbor. The Pacific Ocean seemed far behind us as we fell into the warm arms of the Australians, who maintain a keen sense of gratitude to the U.S. Navy for our efforts in the Second World War to keep the Japanese from finding their way south. In those days it was a good idea to wear a uniform ashore, perhaps not so much today. But it is worth noting that the Australians continue to be very close to Americans, and in the military context have stood alongside us throughout our missions to Iraq and Afghanistan. I encountered no better fighters than the Aussies in Afghanistan, for example, and they are a serious part of the coalition against the Islamic State today. After the delights of Sydney, we began to work our way up the Australian coast, stopping over for a few days in Townsville on the Great Barrier Reef. Situated at the foot of the spikelike peninsula on the northeast coast of Oz, Townsville is a laid-back town of around 200,000 today, far smaller those decades ago. It is a gateway to the reef and a significant tourist destination. Drinking a Foster’s Lager and looking across the perfectly gorgeous waters of the reef out toward the barrier islands and the Pacific was extremely relaxing, and I felt I was close to the end of the Pacific crossing. Then I remembered what was ahead: the Torres Strait. The good news about the Torres Strait is that it is relatively wide as international choke points go. It is the body of water between the northeastern tip of the continent of Australia and the big island of New Guinea, and, as a result, one of the busiest sea passages in the world. But the bad news is that it is unusually shallow and filled with a maze of small, nearly submerged islands and delicate reefs. In the mid-1970s it wasn’t particularly well marked with navigational buoys, and no one on Hewitt had ever been through it. Given the risky nature of the passage, the captain elected to take the conn and drive the ship himself, a quite unusual decision. As the sea detail junior officer of the deck, I was supposed to provide tactical navigational advice based on radar sightings, while the ship’s navigator used traditional plotting of visual landmarks. Fortunately, we passed through in good weather on a bright day with relatively light traffic, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief as we headed fair from the Coral Sea of the western Pacific into the Arafura Sea of the eastern Indian Ocean. Thus ended my first crossing of the Pacific, a voyage I have since duplicated many times over. The first European to cross the Pacific, Ferdinand Magellan, ended up far worse than I did. To appreciate the voyage of Magellan, you have to look at the globe with eastern Australia and Indonesia at the bottom left part of the circle. It is a water world indeed: you would see only slivers of western North America and Northeast Asia—the rest of the enormous circle is essentially water. Yet despite the long voyages of the Austronesians, there was no real sense of what existed west of the Americas from a European perspective until the beginning of the 1500s, when Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama, stood atop a high hill, and both discovered and claimed the Pacific “for God and Spain.” The discovery set off a maritime version of the scramble for land colonies in the Americas, and for the next three centuries the Europeans gradually mapped the vast stretches of the Pacific. It was Magellan, an irascible Portuguese sailing on behalf of the Spanish crown, who actually named the Pacific, deciding that the waves were gentle and calm (which they are decidedly not much of the time, by the way) as his ships sailed into the deep South Pacific. He was the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean, and the five-ship expedition under his command was the first to circumnavigate the globe. (Although Magellan himself did not complete the voyage and was killed in the Philippines in 1521.) Until Magellan, most of the voyages to Asia (in search of spices and gold, principally) were conducted by passing under the tip of Africa; he reasoned that it would be possible to reach Asia by sailing west, particularly as he reputedly thought the Pacific was only six hundred miles wide—he was off by more than ten thousand miles, not to put too fine a point on it. He persuaded the Spanish crown to finance his voyages and they provided him with five ships in 1519. Magellan’s flotilla, consisting of about 250 men, sailed down the coast of South America looking for a gap to sail to the Pacific. Naturally, the weather got worse and worse and the southern winter set in, destroying one ship and requiring the remaining four ships to winter over before finally discovering what would become known as the Strait of Magellan at the bottom tip of South America. The weather continued to be challenging, and the crew of one of the ships refused to continue, but Magellan eventually broke into the southern Pacific after observing the natives along the southern coasts burning big fires— hence the name Tierra del Fuego, or “land of fire.” Getting to the Pacific was exciting, but quickly the enormous length of the ocean ahead of them dawned on Magellan and his men. The sailors gradually pushed themselves farther and farther west from the coast of modern-day Chile without finding themselves in Asia. Eventually, by early spring of 1521, they made landfall on Guam in the Mariana island chain. They worked their way farther west to the Philippines by Easter of that year, where a mass was celebrated on the island of Cebu. Magellan then foolishly became involved in interisland conflict, sailing to a nearby island called Mactan, where his party of fifty Spaniards was overwhelmed by natives and he was killed. His crew chronicled his end: “That [a spear wound] caused the captain to fall face downward, when immediately they rushed upon him with iron and bamboo spears and their cutlasses until they killed our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide.” The two centuries after Magellan’s death were consumed in building transpacific trade, with the Spanish Empire in the lead by virtue of its colonies in the Philippines. Spain’s flag, the Cross of Burgundy, was the dominant flag, but the Dutch, Portuguese, British, and French were also at play in the Pacific. The Spanish built the first truly international oceanic conveyor of goods, carrying silver mined in the New World to Asia and carting back manufactured goods to European markets. Over time the Spanish influence weakened, reflecting events in Europe (including the wars of the Reformation) that bled the peninsular nation. By the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, it was the Dutch and British who were in the ascendance in the western Pacific. In 1743, one of the massive Spanish treasure galleons was seized off Manila by British navy commodore George Anson, striking another significant economic blow against the Spanish. The French explorer Louis de Bougainville was the first of his nation to circumnavigate the Pacific as the French belatedly made their way into the region. While there were many expeditions and increasing levels of trade, there were still vast parts of the Pacific that were completely unexplored. Enter Captain James Cook, perhaps the greatest of all the Pacific sailors in history. James Cook was born in 1728 to a lower middle-class family from northern England that initially apprenticed him to a shopkeeper; fortunately for the Pacific Ocean, he was obsessed from an early age with boats, rivers, and the sea. He managed to secure an apprenticeship with a shipping firm and began to learn to handle awkward commercial ships in the difficult and constrained waters around Great Britain. Cook also began to develop a true specialization in charting and mapmaking. He was drawn into the Royal Navy by the Seven Years’ War and emerged an officer with a series of commands under his belt. As the British began to think in a truly global way by the mid-1750s, it became apparent that mapping and surveying the Pacific Ocean was a means to develop sea power and leverage global influence. Cook was given command of HMS Endeavour, a 106-foot bark—short and chunky, but with a shallow draft to get in close to small islands and over reefs. He sailed for the Pacific in the late summer of 1768. A crucial member of his company was the wealthy, handsome naturalist and scientist Joseph Banks. Together, the two men spent the next several years exploring the far reaches of the Pacific. One easy way to cruise the Pacific without leaving the comfort of a library is to pull out an atlas and trace the voyages of James Cook. He went out three times on a variety of ships and covered more than 150,000 sea miles. His ships were named Endeavour, Discovery, Resolution, and Adventure—all names that quite accurately describe how he spent the years from 1768 until his death at the hands of natives in the Hawaiian Islands (he called them the Sandwich Islands) in 1779. To lay out the courses of the three voyages is to chart virtually every important Pacific port—Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound in Alaska, Nootka Sound in western Canada, the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia—and all of the important islands: Hawaii, Marquesas Islands, Tahiti, Fiji, New Caledonia, Easter Island, Cook Islands, Friendly Islands, and New Zealand’s North and South islands. He also sailed close by Antarctica, circled Australia, rounded Cape Horn at the tip of South America, and cruised both the Atlantic and Indian oceans. In a brilliant and highly readable memoir, Blue Latitudes: Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before, Tony Horwitz follows Cook across the many sea miles from Alaska to Tasmania and from Easter Island to Russia. The Pacific was still essentially unexplored and certainly uncharted before this Yorkshire farm boy arrived—his genius opened it up, and his legacy lives today in the hearts and minds of mariners who sail those waters. The Russians too participated in the great opening of the Pacific to outside powers. Using their bases in eastern Siberia, Russian crews with minimal technology accomplished rugged journeys across difficult distances through what must have seemed to be simply a cold, watery void. They carved out claims to Alaska, of course, being so close to the Bering Strait, but their influence extended south throughout much of the Pacific as well. Lured by the same fur trade that enticed American and Canadian trappers, Russian ships operated from forward operating bases, such as Fort Ross, north of San Francisco, in the early nineteenth century. But overhunting drove down the number of fur animals and made the expensive expeditions less economically viable. The Russian toehold in the Pacific was transitory, retracting from Fort Ross in the 1840s as the weight of its large empire became too burdensome and the czarist façade began to crack. Famously, Russia sold its claims to Alaska to the United States in 1867, just a scant two years after the conclusion of the U.S. Civil War in a deal widely mocked in the United States at the time. Yet despite their transitory physical presence, the Russians made invaluable contributions to the scientific exploration of the region. The United States came into the Pacific world in fits and starts. Ships from Boston had made the arduous journey to China since the days of the Revolution but never established a permanent presence until the 1840s with the acquisition of California after the Mexican-American War. The fortuitous discovery of gold at Sutter’s Mill in 1848 kicked off the California Gold Rush and drove mass migrations west, either by land across the continent, or across the isthmus of Panama (in the days before the Panama Canal), or around Tierra del Fuego as Magellan had done three centuries before. Capitalizing on the use of whale oil, whaling became a boom energy industry that migrated from the Atlantic to the Pacific due to overexploitation. Additionally, the lucrative commercial China trade became more and more important as the decades went on. This mania of interest brought the Pacific world into the minds of those on the East Coast. The advent of coal-powered ships in the 1860s changed how the United States interacted with its Pacific domain. Coal ships were faster and more reliable than their sail-powered counterparts, but coal is heavy and exhaustible. Ships could not carry an unlimited amount of coal without sinking into the briny deep. They needed dedicated coaling stations at regular intervals in order to maintain their impressive speed. Fortunately, the Pacific for all of its vastness was dotted with islands perfectly situated to serve as coaling stations. It was this impulse that drove the U.S. annexation of Hawaii in 1898, with the beautiful port of Pearl Harbor serving as the fulcrum for its Pacific presence. In a geopolitical sense, an interesting question to consider is why Japan did not develop much as England did, essentially becoming the Great Britain of the Pacific. There are many similarities in their geopolitical trajectories: each is an island nation that faced threats of invasion early and often (with the British Isles succumbing far more frequently over their first millennia than did the Japanese); both are proud and capable societies with militaristic talent; they both produced skilled sailors and shipbuilders; and each had relatively few natural resources within their natural boundaries, theoretically necessitating a turn to the oceans. Why did the British come to create an empire that held sway over vast tracts of the earth while the Japanese turned inward for the better part of three hundred years, emerging aggressively only in the twentieth century after the opening of their world by the West? • • • THE ANSWER LIES AT LEAST in part in the geography of the Pacific Ocean as opposed to that of the Atlantic. First and foremost, the Pacific is just so much larger than the Atlantic, and the nations on the coast of Asia sit astride a relatively small land littoral facing an enormous sea to their east. Vessels launched to the east would sail away and literally disappear more or less indefinitely given the tyranny of distance. Additionally, unlike the British, who were separated from continental Europe by only a very narrow strip of the English Channel, the Japanese had both a wider distance across which invasions had to be launched as well as fewer and less aggressive geopolitical rivals developing in their littoral. They also keenly felt the size of the Pacific at their back, providing a natural buffer to the east. The Japanese faced early invasions from the Mongols in the thirteenth century, but defeated them relatively easily by surrounding the invaders on beachheads upon their arrival. Despite having significant internal rivalries, the Japanese were able to set these aside and defeat the Mongols twice in the late 1200s, assisted by the weather in the form of a typhoon (Kamikaze, or Divine Wind) that scattered the invading fleets. After a long period of consolidation and relative isolation under the various shoguns, the Japanese invaded the Asian continent in the 1500s, attacking the Korean Peninsula around the turn of the seventeenth century. They were defeated by Chinese land forces and the Korean navy, and settled back into the home islands again. This was around the time of the Battle of Lepanto in the Mediterranean, and the change in naval technology in the Pacific was notable as well—the lightly armed galleys heretofore used for grappling and ramming were giving way to heavier platforms capable of carrying larger cannons. After two serious attempts to invade Korea in the final decade of the sixteenth century, the Japanese decided to essentially remain within home waters. Unlike the British, they did not attempt to cross the broad Pacific, but essentially stood watch, protecting their western coastline and relying upon the sheer distances of the Pacific to ensure that there would be no attacks from the east. This became official doctrine; going to sea was seen as “going outside,” as one noted Asian scholar, John Curtis Perry, has described it. Similarly, the Chinese faced resolutely to the west and to their land borders. Why? Because that was the threat vector for them, not from the Pacific. They correctly regarded the principal existential dangers to their civilization as coming from the barbarians of the Asian steppes (hence the building of the Great Wall of China) and to some degree from the infections of European civilization transmitted through trade and engagement. There were abortive attempts at oceanic domination during the impressive voyages of Zheng He in the fifteenth century. But these voyages went west to known entities in the South China Sea, Indian Ocean, and East Africa, resulting in only a transitory impression on the locals and the withering away of the Chinese fleet when political tides turned against exploration. Looking to the east at the enormous range of the Pacific did not engage the Chinese geopolitical imagination any more than it did the Japanese (or that of any other Pacific culture for that matter). In the end, it was the Europeans, ironically, who would well and truly cross the Pacific and seek to connect the two worlds in a fashion beyond episodic trade and missionary work. And no individual act of opening the Pacific world could have been more dramatic than the voyage of American commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry to Japan in the 1850s. At that point, Japan had held itself more or less aloof from the world for more than 250 years. It had developed a deeply homogenous and intensely internally focused national culture, including limited trade and engagement even in the commercial sphere. But the United States was irresistibly pulled toward Japan. Pacific whaling operations, so crucial to the American economy, shifted from the South Pacific to the North off the coast of Hokkaido. The increasing trade with China made the home islands of Japan very advantageous as logistic bases to facilitate sea lanes of communication. U.S. president Millard Fillmore therefore produced a letter and directed Commodore Perry to deliver it, with the objective of gaining access to Japanese ports. Although the use of force was authorized, Perry had studied Japan and decided to take another, more diplomatic approach. Sailing in paddle-wheel steamboats, he came loaded with gifts and did all in his power to act the part of imperial representative of a great power. He sailed into Tokyo Bay in July 1853 with the intent to communicate using what we would think of today as a “soft power” approach—sensitivity to culture, avoiding a resort to military force, using economic and diplomatic levers as a first choice, and laying out a compelling geopolitical case to other actors. His ships were deeply impressive to the Japanese, and he augmented the squadron size over the winter. By March 1854, he had managed to execute the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first such cross- Pacific instrument that provided for the rights of shipwrecked sailors and refueling rights at two Japanese ports. It was the beginning of European engagement with Japan, involving most of the major powers—notably Russia and Great Britain. The internal Japanese debate over modernization crested with a two-year civil war and the return of the emperor in the so-called Meiji Restoration. Suddenly Japan was quite literally on the march—and more important, in terms of naval developments, sailing to sea. Japan’s industrial base sprinted into the late nineteenth century, rapidly developing significant military capability in its army and navy. Midshipmen were sent to Great Britain and the United States for naval educations, and the dockyards of Japan began to produce very capable, large warships. The Pacific, after centuries of being seen as a vast empty buffer zone, started to loom on the Japanese geopolitical map as a potential zone of conquest. In terms of naval strategy, the Japanese, unsurprisingly, began to think like Great Britain. Like the British, they were an island nation hanging off the coast of a huge continent, and they worried about China and Russia, the great land powers. Because Korea was essentially a strip of buffer zone between themselves and the Chinese, it became logical in their eyes that they should dominate and hold it as a means of putting space between themselves and the vastly larger Chinese Empire. This led to the first of two important wars for Japan—both of which had significant naval components—the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. It began when Japan’s navy attacked a Chinese troop convoy heading to reinforce Chinese troops in Korea—before war was declared, by the way—demonstrating the propensity to seize on surprise that they would again use five decades later in attacking the United States at Pearl Harbor. The war was short and sharp, and Japanese naval forces comported themselves well. Of note, the naval tactical debate of the period was about whether massive armor or heavy guns were most important in maritime combat, and the Battle of Yalu did not clearly demonstrate the superiority of either. What did emerge was the efficacy of using maneuverability and speed, as the Japanese did under Admiral Sukeyuki Ito. He split his force into a “Flying Squadron” of fast ships and a slower but still capable main squadron, and was able to rake the Chinese ships throughout the engagement with more rapid fire from faster ships. Over the next few months, the war became a rout, and ended in 1895 with Japan consolidating its possession of Korea, Formosa, and various other islands. In terms of geostrategic position, Japan was in the driver’s seat in the eastern Pacific. Now it needed to shore up its northern flank, which led to war with Russia. • • • THE RUSSIANS WERE ACTUALLY the cause of the Russo-Japanese War. After Japan’s victory over China, it was Russia that pushed against the Japanese Empire, demanding the demilitarization of the Korean Peninsula and taking Port Arthur as a warm-weather port. The Russians cooperated with other European powers and pushed hard against Japan’s expansion. This led to a war in 1904 for which the Russians were unprepared both militarily and politically. Militarily, the Russian fleet was split all around the periphery of that vast state and needed time to consolidate its forces. Politically, the rumblings that would eventually lead to the Russian Revolution and the fall of the czar were already apparent, and the ruling claque in St. Petersburg could not fully focus on the external conflict that was brewing on Russia’s Pacific coast. The Japanese, although numerically inferior, were able to concentrate their forces and attack early, preventing the Russians from building up strategically to challenge them. Fresh off the defeat of the Chinese fleet, the Japanese fleet again launched its first powerful attack before war was declared—a night torpedo raid conducted by Japanese destroyers that damaged important Russian warships caught in harbor. Despite the arrival of a dynamic new Russian admiral, Stepan Makarov (who died in a mine strike shortly thereafter), and the long sail of the Baltic Squadron to Pacific waters, the Russians never gained the tactical upper hand, and with the help of the interior strategic position and relatively newer technology, the Japanese prevailed. The Russians ended up losing their Pacific fleet and the key base of Port Arthur in January 1905. The final blow to Russia in the Pacific came when the Baltic Squadron was destroyed in May 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima, losing fifty of the fifty-three ships that had sailed from the Baltic beginning in October of the previous year. Faced with this complete loss of their fleet, the Russians were forced to settle the war in an agreement negotiated by U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt—for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Russians lost the war because they were outfought tactically in each engagement, but mainly because they failed strategically to concentrate their forces and were defeated piecemeal. This, by the way, constituted a crucial lesson for the United States on the importance of building a Panama Canal—otherwise the U.S. fleet would be essentially separated for months by the necessity to sail around the southern tip of South America to combine forces. An interesting side note was that the age- old principle of warship captains’ “striking their colors” and surrendering their ships was practiced for the last time in the Russo-Japanese War by the Russians. When the commanders came home, they were court-martialed and sentenced to death, ending for all intents and purposes the idea of surrender. Today, in the U.S. Navy and most other naval forces, the philosophy is definitely not one of striking the colors in gracious surrender, but rather “don’t give up the ship” and be willing to fight to the end. It was the occupation and buildup of the Hawaiian Islands that truly vaulted the United States into power in the Pacific. Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu, is a spectacular natural harbor, and I can vividly remember the first time I sailed into it in the late 1970s. I was still a very inexperienced deck watch officer, and the captain decreed that I should take the conn into port. It was blowing hard, and the breeze worried me as I tried to line up the ship and glide into the berth, something I’d watched my very salty captain do several times. I had foolishly declined to use an offered tug, and didn’t heed the advice of the experienced harbor pilot who was there to advise us: I wanted to do it all by myself, like a defiant toddler. Unfortunately for me, I simply kept too much “way” on the ship (meaning we were moving too fast) and managed to bang the stern hard against the pier, scraping off a lot of paint and putting a small, insignificant, but deeply embarrassing dent in the after starboard quarter of the ship. My captain sidled over and offered an observation from Admiral Ernest King, the tall, hard-driving Navy leader during the Second World War: “The mark of a great ship handler is never getting into a situation requiring great ship handling”—in other words, use the tugs and listen to the pilot. Lesson learned. After recovering my composure, I walked around the beautiful naval station later that day and realized that I was in America’s gateway to the Pacific, and the heart of the U.S. Navy. So much of the Navy’s modern ethos is tied up with the Pacific campaigns of World War II, and when I thought in those long ago days of the legendary officers who led the service through the war, I contemplated how comparatively small and circumscribed my own career would probably be —the cold war of the 1970s didn’t seem to offer much chance of massive fleet combat. Admirals like Nimitz, Spruance, Halsey, Kinkaid, and the other giants of the Pacific War had a sense of the vast landscape of the ocean that permitted them to construct the enormous, sweeping, island-hopping campaign that ultimately defeated the Japanese Empire. So much of the Navy’s mental map begins at Pearl Harbor and opens out from there to the endless distances of the ocean; so it was fitting and shattering at the same time to be attacked without warning in early December 1941 as war came to the United States. In order to understand the severity and totality of the Pacific Theater of World War II, you need to imagine the vast scale of the region and pair it with the fact that for the first time in history, military operations would cover the far reaches of the Pacific north of the equator and a good distance south. As the late William Manchester illustrates clearly in his excellent biography of five-star general of the Army Douglas MacArthur, American Caesar, the area of operations “covered mileage equivalent to that from the English Channel to the Persian Gulf—twice the farthest conquests of Alexander, Caesar, or Napoleon”—a comparison the ego-driven general would have enjoyed. That vast emptiness, which had taken outrigger canoes decades and steamships months to cross, could now be traversed in weeks. Technology did not just increase the power of ships but added new dimensions to war. Above the water, aircraft and radar altered the calculus of range. Below the surface, submarines could menace military ships and civilian shipping alike with little to no warning. The Pacific Ocean’s first experience as an arena of total war came at a time when war at sea was suddenly profoundly different from ages past. The early morning hours of December 7, 1941, on Hawaii were punctuated by the sound of airplane propellers and air raid sirens. Japanese naval aviation launched what was the largest air attack in history at that time. Planned by the brilliant and colorful Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, a graduate of Harvard and lover of American culture, the Pearl Harbor raid devastated both the U.S. fleet in harbor and its ground-based aircraft. But the jewels of the U.S. fleet, the aircraft carriers that were the primary target of the raid, were, by a stroke of dumb luck, out of the area when the attack happened and spared destruction. The battleships Arizona, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and California were not so lucky—caught in port on a quiet Sunday with much of their crews ashore, they were pounded by the Japanese and sunk. My wife, Laura, is today the “ship’s sponsor” for a new Navy destroyer, the USS John Finn, named for a Pearl Harbor Medal of Honor recipient, a high honor of which she is justifiably proud. She christened the ship in 2015 and will be part of the ship’s commissioning as well, continuing to have a relationship with the captain and crew throughout the life of the vessel. As a result, we have spent a fair amount of time learning about those terrible hours as an unexpected strike literally blew up the gorgeous harbor before the unbelieving eyes of Navy sailors. Chief Petty Officer John Finn organized a machine gun nest and returned fire with a “pickup” crew of sailors, receiving many shrapnel wounds in the process. He fought proudly through the rest of the war, and lived to be more than one hundred years old, always remembering the way the world changed forever on that quiet Sunday morning. That same day, on the other side of the Pacific, 5,500 miles away from Pearl Harbor, Japanese forces assaulted the United States in the Philippines. Just as in Hawaii, ground-based aircraft in the Philippines were devastated by the Japanese air assault. Unlike Hawaii, the Philippines were not one of the world’s most isolated island chains. Their proximity to occupied Indochina meant that Japan’s air assault could be followed by a ground invasion. Despite valiant resistance by American forces in the mountain redoubt of Corregidor on the Bataan Peninsula, the islands fell and would remain occupied until 1945. The Japanese war machine was churning in high gear and had not lost a battle. Things looked bleak in early 1942 for the United States and its Pacific allies. American fortunes turned upward at the Battle of Midway in June 1942. The Japanese war plan conceived of surprise attacks across the vast Pacific in order to dislocate American efforts and put Japan in the best position possible to deal with America’s demographic and industrial superiority. But in the waters around the small island of Midway, the United States was victorious despite having far fewer ships on hand in the early days of the war. Through another stroke of luck (just as at Pearl Harbor), the American carriers remained hidden from the Japanese because a mechanical failure delayed the departure of a Japanese reconnaissance plane by fifteen minutes. Unsure of the exact location of the U.S. fleet, the Japanese commanders nonetheless decided to switch the weapons carried by their planes from bombs (to target the American fortresses on Midway Island) to torpedoes (to target the American fleet). The cat-and-mouse game came out in the Americans’ favor as the Japanese aircraft were caught on the decks of their carriers in mid-transition between armaments thanks to the fifteen-minute delay. These aircraft were nearly defenseless and were largely destroyed on deck. The result was a catastrophe for the Japanese as four of Japan’s carriers, the same ones that had participated in the Pearl Harbor raid, were sent to the bottom of the Pacific along with Japan’s hopes of holding out against America’s numerical superiority later in the war. As one of the Japanese combatants at Midway, Commander Masatake Okumiya (later a lieutenant general in the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force), said in the book Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan, “The Pacific War was started by men who did not understand the sea and fought by men who did not understand the air.” With the victory at Midway, the Americans could begin to advance across the Pacific in two prongs. The first prong, led by the Navy under Admiral Chester Nimitz, went across the North Pacific by hopping from island to island, using the islands once coveted as coaling stations as refueling points for ships and aircraft. Meanwhile, the South Pacific campaign was led by the Army general Douglas MacArthur, pushing up from his exile in Australia back toward the Philippines. The people fighting under his command found conditions as brutal as their compatriots in the North Pacific; the jungles of Indonesia and New Guinea bore deadly traps and virulent diseases. Those same passages of water like the Torres Strait, which one day I would be so nervous about navigating, were then full of Japanese defenses that posed a vastly more lethal threat than simply submerged reefs. The going was hard for both campaigns. But the slow, methodical pace yielded fruit, resources were cut off from the Japanese, U.S. industrial might began to tell, and Japan’s strategic options were increasingly foreclosed. Japan’s eventual capitulation was inevitable, although the island-by-island defenses were at times fanatical. The prospect of a land invasion of the home islands was predicted to cost enormous casualties on both sides—leading to the decision to use nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The long war, culminating in the two atomic bombs, the firebombing of Tokyo, and the subsequent psychological impact of the occupation, headed up by General MacArthur, devastated the Japanese home islands. For Japan, it would be a long period of rebuilding and a withdrawal from global military and security affairs for many years. It is worth remembering the other two admirals who led the fight in the Pacific, serving under the iconic Nimitz: Admiral William “Bull” Halsey (although he hated the nickname) and Admiral Raymond Spruance. Halsey’s life was brilliantly captured in Admiral Bill Halsey: A Naval Life by Thomas Alexander Hughes, and Spruance’s equally well in The Quiet Warrior by Thomas Buell. The two men could not have been more different: Halsey impulsive, tempestuous, and loud, while Spruance was quiet, cerebral, and deeply reflective. But Nimitz harnessed their different personalities and skill sets and together they led the grandest naval campaign in history, equal to the challenges of distance, time, and determined resistance. Their names remain irrevocably bound to the Pacific Ocean, and will remain so as long as sailors go to sea in warships. Sadly, conflict would not disappear from the region as the Korean War would break out several years after the end of World War II, and of course the U.S. war in Vietnam would follow just over a decade later. But on the vast expanse of ocean itself, the Pacific once again became peaceful. To be sure, there were cold war tensions above and below the waves. The Soviet navy, under the long tenure of Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, expanded its presence in the Pacific for the first time since Russia’s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Submarines armed with nuclear warheads prowled the oceans to provide a stealthy nuclear deterrent while surface ships on both sides tried their best to find and track their opponents. But the islands and the peoples themselves were largely untouched. The period of U.S. trusteeship over the islands it seized from Japan in the western Pacific morphed into the Compact of Free Association, an agreement with the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau, which continues to this day. The return of peace, the economic revival of Japan, and the emergence of new economic powerhouses in Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong led transpacific trade to overtake transatlantic trade for the first time in the 1980s. That trend also continues. Are we living in a Pacific Century? It is hard to say. Certainly the Obama administration thought so, announcing a “pivot to the Pacific” several years ago that ended up being more sound than light given events in the Middle East and the resurgence of Russia. But the Pacific region still boasts most of the world’s largest and most powerful countries, and economic power is moving inexorably that way. The United States, China, Japan, and Russia all frequently call themselves Pacific powers, and the region is home to a host of other vibrant countries as well, including Australia, Korea, Canada, Mexico, Indonesia, Colombia, and Chile. Almost half of the world’s trade happens along the Pacific Rim. And this is just the beginning, especially as India begins to engage in the Pacific in more significant ways. Countries across the Pacific Rim are developing ways to spur economic development of the region, whether it is through the TransPacific Partnership (an agreement that I hope one day will be ratified by all parties) or China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (which I hope evolves into a responsible actor), to unlock the region’s potential. Although the Pacific has a great deal of potential, it is still a region of great risk. Overfishing remains a dangerous strain on the sustainability of global fish stocks, as does the continued increase of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Human pollution is taking a toll on the region’s ecosystem with a Texas-size island of plastic circulating both above and below the surface of the Pacific. On the environmental front, the Pacific Ocean experiences terrible typhoons that menace the region, particularly the areas on the front lines such as the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. The increasing frequency of these storms (regarded by many scientists as the result of global climate change) will be a source of untold suffering and economic backsliding unless the players in the region make sensible investments in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) capabilities. Military and civilian agencies around the region need to work together to ensure that they are equipped to deal with these challenges. On the geopolitical and security front, one powerful indicator worth watching closely is the increasingly tense state of the ongoing arms race around the Pacific —which is real and growing. It will have a tendency to increase the possibility of open conflict in the region, and will require delicate diplomacy as military options tempt nations to use the military forces upon which they have spent a great deal of national wealth. And the vast majority of the systems are designed to be used either on, below, or from the sea to attack neighbors around the rim of the western Pacific. Data from 2013 to the present reveal a preference to modernize systems rather than simply increase the size of the active force within a country. The trends in the macrodata are striking. According to The Military Balance, defense spending in Asia broadly (including India) rose 9 percent, from $326 billion to $356 billion from 2013 to 2015. As points of comparison, defense spending over the same period of time in the United States fell 6 percent, from $633 to $597 billion, and in Europe fell 12 percent, from $281 billion to $246 billion. How do we temper this arms race and ensure the security of the Pacific Rim? North Korea, the most unpredictable and dangerous nation on the Pacific Rim, has more than doubled its military spending to about $10 billion from 2013 to 2015. While it is notoriously difficult to assess the actual spending inside this isolated nation, recent nuclear tests combined with long-range missile testing and road-mobile launchers are obvious causes for concern. The North Koreans will continue to prioritize high levels of defense spending, even in the face of harsh new sanctions and a weakened economic environment—the young leader, Kim Jong-un, knows that only through military might will he retain his grip on power internally and maintain some level of influence in the region. China is the source of a disproportionately large portion of the increase in Pacific Ocean defense spending. China increased its defense spending by 26 percent to almost $147 billion between 2013 and 2016—and these numbers tell just part of the story; actual defense spending may well be more than $200 billion. The most visible display of China’s aggressive approach is the construction of artificial islands that serve as a handful of “3,000-acre aircraft carriers” (a U.S. 100,000-ton aircraft carrier is only 7 acres, by the way) on permanent station in the disputed regions of the South China Sea. This policy decision puts China at odds with many nations throughout the region. Building radar and missile systems as well as airfields on its artificial islands is another key investment. Other Chinese technological and strategic advances can be seen in China’s investment in advanced fighters such as the J-20 and the J-31, the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile known as the “carrier killer,” and its own nascent attempts at building an aircraft carrier fleet. These advances, when combined with its focus on offensive cyber, will enable China to push past its current so-called antiaccess/area denial (A2/AD) strategy to a more active defense, which would improve its ability to project offensive power. This will be a game changer in the region. Strategically, China is by far the biggest military spender in the region, but must also cover more territory both ashore and at sea than other Asian nations. The shift from ”peaceful development” to the notion of “active defense” is likely designed to mask internal problems and attempt to shift the focus of its population away from its own contradictions to external challenges. Capable missiles like the DF-21D alter the risk calculation for the United States, especially for carriers. Finally, there is quite a bit of focus on China’s aircraft carrier program. Chinese carriers are not competitive relative to those of the United States. However, as a “prestige platform,” they are symbolically important and conceivably useful in maritime combat against smaller powers in the region. The irony here is that China’s carrier is threatened by the very same A2/AD technologies it champions as Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam all up their game in that regard. Strategically speaking, the Chinese carrier program is not a game changer, but it will unnerve many smaller neighbors. Given all of this, it is important to think about American capabilities and potential responses at sea. The United States, with its six heavy nuclear-powered carriers and dozens of sophisticated air defense cruisers and destroyers plus long-range bombers operating from Guam, still has a powerful maritime position in the region. The construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea plus the increased capability of the long-range ship attack missiles by China shift, but do not fully reverse, the balance of power in Asia, especially given the strength of U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea. Other nations in and around the Pacific are likewise ramping up spending, including Japan, which announced an increase to its 2016 defense budget, the first such increase in more than a decade. The stated policy focus of Japan’s drive for security is “seamless integration” with the United States. Japan is adding significant missile defense, airborne surveillance, and advanced aircraft to its already highly capable forces. Another ambitious capability acquisition includes the desire to field an Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade by 2017. This capability will integrate ground, naval, air, cyber, and space domains. Japan’s technological edge makes it the second most powerful navy in the world, and its air force and army are quite capable as well. Ensuring that its security policy matches its defense capacity and capability enhances its importance to the United States in a collective defense scenario. Although Japan’s record defense budget of $42 billion in 2016 is relatively low when compared with China’s, its focus is clear and local and will reduce operational seams to complement its most important treaty ally: the United States. Japan has reduced spending for its Ground Self-Defense Force and increased both Air and Maritime Self-Defense Forces—clearly showing that its priorities are aligned with its policy shift to support collective defense. These investments are relevant in a confrontational scenario with China. On the other hand, China’s spending on defense must cover more territory and focus on internal security. While the exact ratio of external-to-internal defense spending is unclear, we do know that internal defense concerns will continue to act as a brake on its external ambitions. South Korea continues to invest in technology while increasing the quality (as opposed to quantity) of its personnel. Although the South Korean defense budget increased 6 percent from 2013 to 2015, it shed 4 percent of its manpower in the same period. It is acquiring major systems: upgrading its fleet of F-16 jet fighters, seeking an F-X program to develop a sixth-generation fighter, and developing a new unmanned airborne vehicle for its army and marine corps. While still reliant on the United States for air and missile defense, South Korea continues to pursue a Korean-operated air and missile defense in light of the threats it faces from Pyongyang. Meanwhile, Australia, another staunch ally of the United States, has increased defense spending by about 7 percent and focused on combat aircraft and ships, including upgrades to its diesel submarine force. While beyond the far reaches of the Pacific Ocean, India is notable as the only country, besides China, that increased the size of its active military personnel roster between 2013 and 2015 (2 percent, the same as China). This came in tandem with a significant increase to its military budget. A central focus of this increase serves to drive defense production within India’s borders in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” initiative. New procurement runs the gamut across sectors: new tactical helicopters, new Rafale fighters (despite continuing issues in the negotiations between France and India), and additional heavy airlift transports—with a significant uptick in spending on American systems. Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and other actors are likewise stepping up their defense spending with a focus on a potential war at sea. This maritime arms race in Asia comes from each state’s perception of external threats. A worst-case scenario would see the region falling into the so- called Thucydides trap, where miscalculation of intentions leads to armed conflict—either between the United States and China globally, or possibly between China and Japan in the region. The best chance we have to avoid conflict rests in maritime diplomacy. This must begin with a continued high-level U.S.-Chinese conversation about points of friction, from artificial islands (and the resultant “freedom of navigation” patrols by the United States) to cyber intrusions to balance of trade disagreements. The United States should encourage cooperation between its allies in the region (i.e., Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, and others) in a way that does not create an Asian cold war between China and a U.S.-led bloc of nations. Additionally, Pacific Rim nations should be encouraged to use their militaries for exercises, training, and other confidence-building measures—like the U.S.- organized RIMPAC annual exercise, which has seen solid Chinese participation. This helps build confidence and military-to-military cooperation. And the nations of the region can also work together on soft-power projects using their militaries for disaster relief, humanitarian operations, and medical diplomacy in the coming decades. The Pacific Ocean arms race is real and it is dangerous. Transparency, cooperation, and diplomacy can mitigate the potential for open conflict. Now is the time to put such mechanisms in place—before nations are tempted to reach for the military instrument and exercise hard power in addressing their geopolitical concerns. Despite the tensions and the risks in our modern Pacific Rim, the odds are better than even that the region will develop peacefully. None of the societies have a long tradition of imperialist behavior, and most have found ways to cooperate and collaborate in a variety of dimensions, despite the arms buildup. Other than North Korea, which is by far the most dangerous actor in the region, there seems little likelihood of any of the nations’ moving to open warfare as an instrument of policy. There will probably be some flash points in and around the South China Sea, but the chances of nation-on-nation high-level combat are low. The Pacific Ocean that I sailed into in the 1970s as a naïve, young, and unformed officer as the cold war unfolded was a more dangerous place. Today’s major actors—Japan, Korea, China, the United States—all know well the devastation of a Pacific war at sea. The strength of commerce, depth of culture, and quality of human capital of the nations in the region all point to the potential for a positive trajectory of growth. While the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula present challenges and tension, hopefully the Pacific will live up to its name as the twenty-first century sails along; much will depend on the willingness of the actors around its vast littoral to work together around the ocean that binds their fate together in so many ways. On the other hand, the potential for an explosive war—perhaps on the Korean Peninsula, or between Japan and China—looms on the horizon like a tempest headed our way. The twenty-first century in the Pacific has many unexpected twists ahead. 2. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN THE CRADLE OF COLONIZATION Pascoal Roiz’s famous 1633 map showing the Atlantic world.

Ward Bay Mediterranean Much has been made about the twenty-first century being the Age of the Pacific. And indeed, many metrics would suggest that the Pacific—especially when considered as the Indo-Pacific, to include the waters surrounding South Asia and the Indian subcontinent—will be the dominant sea space of this unfolding century. The Obama administration’s famous “pivot to the Pacific” (now tempered as a “rebalance to the Pacific” in the wake of events in the Middle East and Europe) seemed to validate that concept. Yet no matter where the world is headed in terms of the importance of the oceans relative to one another, there is one inescapable fact about the Atlantic: it will always be the cradle of our civilization as we know it, especially when the Mediterranean is included in its broad remit, and also when we consider that it formed the nexus of exchange between European nations, newly formed North American states, Latin American civilizations, the Caribbean, and Africa. When I think of the Atlantic Ocean, I am occasionally reminded of Louis Malle’s small masterpiece of a film, Atlantic City, which came out in 1980. Set in that city, it features an aging Burt Lancaster as a fading mobster named Lou seeking to help a young Canadian on the run, played by Susan Sarandon. Musing on the beauty and power of the Atlantic Ocean when he was a young up-and- comer, Lou says in all sincerity, “You should have seen the Atlantic Ocean back then.” Somehow I doubt the Atlantic had changed a great deal over the few decades of Lou’s life, but its power to impress has been with mankind for centuries. The Atlantic Ocean is the world’s second largest, after the Pacific, covering more than 40 million square miles (more than ten times the size of the United States*) and about 20 percent of the earth’s surface. The name derives from the ancient Greek mythological character Atlas, who in legend supported the world on his shoulders. The ocean is really composed of two distinct regions, often referred to as “basins,” one on either side of the equator, and overall forms the letter S if viewed from space. Any casual observer looking at the west coast of Africa and the east coast of South America would quickly guess that the two continents drifted apart at some point in prehistory, the space between them creating the landscape of the ocean’s sea bottom. The Atlantic has two key tributary seas—the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, as well as an important strategic gap to the north (the Greenland- Iceland–United Kingdom gap), which was a nautical zone of competition and near conflict in the cold war. To the south, it is connected with its two sister oceans, the Pacific and the Indian, by a relatively small strait, the Drake Passage to the Pacific, and by a broad expanse of ocean water to the Indian Ocean in the east. Including the two tributary seas, it is bordered by nearly a hundred nations and territories, ranging in size and economic power from the vast scope and scale of the United States and Brazil to tiny countries like Belize and Montserrat. • • • MY OWN FIRST IMPRESSIONS of the Atlantic are from the early 1960s, when, as a very small boy, I sailed with my family from New York to Athens, Greece, where my father—an active-duty Marine officer—was headed for an assignment at the U.S. embassy. Sailing in those days on a large cruise liner was a throwback to the great liners of the twenties and thirties—terrific food, small but elegant staterooms, and plenty of open bars. We were on SS Constitution, which offered many programs for children, but all I wanted to do was watch the ocean roll by. I was endlessly fascinated by the way the surface of the ocean could form at one moment a smooth skin like a trampoline, and the next be full of chopped whitecaps, and as quickly turn into long but smooth ocean waves. It was the show that never ended, full of colors and light and high-flying seabirds in shades of gray and white. For a very small boy, it was mesmerizing. On the way, we sailed through the Mediterranean, stopping at Lisbon and Rome before arriving in Piraeus Harbor, the gateway to Athens in our ethnic homeland of Greece. I returned to the Atlantic in a serious way just over a decade later, in the early 1970s, when I sailed in the then brand-new aircraft carrier USS Nimitz. As a midshipman just over twenty years of age, about to enter my final year at the Naval Academy, I sailed from Norfolk into the rolling, dark blue waters of the Gulf Stream, one of the most distinctive features of the western Atlantic. This current, which forms itself originally off the west coast of Africa, travels across the Central Atlantic as a sort of river within the ocean. It bounces off the northeast coast of South America, splits into two parts, then reforms and heads north through and beyond the Strait of Florida. The Gulf Stream is typically about sixty to seventy miles wide and almost four thousand feet deep, with a high velocity near the surface, approaching five miles per hour in places. Colonial navigators became very aware of it in the eighteenth century, although mariners argued over the best way to use its speed and pace to best advantage. It has figured in many works of literature and films, and the sense you have of it as a mariner is one of relentless flow and power, moving everything in its path deeper and deeper into the North Atlantic. In a famously long and pedantic sentence, Hemingway laid out a comprehensive if somewhat tedious description of the Gulf Stream, one that would probably require drinking a Papa Hemingway–size daiquiri to get through. It is a feature of the Atlantic that continues to fascinate writers. • • • THE FIRST EUROPEANS TO VENTURE into the Atlantic were probably the ancient Greeks, although the extent of their travels beyond what is today called the Strait of Gibraltar and was known to them as the Pillars of Hercules is shrouded in legend, myth, and mystery. A central part of the mystery involves the reputed existence of the mythical city of Atlantis. To get a sense of how the Greeks envisioned the physical world, go back to ancient mythology, much of which I learned from my father while a small boy in Greece in the 1960s. According to the myths, the titan Atlas held up the world with arms that never wearied, standing at the very end of the earth before the Hesperides—a collective name for a blissful group of nymphs who resided in a garden at the edge of Oceanus, the ocean that encircled the world. Not exactly precise mapping. A variety of early explorers began to penetrate the mystery of the Atlantic as early as the sixth century A.D., including an Irish abbot, Saint Brendan, also known as “the Navigator.” The voyages of this ecclesiastical character were supposedly in search of converts, few of whom would have been found at sea. Some records indicate his voyages took him to the rest of the British Isles (Scotland and Wales) and possibly across the English Channel to Brittany. The extent of the legends of Brendan the Navigator have him making it to icebergs off the coast of Greenland and possibly the south shore of Iceland. None of what such early explorers managed to learn was made widely available to others, and the Atlantic continued to reflect real mystery and danger to the European world. On the Atlantic’s western coast, the widely scattered indigenous settlements in the Americas did not appear to move beyond minor coastal voyaging—leaving a vast tract of unexplored ocean. Not until the time of the Vikings in the period from A.D. 800 to 1000 is there evidence of recorded voyages into the open Atlantic. The first real settlements in Iceland were probably Viking, perhaps in the late 800s. There are recorded voyages in the late 900s, including one by Bjarni Herjolfsson, who was evidently driven west by fierce storms from the relatively known waters around Iceland and Greenland and reported seeing heavy forests to the west. This voyage has led some observers to credit the Vikings with the first sighting of the New World, linking Europe and North America by the maritime highway that continues to matter so deeply today. By the tenth and eleventh centuries there appear to have been settlements in present-day Canada—Labrador and Newfoundland. Some reports exist of “Viking relics” that supposedly have been found as far inland as Minnesota and the upper Midwest, although the vast majority of serious scholars discount those as urban legends run wild. It is hard to imagine what a Viking would have thought about the fact that in today’s world more than $4 trillion passes annually between the two continents, reflecting the largest trading relationship in the world economy. There is a bit of an academic debate over whether all of the Viking activity constitutes actually “discovering” the New World or merely reaching it. In his brilliant work on this topic, Daniel Boorstin makes a distinction between such voyages of exploration and the act of discovery, in the sense that discovery implies providing feedback to European civilization that would cause a real change in its worldview.* What is clear is that the early voyagers like the Irish and Vikings opened the Atlantic world as we understand it today—a maritime bridge of enormous importance. In the end, they were more sailors at sea than colonizers ashore. It was the warmer-weather voyagers in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries—led by the intrepid Portuguese—who not only explored but also discovered and colonized the Atlantic world both at sea and ashore. In a way, this is the difference between the oceans themselves—which are but glittering passages across which the world’s trade, commerce, research, and security are conducted—and the riches of the vast lands that the world of the seas connects. • • • MY FIRST TRIP ACROSS the North Atlantic as a ship captain was in the mid-1990s. My ship, USS Barry, was a brand-new Arleigh Burke–class guided missile destroyer with a crew of about three hundred and a huge array of missiles for air defense, land attack, and killing submarines—a so-called multimission warship. Given that the ship was named for Captain John Barry, a Revolutionary War hero of Irish descent, we were sent across the North Atlantic in the early summer of 1994, bound initially for goodwill visits in Ireland. After a brief stop there, we would head into potential combat operations in the Arabian Gulf. As we sailed across the broad expanse of the rolling Atlantic over that Memorial Day, I was struck by the differences and similarities we experienced compared with early voyagers. We had all the comforts of home—good hot food and showers, pleasant bunk rooms, communications with family and friends back home (although limited compared with today), plenty of fuel brought out to us at sea by wide-ranging oilers (ships designated to act as at-sea gas stations). While our accommodations were not luxurious, compared with a Viking long ship we were living like kings at sea, sailing in a well-heeled palace—a very different world. But the impetus was the same: we sailed on a mission for our country, left our families for a long, seven-month voyage, faced real danger in our ultimate destination—the volatile Arabian Gulf in the time of Saddam Hussein—and felt between us the same bond that sailors have felt going back two thousand years or more. We were hardly Vikings, nor faced the sea in such a dramatic way, but we were in every sense part of the long story of the Atlantic Ocean. We knew where we were headed, but not what would unfold. In the end, that uncertainty and sense of adventure is a significant part of what draws many of us to the oceans. • • • THE FOURTEENTH AND FIFTEENTH CENTURIES saw key improvements in sailing technology. The frail, single-mast Viking ship—which was really a simple adaptation of what the Greeks and Romans used in the Mediterranean nearly a millennium earlier—gave way to multiple masts, a bowsprit to carry sail in front of the ship, and a handful of sails. The compass came into general use, as well as simple means of measuring speed using knotted ropes (hence the term “knots” for the speed of a ship). The necessity of “dead reckoning,” which is using landmarks ashore to plot a course, was gradually resolved by using celestial means to navigate, which improved gradually. As trade goods—especially spices, gold, jewelry, perfumes, dyes, and gems—began to flow, the appetite for longer and longer voyages increased. Whether or not we credit the Irish (or more likely the Vikings) with the first significant European voyages across the Atlantic, what is indisputable is the early and enormous impact of the Portuguese. The most iconic of these intrepid figures was Infante Henrique of Portugal, Duke of Viseu, who earned the sobriquet Prince Henry the Navigator. He lived in the first half of the fifteenth century and launched many expeditions throughout the early 1400s that sailed down the Atlantic and explored the coast of Africa. His taste for exploration and profit was whetted early in his life by a crusade conducted against the city of Ceuta, in what is today Morocco—there he discovered spices, gold, silver, and the other potential riches of the Atlantic coast of the massive continent to the south. He also gathered to himself many of the best navigators and sailors of the day in an informal “maritime court” in Sagres, near Lisbon, which he presided over with enthusiasm. While there is a fair amount of scholarly debate over the degree to which Henry actually conducted regularized meetings of this “court,” it seems reasonable to say that upon occasion he brought together maritime experts and drew from their collective wisdom. Prince Henry sponsored many of the voyages that both solidified knowledge of the world to the south and permitted the expansion of new techniques of sailing and navigation. The caravel, a type of lightweight, lateen-rigged ship (sails fore and aft instead of squared up to the stern of the ship), was crucial to these explorations. While small, caravels could be operated in small flotillas and could sail not only down the coast of Africa, but, crucially, back up the coast by beating into the wind. The expression “sailing close to the wind,” implying taking risk and going against the normal flow of events, comes from lateen- rigged sailing caravels. The Portuguese navigators of the time also perfected the use of the various prevalent winds and currents in the Atlantic to sail first southwest from Lisbon and Lagos to ports on the equatorial coast of Africa, then north and west— actually away from home—but finally swinging back to the northeast around the vicinity of the Azores Islands and catching the so-called Portugal current for home. This huge triangular passage was called the volta do mar or the “turn of the sea.” A smaller version of it consisted of sailing to a mid-distance port on the African coast, then heading northwest to the Canary Islands before turning for home. Taking advantage of both currents and winds (which were known as the Gyre of the Atlantic) allowed European explorations to unfold with increasing frequency. The technology of the caravels allowed for expeditions via these two routes that thoroughly exploited the vast northwestern coast of Africa, from the ancient port of Ceuta on the southern point of the Strait of Gibraltar down to the first major fort built by the Portuguese off the coast of modern Mauritania on the island of Arguin—which they held for two centuries, until the mid-1600s. After the death of Prince Henry in the middle of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese voyages continued under a new generation of sailors who had literally grown up in the culture of exploration. Three of the key sea captains were Bartolomeu Dias, Vasco da Gama, and Pedro Álvares Cabral. Dias, for example, departed the White Tower on the River Tagus in the late 1480s and worked his way around the Cape of Good Hope (more or less accidentally, as legend holds it was a storm that blew him east) after a year-and-a-half voyage. Da Gama pushed farther and was the first European to touch the Indian subcontinent at the very end of the fifteenth century. In the first year of the sixteenth century, Cabral discovered Brazil, and continued on the first known voyage to touch four continents: Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia on the Indian subcontinent. Taken together, the exploits of these and other Portuguese sea captains gradually opened the southwestern coast of Africa, helped build up trading routes, continued the search for the legendary Christian kingdom of Prester John (never found), and eventually rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed into the Indian Ocean. Their great voyages of discovery inspired Europeans, exploited Africans (often with extreme brutality), and created the connections between the Atlantic and Indian oceans over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Some have called this the dawn of the Oceanic Age. My first sea voyage into Lisbon and up the Tagus River was in 1962 on SS Constitution, while our family was headed to Athens for my father’s three-year tour as the assistant naval attaché. An infantry officer at the time, he was not particularly enamored of sea voyages, but I remember loving the experience of being under way. Our first port after departing Boston was Lisbon, and we sailed up the Tagus on a hot summer day. Even as a seven-year-old boy, I was enchanted by the ships swaying on the waterfront, the wide and beautiful river, the gleaming white tower from which each of the Portuguese captains after the early 1500s departed on the voyages that opened the world. Decades later, I would return to Lisbon as a grizzled four-star admiral with many commands at sea and too many sea miles under my belt to remember—and the magic of that tower felt the same. As I toured the Portuguese maritime museum a few blocks from the waterfront, I was struck by the courage it must have taken to sail away from all you knew—a European and Christian world, a vibrant society, a loving family—to launch into an unknown void to the south. As they watched that white tower—by then known as the Belém Tower, recede from view, how they must have been torn between a longing for home and a thirst for the sea, like sailors everywhere. • • • COLUMBUS AND HIS FAMOUS VOYAGES of 1492 are discussed in more depth in the chapter on the Caribbean, but it is worth noting that he initially offered his services to the Portuguese and was turned down, finally winning the trust and financing (as well as the affection) of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand of Spain. He initially sailed south toward West Africa, but turned westward, taking advantage of favorable winds. In just over a month, he changed the course of world history with his landing in what is today the Bahamas. Eventually styled “Admiral of the Ocean Sea,” perhaps the most pompous title in maritime history, he completed three more voyages to the “New World” that would bear his imprint for centuries. By the sixteenth century, just a few decades later, voyages across the Atlantic were becoming more and more common. Of note, within twenty years of Christopher Columbus’s “discovery” of the New World, Ferdinand Magellan, whose expedition would later circumnavigate the earth, sailed on a voyage that resulted in discovery of a passage connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans at the bottom of the world—the Strait of Magellan at the tip of South America. Ironically, Magellan was Portuguese by birth, but sailing under commission to the Spanish throne. As we’ve seen, he would not survive his circumnavigation of the world, but his deeds and the resulting changes in cartography influenced the rising mariners of France and England, who next began to sail the Atlantic waters, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. While the Portuguese and Spanish led the way across the Atlantic to the Caribbean and South America, the British and the French concentrated on North America. By the end of the fifteenth century, John Cabot—ironically an Italian, sailing for the British crown—explored Newfoundland, but was subsequently lost on a follow-up expedition with five ships. This had a bit of a chilling effect on British exploration, and it was roughly a century before the Brits returned in numbers across the Atlantic. As the sixteenth century unfolded, both the French and the British established colonies in what is today Canada, as well as settlements along the Atlantic coast of the modern-day United States. In Britain, a nautical tradition emerged in the 1500s under Henry VIII, who commissioned the building of the first national warships. They featured heavy cannons that were muzzle loaded, and towers fore and aft to afford height from which to shoot down upon opposing mariners. The use of multiple cannons firing together became known as the “broadside,” and was used to devastating effect in nautical warfare for the next five hundred years, until the advent of aircraft and long-range missiles in the mid-twentieth century. By the late sixteenth century, the battle for geopolitical supremacy between England and Spain was in full flower, exacerbated by the religious wars that came following the Reformation and Henry’s decision to break with the Catholic Church and reject the authority of the pope. English sea rovers, who were essentially pirates formally authorized by the crown and called “privateers,” became strategic weapons in the duel between England and Spain. Two of the most feared were John Hawkins and Francis Drake. Their ships, notably Drake’s Golden Hind, ravaged the coast of South America in the late 1500s. This led to one of the epic battles of the Atlantic—the attack of the Spanish Armada, sometimes known as the Grand Armada. A massive force for the times, it consisted of well over a hundred vessels, a thousand cannons, and nearly thirty thousand men. All of this was assembled while Spain was simultaneously fighting in the present-day Netherlands, which along with Germany was essentially ground zero of the wars of the Reformation. The English were able to muster more than thirty heavy men-of-war, and by dint of armed merchantmen eventually put to sea nearly two hundred ships. The crucial difference was that the English ships were smaller, lighter, and more maneuverable, and expert sailors manned them. The Spanish ships were heavier (with broadsides more than double in firepower) and had shorter-range cannons. The battle, which took place in the waters off the English coast, was notable for being the first significant clash between sailing fleets, as well as a pivotal moment in the confrontation between Catholicism and Protestantism. The exchanges included firing many tens of thousands of rounds between the two sides, but without great effect because of the significant distances between the fleets. The Spanish reached their first objective, the French port of Calais, where they were to take on additional troops before crossing the Channel and invading England. Unfortunately for the Spanish, they had expended most of their heavy shot and could not be resupplied from distant armories in Spain, while the English, with the home court advantage, were able to reload. Despite this advantage, the English were not able to crush the Spanish fleet but rather chased them into the North Sea and eventually back to Spain—a voyage that was interrupted by terrible storms and bad navigation, which, between them, account for dozens of sunken Spanish ships. When the Armada limped back into Spain, it was half its original size. “God breathed and they were scattered” is inscribed on the English victory medals. Over the next century, the remarkable Dutch began to emerge as a competing nautical power with designs on the Atlantic and other territory in the New World. In the 1600s, there were three wars between the English and the Dutch, which did not turn out well for the Hollanders—the British enjoyed a significant strategic advantage by sitting astride the sea lanes over which the Dutch needed to sail to make it into the open waters of the Atlantic. This was the period of the Commonwealth in England, and Oliver Cromwell had a deep distrust of admirals (I am sorry to report) and decided to send his generals (who normally commanded only land forces, of course) to sea in order to take command. This led, of course, to more orderly tactics of columns and the so-called line ahead, which competed with the “melee school” of simply putting your ship next to the enemy vessel with alacrity. By the 1700s, when England and now France were engaged in Atlantic warfare, command had returned to the sailors—but the general approach of fighting in column and with precise maneuvers stayed central to maritime warfare. The Seven Years’ War in the mid-1700s can be regarded as the first truly global conflict, with France and England fighting in the Atlantic and its tributary seas, the Mediterranean and Caribbean, as well as in the Pacific and ashore in all of those locations. Britain developed a strategy that served it well for the next three hundred years of aligning with a continental European power to create a geopolitical balance against its major foe—in this case France. The English would hit at various points around the world, including a central campaign against French colonies globally and against France’s fleet in the Atlantic, while holding French ships in port by blockading and counting on continental allies (in this case, Prussia) to threaten France ashore. Sometimes known as “Pitt’s Plan” after the creative geostrategic genius William Pitt, who conceived it, some variation on this approach continued to be seminal for England for the next three centuries. France tried to respond by defending its colonies and threatening to invade England. In the end, British mastery of the seas was decisive, and Britain ended with possession of Canada and significant gains in the Caribbean Sea. The Seven Years’ War demonstrated the power of a global naval force and control of the sea lanes of communication as the key to winning wars. What is notable in the gradual progress of the Europeans across the Atlantic is the degree to which exploration led inexorably to transformation. In addition to the technical improvements in sailing technique, sails, rigging, and hull form that flowed from the requirement for longer voyages and the urgent need to sail opposing the wind, the other major transformation was the result of the discovery and return to Europe of new agrarian products. Diet began to change in Europe as a result of the flora and fauna hauled back, initially as curiosities, then increasingly as commercial products. This has been called the Columbian Exchange or the New World Exchange. Just as the Europeans brought “guns, germs, and steel” to Africa and the Americas across the Atlantic Ocean (as writer Jared Diamond describes in his classic work of the same name), the New World sent products back. Tomatoes, potatoes, rubber, vanilla, chocolate, corn, and tobacco came from the New World, while Europe sent onions, citrus, bananas, mangos, wheat, and rice. Livestock sailed largely from Europe to the Americas, fundamentally changing lives there—horses, pigs, donkeys, dogs, cats, bees, and chickens were all introduced as a result of the Atlantic bridge. Discovery of the two new continents created new trade routes for the Europeans, including, over time, the flow of human slaves to the Americas to work plantations (notably sugar, cotton, and tobacco) with finished products then returning to Europe. This “Middle Passage” of human slaves was tragic and horrific, and indeed has come to reflect the worst moments of Atlantic history. Slavery formed but one part of an enormous migration across the Atlantic that has continued to this day, resulting in the eventual settlement of more than a billion people in the Americas today. All of this helped create the basis in the eighteenth century for the Industrial Revolution, which was enhanced by the trade in raw materials and the flow of humans across the Atlantic. With the increase in trade and commerce, and the attendant rise in industrial capability, came great-power geopolitics. Gradually, the five imperial powers of the Atlantic Ocean—France, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal—embroiled themselves in a series of colonial wars that required the Atlantic to serve as a maritime battlefield, a logistic bridge to support military campaigns in the Americas, and a highway for the economic advancement that fueled the wars. Over the next two centuries, what might be termed the “Wars of the Atlantic” were fought both ashore in the Americas and in Europe, as well as at sea. Essentially the competition was over the products of the New World—the riches that flowed from gold, silver, slaves, sugar, tobacco, fish, furs, manufactured goods, and the markets themselves. The imperial powers realized that what we would call today “sea control” was an essential element of national power. While a coherent theoretical framework to describe their strategies would have to wait another couple of centuries and the writings of Alfred Thayer Mahan, this was sea power at play on a broader scale than had ever been seen in human history. The rise of great oceangoing vessels—both commercial and warships—created the engine of sea control and power projection that came to dominate global politics for centuries and still exists today. All of that was birthed in the Atlantic Ocean. In the United States, the relatively small region of New England began to develop as the first truly global maritime hub for the Americas. Rudimentary shipyards began to emerge in the decades leading up to the American Revolution, and the independence and wealth they generated were central to the ability of the colonies to eventually break away from the British crown. Naturally, the disputes at the heart of the revolution fell out of the Atlantic trade, from the imposition of taxation without representation to the growing sense of liberty and freedom owed to men and women who had sailed into the unknown and created a new political entity with increasingly different norms and behaviors. The trading routes grew increasingly complex, to include lumber, meat, grain, tar, resin, pitch, rice, and indigo by the middle of the 1700s; literally thousands of ships were engaged in this trade, with hundreds of warships protecting and escorting them, as well as fighting a series of skirmishes, battles, and wars at sea. Alongside this legitimate trade and military protection, of course, was a flourishing pirate culture centered in the Caribbean, an area that afforded many advantages to piratical activity, as we’ll see: many small inlets and bays, tiny islands, temperate weather most of the year, and the natural geopolitical chaos resulting from five national entities competing in a relatively small space. All of this trade, wealth, and geostrategic competition acted as a complex and combustible mix that was eventually ignited by the ideas of the Enlightenment. This helped create the conditions for the American Revolution, in which the Atlantic again played a major role. Following the French and Indian Wars (the North American portion of the Seven Years’ War), the British crown was in a less advantageous position, caught between unrest at home, continued anger and resentment on the part of fellow imperial power France, and a sense in the American colonies that their burden and obligation to Britain was too high a cost to bear. Gradually increasing taxes and tariffs led to significant unrest in the colonies, catalyzed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773—an act that did not go down well in Britain and led to further restrictions on the colonies, including the closure of the port of Boston. By 1775, the northern colonies in particular were in a state of rebellion, and the battles of Lexington and Concord (essentially shootings and skirmishes) led to full-blown war. No revolution in history has been embraced unanimously. About a third of the American population at the time of the revolution wanted to remain loyal to the crown, about a third were more or less ambivalent, and a third were strongly pro-independence at the outset. But once combat was joined in New England, the tide turned in the colonies and a revolutionary spirit strengthened. While the Americans hardly possessed a significant navy compared with Great Britain, they were aided by the French, still smarting from their losses in the French and Indian Wars and eager to weaken the position of their rival in the Americas. The colonists marshaled their small vessels and attacked British interests where and when they could—afloat on Lake Champlain and ashore into Canada. Surprisingly, they were also able to carry the war into British waters by deploying privateers and the first vessels of the Continental Navy. Massive British troop deployments to the colonies as well as total control over the Atlantic seaways took a toll on the lightly armed American ships. Americans quickly realized that British control over the Atlantic was a key element they had to overcome to be successful. Only when France entered the war in 1778 were the Americans able to begin to establish some level of what we would today call sea control in the approaches to our shores. By the 1780s, American naval officers, including the iconic John Paul Jones, had scored real victories at sea in the North Atlantic. Jones sailed into Irish and British waters, first in the Ranger and later in the Bonhomme Richard, conducting a guerre de course, or war against shipping. His small squadron of lightly armed ships attacked a British convoy and captured the heavily armed English ship Serapis in 1779. This was perhaps the most famous U.S. naval engagement of the revolution, in which the British captain asked Captain Jones —his ship nearly sunk under his feet—if he wanted to strike his colors (surrender to the enemy). His reply, “I have not yet begun to fight,” has been memorized by generations of midshipmen at Annapolis (including a young plebe named Stavridis in the summer of 1972). John Paul Jones, by the way, is probably the only famous American naval officer many citizens could name from the early days of the republic. He was quite widely traveled across the Atlantic. While he tends to be revered as the “father of the American navy,” in fact he was a mercenary who fought for both the United States and the Russian Empire, rising to the rank of rear admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy. He wasn’t particularly happy with the way he was treated (he was a prickly Scot) throughout the Revolutionary War and returned to Europe for better pay and larger commands, but was eventually outmaneuvered in court politics. In 1792, he died penniless in Paris and was buried in a French cemetery. His star rose considerably after his death, however, when Theodore Roosevelt took an interest in him and had him exhumed, and in 1905 Jones sailed once again across the Atlantic, in the American warship USS Brooklyn, escorted by three other cruisers. Jones was then buried with enormous pomp and circumstance, first in Bancroft Hall (home of the Brigade of Midshipmen at Annapolis), and ultimately in a gorgeous black marble crypt under the massive chapel at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. He is probably the only person who crossed the Atlantic over the course of three centuries, from the late eighteenth to the early twentieth. Luckily for the nascent United States, the French were trying to turn the tide of the battle by helping resupply American forces across the Atlantic, conducting harrying attacks on the British where they could, and drawing up plans for an invasion in the southern colonies. Ultimately, the French Marquis de Lafayette proved to be the reliable ally the colonies needed, conducting a decisive and vital campaign at Yorktown in southern Virginia. The battle—truly a campaign conducted over months—showed the value of sea power. First and foremost, it was enabled by sea control across the Atlantic; it also illustrated the strategic mobility that sea power can confer as the Americans were able to shift forces smoothly and apply combat power at the point of maximum need. As forces converged via sea on Yorktown in the late summer and early autumn of 1781, the naval fight in the Atlantic turned into a tough, close-in battle between British and French warships. The French mauled the British and forced them to sail north to try to bring more troops to the embattled British general ashore, Lord Cornwallis. But time was against the British, and Cornwallis was forced to surrender as a result of superior sea power—in this case supplied by the French, our oldest and first ally. By 1783, the British had greater geopolitical challenges and turbulence at home, and the Treaty of Paris ended the war and recognized the independence of the new United States, stretching from the Great Lakes to Florida. The Atlantic seacoast of the United States was our nation’s first and most prominent geographic feature, and our doorway to the world opened through it as we achieved our first real degree of independence. The next great series of campaigns in which the Atlantic played the central role was the long conflict unleashed in Europe by the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte. The long duel between Napoleon’s France and the nations he conquered or persuaded to fight with him against the coalition led by Great Britain rumbled along through the end of the 1700s and the first decade of the 1800s. It was a geopolitical fight that ultimately turned upon Britain’s use of sea power to maintain its independence, blockade French power, fight over distant colonies, and continue to function economically despite Napoleon’s domination of the continent. Perhaps the most iconic sailor in history, Britain’s Viscount Horatio Nelson, was a key figure in the long fight. He fought battles on all sides of the Atlantic—in the Caribbean, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean—and crossed it dozens of times in the course of the Napoleonic Wars. His two early successful battles against the French were crucial: in Egypt, the Battle of the Nile probably saved British India from French conquest, and in Denmark, he managed at the Battle of Copenhagen to force Napoleon to the bargaining table. His influence on the British navy is felt to this day. It is worth knowing that in this age of transparency and political correctness, Lord Nelson would never have passed a U.S. Senate confirmation process. He was subject to violent seasickness and had various other medical challenges. He was a short and scrawny figure, standing well under five feet six inches, who eventually lost both an eye and an arm in combat. Nelson had a long-running affair with Emma Hamilton, who might charitably be called a courtesan, with whom he fathered a daughter out of wedlock. He consistently took delight in countering the tight, regimented tactics of maritime combat at the time, and his ability to weld together a “band of brothers” from among the various sea captains serving under him was instrumental in creating the best fighting force ever to sail the oceans up to that day. What really mattered about Lord Nelson was his centrality to the fate of his nation in the latter part of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth; as a continental land power, France under Napoleon sought to dominate the maritime power of the world, Great Britain. He was fundamental to Great Britain’s ability to execute a classic maritime strategy of dominating the lanes of communication across the Atlantic and around the littoral seas of the European continent while maintaining economic vitality from colonies around the world. By 1805, Napoleon was actively seeking an invasion force to attack Great Britain. Nelson pursued the French fleet (and its Spanish allies) vigorously, knowing full well that defeating it was the key to ensuring the safety—indeed, the sanctity—of the British Isles. The British knew that their strategic center of gravity (which has been described in war as “that about which all else revolves”) was the English Channel and the ability to control it via sea power. This pursuit led ultimately to one of the most famous sea battles in history, the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. Fought off the coast of Spain in the eastern center of the Atlantic Ocean, it brought together two massive battle fleets. Tactically it was notable for the production of Nelson’s memorandum on how to fight the battle, which he promulgated just before the fight. Nelson knew that he would not have clear and instantaneous communication with his nearly forty major warships, and that the fog of war and the probability of heavy weather would make precise command and control impossible. As he said in the memorandum, “Something must be left to chance; nothing is sure in a sea fight.” He lays out the basic direction and tactics of the fight, but then includes the most crucial line, one that is often quoted by sailors headed into combat: “In case signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy.” That spirit of independence in command, and the resultant tradition of taking action with real initiative, lives on in the U.S. and British navies—and in those of many allied forces—to this day. On that October morning, the normally roiling Atlantic was strangely calm. Nelson deployed his forces in two long columns, spreading the nearly thirty ships out and bearing down on the Spanish and French fleets, seeking to force them to fight. Nelson was able to drive into the center of the enemy’s line. Just before the battle, Nelson wrote out a will and a prayer, which included the words, “May humanity after victory be the predominant feature of the British fleet.” He then launched a signal that any British sailor can quote: “England expects that every man will do his duty.” He certainly did, and tragically, he was killed by a sniper’s bullet a few hours later while he stood on the quarterdeck of his ship, fully exposed to enemy fire and wearing all his medals and decorations, inspiring his men. He died in agony belowdecks in his flagship, HMS Victory, as it rocked on the unnaturally calm Atlantic. The battle was a brilliant success, resulting in the capture of fifteen of the French and Spanish fleets’ most capable warships. Thus ended the attempts of Napoleon to invade the United Kingdom, demonstrating the “influence of sea power upon history,” as the American naval historian Alfred Thayer Mahan described it decades later in his classic work of maritime strategy. Ironically, the ultimate loser of Trafalgar, Napoleon, eventually ended his life deep in the southern Atlantic. After successfully escaping from his first exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba, he was defeated at Waterloo and sent far, far from Europe: to the tiny, volcanic island of St. Helena. A vastly diminished figure, Napoleon’s life closed in on him, dampening his exuberant demeanor and saddening his small retinue of loyal courtiers. A superb portrait of both the island and his final days is Julia Blackburn’s book The Emperor’s Last Island, which is as much about the island and the ocean as it is about Napoleon. Bonaparte died there in 1821 after six long years in exile on a tiny rock measuring five by ten miles. He spent much of his final years staring endlessly across the waves of the Atlantic, the one venue he could never conquer. The next chapter of note in the geopolitical history of the Atlantic was the rise of the U.S. Navy, born of necessity in the turbulent years after the revolution. The two principal political parties of the time, Alexander Hamilton’s Federalists and Thomas Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans (who, by the way, were not the fathers of today’s Republican Party; that party devolved from the Whigs and other groups), were on opposite sides of the “big navy” issue. The Federalists wanted a serious seagoing navy, arguing that American interests would be expanding over time and that the simple existence of the Atlantic Ocean would be insufficient to protect the young nation. Jefferson felt that the real expansion of the United States would be to the south and west, and that agriculture, not nautical concerns, would be at the heart of the new nation’s business. In essence, they were both right—and thus the U.S. Navy was grudgingly constructed in stops and starts over the several decades following the revolution. The Navy Department was created in the final years of the eighteenth century in time for an undeclared war with France (the so-called Quasi-War, fought largely in the Caribbean from 1798 to 1800). Despite Jefferson’s aversion to relatively big ships, a declaration of war against the United States by the Barbary pirates forced the by then president to launch a series of expeditions to the Mediterranean to deal with pirates preying on U.S. shipping in the first decade of the nineteenth century. In 1803, young, aggressive naval heroes like Commodore Edward Preble and Lieutenant Stephen Decatur burnished their strong reputations through their campaigns in the Mediterranean, operating from a base on the island of Sicily. Eventually, this foray across the Atlantic ended in victory for the young United States. Yet despite this outcome and the seemingly obvious lesson that real sea power was necessary to help guard the nation, the Republicans in office decided that a strategy of small ships—gunboats—and coastal forts could be used to protect the Atlantic coastline. Such forts still exist in a chain running all along the eastern Atlantic seacoast of the United States. They proved quite inadequate, of course, during the War of 1812 with Great Britain. It was lucky that the early construction program for six medium-size frigates—lionized in Ian Toll’s brilliant book Six Frigates—was completed by this point despite the emphasis by the administration on the gunboat-and-fortress strategy. Soon the Atlantic was again a battleground for the United States and Great Britain, in a war that stemmed from lingering resentments on both sides after the successful revolution and was catalyzed by the boarding of an American warship, USS Chesapeake, by sailors from HMS Leopard in 1807. The Brits came aboard after firing on an unprepared Chesapeake and forcibly removed four sailors suspected of being British deserters (only one of them was proved to be so). This enraged the American public and, coupled with trade restrictions levied by Britain on the neutral U.S. merchant fleet, led to a high level of tension between the two nations. By 1812, events had spun out of control and the United States—with a navy that numbered a grand total of eighteen seagoing warships —declared war on the British Empire, with hundreds of heavy warships and centuries of nautical warfare experience. Fortunately for the United States, the British viewed the War of 1812 as a sideshow, and never devoted a significant level of sea power to prosecuting it. The British executed largely by blockade, while American warships tried to conduct raids on British maritime shipping. A series of small-scale battles on the Atlantic had some surprisingly successful outcomes for the Americans, with battles coming out roughly a draw over the years of the war. In the end, while good for American morale, the sea battles were not the drivers in determining the overall outcome of the conflict. The United States fared badly in the War of 1812 because of the combination of the effect of the British blockade on U.S. commerce and the successful invasion of the United States by British troops, who gleefully burned the capital of the young nation, Washington, D.C. While American maritime operations in the North were marginally successful, they did not sway the direction of the war. Fortunately for the Americans, the British had larger matters to deal with than their upstart former colonies. Eventually, given other pressing matters globally and war fatigue in Great Britain, the British were content to come to the negotiating table, ending the war and planting the seeds for the “special relationship” that continues to this day (albeit with occasional subsequent periods of tension between the Atlantic cousins). From the end of the War of 1812 to the Civil War, the Atlantic was relatively peaceful, and the world saw a period of less conflict after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Nevertheless, a different type of revolution (that of naval technology) was happening at sea, spurred by inventions and ideas flowing from the war years. Navies began the transition from sail to steam and started to apply serious levels of metal armor to the sides of their ships. Instead of smoothbore cannons that had to be brought to bear at extremely close range, rifled gun barrels led to great improvements in range and accuracy. The initial ideas of fire control, or the way in which guns are sighted using optical targeting systems, were developed and implemented. And instead of hammering home a charge with a muzzle loading system (a slow and ponderous process), the use of percussion-fired projectiles emerged—with significant gains in efficiency and rate of fire. Much of the testing and use of these new technologies happened on training ranges created off the Atlantic coasts of both Europe and the United States. While there were outbreaks of warfare in the littoral seas of the Atlantic —the Gulf of Mexico in the Mexican-American War, the Baltic and Black seas in the Crimean War—for the main part of this four-decade period the Atlantic was not the perennial battleground it had been for the preceding three centuries. However, that changed with the advent of the Civil War in the United States. The Atlantic became a zone of real conflict again in the 1860s as two American battle flotillas, one from the North and the other from the South (quite small by European standards), squared off on the inland lakes and rivers, the littoral and coastal waters, and occasionally the deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The key tactic by the North was the immediate installation of a blockade, which it could put in place because it had the advantage of having inherited a preponderance of ships by virtue of the general loyalty of seagoing officers to the Union. As a result of the disparity in the number of ships between the two sides, the South never matched the North on a ship-by-ship basis. Instead, the South pursued a strategy of privateering and the offering of letters of marque, as well as commerce raiding on a selective basis. The Confederacy also tried to procure ships from a generally sympathetic Europe and attempted to convince other nations that the blockade existed only on paper—something that was true for a year or so before the North became more organized and systematic in enforcing it by putting its assortment of more than two hundred ships to sea over time. New technologies from the “ironclad” armored vessels on both sides (such as CSS Virginia and the oddly turreted, low-slung Union Monitor) and torpedoes (which are called mines today) were on display. Commerce raiding by the South had some impact (especially the morale-raising exploits of CSS Alabama under Captain Raphael Semmes), but could not in any sense turn the tide of the war. As was the case ashore, over time the vastly greater industrial might, employable population, and advanced technologies of the Union made the end more or less inevitable. The North prevailed at sea on the Atlantic as it did ashore, and the blockade was crucial in choking off the South’s ability to resist. While it mainly supported the North’s efforts on land, the Atlantic nevertheless allowed the North to implement a successful war strategy. In much the same way that new technologies transformed the fight between the North and South during the Civil War, the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century also transformed Americans’ relationship with the Atlantic. Advances in shipbuilding techniques expanded the zone of competition between nations beyond naval warfare; commerce in and of itself began to be a tool of statecraft. This was manifested at sea in the rise of various shipping lines and individual packet ships. SS James Monroe will sail into history as the first vessel to leave on a schedule regardless of wind and weather, and initial shipping lines included the Black Ball Line, the Red Star Line, and the Swallowtail Line, all of which began to become operational in the third decade of the 1800s. These were of course initially sailing ships, usually called clipper ships, and they competed for speed records. One of Donald McKay’s clippers, Lightning, sailed 436 miles in a day, the single-day longest distance recorded by a sailing vessel, and a record that still stands.* The net effect of these new technologies gave a certain psychological power to the growing sense that the seas in general were shrinking. This was especially true for the North Atlantic. As steam vessels became more commonplace by mid-century, the ocean appeared further reduced, facilitated by the advent of transatlantic telegraph cables that the increasingly big ships were able to place on the sea floor and operate with reliability by the 1860s. Before the cables became fully operational, normal communications had to be transported in a vessel, a voyage of generally ten to fourteen days. When telegraph cables became reliable, a message could flow across the Atlantic within minutes. Queen Victoria sent a telegram of congratulations to President James Buchanan to open the line, directed to his summer residence in the Bedford Springs Hotel in Pennsylvania. She said that she hoped the link would create “an additional link between the nations whose friendship is founded on their common interest and reciprocal esteem.” The president replied, “It is a triumph more glorious, because far more useful to mankind, than was ever won by conqueror on the field of battle. May the Atlantic telegraph, under the blessing of Heaven, prove to be a bond of perpetual peace and friendship between the kindred nations, and an instrument destined by Divine Providence to diffuse religion, civilization, liberty, and law throughout the world.”* Despite these advances, it is worth remembering how challenging the sea remained for mariners. Even a casual student of the Atlantic knows the story of the doomed Titanic, the “unsinkable ship” that was lost after hitting an iceberg. Leaving aside the fairly accurate film and its associated doomed love story paralleling the fate of the ship, the sinking remains a cautionary tale of the hubris of man and the capricious nature of the high seas. As I sailed across the north Atlantic in the mid-1990s, a century and a half later, the story of Titanic was not far from my mind—even in a high-tech, solid-steel, brand-new U.S. Navy destroyer. Following the short but bitter Spanish-American War, which saw a few naval engagements in and around Cuban waters, the next significant set of battles on the Atlantic were those of the First World War. The United States tried to avoid being pulled into the war, but eventually was drawn fully into the conflict. Fortunately, by that point in the nation’s history our navy had improved dramatically. This was a direct result of the combined strategic thinking of Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce and Captain (later rear admiral) Alfred Thayer Mahan and the energy and political advocacy of Theodore Roosevelt. Mahan and Luce conducted their collaboration at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, and Mahan produced a series of seminal books that used the prism of history to describe the importance of sea power. Mahan became a sort of intellectual mentor to Roosevelt, who became the youngest president in American history in 1901 when an assassin struck down William McKinley. As president, Roosevelt drove a naval construction program that created a true blue-water navy of powerful battleships and cruisers. He pushed through the creation of the Panama Canal, intervened frequently in Latin America and the Caribbean, and used the emergence of new technologies to improve the sea power capabilities of the United States. Big battleships of 15,000 tons and more were able to speed through the waters at nearly 20 knots—a big improvement over sailing ships or more primitive steam-driven vessels that topped out around 12 to 15 knots—and were armed with massive eight-inch guns. Smokeless powder, greater range, and faster, more accurate torpedoes were also developed. The airplane was emerging in that first decade of the twentieth century, and the first flights in America were pushed by Atlantic winds over the beaches of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Roosevelt’s policy to “speak softly and carry a big stick” specifically envisioned an oceangoing navy as the ultimate big stick. The massive 100,000-ton nuclear-powered aircraft carrier named after him, USS Theodore Roosevelt, today sails proudly with the fleet nickname “The Big Stick.” Fair enough. After the collapse of the complex structure of European alliances in the late summer of 1914, “the lights went out in Europe” and the Atlantic again became a field of maritime battle. Both Britain and Germany possessed powerful fleets centered on capital warships, notably the battleship. Indeed, the construction of the German fleet had been one element that raised British suspicions and concerns—logical enough if the long history of British maritime strategy is considered. Most of the German ships had fairly limited cruising ranges, which further convinced the British that they were designed to attack England and cover an invading force. As the two massive battle fleets of Great Britain and Imperial Germany each sought to bring a “decisive fleet action” off in their respective favor (geopolitical-speak for destroying an opponent’s ability to effectively wage war at sea), the scene of potential battle became the North Sea between the two countries. Given that the British home islands are athwart the exit from the North Sea, the German Imperial fleet was effectively held prisoner throughout the war. The two countries fought a series of inconclusive engagements, including at Dogger Bank in 1915, in the center of the North Sea, and at the more important Battle of Jutland in spring of 1916. Several Atlantic battles also took place in the far South Atlantic off the coast of South America, including the Battle of the Falkland Islands. Despite the actions at sea, the land armies quickly bogged down across the center of Europe and the war turned into a slugging match of attrition on land. This led the Allies, especially the British (who were being bled white ashore), to seek alternatives: they seized on the idea of a maritime campaign in the Mediterranean, the “soft underbelly of Europe.” With the urging of Winston Churchill, then a very young first lord of the Admiralty, the British launched the Dardanelles/Gallipoli campaign, as he said, “totus porcus,” or whole hog. It was a fiasco, described more fully in the upcoming chapter on the Mediterranean. Its tragic human consequences are well depicted in the film Gallipoli. Nevertheless, these actions—fought on the periphery of the central theater of the North Atlantic—were of less strategic importance than the war against shipping waged by both sides. The Germans responded to a British blockade with their own U-boat campaign. They began by attacking British blockading vessels with their U-boats, and seeing the strategic effect, added surface cruisers to the mix of ships conducting attacks. By 1915, the U-boat campaigns had increased in strategic importance, and in May 1916 they sank the merchant liner Lusitania, a story brilliantly told in Erik Larson’s Dead Wake. The killing of 128 Americans helped pull the United States into the war, although not immediately. The declaration of unrestricted U-boat warfare at the end of 1916 both accelerated the British response and forced the Allies to institute a system of convoys. As the United States joined the war, additional new technologies came on line, including early radar and sonar systems. The United States’ increased participation in the form of troops sent to Europe turned the tide of the war. The Atlantic became a bridge across which flowed war materials, supporting soldiers and Marines, and perhaps most important, trade and commerce that fueled the Allied efforts. It was during the First World War that the idea of the North Atlantic community of nations evolved in the writing of geopolitical commentators like Walter Lippmann, who referred to “the profound web of interest which joins together the western world.” As he put it, “Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Holland, the Scandinavian nations, and Pan America are in the main one community in their deepest needs and their deepest purposes. . . . We cannot betray the Atlantic community. . . . What we must fight for is the common interest of the western world, for the integrity of the Atlantic powers. We must recognize that we are in fact one great community and act as members of it.”* Tragically, the United States essentially rejected the construct of an Atlantic community after the First World War, declined membership in the League of Nations (the forerunner to today’s United Nations), and embarked on an ill- conceived course of isolationism. As I listened to the overheated rhetoric of the 2016 election campaign roughly a century later, I heard echoes of those misjudgments in the words of Donald Trump, who would seemingly have us turn our backs on the larger world, rebuild walls of protectionism, construct a physical wall between the United States and Mexico, dissolve NATO, and repudiate our linkages with allies around the world. This reflects a certain strain of isolationist DNA that has run through our nation’s psychology for two centuries. And frankly, we’ve seen that movie before in the interwar years, and the world reaped a predictable and terrible harvest in the form of the Second World War. Furthermore, the “great wall” of its time, the Maginot Line constructed by France to protect itself from a resurgent Germany led by Adolf Hitler, was a complete failure. In the run-up to the Second World War, despite efforts to limit naval construction by treaties, the major world nations all rebuilt their fleets. Collective security died a premature death along with the League of Nations, and fascism began its rise in Germany, Italy, and Spain. Britain and France desperately wanted to avoid another world war, and looked away as Hitler annexed various territories and nations in Europe. Appeasement failed, as it always does, and Germany invaded Poland in 1939. The United Kingdom and France both declared war on Germany, and Europe was again plunged into war. On the Atlantic, at least, the British had a significant advantage because Germany had not invested in significant capital ships to the degree that it had invested in land forces. This allowed Britain to maintain its independence even after the fall of France in 1940. Yet even with a relatively small fleet, the Germans were able to strike at British sea power, including sinking both warships and merchant shipping, with their highly capable and technologically advanced U-boats. Even the reconstruction of a strict convoy regime did not stem the losses across the North Atlantic. In addition to the U-boats, German capital warships were engaged in commerce raiding from the northern reaches of the Atlantic down to the coast of South America. By mid-1941, the situation for Great Britain—alone and defiant, but under real threat of collapse—was dire. The U.S. Navy was conducting essentially an undeclared war in the North Atlantic, with Navy destroyers attacking U-boats and torpedoes fired against U.S. ships in turn. When the United States entered the war in earnest after the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Battle of the Atlantic was already well under way. Victory at sea in the Atlantic during World War II would turn on the battle to defeat German submarines, and it would be, as the Duke of Wellington said of Waterloo, a very near-run thing. As the Germans “flooded the zone” with U-boats, the Allies reached back to World War I tactics, techniques, and procedures. The Germans operated in wolf packs, improved their surveillance and targeting ability, and instituted a system of logistics to resupply the raiders at sea from much larger mother submarines. The Allies reinstituted a complex system of convoys, added significant antisubmarine warfare warships to protect them (destroyers and corvettes), and increased the use of new technologies, including surface radar and sound imaging (sonar) to detect the U-boats while submerged. Newer, bigger, and rocket-thrown depth charges were also added to the arsenal of Allied ships to counter the U-boats. U-boat attacks ranged as far as the coast of the United States and deep into the Caribbean. In the summer and fall of 1940, German tactics sank hundreds of thousands of tons of Allied shipping each month, including more than 350,000 tons in October 1940 alone. Turning the tide after the U.S. entry into the war required cracking the communications code used by Axis powers to target submarines against specific Allied convoys and shipping. It also hinged on improvements in radar and sonar, and the attrition of U-boats, which were difficult to reconstruct as pressures mounted on the European continent. There were also significant operations in Arctic waters as the Allies sought to resupply Russia through northern convoys along the Arctic Circle to Murmansk. Despite Allied momentum in the Atlantic, the Germans launched a second surge of U-boat attacks across the Atlantic in the spring of 1942, and in May and June of that year managed to sink more than a million tons of shipping. The effects of the attacks eventually peaked in November 1942 with 700,000 tons going down. At the time, Admiral Karl Dönitz had more than three hundred U- boats at play, which he estimated were enough to effectively starve the English people. While the Allies possessed new technologies to combat U-boats, their operators were not experienced, and the Germans had the upper hand. Additionally, a new cipher had been produced and the Allied ability to track the German submarines was again limited. The Allies responded by instituting new tactics, including picket lines to kill U-boats in transit. They also recracked the cipher, and by early 1943 there was improvement (although in March 1943, nearly 700,000 tons were sunk). Two factors were crucial to the Allies’ newfound success: first was the Allied ability to more effectively attack U-boats with better technology and tactics; and second was the U.S. industrial machine’s production of overwhelming numbers of convoy escort warships. By late spring of 1943, the worst had passed. Despite German hopes of a technological breakthrough of some kind (a new acoustical torpedo, for example), it was clear that the Allies would gradually kill enough U-boats to break the campaign and permit the safe transfer of sufficient U.S. troops to Europe to win the war (alongside the enormously critical Russian campaigns as well). Despite destroying nearly three thousand Allied ships and well over 20 million tons of shipping, in the end the U-boat campaign was not enough. As Churchill said, “The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome. . . . Many gallant actions and incredible feats of endurance are recorded but the deeds of those who perished will never be known. Our merchant seamen displayed their highest qualities, and the brotherhood of the sea was never more strikingly shown than in their determination to defeat the U- boat.”* Given that Great Britain needed more than a million tons of food and material weekly, the greatest strategic chance the Germans had to destroy the United Kingdom was to choke it to death. In the end, the battle turned—as battles always do—on a combination of courage, innovation, and communication. The real keys to defeating the U-boats in the Atlantic were longer-range aircraft, radar mounted to the U-boat-seeking aircraft, improvements in depth charges and sonar, British intelligence and code-breaking skills (like Enigma), tactics of avoidance in regard to convoy deployments, and optical devices like the Leigh Light (a searchlight used in conjunction with radar to help Allied aircraft hunting submarines at night as they surfaced to recharge their diesel batteries). After the final defeat of Germany and Japan and the end of the Second World War, the United States crucially decided to remain engaged in the world, as opposed to another abrupt withdrawal à la the post–World War I world. The United Nations and the so-called Bretton Woods institutions (the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund) were designed to help ward off another global war. Despite this good news, the Soviet Union emerged in the post–World War II era as a global threat, requiring significant U.S. response and launching what came to be known as the cold war. This was also the start of my own military career in the mid-1970s, and for the first fifteen years of my seagoing experience I was a true cold warrior, essentially chasing Soviet ships, submarines, and aircraft or being chased by them. These days, given Russia’s recent assertive geopolitical behavior in Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and Syria, I am often asked, “Are we headed into a new cold war?” The answer is “probably not.” I am certainly old enough to remember the cold war, in which I spent a great deal of time on the broad Atlantic tracking Soviet platforms. The cold war was millions of well-trained troops on both sides facing one another across the Fulda Gap in Central Europe; it was two huge battle fleets playing cat and mouse from the High North and Arctic Circle to the bottom of the world off the coast of South America; it was two huge nuclear arsenals on a hair-trigger alert, twenty thousand warheads ready to utterly destroy the world. We are not remotely in that world today, and that is a very good thing, but we do need to be mindful of the geopolitics of the oceans or we risk stumbling back into that late-twentieth-century world. What was the cold war like in the Atlantic? First and foremost, it was a battle for control—really complete surveillance and the positioning of strategic and tactical assets—in the Greenland-Iceland–United Kingdom (GIUK) gap. This zone of thousands of miles of empty ocean became critical strategically because whichever side controlled it would be able to monitor and channel all the maritime traffic (including subsurface) into and out of the North Atlantic. It therefore controlled the flow of men and material to Europe in the case of a Soviet attack on western Europe. Unlike the Germans in World War II, the Soviets had a huge and capable seagoing fleet; allowing them to break out of northern ports and flow into the GIUK gap would have ceded control over the supply routes to Europe—the precise thing that Germany strove for so mightily with its U-boat fleets. Thus in the cold war, there was a constant maneuver between the Soviet Union (and its Warsaw Pact allies) and the NATO forces led by the United States for control of the gap. This required significant deployments of U.S. combat power to Iceland, Canada, Denmark, and of course the United Kingdom itself. Combat power was also stationed at bases in the Northeast of the United States. The operative maritime forces were long-range P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare aircraft, formidable hunter-killer machines used to find Soviet submarines; nuclear attack submarines of the United States and our allies; satellite coverage of the deep ocean; and occasional deployments of flotillas of destroyers and cruisers (like mine) with significant sonar, torpedo, and other sensors suitable to pursue submarines. The Soviets deployed their ballistic missile submarines (equipped with long-range missiles tipped with nuclear weapons) as well as flotillas of submarines and surface ships. While not exactly crowded up there, it was a “target rich zone” for antisubmarine forces. The Atlantic was also increasingly a huge trade path for the expansive economies of western (free) Europe and the United States. As the Europeans moved gradually toward a better state of economic union, it became increasingly clear that this commercial connection across the Atlantic would be vital for the United States as well. There was a final bloody spurt of combat in the deep southern reaches of the Atlantic Ocean as the twentieth century moved to a close: the Falklands War. In the spring of 1982, over the course of ten weeks, Great Britain and Argentina fought a short, sharp war that cost a thousand lives, sank sixteen ships, and saw more than a hundred aircraft destroyed. It was fought over the Falkland Islands, which had been (and still are) a British protectorate with a British population but are long claimed as the Malvinas Islands by the Argentines. The classic description of the battle from the British perspective is Admiral Sir Sandy Woodward’s One Hundred Days, his memoir of leading the British flotilla that wrested the islands back from Argentine invaders after a demanding campaign fought as winter drew on in the southern latitudes. While the two nations still disagree over ownership of the islands, another round of violent conflict appears unlikely. The war has been studied by naval strategists and historians and provides a good example of the vulnerability of surface ships to air attack in the era of cruise missiles. As I progressed through my cold war career in the Navy, I would often open up Sir Sandy’s brilliant book to help me think through how best to prepare my various at-sea commands for potential combat around the world. It was the final spasm of international violence in the long history of the Atlantic in the twentieth century and, let us hope, the last. The Atlantic today is, for essentially the first time in its long history, a zone of cooperation and peace from the Arctic Circle to the shores of the Antarctic in the far South. While there are still a few lingering territorial issues to resolve— some African littoral claims, islands in the Caribbean, and the aforementioned Falkland Islands/Malvinas in the South Atlantic—the ocean itself and almost all of its tributary seas are in a relative state of peace. Only the eastern Mediterranean and to some degree the Black Sea present the potential for serious conflict. This is a remarkable change to a body of water that has long been viewed, correctly, as the canvas of war upon which too many admirals have quite enthusiastically painted in blood. 3. THE INDIAN OCEAN THE FUTURE SEA India is the center around which its ocean turns. Map created by Joannes van Braam, 1726. The Indian Ocean will remain a driving economic force in the world oceans for decades to come. The Indian Ocean is a vast body of water—20 percent of the world’s surface and third in size behind the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. If you were to drop the entire continental United States on top of the Indian Ocean, it would fit quite comfortably within its borders as a sort of very large island. In fact, you could probably squeeze three continental United States into the water space and be able to navigate comfortably around them. Yet with all that space—and a sense of real openness for a sailor—the Indian Ocean itself has relatively less human and geopolitical history than either of the other two major oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific. And it is worth noting that even the tributary seas—the Arabian/Persian Gulf and the Red Sea—have become particularly important in a geopolitical sense only in the post–World War II era with the rise of global shipping and the export of oil from the Gulf region. While that absence of global impact is about to change as India rises in its global ambition and reach, it is still relatively a tabula rasa in geopolitical terms. I first entered the Indian Ocean from the east, through the Strait of Malacca, in the mid-1980s. I was operations officer in a brand-new AEGIS air defense cruiser, USS Valley Forge. AEGIS is a hi-tech, automated command and control and weapons system that can detect, track, and shoot down multiple targets simultaneously. Our mission was to head through the Indian Ocean to the Arabian Gulf at best speed, first taking on fuel and supplies at Diego Garcia, a small island and British possession in the center of the vast ocean space. As the operations officer, I had prepared the charts and set the course, and took the first watch as we drove out between Indonesia and Malaysia and headed toward the Indian Ocean, watching the stars open above us in the unlit sky. We sped through the long Strait of Malacca after departing Singapore. The night watch was a blur of huge tankers, coastal junks and small boats, and occasionally other warships flashing their signal lights at us. Singapore guards the eastern entrance to the Malacca Strait, one of the busiest in the world, and its multinational character—with Malay, Chinese, Indian, Anglo, and many other residents—makes it a gateway city in every sense of the word. As you get under way from its busy ports and take on speed entering the very crowded Strait of Malacca, you have a sense much like coming through the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean Sea—yet knowing that unlike the Med, the Indian Ocean is essentially a vast open seaway. After that long night watch, I was still on the bridge as the sea and anchor detail officer of the deck as we came off navigation detail (additional watches set for close-to-land or very dense traffic maneuvering) and watched the sun rise up as we entered the broad reaches of the Andaman Sea off the western coast of Thailand. Suddenly, we were in an enormous expanse of open water, and we shaped our course for the southwest and the tiny atoll of Diego Garcia. Sailing across the Indian Ocean, unlike the Med, a sailor is hit by a sense of wide-open space, much like the central and western Pacific. While you occasionally pass other ships, it is a relatively rare moment to be within visual distance of another vessel. As you stand the long, boring watches, you can easily imagine slipping back over the centuries and seeing, across the horizon, not a smokestack rising where the next ship should be, but instead a set of huge sails as one of the great hulls of the British or Dutch East India Company bears down upon you, the classic northeast monsoons and equatorial currents driving it straight at you. Or so it felt to a very young lieutenant who had probably read too many novels set in the nineteenth century by George MacDonald Fraser, C. S. Forester, and Patrick O’Brian. But actually it is apt to think of a trading ship rather than a warship coming over the horizon. For the Indian Ocean’s most salient characteristic is that unlike its massive cousins the Atlantic and Pacific, and as particularly distinct from the perpetual battlefield of the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean has been primarily a zone of trade. Beginning with the earliest Indian civilizations of the Harappans in the Indus Valley nearly three thousand years before Christ, there have been frequent trading ventures along the coast of modern India and Pakistan, across the Red Sea between the Arabian Gulf and Africa, and indeed between the ancient Mediterranean and the early societies of the Indian Ocean littoral. The engine that drove all of this through the long centuries of the age of sail was mother nature: the monsoon winds, the powerful and perpetual wind patterns that drove ships of trade and of war in the days before mechanical propulsion, coupled with the equatorial currents. In an oddly named document, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, written by an ancient Greek of Alexandria whose name is lost to the ages, we see evidence of the commercial potential of the Red Sea, the African coast, and the Indian subcontinent as well. This is matched by discoveries from more than two thousand years ago of Greek amphorae, coins, and other physical evidence of trade in the coastal waters of the Indian Ocean. The ancient sailors knew of and mastered the monsoons, which provided the ability to transit significant distances. These winds are predictable and therefore recordable. In the fall and winter, the northeast monsoon blows down from Asia toward the Indian Ocean, accompanied by currents that can reinforce voyages in that direction. This is reversed in the spring and summer as southwest monsoons blow back from the Indian Ocean toward Asia and the currents reverse themselves. While their appearance is not always guaranteed, it is sufficiently reliable to have powered the ability for trading across the seemingly endless sea relatively early in the course of human development. Ancient Indian civilizations probably began sailing the waters of the Indian Ocean as early as the fifth century B.C. As the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers emptied into the northern Arabian Gulf, the conflict between the Persian Sassanian Empire and various Indian empires (Harappan, Mauryan, Guptan) flared back and forth. There is little evidence of major sea battles as was the case in the Mediterranean, largely because the geography is so different. The strategic geography of the Indian Ocean is one of vast, open space—essentially one massive littoral, with the exception of the two inland seas, the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea. While there were sporadic naval engagements across these two areas, most of the major warfare was focused on the land and the holding of territory. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks traded with the Indian and Persian civilizations, as well as conducting wars. Trade goods included myrrh, incense, ebony, oil, wood, crafts, crops, livestock, and gold and other metals. The brief but impactful life and adventures of Alexander the Great influenced the rise of trade, opening new cities and extending cultural influence, including the founding of the great Egyptian trading city of Alexandria and even ports on the Arabian Gulf. As a young junior officer ashore for the first time in Kuwait, I was fascinated by the ruins of a Greek temple. The Egyptians and the Greeks both traded across the Red Sea, and when Rome conquered Egypt around the time of Christ, Rome became part of the expanding level of trading in the Indian Ocean. Roman Alexandria became a kind of early hub for the trading runs into the Indian Ocean—the goods included textiles from distant China, glass and crafts, and—as was to be a constant driver in Indian Ocean trade—spices, notably black pepper. At the same time, on the eastern side of the Arabian Gulf, the various Persian empires opened new ports and began both importing and exporting across the Gulf. In addition to the goods above, pearls, carpets, and horses were part of the mix. The strategic value of the Strait of Hormuz, which guards the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, began to emerge. You can drop a plumb line through the more than two millennia since the Persians established forts and seaports to control the narrow choke point to the present day, which continues to occupy the attention of the world. The Arabian Gulf and its exceedingly narrow opening, the highly strategic Strait of Hormuz: this seemingly perpetual flashpoint of collision between civilizations was much on my mind the first time I sailed through it in 1984. The USS Valley Forge was sent to the Arabian Gulf as part of a mission called Earnest Will, which would escort tankers through the dangerous waters of the Gulf. The threat was from missile strikes or even missile boats attacking tankers bound in and out of the Gulf during the long war between Saddam Hussein’s Iraq and Iran under the ayatollahs. Our job was an uncomfortable one: to come close aboard to the massive oil tankers—ten times our size by tonnage—and use our highly sophisticated radar and missile systems to defend them from attack. It was harrowing work, and I stood long, tension-filled watches as a tactical action officer (entrusted with the authority to launch missiles) in the combat information center, the dark heart of the ship, lit only by the glowing radar screens. Every watch had its inevitable call to general quarters, when everyone in the ship was rousted out to battle stations. Our missiles were in the ready-to- fire position, and fortunately we were being backed up by combat aircraft flying from the rolling decks of a U.S. carrier outside the Gulf in the North Arabian Sea. The real threat was from Iran, which was unpredictable in its intent, although somewhat limited in capability. The other problem was the possibility of a mistake or miscalculation by Iraq, which was trying to export oil under the missiles and guns of archenemy Iran. Our job was to keep the sea lanes of communication open by protecting the U.S.-flagged tankers, while also trying to avoid escalating the situation. Frankly, not much has really changed down through the centuries in the Arabian Gulf. Just as the geography of the Indian Ocean is one of openness and seemingly limitless horizons, the Arabian Gulf is tight, confined, constrained, and shallow—all things a sailor hates. That trade has crossed the Gulf more or less perpetually has not reduced its fundamental danger to those who would fight in its tight spaces. The Arabian Gulf has its own history, of course. It is intertwined with the larger Indian Ocean, but has been a distinct Islamic sea since that religion emerged on the landmasses around its periphery. From its northern tip, at the Shatt al Arab delta where the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates flow into the Gulf, to the narrow thirty-five-mile Strait of Hormuz at the south, it is just over six hundred miles: the distance from Washington to Boston. Islamic countries surround it, although they are religiously split between Shi’a and Sunni governance. Iran is a Shi’a nation, and Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait are predominantly Sunni. Iraq, which has only a small aperture on the Gulf through the Shatt al Arab and the port of Basra, is a mix of Sunni and Shi’a, a source of constant turbulence and disturbance. • • • AS A RESULT OF NOT only religious differences within Islam but also geopolitical rivalry, the Gulf is today a “cold war” lake between the Sunni bloc led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Shi’a world led by Iran. Over the past decade, Iranian influence and power in the region have increased, and today Tehran either directly controls or has significant influence in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. The Gulf itself has become a place of constant cat and mouse between the naval forces of Iran and those of the Sunni Arab states. In the center of it, of course, is the United States and its Fifth Fleet, the largest of all the U.S. global fleets. And this Sunni-Shi’a conflict—both geopolitical and religious in character—gives every impression of being capable of leading to outright conflict between the two nations, which face each other, as Arabs and Persians have done for centuries, across the light blue water of the Arabian Gulf. The Fifth Fleet is based out of Manama, the capital of Bahrain. It is here that the U.S. Navy has a huge command and control structure, headed up by a three- star vice admiral in one of the truly plum jobs today’s Navy offers. It is a large command, both ashore, with thousands of sailors and their families living in Bahrain, and at sea, with at least one aircraft carrier and its attendant escorts under operational control at all times. There are also logistic, patrol, and intelligence-gathering ships and aircraft under the command of the admiral’s staff. All of this seems ironic when you consider the history of the Arabian Gulf—a supremely hot, windy, shallow, and resource-poor body of water that slept its way through the millennia until the rise of oil and natural gas. Even as recently as the time of World War II, “cities” like Bahrain, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi were essentially fishing villages. Dhows plied the waters as they had for centuries, doing some listless fishing, pearl diving, and smuggling. All that changed as the world realized that perhaps two thirds of the earth’s oil reserves and a third of its natural gas reserves are in the immediate region, both ashore and at sea. The Safaniya offshore oil fields are the largest in the world, and the shallow depth throughout the Gulf (an average depth of only 150 feet) makes it an easy place to work offshore. Today Dubai is one of the first cities of the commercial world, of course, with Abu Dhabi and Doha, the capital of Qatar, not far behind in sophistication and elegance. The military technology that resulted from the geography and the political competition reflected more than anything the prevailing conditions of wind and current. Ships within the Gulf were typically dhowlike, with lateen (triangular) sails rigged fore to aft. The term “dhow” covers a multitude of vessels, by the way—African, Arab, Persian, and Indo-Pakistani. They can be very small and coastal—much like the classic dhows that ply the Gulf today—or rather large. A key feature is that they were built “carvel style,” which is to say the boards were not nailed or bolted together but rather sewn with rope and then caulked. They almost always have a large square stern. Because of the nature of the dhows, the use of mounted guns came very late, and the idea of using marines—soldiers specialized in maritime warfare—did not emerge. In the broader Indian Ocean, the winds gave impetus to the rise of sailing over rowing very early on in the developmental process and also spurred the building of more square-rigged sailing ships. Overall, the ships of the Indian Ocean were optimized for sailing and trading, not for fighting—although they were certainly used for all three over time. My own history in the Arabian Gulf is extensive, as is the case for most U.S. Navy sailors of my generation, officer and enlisted. I went there first in the mid- 1980s on the Earnest Will operation described above. Shortly after my ship departed following a successful series of escorts, our relief—the ill-fated cruiser Vincennes—inadvertently shot down an Iranian commercial airliner, killing 290 innocent civilians in what many in the Navy regard as the worst chapter in our cold war history. It was a terrible mistake caused by the high state of tension in the region, the confusion and fog of war, and a belief on the part of the Vincennes crew that the aircraft they saw on radar was an Iranian F-14 carrying either bombs or missiles. If there is any incident that illustrates the danger and confusion of the Arabian Gulf, it is the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 688— which to this day is the number the Iranians always use for the same flight (Tehran to Dubai) as a memorial to the victims. I have pulled into virtually every open port in the Gulf (obviously not into Iran), and each has its own culture and relationship with the U.S. Navy that shapes the visit. The most open and overtly welcoming is Bahrain, where the Fifth Fleet maintains its headquarters. Here our sailors can enjoy not only first- class hotels and the chance for a cold beer, but also the support of a fully operational U.S. military base with medical, dental, Navy exchange stores, recreation, and all other amenities. Liberty in the United Arab Emirates is a different experience and has evolved over time. Initially, the vast majority of ships were confined to a restricted area in a huge port called Jebel Ali, located in between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. But over time the restrictions have been eased, and today our sailors enjoy themselves in both metropolitan areas. For me, one of the strange enjoyments of the Gulf is being out at sea, even on the hottest of summer days, when the temperatures can rise to more than 120 degrees and the steel decks nearly glow with latent heat. I always enjoyed going for a (brief) run around the decks, almost like running in a sauna, and the normally flat calm of the turquoise waters is beautiful and quiet. But the operational tempo is the hardest of any spot in the Indian Ocean because of the complexity. At all times, the watch stander is thinking and worrying about Iranian naval ships and aircraft, with which we have a tense relationship (although generally professional). Since the signing of the nuclear arms agreement with the Iranians, there have been some untoward incidents that may be a sign of hard-liners in Tehran trying to ratchet up pressure and perhaps even sink the agreement. Too soon to tell, but it seems clear that the Arabian/Persian Gulf will continue to be a fault line in international geopolitics, and a source of tension that bleeds into the larger Indian Ocean. All of which brings us to the earliest and darkest forms of trading and commerce along the Indian Ocean and its tributary seas: slavery and piracy. The movement of slaves was a brisk trade throughout the recorded history of the region, persisting to the present day. The transport of slaves from various conquests was part of the shipping routes of the region, including slaves taken by capturing ships at sea in acts of piracy. While slavery and piracy have diminished somewhat, both still exist in parts of the Indian Ocean, albeit with modern tools and sophistication, something I learned a great deal about as the NATO commander charged with eliminating piracy along the eastern coast of Africa, which I will discuss in depth below. It is worth noting that Indian Ocean trade in the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. dropped dramatically as several of the key trading empires declined in power and influence. Both the Sassanian Persians and the Guptans of India— who had attempted to control trade along with Chinese and Malay entities— shrank significantly in population. This may have been partly due to a global epidemic (paralleled by the bubonic plague in Europe), sometimes called the Plague of Justinian, a disease carried by fleas and rats and well known on ships. But the energy from the east and west of the Indian Ocean would again reignite the trading regime with vigor. Both from Arabia and from China, the pressure for trading began to put life back into the commerce across the broad ocean. Both gold and ivory were important, as well as the hard woods of Africa; but the rising trade in African slaves was a powerful driver as the religion of Islam appeared, the Arabian caliphate expanded, and much of the Indian Ocean littoral, particularly in the west, became part of the Islamic world. Trade between Arabs, Persians, and the Chinese of the Tang and Song dynasties expanded and drove the trading patterns through the thirteenth century. These included formal trading arrangements, embassies, protected ports, and many advanced mechanisms to expand relations. It also included the expansion of Islam to the littoral of the region, albeit much more slowly in Southeast Asia and much of what is today India. Ports like Calicut and Khambhat became global centers. All of this progressed without significant warfare, at least at sea. But looming from the west was the coming force of Europe as it entered the Age of Discovery and exercised its appetite for trade as well. Vasco da Gama was a stocky and emotional man of middle-class origin, born around 1460 in southwestern Portugal. He undertook perhaps the most epic and impactful voyage of exploration in world history in 1497–98 when he led four Portuguese ships down the Atlantic coast of Africa (building on decades of exploration led by Prince Henry the Navigator). He then continued into uncharted waters of the South Atlantic, sailed around the Cape of Good Hope at the bottom of Africa, between the island of Madagascar and Mozambique on the east African coast, up the east coast of Africa to an Indian Ocean port called Malindi, and on to the southwestern tip of India, landing at Calicut in the spring of 1498. The entire length of the voyage was at the time the longest conducted out of sight of land, and was longer than sailing around the earth at the equator. Da Gama returned to Portugal in 1499 to much acclaim, although overall his record is sullied by a variety of massacres attributed to him in India (including burning alive a boatload of hundreds of Muslim pilgrims, among them women and children, who were begging for mercy and posed no threat to his expedition). He returned to India on another expedition several years later, where he was still unable to fulfill his fundamental mission of obtaining a treaty for trade. He eventually died during a third and final voyage to India in 1524. What began as a spice trade, initially based on pepper and cinnamon, soon expanded as the Portuguese consolidated their head start to India, with England, France, and the Netherlands not far behind. The key for the Portuguese was finding an independent path to the spices, one not dependent on crossing the dangerous Mediterranean and going overland to the Red Sea. This seagoing route was perfect for a small, seafaring nation like Portugal, and allowed it to break the monopoly over the spice trade heretofore held by Venetian, Arabian, and Persian traders. Although there were frequent diplomatic missteps (including by da Gama himself) based on simple ignorance of the cultural mores of the Indian trading culture, gradually the Portuguese were able to insinuate themselves into the trading patterns of the western Indian Ocean. The nation that soon followed up as more nautical knowledge became available and ships’ capabilities improved were the Ottomans, seeking to create a Muslim protectorate over large portions of the Indian Ocean littoral. This was facilitated by the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in the early 1500s, which gave them convenient access to the length of the Red Sea. Soon the Portuguese and the Ottomans were in full competition, each seeking exclusive trading treaties, bases for logistic support, and engaging in combat where they could bring maritime forces to bear. This was difficult for the Ottomans as their sea power was optimized for the more restricted coastal waters of the Mediterranean. In the mid-1500s, the Ottomans launched a fairly large fleet of more than fifty vessels to attack Portuguese positions around the Indian Ocean with a particular focus on Hormuz at the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, sailing this time from bases in present-day Iraq at the northern end of the Gulf. They were crushingly defeated, but the rivalry continued for another century until finally the Ottomans essentially withdrew and the Portuguese turned to face new rivals. Their legacy at this point included introduction of a kind of patois of Portuguese and local dialects that was used for commerce (often referred to as Portuguese Creole), adapting their ships to long ocean voyages through new sailing technologies, and fusing the power of the state to the commercial interest of quasi-private companies in fairly creative ways. The latter model—of commercial and state interests blending—was raised to its highest level over the next several centuries in the Indian Ocean. We see this first with the British East India Company in 1600, followed very shortly by the Dutch East India Company. Both used the model developed by the Portuguese as their basis, and both companies existed to create commercial trading opportunities that led to state power. The Dutch began to focus on the eastern parts of the Indian Ocean, including what is today Sri Lanka and parts of Indonesia. They also established a foothold at Cape Town at the southern tip of Africa. Their initial product offerings were traditional spices (pepper, cloves, mace, cinnamon, nutmeg) and, increasingly, coffee. The British, on the other hand, began with a focus on gaining control of as much of the Indian landmass as they could. They built forts and created a string of bases around the periphery of the country in the 1600s and on into the early 1700s. Despite the increasing level of imperial competition between the Portuguese, Dutch, and British, the fundamental trade routes remained largely in local hands. The Chinese, who had no appetite for colonization and no significant deepwater military capability, were nonetheless involved in all aspects of the trade as well —often providing loans, cooperative arrangements, chandlery, and posted both in China and other parts of Southeast Asia along the trading routes. Each of the imperial competitors created its own string of bases—the Dutch, for example, centered their operations in Batavia (now Jakarta), but with robust capability in Cape Town and present-day Sri Lanka. While there were occasional indigenous challenges, for example from the Yaarubi regime in Oman, the power of the two increasingly dominant imperial powers—Britain and the Netherlands—gradually consolidated. The big winner as the eighteenth century ended, of course, was Great Britain. Having essentially seized control of Oman, Kenya, and India, the British went on to create a British lake in the center of the Indian Ocean. Neither Portugal nor the Netherlands was strong enough to face imperial Britain, and the defeat of Napoleon in the early 1800s ultimately limited France’s ability to play a global role. As a result, much of the maritime history of the nineteenth century in the Indian Ocean is Britain’s, upon whose empire the sun never set “because God cannot trust an Englishman in the dark.” While it is certainly fair to say the Indian Ocean became a sort of British lake, it is also quite true that the gaze of the British was ashore, not at sea, once they had established dominance over their imperial and local rivals. There was wide realization on the part of the British that they needed to control the sea lanes to control India, and every English viceroy sent to India reiterated to the crown his need for sea power to ensure dominance. The challenges were from France early in the 1800s, and to some degree from the Dutch, as well as concerns over piracy and slave trading. Each was overcome through a combination of ruthless conquering of needed bases, intricate systems of alliances and commercial trading agreements with littoral states and local rulers, and new technologies— especially the switch from sail to steam power and the completion of the Suez Canal by 1869. • • • THE SUEZ CANAL is an interesting place, to say the least. There were ancient attempts by both the Egyptians and the Persians to construct small waterways through the Sinai desert and connect the two ancient waters of the Mediterranean and Red seas. It is possible the Persians successfully did so under Darius, but it is difficult to say with certainty. Napoleon expressed a high degree of interest in such a project before his hopes of global empire were thwarted. It was the French who took on the canal as a commercial venture in cooperation with the Egyptian government, interestingly originally vociferously opposed by the British. But by the time it was complete, the British understood its value and eventually took it over as a “protectorate” for decades. In an interesting bit of nautical showmanship, when the canal was to be first opened to traffic, the French empress Eugénie was scheduled to lead a host of international ships down the Canal with the French ship at the lead. But to the horror of the Egyptians and the outrage of the French, a British warship managed to steal a sail on everyone by maneuvering its way through the assembled fleet in the course of the night without lights and managed to be the first ship through the canal—thus presaging the eventual British takeover. The captain was officially reprimanded and unofficially commended. My first trip of the many I have done both north and south through the canal was in the mid-1990s. I was a relatively inexperienced captain and just thirty- eight years old in command of a 9,000-ton Navy destroyer with a crew of three hundred. I did all the reading I could on the protocols of the canal, and knew that we would have to depend a great deal on the “professional” pilots (former Egyptian naval officers) who would guide us through using their local knowledge. I was told to be prepared to offer some baksheesh, a sort of cross between a gift and a bribe. The usual thing was to offer up multiple cartons of cigarettes. Foolishly, I decided to spare us the expense of a hundred dollars in smokes and offered the pilot instead the “highly coveted” baseball cap of my ship and a hearty handshake. He went immediately into a huge pout, unfolded a canvas stool, and sat passively on the bridge. We were on our own. Fortunately, my navigator was a brilliant young officer, Lieutenant Robb Chadwick, and he had a crack team of quartermasters who had spent a month learning everything there was to know about the canal and devouring the various charts and descriptions of it, called “Sailing Directions.” They managed to get us to the midpoint at the Great Bitter Lake, where the north-and southbound traffic divides up to allow passage, as the canal can handle only one stream of ships at a time. As we maneuvered to our anchorage, the Egyptian pilot finally roused himself and began insisting that we come hard to starboard to a completely different anchorage from the one we had been assigned. Thinking he must know what he was talking about, I started to bring the ship in that direction. Lieutenant Chadwick literally threw himself between me and the pilot and said, “Captain, if we keep heading there we are going to go aground.” My choice: follow the advice of the local pilot and fifty-year-old expert, or that of my twenty-six-year- old Annapolis grad on his first voyage through the Canal? I ordered all stop, swung the rudder to port, and headed to where Robb indicated and dropped the hook. The pilot lost his temper and stormed off the bridge. In the ensuing calm, Robb showed me precisely on the chart where we would have gone aground under the direction of the pilot. Had we gone aground, I would have been a retired Navy commander and probably doing something very different with my life. It was one of those pivot points in life that flashes across the screen when a single decision establishes a very different trajectory depending on the choice we make. So many of our lives and careers depend on others, and very often they are the people who work for us and whom we are mentoring. As an aside, in a cosmic way I returned the favor on 9/11, when I invited then-commander Robb Chadwick to pay an office call on me in the Pentagon. He stepped away from his desk in the Navy Intelligence Center to spend time with me, and thus was out of his office when the plane crashed more or less directly into it. All of his office mates were killed, several of them good friends to us both. Robb and I have had a close relationship since, to say the least. It strikes me that the Suez Canal is above all a symbol of the power of connections—between ancient seas, civilizations, rivals, and friends. It became in the nineteenth century a vital interest of Britain’s and continued to be so essentially through the late 1960s when the British withdrew their forces from “east of Aden” after Indian independence. With the speed and mobility that the canal provided the mid-nineteenth-century Royal Navy and the East India Company, the British were able to increase their domination over the Indian Ocean. Indeed, throughout the nineteenth century, the British avoided the kind of major set-piece battles that we see in places like the Mediterranean, but were kept quite busy controlling their rivals, suppressing individual revolts and uprisings (the so-called small wars, although no war feels small when you are in it), weeding out the slave trade, and trying to stop piracy. The heart of nineteenth-century piracy was in the waters between the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal—essentially in and around the Strait of Malacca. Here again we see the strategic importance of geography, which allowed pirates the ability to build safe havens (much as we will see in the Caribbean) from which to operate beyond the reach of deeper-hulled warships. By 1824, the British and Dutch had reached an accommodation that included a stated intent to work together to reduce piracy and eliminate slavery. This proved to be no easy task, as many of the pirate regimes were backed by city-states and countenanced by local rulers who would take a cut of the profits. Some operated from fairly large vessels that, when gathered together, could threaten any commercial ship and even some small warships. Some of the pirate fleets boasted hundreds of vessels of varying sizes and required real application of shipboard firepower to suppress. Hence these sea routes continued to be very dangerous throughout the region. During this period, the British and the Dutch consolidated their colonial control of huge swaths of population and land. All of this had an extraordinary effect on the colonized populations, a phenomenon that is best understood on the British side—the rise of the culture of British India is still part of the DNA of modern India. Reading the superb novels of George MacDonald Fraser, four of which are set in and around India during this period, is not only entertaining but also reasonably historically accurate. Centered on a British officer named Flashman, they show the dark side of colonization in vivid anecdote. The first of the series, Flashman, is set in India and today’s Pakistan/Afghanistan region as Flashman is an appointed official with the East India Company in 1839. Over the next twenty years, he goes to sea to rescue his wife from pirates (Flashman’s Lady) and survives the Sepoy Mutiny (Flashman in the Great Game), among other adventures. I have read them all over the years, and for a view of how disturbing the colonization of the Indian Ocean littoral must have been for the indigenous populations, they are hard to beat. The strategic motif of trade as the central focus continued throughout the nineteenth century, with coffee and spices continuing but with the additional inclusion of sugar, cotton, tea, and rubber feeding back to the Industrial Revolution in Europe. The critical ports and territories gradually accrued to the British: Kenya, Somaliland, Sudan, Egypt, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Iraq, Mauritius, India, and of course Singapore guarding the gates to the east. France had hung on to a scattering of islands including Madagascar, Réunion, and the Comoros, while Portugal still held Mozambique, East Timor, and the trading port of Goa on the Indian mainland. The Dutch held what is today Indonesia and Malaysia, styled as the Dutch East Indies. Even Italy found its way into the colonial scramble around the Indian Ocean with the acquisition of Eritrea and Somalia. Throughout the nineteenth century, the advent of new technologies—notably the steam engine—coupled with the opening of the Suez Canal to vastly increase the movement of humans around the Indian Ocean. Indians and Chinese moved back and forth between their regions, and smaller groups of Malays, Indonesians, and Filipinos were moved as low-cost labor: slaves by another name, living under brutal conditions of indenture. Such workers were used on plantations under conditions of complete penury to the benefit of colonial businesses. In addition to the movement of indentured laborers, another dark side of the trade routes across the Indian Ocean during the nineteenth century was the movement of opium. It was produced in India and Java to feed the markets of China, a trade encouraged by the colonizing powers. This led to the 1839 First Opium War between Great Britain and the Qing dynasty of China. Both Singapore and Hong Kong were central to the highly profitable opium trade. As the century concluded and the European world headed toward the “dimming of the lights” with the coming of World War I, the changes across the entire Indian littoral were immense. Most important were the movement of workers and the entrenchment of significant colonial regimes throughout the region. Surprisingly, there had not been an outbreak of major great-power combat, and World War I would have little lasting effect on the Indian Ocean— it would be as distant thunder. But of course what lay ahead for the region was the Second World War and its attendant effects—violence, especially on the northeast corner of the Indian Ocean in Burma and down the Malay Peninsula— but above all the end of colonization. As World War II loomed on the horizon, British planners understood the vulnerability of the Indian Ocean to Japanese attack, either overland or via the sea. But they thought Singapore would hold, preventing easy maritime access, and the huge distances and the need for Japan to subdue and hold China seemed to mitigate the overall threat. It is easy to understand why the British thought Singapore—the “Lion City”—would hold out against the Japanese onslaught. It has strong geography that ought to favor a determined defender (it lies on an island, for example), and at that point in the conflict, the British still believed that their military simply had better discipline, skills, and technology than the Japanese. They were terribly wrong, and the city fell into Japanese hands on February 15, 1942. It was held until the surrender of Japan in 1945. I first sailed into Singapore in the mid-1980s, and even then it was a clean, technologically advanced, multicultural city, which used a combination of strong social networking, enlightened racial and educational policies, strict policing, economic incentives, and political control to build a powerhouse city-state out of virtually nothing but raw geography and human capital. Under an inspired leader, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore has emerged as a showcase city, easily ranking at the top of all social and economic indices in Asia and in the top ten in the world. As I walked around the city looking for a place to play squash (and found one at the “American Club”), I was struck by the incredible contrast with every other major Asian city at that time. It was scrupulously clean, full of public gardens, signed in English (the lingua franca of this most multicultural city-state), and very, very law abiding. Like most tourists of that time, I went to Raffles Bar (named for an early British governor-general) and had a too sweet Singapore sling, a sappy cocktail. But what is really striking about the city is its geopolitical position. Sitting astride the most important shipping strait in the world, defended by water on all sides, blessed with a fine dockyard and a now-powerful military, Singapore is a good country to have on your side. The United States has a very close relationship with the highly professional Singapore military, and my work with them in the Arabian Gulf on the maritime side over the years left a deep impression on me as to the seriousness with which they take their defense. Given their enviable position, they need a strong military and strong friends as well. Since that first visit, I have returned to Singapore many times. The most illuminating visit was in the mid-2000s when I served as the senior military assistant to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. We went to see the former prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. It is hard to describe how he is viewed there— sort of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln together, with a little Franklin Delano Roosevelt thrown in. At that point in time he was in his eighties and Secretary Rumsfeld was in his seventies. A former prime minister and nation founder meeting with a two-time secretary of defense, White House chief of staff, and ambassador and having a long cordial conversation. To see these two lions in winter, in the City of Lions, spar about the world was extraordinary. What they agreed upon was that it takes discipline, vision, and some tough decisions to build something lasting. Hard to argue with that, and the nation of Singapore is a pretty accurate reflection of that approach. And the food was a lot better than on my first trip. All of that modernization came long after the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942, which opened up the broader Indian Ocean to the Japanese war machine. Their naval planners were beginning to think about campaigns— both overland and at sea—that would cut India itself off from the British Empire. Meanwhile, both Italy and Germany mounted maritime campaigns throughout the northern Indian Ocean. While the Italian forces, operating mainly off the coast of East Africa, were soon neutralized, the Germans continued significant U-boat operations throughout the war. In addition to the German submarines, Nazi surface ships—including the pocket battleship Graf Spee—conducted commerce raiding. The strategic theory was to cut off the sea lanes of communication between Britain and its colonies; destroy the general commerce in the region, which benefited not only the United Kingdom but also France and the Netherlands; prepare for further land operations; and conduct harassment against Australia. There were no significant fleet-wide actions in the Indian Ocean as there were in the central and western Pacific, which was the main theater of war, but there were literally hundreds of single-ship and small-group combat operations throughout the region. Overall, operations were a draw, with both the Axis and the Allies having ships “at sea and operational” throughout the conflict. • • • FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II, the key geopolitical change in the Indian Ocean was the essential departure of the United Kingdom. The Indian Ocean had been largely a British protectorate for more than two hundred years as a result of the “jewel in the crown” of empire, the Imperial Raj of India. The ocean had been ringed by British colonies in East Africa, South Asia, and the western side of Southwest Asia. In today’s world it is hard to imagine the power and scope of the British Empire globally in the Victorian era through the end of World War II. By 1968, Britain—which had never truly recovered as an imperial power after the war—made a strategic decision to withdraw “east of Aden” on the southwestern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. In practical terms this meant that a strategic vacuum would be created, just as the cold war began to truly unfold. Nature abhors a vacuum, and when the British left the waters of the Indian Ocean, the fleets of the United States and the Soviet Union arrived. Both nations decided to increase the levels of their patrols throughout the region, although their objectives differed. The United States wanted to maintain stability in a vast and now relatively ungoverned part of the global maritime commons; protect the flow of tankers providing needed oil to and from the Arabian Gulf; and ensure a ready, maritime-based supply of strategic minerals and materials—chromium, rare earths, cobalt, manganese, copper. For Russia (which had its own supply of oil from its huge reserves), the objective was first simply to compete with the United States for political influence among the nations of the region and to maintain a strategic partnership with India, which it saw as a potential counterbalance to NATO. Although today we think instinctively of the Arabian Gulf in terms of the supply of oil globally, it is important to remember that all of those nations did not become major producers until the mid-twentieth century. As other sources of oil ran down, the percentage of oil held in the Gulf region, Iran, and Iraq soared (all this before the advent of a great deal of offshore oil and the use of fracking, of course). This made the region of extreme importance strategically, with tankers departing the Gulf many times an hour and the nations of the region developing OPEC to control the price and quantity of oil on the market. All of this contributed to the strategic importance of the region and in a maritime context to the vital protection of the Gulf region. American war planners were concerned that the Soviet Union might make a play to drive south or at a minimum to achieve warm-water ports on the Indian Ocean—something that history has not shown persuasively to be the case, although it was a commonly held view at the time. Of note, by the early 1970s neither the United States nor the Soviets had any actual naval bases in the region. The Soviets had a treaty with Iraq that gave them access at Basra, and the United States maintained a very small naval force in Bahrain (only three warships and a generally unhappy two-star admiral, pondering the reasons for his exile). As the importance of the flow of oil increased, the nations in the region began to think about how to improve their geographic and strategic positions. And both nations sought to marginalize China, which for two millennia had been an important player in the Indian Ocean but which neither the United States nor the Soviet Union wanted to see in the region then. The United States throughout this period cooperated closely with both Saudi Arabia (as it does today, of course) and with Iran under the shah. Both nations received billions of dollars of training and equipment from the United States (paying for almost all of it from their oil revenues). The United States also exploited the British protectorate island in the center of the Indian Ocean, Diego Garcia, where U.S. engineers in the early 1970s built a huge airstrip, massive fuel tanks, significant docks, housing, communications, and intelligence- gathering facilities. In the mid-1980s, about a decade later, I sailed into the lagoon at Diego Garcia, not quite sure what to expect. A standing joke in the Navy among junior officers was that if you screwed up badly enough, you’d be sent to either Adak, Alaska, or Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. From what I had heard, I would have requested Adak. But when we arrived ashore, I found an intriguing and not uncomfortable environment: nice barracks ashore, primitive but acceptable golf and tennis facilities, a small but decent officers’ club, and a place of incredible natural beauty. That it was the strategic hub of the Indian Ocean didn’t dawn on me, but I sure enjoyed hitting some tennis balls after a few long and boring weeks at sea sailing from Singapore. The Soviets, on the other hand, worked to conduct frequent “show the flag” cruises throughout the region—to Sri Lanka, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Pakistan, and of course to India. Over time, the Soviets were able to develop cooperation agreements with India, Yemen, and—on the east coast of Africa—Somalia. As a result, they had access to ports for their warships, with supplies and logistics as well. All of this in accordance with the Mahanian doctrine of sea power both nations followed. Both nations competed for influence and control over two perceived “treasure houses,” as Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev called them: the energy and oil of the Gulf and the strategic minerals of sub-Saharan Africa. The breakdown for the United States was the collapse of the shah’s regime in Iran and the rise of the Ayatollah Khomeini’s government, which truly, madly, deeply, hated the United States. This effectively closed off one side of the Arabian Gulf (this was the time we switched to calling it “Arabian Gulf” instead of what we had historically called it, the “Persian Gulf”). It also put a bitter enemy in effective control of the entrance to the Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz. The Soviets had several successes in this period as well. The Soviet adventures in southern Africa, both in Angola and Mozambique, were initially successful (especially with Cuban troops fighting alongside the Soviets in Angola) and two new client states emerged. And when Somalia and Ethiopia went to war in 1977, the Soviets shifted sides and pocketed a strong relationship with Ethiopia (more than 30 million people) at the cost of betraying the smaller nation of Somalia. Yemen also became a Marxist state. Suddenly, the only major client of the United States was Saudi Arabia, and the Soviets were picking up relationships, bases, and political support around the rest of the Indian Ocean littoral. As a theater of political cold war, the Indian Ocean looked very much like a Soviet win. In the complex geopolitics of today’s world, perhaps the two most dangerous state-on-state confrontations exist around the littoral of the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Gulf. We discussed the Arabian Gulf “twilight war” between Saudi Arabia and Iran earlier in this chapter, but the most dangerous of all—because of the availability of nuclear weapons—is the cold war between Indian and Pakistan. The British departure from the South Asian subcontinent after World War II eventually led to the division of that vast region into three nations: Pakistan, the second most populous Muslim nation in the world; India, which will soon overtake China as the world’s most populous state (and possessor of the third largest Muslim population, by the way); and Bangladesh. The Indian- Pakistani hatreds are deep-seated and are partly religious, partly cultural, and partly geographic (with the flash point of the disputed Kashmir region at their tactical heart). While the divisions between India and Pakistan seem insurmountable at the moment, there is at least a ray of hope in the conversations between Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Narendra Modi of India. The United States has a vital interest (as does the entire world) in avoiding a nuclear confrontation between these two states. While their disputes do not typically unfold at sea, it is entirely possible that an incident could cause a flare-up at any point. This is the most dangerous aspect of the Indian Ocean, which has been generally a commercial and not a war-fighting body of water. One tragic incident that illustrates that not all problems are man-made was the devastating tsunami that struck much of the Indian Ocean littoral in 2004 on the day after Christmas. A 9.0 undersea earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia caused it, and the resulting tidal waves almost instantly killed well over 200,000 people. Some estimates of total deaths rise to nearly 300,000, concentrated in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. The waves were as high as one hundred feet in places as they crested across densely populated portions of those nations. I had only recently assumed duties as the senior military assistant to the secretary of defense, and we quickly assembled a crisis action team in the Pentagon to see what the Department of Defense could do. We put a superb U.S. Marine general, Lieutenant General Rusty Blackman, in charge of the response, and he swiftly marshaled the huge logistic, humanitarian, and medical capability of the department. Conducting daily video- teleconferences with the secretary, he was able to get U.S. hospital ships, big- deck amphibious vessels, and aircraft on scene and dispensing aid and assistance to the various devastated populations. As I watched night after night in the command center in the Pentagon the videos of our sailors, Marines, airmen, and soldiers wading into water to rescue people, moving huge bags of relief supplies, and caring for the wounded and the sick, I was deeply moved. We spend a great deal of time in the military conducting lethal combat operations—that is who we are. But we also can deploy soft power in massive ways that can make a real difference in the world. And the result—a changed view of our nation—is so often the way we can create real security over the long haul. In some ways, the deployment of our massive, 60,000-ton hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort, can do more for our security than the combat cruises of our nuclear aircraft carriers. Both have a role, and our ability to balance both hard power (combat) and soft power (disaster relief, medical assistance, diplomacy) has been called “smart power.” An apt term, and it came home to me in the Indian Ocean during those terrible weeks after a quarter of a million people died on the television screens before our eyes. Piracy was part of the mission set I inherited in 2009 when I became the Supreme Allied Commander for NATO. The twenty-eight nations of NATO had collectively voted to join the effort to stop the worst of the piracy that was emanating from the largely ungoverned space of what had once been Somalia. Fueled by khat, a soporific drug they would chew, Somali ex-fishermen would mount skiffs and set out to take down large container ships by scaling the sides, overpowering the crew, and then sailing the ships into Somali anchorages and demanding ransoms of millions of dollars. As I took over the mission, there were nearly twenty ships and more than two hundred mariners held hostage, and the number of assaults was rising. The international community cannot agree on much, but on the view of piracy as an ancient scourge that is punishable by any sovereign nation there is universal agreement. Therefore, my task was to gain additional resources and warships from a broader coalition than just the twenty-eight NATO nations. We cast a wide net, including some traditionally non-NATO-aligned countries: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Iran all responded in a positive way—either sending ships, participating with intelligence, or at a minimum providing logistic and refueling support. This was quite unprecedented: a grand nautical coalition that included the United States and Canada from North America, more than thirty European nations, and five aforementioned countries that do not wake up in the morning looking for ways to cooperate with NATO, to say the least. Thus we saw in the Indian Ocean a good example of a strategic approach that provides a means to cobble together nations that are normally at one another’s throats. That we could in the process significantly knock down piracy was equally good. By 2013, as I was departing NATO, we had just a couple of ships and a small handful of mariners still being held. The bottom had been knocked out of the piracy business, and many of the pirates had been apprehended and remanded to justice. Not a single ship has been pirated at sea off the coast of East Africa in the past couple of years. Partly, this is because of progress ashore as well, fueled by the good work of the European Union. But in terms of reducing piracy in a region of the world that has seen it often, this is a rare good story of coordination at sea, and full of lessons for seeking other zones of cooperation on the world’s oceans. • • • TO SUMMARIZE: Throughout this book and in our world, discussions about maritime issues tend to focus on the Atlantic Ocean, with its attached Mediterranean Sea; and the Pacific Ocean, with the South China Sea. There are endless discussions about the emerging conflicts, the flow of refugees, and competition over vital hydrocarbons, as well as the geopolitical impact of the two “major oceans.” Yet the twenty-first century will be more about the Indian Ocean than either of the other two—and the sooner we fully realize that in the United States, the better. We cannot forget the facts of the case: The Indian Ocean, while admittedly smaller than the Atlantic or the Pacific, consists of nearly a quarter of the waters on the globe, especially when one counts its major subordinate seas, the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Across its vast expanse move 50 percent of all shipping and containers and 70 percent of all oil, making it quite literally the crossroads of globalization. Nearly forty nations border it, with more than a third of the world’s population. And it is the beating heart of the Islamic world, with Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the Gulf States all having coastal access to the Indian Ocean. More than 90 percent of the world’s Islamic population is in this massive catchment basin. And it is highly militarized and constantly in a high state of tension. The highest potential nuclear conflict in the world today is between Pakistan and India—two huge, capable, professional, and nuclear-capable militaries. Iran is an adventurist state with an innovative and battle-trained military force. Many of the other nations along the littoral have internal conflicts and significant chaos along their borders, particularly in East Africa. Piracy, while reduced over the past several years, remains a threat both along the coast of East Africa and in the Strait of Malacca connecting the Indian Ocean with the Pacific. The history of the Indian Ocean certainly does not inspire confidence in the potential for peaceful governance in the twenty-first century. As we have seen, throughout the centuries its trade routes have inspired competition and conflict since East met West with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1497. The British conquest of India and the commercial muscle of the British East India Company dominated the region for a time in the nineteenth century, but the breakup of the Ottoman Empire and great-power maneuvering during World War II led into the long twilight of the cold war when American, Soviet, Chinese, and Indian vessels played cat and mouse. There are other flashpoints centered in the Indian Ocean beyond India and Pakistan. There is no love lost between China and India in the region, particularly as China continues to expand its commercial influence and basing throughout the Indian Ocean littoral. There is piratical activity along the East African littoral and throughout the western Indonesian archipelago. In the Arabian/Persian Gulf, the Sunni-Shi’a conflict continues to play out at sea as it does ashore. Yemen is on fire in a manifestation of Sunni-Shi’a conflict as Houthi rebels seek dominance of the poverty-stricken nation. Much of this is well documented in Robert Kaplan’s superb treatment of the region, Monsoon: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power. The salient question for the United States is simple: What is our role? How can we help create U.S. security and stability in the global oceanic commons upon which we depend for so much of our international trade? First, we must recognize the vital importance of the Indian Ocean itself. On our maps and globes, it tends to be depicted as split (in order to give primacy to “our” oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific). Our strategic and geopolitical mental map reflects this, and in all of our thinking—from the Pentagon to our Fortune 500 companies to our academic and humanitarian institutions—we should consciously consider the importance of this vast body of water and its littoral nations. Second, we must consider India. It will soon overtake China as the world’s most populous nation, it is led by a dynamic and globally oriented leader in Prime Minister Modi, its lingua franca is English, and—above all—it is a vibrant, legitimate democracy with whom we share fundamental values. Too often in the international conferences I attend all over the world we end up discussing China, the United States, and the European Union—important to be sure—but never even mention India. In this century, the rise of India may be the most important single geopolitical driver, and its engagement in the Indian Ocean will be an enormous part of that. Third, we must deploy and operate in the region with all of our forces. This most obviously requires a strong and deployable Navy and Air Force, but the Army and Marines have work to do as well. The Department of Defense should be building more exercises in the region like the recently completed Exercise Malabar, which brought U.S., Indian, and Japanese forces together in naval exercises. Fourth, we should continue the global counterpiracy campaign, which has shown real success off the coast of East Africa. When we can bring together not only NATO, European, and Asian allies but also Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Iran, there are few things we cannot successfully do. Within the turbulence of the Indian Ocean, counterpiracy operations are something almost everyone can agree upon—we can help lead that effort. Fifth, one enormous key to unlocking the potential of the region is solving two difficult challenges: the Indian-Pakistani conflict, centered on the disputed Kashmir but in reality the result of religious, cultural, and historical differences; and the Shi’a-Sunni divide, which continues to make the Arabian Gulf volatile. These are long-term challenges, but whatever U.S. diplomacy can do to reduce tensions and avoid open confrontation will be helpful. Sixth, the Arabian Gulf will not simply be a “lesser but included” subset of the Indian Ocean. Because of its particular place as the fault line between the Sunni and Shi’a worlds, it will demand a significant level of U.S. involvement in order to fulfill our objectives there: freedom of the high seas and an open sea lane of communication through the Strait of Hormuz, particularly for oil; capable allies in the Sunni Arab world, led by Saudi Arabia; a functioning modus vivendi with Iran; and an environmentally safe region given the high potential for ecological disasters. In 2016, we saw several incidents of U.S. warships involved in disturbing scenarios in and around both the Arabian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. There is today a particularly high general state of tension with Iran at sea, in spite of the negotiated nuclear arms agreement. Since the agreement and the lifting of sanctions, Iranian naval forces—and particularly the Revolutionary Guard— have become emboldened. In January, they came upon two U.S. Navy riverine craft operating innocently in their waters (one had broken down, the other was helping, and both had poor navigation and communication equipment readiness). In a violation of international law and seafaring custom, the U.S. Navy sailors were not assisted but instead were disarmed, put into humiliating stress positions, and taken into port. The Iranians used video of the sailors to further humiliate them, in direct contravention of international norms. Late in 2016, U.S. Navy destroyers operating in international waters off the coast of Yemen were attacked by cruise missiles fired by Houthi rebels, who probably had Iranian training, targeting, and concurrence, considering the staunch Iranian support for the Houthis. Both incidents are harbingers of much more tension to come, particularly in the Arabian Gulf, but also in the northern Indian Ocean. Above all, we simply need to factor the huge Indian Ocean and the smaller but vital Arabian Gulf fully into our thinking—they must not be forgotten as we sail into the twenty-first century. There will clearly be greater impact from this heretofore less noticed but still enormous body of water, and sailors will find the Indian Ocean far less domesticated than its twin cousins, the Atlantic and Pacific. How the geopolitics of the Indian Ocean unfolds will be a crucial vector for the overall trends of twenty-first-century geopolitics. 4. THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE WAR AT SEA BEGAN The Mediterranean was the source of the Western world’s best sailors for millennia. Map created by Samuel John Neele, 1817. With frictions over natural resources and migration resurfacing, the recent peaceful history of the Mediterranean is under threat. Mankind’s geopolitical journey upon the seas began in earnest on the waters of the Mediterranean. Through the centuries of man’s sailing across the ocean’s waves, it was in the Mediterranean Sea that sailors created and then perfected the idea of war at sea. As a result, no other body of water can lay claim to such a central place in early global history—at least when it comes to war. If the remains of long-dead mariners were suddenly to float unencumbered to the surface, you could easily walk the length of the Mediterranean over the bones of warriors who died at sea. The Med is close to a million square miles in area, more than 2,400 miles from east to west, and is spread out along 23,000 long miles of coastline. Yet the opening strait, the only part that links the Med to the vast Atlantic Ocean, is less than ten miles wide at the highly strategic Strait of Gibraltar—which was known to the Greeks and Romans as the Pillars of Hercules. Another way to think about the size of the Mediterranean would be to imagine the Med superimposed over a map of the United States. The Strait of Gibraltar would be roughly where San Diego is located on the West Coast. The Suez Canal and the approaches to the Red Sea would be on the northeast coast of Florida, near Jacksonville. The top of the Adriatic Sea would be almost to the Canadian border, just west of the Great Lakes; and the Libyan Gulf of Sidra would touch the Gulf of Mexico. Highway 66, stretching all across the United States, would fit from east to west. This is a big body of water, to say the least. And most important, it has a series of fateful geographic features that appear again and again in the long throw of Mediterranean history: the narrowness of the opening in the west, of course, but also the enormous central importance of the largest island, Sicily—a prize over which nations have fought for more than three thousand years. Likewise, the dagger of Italy thrusting toward Africa and effectively bifurcating the Med is a geographic feature that will continue to make itself known. Its length and central position, with excellent ports both east and west, gave rise to Roman trade and enabled its sea power through the long Pax Romana. And to the south of Sicily, its smaller but almost equally strategic cousin Malta will appear repeatedly in the strategic drama of the Med. Continuing east, the rocky island terrain of the Aegean has been a maritime battleground that echoes today as Greek and Turkish warships and aircraft conduct a delicate dance of confrontation that seems to belie their common NATO alliance membership and reminds us of Christian and Muslim hatreds from a thousand years ago that drove events through the eastern Med. Here the key islands are Cyprus, dominating the approaches to the Levant, and Crete, long and bulky, guarding the entrances to the Aegean. To the north of course is the Black Sea, truly deserving of its own place in the books of history, but forever serving as a sort of “Med in miniature” through the millennia, with many of the same conflicts playing out north of the strategic passage of the Bosporus. And to the south, the flat terrain of the North African desert, the rich delta of the Nile, and the harsh land crossing the Suez all play a continuing part in the history, politics, and culture of the Med. The name of the sea itself derives from the Latin word mediterraneus, which can be translated as “inland” or as the “middle place between the land.” The Romans thought of it, appropriately, as the mare nostrum, “our sea.” From the beginning of recorded Western history, it functioned as a sort of global commons in a relatively confined space, providing a path for trade, an accessible source of protein, a field of transport, a ready battlefield, and a natural barrier. And it supplied much to the imagination of man as well. As the geography of the Mediterranean gradually revealed itself through the centuries, the legends grew of what lay beyond the Strait of Gibraltar. Dragons, sea monsters, the gates to Hades, the lost city of Atlantis—all occupied a place in popular imagination and culture. Rowing their graceful and reasonably reliable triremes, ancient sailors seldom chose to venture beyond the Strait of Gibraltar, where fear of the unknown held sway. The Med has also played a central role in both the development of war- fighting technology and the creation of maritime strategy. As the ancients gazed on the Med, they quickly developed seagoing means to do what they already did ashore: fight. The Med gave war the battering rams and multilayered oars of the triremes; the use of marines—essentially specially trained soldiers bred to fight on the waves; accurate cannons and early fire control systems; new means of propulsion, as sailing became vastly more sophisticated; and the application of steam, combustion engines, and eventually nuclear power. Each of the advances in combat at sea was tested, refined, and put to brutal use in the Med. For a modern Navy sailor, the first sense you feel passing through the Strait of Gibraltar coming into the Med is one of entering an ancient arena of battle. You feel hemmed in and closed off, something a sailor hates. When sailors part, in addition to wishing each other the common “fair winds and following seas,” they will sometimes say, “Godspeed and open water.” In the Med, you feel surrounded by history and somehow enfolded by the past, with not much obvious open water around—not a good feeling. I remember the first time I sailed a warship into the Mediterranean as a junior officer in the early 1980s—on the massive American aircraft carrier USS Forrestal (CV-59). Named for the first secretary of defense of the United States, James Forrestal, the ship was a floating city full of planes and bombs. It probably carried as much combat power in the high-performance aircraft on its decks as the entire Roman Empire could bring to bear. My job as an engineer kept me belowdecks much of the time, but when I ventured up to the hangar deck and then to the bridge as we sailed through the Strait of Gibraltar, I was struck by the small scale of the waterway with land close at hand on both sides. We passed through late on a summer’s evening, and the sea was beautiful, flat and calm. The Med is famously fickle in its weather, and it is a wise sailor who remembers the long voyage home by Odysseus to his home island of Ithaca from the Trojan War: a mix of beautiful sailing punctuated by terrible storms and disasters every time he and his crew ventured ashore. Wherever we went in the Med that summer, we had gorgeous weather; but as the fall descended, the days shortened and the weather chilled. The mistrals of winter—the great storms of the Med—were coming, and you could feel it not only in the surface of the sea and the great clouds above, but in the attitudes of the people in the ancient port cities we visited in the course of that long cruise. The French say a good mistral will blow the ears off a donkey—it will certainly make a ship rock and roll across the Med. The sense of history in every port— Athens, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, Alexandria, Syracuse, Naples, Cartagena, Tunis, and on and on—was palpable. The cold war, in full bloom in those long ago days, seemed a logical enough backdrop to our warship’s voyage. It also reinforced for me the various strategic geographical divisions in the Med. In the 1980s, at the height of the cold war, the United States tried to keep two carrier battle groups on call in the Mediterranean. One was typically in the western Med, with access to allied ports, easier logistics, and the ancient Roman ports on the coasts of Spain and Italy. A series of bases kept U.S. warships well supplied. In the eastern Med, it was another story. There was a great deal of Russian influence in Libya and Syria, and we often passed close aboard Russian flotillas. Our smaller ships would make their way up into the Black Sea, that miniature battle zone, knowing that if hostilities broke out, our strikes against the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies would make the Black Sea a death trap for U.S. warships. While thankfully we never went to war with the USSR, it was clear that operations in the Med were going to be a very dangerous proposition. We were a long way from home, facing a powerful local opponent—much as the Venetians must have felt as they sailed under Ottoman guns centuries earlier. The real question that kept occurring to me was simple: Why was the Mediterranean such an early crucible of war and conquest? First is its location as a watery crossroads between competing civilizations. Maritime geopolitics was born on the Mediterranean in the early battles between the Greeks and Persians, the Phoenicians and the Romans. As mankind started to ply the waters of the Med, vastly different civilizations came into contact—Europe, Africa, and Asia—and along with the exchange of trade, language, people, and other sources of wealth came conflict. The Med was simply an enabler of it all. Consider the geography of the Med, sitting as it does in a central position among competing societies and nations. Like spokes on a wheel, the key sea lanes of communication across the Med provided access to invading fleets. As early civilizations found their way to the Med, it was easy for adventurous kings and queens and emperors and pharaohs to envision using the water as a means to transport conquering fleets, ships bristling with soldiers, empty holds aching to be filled with treasure and slaves. And the natural geographic divisions—Italy most of all—create smaller individual zones in which to fight. Second, the Med is dotted with highly strategic islands. Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, Crete, the Aegean littoral islands—all provide convenient stepping- stones. As various empires consolidated and rose in importance, the battle for strategic landholdings in the Med rose as well. This created a second wave of conflict and enabled bases from which fleets could operate with impunity. It is worth remembering that even as both trade and war increased across the Med, there were many natural challenges that the ancients had to overcome. For starters, the weather is not easy. While the Med is generally a relatively benign environment in which to sail, it can be unpredictable and unforgiving to the unwary mariner. Second, the technology of navigating deep ocean sailing, out of sight of land, had to be developed over several centuries. Third, the ability to build strong and capable ships that could reliably sail over days and weeks was created over time through trial and error, and much loss of life. But as mankind honed the ability to go to sea, navigate effectively, and fight, the Mediterranean began to function in earnest as a kind of Thunder Dome or fighting cage, where two warring nations entered and often only one emerged. • • • THE FIRST TWO CIVILIZATIONS to make their mark at sea have both largely vanished: the Minoan Empire, centered on the island of Crete, which flourished for nearly a thousand years beginning in 2500 B.C.; and the Phoenician/Carthaginian Empire, which was destroyed by the Romans more than two thousand years ago in the world’s first fight to the death between two relatively advanced societies. The Cretans (roughly 2500 to 1200 B.C.) were forced to turn to the sea by a growing population four and a half millennia ago. They were natural sailors, and found many islands north of Crete over which they soon held sway. The relatively less advanced mainland Greek societies were forced to pay tribute to the Minoan kings, including sending tributes of young men and women to perform with the bulls in the capital of Knossos. Their story is part of the enduring legends of Greece, including the killing by the young prince Theseus of the Minotaur, a mythical creature that was half bull, half man, and to whom the tributes were sacrificed. Much of their society was probably destroyed more than three thousand years ago by an earthquake that has given rise to the legend of the destruction of the lost city of Atlantis. I remember sitting in a small café on Crete several years ago on a lovely summer’s night, enjoying a meal of grilled fish and Greek wine in the modern city of Chania, the second largest on the island. My host was a Greek general who led their armed forces as part of the NATO alliance for which I was serving as Supreme Allied Commander. We chatted a bit about the Minoans, and he opined that if their society had survived, the Greek world would have expanded and dominated the Med much as the Romans later did. When I offered that the Greek mainland city-states could never have banded together to conquer others, his response was simple: that was exactly what the Cretans could have done—forced them to work together. Perhaps. A different twist of the historical DNA, and a Greco-Cretan empire shimmers in the distance, challenging the Romans, perhaps alongside the Carthaginians. Who knows? • • • AT THE EASTERN END of the Med, along the present-day Levant, the Phoenician civilization began about 3000 B.C. and lasted some 2,500 years. Principally traders (as opposed to conquerors), the Phoenicians sailed throughout the known world. Their ships carried tin from Britain, amber and precious stones from the Baltic, as well as spices, slaves, and gold from western Africa. Their intrepid traders sailed beyond the Pillars of Hercules and began the first series of connections between the Mediterranean civilizations and India, operating out of their key ports of Tyre and Sidon. Phoenician trading ports began to dot the islands and the mainland of the Med, and one center began to rise in power on the southern rim of the sea in what is today Tunisia: Carthage. The Carthaginians, descended from Phoenician stock, eventually created an empire that stretched over the key islands of Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily as well as much of Spain and great stretches of coastal Africa along the Med. A tough- minded, harsh, and capable people, the Carthaginians competed alongside the early Greek traders (who pushed them out of the Black Sea and the Aegean early on) and finally would end up in a climactic series of wars with the Romans centuries later. • • • PERHAPS THE EARLIEST “clash of civilizations” (to take a phrase from the late contemporary political scientist Samuel Huntington) was likewise across the eastern Mediterranean—between the Greek mainland city-states and the world- dominating empire of Persia. Surprisingly, the Greeks managed to stop their fractious internal wars long enough to face the Persian onslaught roughly five hundred years before the birth of Christ. The Persians had at this point in their long history conquered much of the civilized world, and had expanded control from their bases in Mesopotamia to the shores of the Med. The Phoenicians in the Levant immediately capitulated and were able to provide ships and expertise in all things navigational to their new Persian masters. The Greeks, of course, pursued a different course and fought hard. By 492 B.C., the first Persian expedition arrived in Greece, but luckily for the Greeks, it was struck by a massive and disastrous storm. A second try also failed as an amphibious attack at Marathon ended in a significant defeat for the Persians. But the Persians were persistent and determined, and they regrouped over the next decade to finally return with what they considered overwhelming force. Persian king Xerxes brought nearly 1,500 fighting ships, almost 200,000 foot soldiers, and more than 100,000 sailors, marines, and rowers around 480 B.C.: a seemingly invincible force. The Greeks at this point were able to muster only around 500 ships, and were significantly outnumbered both at sea and on land. When the death stand of the “three hundred Spartans” at Thermopylae failed to halt the marching hordes, the last chance of the Greeks depended on the Athenian fleet, which would fight in its home waters. Led by the courageous and charismatic admiral Themistocles, the Greeks used the natural terrain of the craggy waters surrounding Athens to position their fleet to best advantage in Salamis Bay, just off the coast of Athens. Civilization in Greece was at stake. The key, in the end, was freedom. Each of the Greeks was a free man, fighting for his family and his city-state. Virtually all of the Persians were conscripts or slaves. Themistocles gathered his sailors and marines around him the night before the climactic battle and challenged them. Based on the description of the speech by the Greek historian Herodotus, we believe that Themistocles exhorted his men to row for their parents, to row for their wives and their children, to row for their city, and above all to row for freedom. They did, and their motivation and bravery—coupled with superior technology in the form of swifter, leaner, lighter galleys—carried the day. I have told that story many times, to many different audiences, and it never fails to create a sense in the room of the power of today’s all-volunteer military. At a dinner in New York City onboard the museum ship Intrepid a few years ago, I told it in honor of Navy SEAL Lieutenant Michael Murphy, who died in Afghanistan and was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic sacrifices on behalf of his men, his family (who were present at the speech), and ultimately his nation. Today a beautiful Navy destroyer, USS Michael Murphy (DDG-112), sails the oceans. I like to think you could drop a plumb line from the ancient free Greeks at Salamis Bay to Michael Murphy’s ship—having in common their courage, honor, and commitment. With the Athenian-and Spartan-led Greek victory, a sort of potential golden age shimmered before the Greeks; but they quickly squandered it by returning to what they did with the greatest gusto—fighting with one another. Thus the Greeks, despite all of their access to the Med and their highly capable militaries, were unable to truly push outward on the seas to create a significant empire (beyond conquering parts of Sicily and some other shoreline areas). It was the Romans who truly created the “inner sea” and ruled its complete periphery with extraordinary effect for centuries. • • • THE ROMANS ROSE IN POWER as the Greek city-states sought to maintain control of the waters between Sicily and southern Italy and as the young Carthaginian Empire was expanding from the North African shore. Rome faced competition from both, and as they consolidated their power in the third century before Christ, the Romans overwhelmed the Greeks who ruled small colonies ashore on the Italian peninsula. Across the Med, the watchful Carthaginians sensed the confrontation to come, and the island of Sicily became the first point of confrontation in what came to be known as the Punic Wars (named for the Latin word for Carthaginian). Once again, the Med became a massive battlefield as the previously land- oriented Romans recognized the need to build a fleet. Their coasts were vulnerable to the traditionally seafaring Carthaginians, and their seaborne commerce was a rich source of plunder that was highly vulnerable to their enemy’s capable fleets. Turning to the conquered Greeks, the Romans were able to acquire a fleet—but they lacked the knowledge of how to fight at sea. They were experts at raising an army and conducting combat hand to hand, but at first were not able to bring their approach to bear against the nimble Carthaginian fleet tacticians, who were masters of flanking, breaking through an enemy’s ship line, and above all ramming and sinking enemy ships through superior ship handling. As would often be the case in war at sea, the answer was to invent a new tactic, technique, or piece of equipment: in this case the corvus. This was a kind of gangplank made of iron that could be pivoted and dropped athwart an enemy’s deck. It had a gripping hook on the forward end, and soldiers could then surge across it to the opposing deck. In several major seagoing battles of the second century B.C., the Romans were able to use this crude but effective boarding tactic facilitated by the new equipment of the corvus to destroy large numbers of Carthaginian ships. As the Roman-Carthaginian Punic Wars unfolded, over time it was the Roman mastery of the sea that led to the defeat of the Carthaginians. Despite the brilliance of the Carthaginian general Hannibal ashore, it was the ability of the Roman fleet to send a major army to North Africa that sounded the death knell of the Carthaginians in 146 B.C. In the end, it was mastering the Mediterranean Sea that provided Rome first the massive island of Sicily, then the rich raw materials of the Iberian Peninsula, and finally the shores of North Africa and the breadbasket of modern Tunisia. Along the way, the Roman navy swept the seas free of pirates and vagabond maritime states, gaining a strong seagoing culture, a naval officer corps, and the confidence to rule the inner sea of the Med with authority and creativity. I will always recall a trip to Tunisia in early 2001 a bit after I was first selected for rear admiral. It was with a group of fellow newly promoted one-star officers, both admirals and generals. As I walked along the bluffs overlooking the southern Mediterranean, I was reminded about the destruction of Carthage and it made me wonder how differently Europe and the Mediterranean world would be today if Carthage had been preserved, balancing the Roman juggernaut and creating a vastly different set of geopolitical outcomes. We always tend to think of history as somehow predetermined—of course the Romans would win—but so often the great twists of history turn on a few decisions, a single battle, an unexpected invention, a visionary or a fanatic’s charisma. Carthage faded from history forever, and the Romans won; but what dreams of empire died with them? What crystallized the Roman domination of the Med following the defeat of the Carthaginians was a series of civil wars that moved Rome from a republic to an empire headed by Caesar Augustus. A series of complex rivalries, the assassination of Julius Caesar, the departure of the brilliant general Mark Antony to Egypt, and the rise of Augustus Caesar, then known as Octavian, collectively set the stage for the climactic battle at sea that would decide the fate of the Roman world in 31 B.C.: Actium, a small port off the coast of western Greece. These were not the largest fleets assembled, but it is hard to find a more pivotal battle in the history of the Med. Octavian, who was closer to his base in Rome, was able to bring just over 250 ships into play; while Antony, operating from Egypt and with the mesmerizing Cleopatra supporting him, brought around 200 larger ships to battle—unfortunately for him, heavy and weighed down with supplies and land troops. Octavian and his admiral, Agrippa, correctly assessed Antony’s forces as sluggish and lacking in the ability to maneuver smoothly and swiftly. The key would be nimble use of sail and rudder to isolate the enemy ships while avoiding grappling actions. Agrippa also used fire projectiles to good effect, and at a crucial moment in the battle Antony and his Egyptian consort slipped away, leaving the bulk of the fleet to destruction. Hardly a proud example of leadership in action, and one of the few times in history a seagoing admiral has simply sailed away and left his fleet to fight to its death. This battle created the conditions for the Pax Romana, the Roman Peace. The Med, for the first time in its history, was truly an inland sea, controlled and patrolled by the power of one nation: Rome. While nuisance piracy was an occasional hazard, the Med enjoyed perhaps the most peaceful prolonged period in its history. Roman rule continued through most of the next five centuries until the decline and fall of the western empire unfolded in the fifth century A.D., followed by the Dark Ages in Europe and the rise of Islam as not only a religion but an enormous motivating geopolitical force. Beginning with nomadic Arabs, Islam spread around the periphery of the Med, conquering all of the Middle East, then Egypt and the Levant. Using this as a base, Islam spread to conquer the rest of North Africa, eventually taking southern Spain and many of the islands in the central and eastern Med. Frankly, it is not impossible to imagine a world in which Islam had triumphed through much of southern Europe. Yet the Christian armies stiffened their resistance, and Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire held firm throughout much of this period. Over time, the Holy Roman Empire emerged in the West, and by the eleventh century the Christians were preparing to strike back, across the Med, and undertake the colossal misadventure of the Crusades. During the Crusades, the Med served as a springboard for the Christian zealots of Europe to push their way into the Holy Land, and the newly (and relatively briefly) established Crusader kingdoms depended on the seas for resupply, logistics, and trade. The Crusades also gave great impetus to the rise of Venice and the Italian commercial cities over the course of the 250 years of various Christian campaigns. Here we see again the political importance of geography. Venice was particularly well positioned in the northern Adriatic, with easy access to the trade coming from Europe over the Alps and superb, relatively safe access to the Med itself. The Venetians were crisp geopolitical actors indeed—rather than seeking to hold huge swaths of territory (with all the attendant headaches of administration), they sought a series of trading bases. They acquired Crete and Cyprus, two of the most strategically positioned islands of the Med. They also built smaller forts and trading stations around the periphery of the eastern Mediterranean. In a way, their sea power strategy anticipated Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan by some six centuries in systematically pursuing key commercial and trading stations around their world. All of this was militarily anchored by the great Arsenal of Venice, which was an early technology assembly line construction facility producing great galleys. The Venetians used seagoing technology cleverly and at one time had a fleet of thousands of ships and tens of thousands of seamen—despite having a core population of only around two hundred thousand souls. Their relationships with other kingdoms and empires were based largely on trade, and they were adept at playing off Christian rulers against one another and manipulating them with the power of the Church and the control offered by the papacy. They seemed destined to dominate the eastern Med, and were growing richer and richer—all due to geopolitical planning, excellent use of geography in the Med, and the application of new technologies in construction, weaponry, and administration. And of course it was not just Venice that displayed power on the waters of the Mediterranean. The great trading cities of Italy and southern France all participated in the rising level of trade. The Italian city-states—Genoa, Ragusa, Pisa, and others—were essentially small maritime nations that developed new types of ships and sails and fueled their wars (and the Crusades) with wealth from trade linen, dye, spices, perfumes, jewels, drugs, and pearls. From the west came oil, soap, wax, honey, skins, and especially wood and metal. Trade was brisk and enormously impactful to the maritime republics of the central Med. Yet looming on the horizon was a new power—the rapidly rising Ottoman Turks, who came storming out of Central Asia. By exploiting the constant feuding between Arab potentates, they were able to essentially conquer the Arab world by 1400. Consolidating their control of modern-day Turkey, as well as the large Arab dominions, they truly took the center stage of the Mediterranean in 1453 by doing what so many had tried and failed to do: conquer Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire had been a haven for culture and Christianity for a thousand years, and it finally fell after constricting and losing its ability to protect itself from the sea, as well as simply failing to produce enough resources (people and wealth) to ward off the Turks. Whenever I am in Istanbul, I try to visit the superb Naval Museum, which is alongside the ferry terminals for commuters crossing the Bosporus in the Beşiktaş district. It is a quiet place full of the relics of the Ottoman Empire, most notably many of the great barges of state used by the rulers and oared by twenty or thirty oarsmen at a time. There is a nice garden outside with various cannons, as is usually the case at such museums. But the thing that always catches my eye is relatively modest—an anchor chain, of which only a few links exist today. It is black and rough, and appears to be made of iron. The placard proclaims it part of the “great chain” made in the eighth century by one of the Byzantine emperors. In times of war, the chain was used to protect the city from the approach of enemy vessels by stretching it across the entrance to the Golden Horn. It was used successfully many times and appears for the final time in history in 1453 as the Ottomans were besieging the city. Mehmet the Conqueror could not get through it, but instead moved his war fleet of some seventy vessels overland through sheer dint of manpower. In the end, the chain failed to protect the city, just as the city was unable to protect Western civilization from the energy and dynamism of the Ottomans. With the fall of Constantinople, the Ottomans were able to push into Europe as far as Vienna, and to increasingly dominate large tracts of strategic seacoasts along the eastern and southern Med. Their practices were brutal even by the standards of the day, and included forced conversions to Islam, slavery, and a particular focus on capturing Christian ships and enslaving their crews. The two civilizations—Christian and Muslim—were on a collision course that would bring great strife throughout the 1500s and 1600s. As with previous conflicts in the Med, geography played an important role. The Ottomans were able to use their sea bases along the coasts and sought to reach out into the island chains of the Aegean and to the west. The Europeans tried to use the coastal bases of Italy as their strategic bastion, while attempting to dominate the same strategic islands. Technologies—cannons, sail, rowing, marine tactics—were roughly equal, although the Ottomans had a better system of administration and training in that it was relatively uniform throughout their growing empire. The West had a collection of different systems at play, which made it more difficult for them to operate seamlessly when fleets from different national entities came together. The fall of the strategically important island of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean to the Ottomans in 1570 finally alarmed the various competing European nations to the point that Pope Pius V formed what was called “the Holy League,” principally backed and manned by the Italians and the Spanish, to counter the Ottomans. The Turks continued to push both on land and at sea, and soon it was clear that a significant sea battle would decide the directions of the maritime campaign, and in many ways determine the fate of Europe. That battle occurred near Lepanto, off the western coast of Greece in the Ionian Sea. The day of the battle dawned clear and bright: October 7, 1571. The Turks brought more than 250 galleys manned by a total of 75,000 seamen and soldiers, while the allied European fleet, commanded by the Hapsburg prince Don John, was made up of roughly 200 galleys manned by just over 70,000 seamen and rowers. Crucially, the Venetians provided half a dozen galleasses—big, heavy, floating forts with terrible killing power. This would be the first great galley battle since Actium, some sixteen centuries earlier and in roughly the same part of the Med. Notably, the Ottomans came to it with overwhelming confidence, not having lost a significant sea battle in more than a century. But by the time the battle ended around four P.M., the sea was literally red with blood—almost all of it Ottoman. The Turks lost the vast majority of their ships, escaping with less than fifty vessels at a cost of more than 25,000 skilled seamen and marines. The Christian forces lost only 7,000 men and a dozen ships. It was a day upon which history turned, and it marked the high water level of Ottoman maritime ambitions for the broader Mediterranean. The difference was tactical acumen by the Europeans, especially in the use of the galleasses, which forced the Turks to maneuver around them and sustain heavy losses from their large cannons. Almost all the fighting occurred hand to hand, and the commanders were personally involved, with Don John leading the assault that ended up killing his opposite number. The battle was incredibly decisive in the moment, preventing the further expansion of Islam into the Christian world; but luckily for the Turks, the lack of follow-up by the Christian powers allowed the moment to pass without loss of territory by the Ottomans. The Christians quickly reverted to form with bickering and argumentation that allowed the Turks to hold Cyprus, and their ships continued to rove the Med in force. Despite the setback of Lepanto, the Turks rebuilt their fleet, worked hard to retrain a sailing force, and continued to be a factor in the eastern Mediterranean, where they skirmished with the forces of Italy and Spain for much of the next two centuries; but they never again truly threatened to fully dominate the entire inner sea of the Med, which was at one point a realistic ambition for them. Their failure at Lepanto meant that the Ottoman Empire, as powerful as it would become and as long as it would last, would be bounded. They would not push by the deserts of Arabia to the south, by the Persians to the east, or by the Europeans at sea and in the Balkans to the west. Perhaps most important, as a result of the Battle of Lepanto, the mortal fear of the “invincible Turks” felt by many southern Europeans was shattered. In that sense, it was a critically important battle. When I was the NATO commander, I went often to Spain, a country I love for many reasons—from the beauty of the language and culture to the excellence of the cuisine to the deep sense of history on the Iberian Peninsula. It is a place that was once an uneasy part of the Islamic world, and the architecture, language, and culture of parts of southern Spain—think Seville—greatly reflect this. At one of the military summits we held there in Seville, my Spanish counterpart presented me with a beautifully decorated bottle of Spanish brandy in a hand-painted box. The motif on the box was a representation of the Battle of Lepanto, replete with a bloodred sea and the Spanish and Italian flags flying over the victorious Christian fleets. It is a sea battle that changed history across the Med, from the Aegean and the Adriatic all the way to the Strait of Gibraltar, by shutting the door to further Ottoman expansion into the central and western Med. • • • WITH CHRISTIAN DOMINANCE ASSURED, it was the turn of the British to begin to move in significant ways into the Mediterranean. They consolidated control over key islands and straits—Gibraltar at the Pillars of Hercules, Malta in the center of the Med, and Cyprus, so large and important to the east. And of course Egypt was a stepping-stone on the routes controlling India. British admirals began to be very familiar with the inland sea—especially Lord Nelson. Throughout the long summer of 1798, Nelson’s and Napoleon’s fleets played hide-and-go-seek across the broad expanse of the Med. When, finally, the French dropped anchor off the northeast coast of Alexandria in Aboukir Bay, Nelson closed in for the kill after several unproductive weeks at sea. His direction to his captains was simply to put their ships alongside the enemy. His aggressive and motivated captains destroyed Napoleon’s armada while it swung at anchor off the mouth of the Nile, and Nelson (a mere rear admiral at the time) was made a baron and became a hero across Europe. Essentially the entire Mediterranean fleet of France was destroyed or captured, and British naval morale peaked, preparing it well for the victories to come. It was the pivotal maritime battle of the Napoleonic Wars and firmly established once and for all British dominance of the Med throughout the nineteenth century. In the early 1980s, I sailed into the bay of Alexandria on the carrier Forrestal, not far at all from the site of the famous battle. We went ashore on small boats, rocking through the surf, mooring at a yacht club and enjoying easy hospitality. It was a far cry from the world war that raged in Alexandria in the early 1800s, and the Egyptians were happy to have our U.S. dollars pumping up their economy. For Nelson, Egypt was an important way station on the voyage to the destruction of Napoleon at Trafalgar; but the months he had spent crossing the Med to find Bonaparte were the pivot point of a brilliant career—time well spent indeed. For us on an American carrier at the height of the cold war, it was simply a break for ice cream and beer ashore. For all the wonderful Mediterranean nights he spent in the arms of Emma Hamilton, Nelson’s destiny lay outside the Pillars of Hercules, in the Atlantic, at the fateful battle of Trafalgar. The Mediterranean was the proving ground that led him to command and glory and death at the pinnacle of British sea power in the early nineteenth century. Through the nineteenth century, the Med lay more or less quiet. The height of geopolitical maneuvering shifted ashore to the continent of Europe itself, as successive waves of revolution pushed back against the compromises of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, which had ended the Napoleonic Wars. The “Iron Chancellor,” of Germany, Otto von Bismarck, managed to dominate European politics and ensure that other than the battle for Crimea and later the 1870 conflict between Germany and France there was little geopolitical activity happening that involved the Mediterranean. By the time the nineteenth century ended and the twentieth had begun, many major strategic theorists had begun to believe that war between the major powers was impossible given the cultural, familial, and economic ties between them. Sadly, they were wrong, and in 1914, war came again to the Mediterranean Sea as an important part of the First World War, what came to be known as “the Great War.” • • • THE FIRST WORLD WAR BEGAN not far from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on the periphery of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand—at the time heir to the empire’s Hapsburg throne—was assassinated by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian nationalist. This led to the triggering of the complex system of European alliances and ultimately to the global war that had at its heart the maritime rivalry between the German Empire and Great Britain. At sea, much of the war was carried out by auxiliaries, including submarines and distant commerce raiders. And of course much of the fighting between Great Britain (the “Grand Fleet”) and Germany (the “High Seas Fleet”) was north of Germany in the waters between the two nations, in the foggy, harsh conditions of the North Sea. But a portion of the war found its way to the Mediterranean as well, beginning in that peripheral body of water that has seen so much of war as well, the Black Sea. There two German cruisers joined decrepit Turkish warships and attacked Russia’s ports in the Crimean—actions that echo through to the present-day NATO-Russia conflict in the area, albeit with slightly different alliances. In early 1915, an audacious scheme was concocted by the young Winston Churchill and grudgingly accepted by the canny and seasoned first sea lord, Admiral Sir Jackie Fisher. They sought to break the deadlock on the trenches of the Franco-German front with an attack on Turkey at Gallipoli in the Dardanelles, at the edge of the Mediterranean in the Aegean Sea where it opens into the Sea of Marmara and then to the Black Sea. The idea was to ultimately take Constantinople, the capital of the increasingly unstable Turkish Ottoman Empire (the so-called Sick Man of Europe) and knock the Turks out of the war. It would also open the southern ports to Russia. The plan was initially under resourced, and the incremental approach ultimately led to massive losses, especially of British colonial troops, when the Turkish army unexpectedly stiffened and beat back the British attacks ashore on the highly strategic peninsula of Gallipoli. Of the half million Allied troops who began the campaign in February 1915, almost half were casualties by November. The reputations of both Churchill and Admiral Fisher were badly damaged, and the war ended up dragging on for another three years. I went to Gallipoli—or Çanakkale, as the Turks call it—on a hot summer’s day in 2010 as a guest of the Turkish chief of defense, army general İlker Başbuğ. We walked the battle lines where Aussies and Kiwis had fought desperate actions against troops under the command of a young Turkish general, Kemal Atatürk, who went on to drag Turkey into the modern world after the war. General Başbuğ showed me the monuments, which are extraordinary and generous in their respect for the fallen Allied troops. One of them has a famous quote from Atatürk, which is addressed to the mothers of the fallen soldiers: “Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives . . . You are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore, rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies (Anzac troops) and the Mehmets (Turkish troops) to us where they lie side by side here in this country of ours. . . . You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears; your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace.” While there is some controversy about the authenticity of the quote, it is moving and I think has been taken to heart by the Turkish military as part of their culture and history. Later, we had a glass of good Turkish red wine and a light meal on the battlefield overlooking the strait. I looked out to sea where the ships of the Allied fleet had launched their inconclusive bombardments and tried to supply the troops ashore, and realized that the troops would have looked longingly as well at the ships, wishing they too could have been saved by simply sailing away. There are times when it is good indeed to be a sailor. General Başbuğ and I took note of the difference between the fate of a soldier on the ground and that of a sailor at sea. In a strange footnote, General Başbuğ—a superb soldier, deeply loyal to his nation—was later falsely charged with undermining civilian control of the military and imprisoned. Fortunately, he was later released and cleared of those trumped-up charges, and today enjoys his retirement. He was a soldier who understood and appreciated sea power, but knew that the men ashore in this battle were the arbiters of the outcome. Our friendship continues to this day. • • • THE RESULTS OF the First World War were inconclusive. An angry and bitter Germany fell victim to fascism, hyperinflation, and a sense of victimization, and its anger gave rise to Hitler, who dragged his nation into the disaster of World War II. Unlike the First World War—where the pivotal fight ended up being largely ashore in massive trenches on what was essentially the Franco-German border—the Second World War achieved a level of combat in the Mediterranean littoral that rivaled that of the Punic Wars. It is no exaggeration to say that the Med was a heartland battle domain throughout the early years of the Second World War, including the early destruction of French and Italian ships by the British fleet after the fall of France and Italy’s declaration of war. The most important parts of the Med campaigns were in North Africa, where the Allies chose to make their initial attacks against German forces, led by General Erwin Rommel, that were threatening Egypt while seeking to cut Britain off from India, an important source of revenue and resources. The American-Anglo force landed on the North African shore in 1942 in Operation Torch near Casablanca, and—after initial setbacks—was able to then invade Sicily (Operation Husky) and make its way to Italy (Operation Avalanche). These actions ultimately knocked Italy out of the war and badly distracted Hitler. They were also the making of General Dwight Eisenhower, who emerged from these Med campaigns as the Supreme Allied Commander who would brilliantly lead Operation Overlord and the invasion of northern France a year later. At sea, as the war began, the Germans and the British launched a series of battles to gain control of the vital shipping routes that would determine victory in the land battles. The fight for Greece went against the Allies, but they were able to ultimately win on the North African coast. Submarine warfare by the Germans was quite effective in these early days, and the situation in North Africa was of deep concern to the British high command. The Med was again an arena of total war at sea. It was also a period that highlighted the strategic importance of Malta, sitting as it does athwart the key sea lanes of communication in the center of the Med. Operation Torch, the British army campaign under General Bernard Montgomery, was able to destroy the North African forces of the Germans, inflicting heavy losses. Rommel barely escaped back to Germany. All of this was enabled by British sea power operating in the central Med and supplying their forces ashore. Much as during the Punic Wars, the Mediterranean Sea functioned both as battleground—as ships and aircraft sought to destroy one another at sea—and more important as the passage across which moved all the means of war. In all of my voyages through the Med, I was constantly reminded of those long patrols in the Second World War. In C. S. Forester’s brilliant novel The Ship, he tells the story of war at sea in that arena perfectly, when British ships sailed out of the base at Gibraltar headed to Malta and Alexandria, always seeking to keep open the vital supply lines. As a destroyer captain in the mid-1990s, I sailed those waters often and always felt the hint of danger and the tingling sense of cruising through the scene of those long-ago battles. • • • THROUGHOUT THE COLD WAR, the U.S. Navy kept two carrier battle groups on patrol in the Med. The idea was to challenge the Russian ability to conduct flanking maneuvers to get behind NATO lines that were dug in along the Fulda Gap in Central Europe. There were constant games of cat and mouse throughout the Med, and Navy ships (especially the massive aircraft carriers) were constantly shadowed by Russian intelligence-gathering vessels. Occasionally, the Navy would send destroyers to shoulder off the Russian AGIs, as they were called (Auxiliary General Intelligence). The Med served as a sort of venue for training, engagement, and intelligence gathering throughout the cold war. Given its relatively shallow depth (shallow in comparison to the far reaches of the North Atlantic and the even deeper Pacific), the Med was never going to be a venue for a huge fleet action in the age of nuclear submarines, which need to plumb the deep sea for concealment and preparation for attack. In terms of U.S. versus Russian engagement, the Med was not the battlefield it had been for the previous two thousand years, but there was a series of relatively low-intensity conflict incidents alongside the maneuvers of the Soviet and U.S. fleets. Notable among them in 1985 was the first significant terrorist incident at sea launched against a civilian vessel—a Palestine Liberation Front attack on an Italian cruise liner, the Achille Lauro, in which an elderly Jewish-American citizen who was confined to a wheelchair, Leon Klinghoffer, was executed and thrown into the sea. The perpetrators were captured by the United States and turned over to the Italians for prosecution. Later in the decade there were significant U.S. Freedom of Navigation operations against Libya (resulting in the shoot-down of Libyan fighters whose pilots were trained by the Soviet Union), as well as the strikes against Libya after a terrorist bombing of a German disco killing U.S. servicemen in 1986. Additionally, following the bombing of a Pan American commercial airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, more intense naval operations were undertaken in the Gulf of Sidra. The pendulum of conflict in the Med was swinging from the big-fleet cold war posturing to more complex operations reflecting the fading importance of the cold war ethos. Throughout this period, I made several deployments to the Med, and on each of them I felt a sense of connection with the many, many sea battles that had gone before. But we never fired a shot in anger, despite many close encounters and provocations. And finally, the dark era of the cold war ended, with all of us thinking we were headed into a brave new world of peace and prosperity with the “end of history” within our grasp. It certainly didn’t turn out that way. • • • AFTER THE INITIAL EXUBERANCE at the “victory” of the cold war, reality set in as it became clear that knocking off the Soviet domination of various parts of the world would release destabilizing forces. Perhaps the signature conflict in that regard involving the Med in the immediate post–cold war period was in the decade of the 1990s, when the Balkans simply exploded as Yugoslavia broke apart. Long-simmering religious and ethnic tensions between Bosnian Muslims, Catholic Croatians, and Orthodox Serbs created a vicious war centered in Bosnia in the center of the Balkans. Hundreds of thousands were killed and millions pushed across borders. More than eight thousand Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Serbians in July 1995 near the town of Srebrenica. This was followed by a second conflict when the largely Muslim province of Kosovo broke away from Serbia in 1998. The international community, after much vacillation, finally intervened both in the air and from the sea. The maritime operations included strikes, an arms embargo, and eventually a significant ground force requiring logistic support from sea. The forces ashore totaled more than 100,000 allied troops between the Bosnia and Kosovo campaigns. When I was a destroyer captain, my ship, USS Barry, had a key role in the mid-1990s as part of the arms embargo preventing weapons from reaching the Serbian aggressors. I remember reading Robert Kaplan’s brilliant meditation on the region, Balkan Ghosts, and thinking that the problems were simply intractable, the well of pain too deep. And yet, over time, the international community has fashioned a kind of rough peace in the Balkans, and the ships at sea played an important part in it. We had long weeks on station chasing down smugglers and pushing them off the coast under the command of an excitable British commodore. I was glad to put the dark shoreline in my wake and head home. After the Balkan wars of the mid- 1990s, things settled down in the Med, but anyone who follows the region knows it was a quiet that would not last—and it has not. • • • TODAY’S MEDITERRANEAN IS AGAIN a sea of conflict. With Russia’s resurgence, we are seeing aggressive patterns of maritime behavior dotting the Med, especially in the Black Sea and the eastern Mediterranean. While the Russian fleet is not the equal of the vast Soviet naval armada, it is quite capable of challenging U.S. interests. In addition, the Islamic State is rolling around the shores of the Mediterranean and will soon be challenging Europe and the West via the sea lanes across the central Med. Additionally, Israel remains at odds with most of its neighbors, and around Cyprus lie rich fields of natural gas and oil on the bottom of the seabed—with attendant territorial disputes among all the nations of the eastern Med. NATO allies Greece and Turkey still squabble over the Aegean and the islands that make up its beautiful archipelago, and the Black Sea—a subordinate vassal of the Med—has disputes between Russia, Georgia, and Ukraine. Looking first to Russia, it is clear that Vladimir Putin sees his country as a Mediterranean power and the dominant force in the Black Sea. The annexation of Crimea and the domination of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Ukraine in the southeast of the country give the Russian Federation a strong foothold on the necessary strategic real estate. Having had a long-standing treaty with Ukraine to keep capital ships in the port of Sevastopol, it has been easy for the Russians to simply build out the infrastructure there. In 2013, as the NATO Supreme Allied Commander, I went to the Russian and Ukrainian naval base in Crimea and had lunch on a Ukrainian destroyer with their chief of naval operations. I was there to thank the Ukrainians for their participation in the NATO counterpiracy mission, to which they had sent a ship. After a long, long lunch featuring literally countless toasts with Ukrainian (not Russian) vodka, too much smoked fish, and a half dozen courses based on pork, the navy chief and I went up on deck. He pointed to the Russian ships that were tied up just down the piers as part of the Russian agreement to keep their ships in homeport in Crimea. I mentioned how it must be somewhat frustrating to have Russian ships in a Ukrainian dockyard now that the countries were not as close as they once were, and that these certainly were not Soviet times. The Ukrainian CNO was smoking a cigarette, and after a long puff, he told me that “Russia will never give up Crimea. Never.” When Russia invaded and annexed Crimea a couple of years later, I was reminded of his words. The need to dominate the Black Sea is primal for Russia, and Crimea is the fulcrum that allows it to do so. As the Ukrainian admiral told me, the Russians will never give it back. It is interesting to put the Black Sea into the historical context of the Mediterranean. It began as a kind of region of exploration, dating to the ancient Greeks—legend has it that the Argonauts sailed to what is today Georgia to find the Golden Fleece. For centuries, it was disputed between Russia and Turkey, a relationship that has had many twists and turns over the centuries. It was essentially an Ottoman lake at the height of Turkish power, then fell under domination by Russia. During the cold war, it was essentially a Soviet lake, with only Turkey as a NATO ally guarding the entrances and controlling the southern coast. But with the end of the cold war, the Black Sea has exploded into a sort of Wild West, with new NATO allies Romania and Bulgaria joining Turkey; Ukraine is in a deeply troubled relationship with neighbor Russia, including the annexation of Crimea; and Georgia, a close NATO partner and friend, has two significant provinces occupied by pro-Russian separatists and Russian forces. In addition, today smugglers and violent extremists routinely use the Black Sea as a preferred route into Europe. Russia will continue to regard it as a vital interest, and the potential for exploiting hydrocarbons will also be a key focus for Russia. Putin has also expanded Russia’s relationship with the Assad regime in Syria. Russia has had naval access and bases along the Syrian Mediterranean coast throughout the cold war and on into the present day, representing at one point the final geostrategic connection between Moscow and the Arab world. Now that Putin has effectively doubled down on Assad—despite the Syrian leader’s vicious and illegal actions against his people during the ongoing civil war—it is clear that Russia intends to maintain its ability to operate in the eastern Med into the future. This collides with the views of the United States and other NATO allies, which are seeking the overthrow of Assad based on his use of chemical weapons, torture, and barrel bombs in the civil war. The eastern Med, as so often in the past, has become an arena of great-power politics. In today’s world, it is eerily reminiscent of the Balkans from a hundred years ago, when the powder keg of Bosnia blew apart the Austro-Hungarian Empire and dragged much of the civilized world into a war that essentially lasted until mid-century. Even more concerning is the rise of the Islamic State. A group of religious fanatics, they are attempting to rebuild the Islamic caliphate across the Levant and North Africa. Capitalizing on the chaos and destruction in Syria and Iraq, they have dug into the seam between those countries. While they do not as yet control any coastal regions, their presence is increasingly felt in Libya, which has a long, exposed coast that is less than a hundred miles from Mediterranean islands and represents a path to Italy and Europe beyond. They have also contributed substantially to the departure of more than a million refugees headed to Europe (as well as several million more distributed throughout southern Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon). All of this washes up from the shores of the Med, as many of the migrants are coming by sea to Greece, Italy, Croatia, and other coastal regions of the European Mediterranean. At the moment, there is an agreement between Turkey and the European Union to try to stem the flow of refugees and keep them in Turkey. But the fragile accord will probably unwind over time, and the imperative for physical safety and economic opportunity will continue to keep the flow of refugees coming to Europe from across the Med. • • • OF PARTICULAR CONCERN from a seagoing perspective is the threat from Libya. In 1942, Winston Churchill said that Italy represented the “soft underbelly of Europe,” and directed the Allied invasion efforts there. Today, we are seeing the nascent flickers of an Islamic State strategy that may try to achieve a similar effect. Following the brutal decapitation of twenty-one Egyptian Coptic Christians by radical Islamists professing an allegiance to ISIS in mid-2015, the Italian government began to ramp up its efforts to defend its territory from attacks. How realistic is this threat, and how capable is the Islamic state of reaching across the Mediterranean and striking Italy? And what should Italy do? First, we should listen to what the Islamic State has to say on the subject: From the cover of its Dabiq magazine is a story titled “Reflections on the Final Crusade.” The general idea is that ISIS will conquer Rome, and the images include a photo of a black jihadist flag flying over St. Peter’s Square. The article said: “We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah, the Exalted. If we do not reach that time, then our children and grandchildren will reach it, and they will sell your sons as slaves at the slave market. Every Muslim should get out of his house, find a crusader and kill him. . . . And the Islamic State will remain until its banner flies over Rome.” Hyperbolic? Of course. Literally possible? Not in the least. But worth considering the sentiment as Europe thinks about the increasing possibility of attacks in its homeland coming across the Mediterranean? You bet. As Graeme Wood points out in his intellectually smart and historically grounded piece in The Atlantic, “What ISIS Really Wants,” there is a certain underlying medieval impetus to the Islamic State’s rhetoric and its actions. Beheadings of innocents, burnings of captured prisoners, rumors of crucifixions, enslavement and sale of comely women and children, the literal sacking of cities —all of these connote a strong desire to play on the international stage as though the Crusades were still in progress. Thus we come to the importance of Rome, perhaps the most potent symbol of all the Islamic State hates. In terms of capability, ISIS is not going to launch a conventional attack or strike. But it has two potential routes into Italy by sea. One is by infiltrating the many boatloads of illegal migrants that sail across the short distances from Libya to the southern coast and islands of Italy. The other is by using small craft, much as smugglers and drug runners do to cross the Adriatic Sea, to cross the southern Mediterranean. Both are feasible and easier than working across Turkey and the Balkans and trying to pass illegally into a European Union nation by land. If ISIS wants to inflame a religious war, what better place in Europe to attack than Rome? A significant strike at a Christian holy site would fall directly into both ISIS’s self-stated strategy and its building narrative. Our Italian allies are well aware of this and are responding by taking all the right initial steps, starting with putting portions of both their military and the capable carabinieri paramilitary forces on higher alert; adding more nautical patrols between Libya and their southern islands; sharing intelligence widely throughout both NATO and EU/Interpol channels; and publicizing their measures to appear a more hardened target. All good steps. What else can and should be done to protect the soft underbelly of Europe across the Med? First, get NATO into the maritime game in the Mediterranean. Italy should convene an Article 4 discussion at the North Atlantic Council in Brussels within the NATO headquarters. Article 4 of the NATO treaty permits any nation to bring before the council matters pertaining to its individual security concerns. Such discussions are typically used to raise issues considered particularly concerning, and occasionally lead to common action—a decision taken by consensus of all twenty-eight members—under Article 5 (the famous “an attack on one shall be regarded as an attack on all” clause of the treaty). Italy should specifically ask that a NATO task force be established for surveillance and patrol across the Med. When Turkey felt threatened by Syrian air activity several years ago, NATO responded by sending Patriot batteries to southern Turkey to defend Turkish sovereign airspace. Those batteries remain in place today. In the case of Italian concerns about Islamic State infiltration, the use of standing NATO maritime task forces would be a very real possibility to support the overloaded Italian coast guard and navy. Second, amp up the maritime intelligence collection processes across the Med. The Italians need access to the highest levels of intelligence being collected today in Libya. This means not only working through NATO channels, but also approaching the Arab nations in the anti–Islamic State coalition (Egypt, the UAE, and possibly Tunisia) for assistance. There is no substitute for on-the- ground assets, and these are thin for the Italians despite their close commercial ties to Libya—so Italy should work it through not only high-tech USA/NATO/NSA sources, but also the Arab networks. Much of this can be sea based, with intelligence collection assets operating from coastal shipping. Third, focus on the maritime dimension, using NATO navies in the Med. This means sortieing the Italian fleet and coast guard to patrol and map the patterns of movement across the 100-to-200–nautical mile stretch of the central Mediterranean; using long-range patrol aircraft from Sicilian bases; cooperating fully with neighboring Malta, which sits astride the sea lane; and employing high-endurance unmanned drones to maintain a high-quality, real-time sense of maritime domain awareness. Fourth and most important, develop a strategy for addressing the problem at its source: in Libya. Given the chaos and increasing anarchy in Libya, it is tempting to simply write it off and hope that the revolution ultimately burns itself out. Indeed, many observers express a certain longing for the “good old days” of stability under Muammar Gaddafi. But eventually, Libya will succeed —it has big oil reserves (especially on a per capita basis), an educated population, and enviable geography close to Europe with a huge seacoast. Europe—our closest ally in the world—needs a stable Mediterranean. This will mean engaging more directly in the coastal regions of the Levant to diminish the threat from the Islamic State and the flow of illegal migrants and refugees. It will also mean a maritime strategy to help move Libya toward a more stable situation. This means exploring a UN or EU peacekeeping mission, supporting the relatively moderate internationally recognized government centered in Tobruk, and cooperating closely with Egyptian efforts to take on the Islamic State in military terms with targeting, intelligence, destroying their financial base by cutting off access to Arab banks and, potentially, air strikes. Here in the United States, we should support Italy in helping lead a European approach to stabilizing Libya. Just as Churchill looked at Italy as a relatively easy gateway to Europe, the Islamic State has geographic, political, and symbolic interests in sailing across the Med to Italy and across the Aegean to Greece. It will seek to accelerate its reach across the eastern and central Med. And Russian adventurism will continue in and around the eastern Med and the Black Sea. It is clear the Med will continue to be a fickle and changing geopolitical body of water, and one where more security operations at sea loom ahead on the horizon. That sense of being closed in an inland sea will continue for sailors in the Med. I think back on the first time I sailed in a warship through the Strait of Gibraltar, a young and inexperienced Navy lieutenant. Much of my later career would be spent sailing through the Mediterranean, although I did not know it at the time. I would sail into Cannes for the Fourth of July, hosting an Independence Day celebration for the glamorous citizens of that lovely city, and head from there to shore up an arms embargo in the Balkans, where massacres and bombings were the order of the day. In port calls to Egypt and Athens and Istanbul I would see the most ancient capitals and what their modern civilizations had become. I dropped into the Iberian ports of the Costa del Sol and saw the mélange of Arab and Spanish culture in the south of Spain. Over time, I would sail by and visit every country in the Med, marveling at the diversity and history, the culture and the beauty. But the overriding impression that stays with me to this day is of the battles fought, the lives lost, the collision of empires, and the throaty shout of war. • • • ULTIMATELY, THE STORY of the Mediterranean geopolitically turns on the rise of technology in response to the wars of the times; the distinctive geography that allows for miniature arenas of combat while still allowing overall passage throughout the inland sea; and the collision of civilizations fighting over trade, slaves, wealth, and land. Each of those has a part to play in the story of the Mediterranean, but in the end it is the maritime character of the sea itself that has driven so many of these battles. We sometimes think of the Med as a cradle of civilizations, where nations were born and took to the center of the stage in all their terrible power and ultimate glory—and it certainly was all that—but it was also an unforgiving arena of war at sea, which shaped the course of history down through the centuries as well. As we look to the future, the security challenges represented by the Mediterranean Sea will continue to be part of the landscape of human history. Sailors on modern warships will continue to ply their trade alongside the tankers, container ships, and gleaming cruise liners. Old ghosts of distant battles rattle still around the Med, and any Navy sailor, walking the decks of his warship at sunset of a winter evening, can feel their haunting presence in the sweep of the deep, uncaring waves. 5. THE SOUTH CHINA SEA A LIKELY ZONE OF CONFLICT John Cary’s chart gives little indication as to how crucial this region, only known as the East India Isles in 1801, is to our modern world.

Ward Mee At the heart of the teeming South China Sea is Hong Kong, perhaps the finest natural harbor in the world. The first time I pulled into it was in 1977, as an ensign assigned as the antisubmarine warfare officer on a brand-new Spruance- class destroyer named USS Hewitt (DD-966). The captain, Fritz Gaylord, foolishly let me drive the ship as the junior officer of the deck for the sea and anchor detail. It was a complex mooring to a buoy, a huge floating concrete hulk anchored to the bottom of the harbor. The idea was to nuzzle the pointed nose of the 9,000-ton warship up to the buoy, hold it steady with the engines and rudder, and allow enough time for a handful of stalwart boatswain mates to jump from a small boat and affix our ship’s anchor chain to a kind of connection link on the buoy. This was a situation that required great ship handling skills which I did not possess, at least not at that early moment in my career. I was dazzled by Hong Kong itself, a spectacular harbor dividing two beautiful landmasses, with thousands of lights glittering on the steep side of Victoria’s Peak in the early evening and the bustle of what was then a British crown colony in full bloom. Between my inexperience and distraction, I did a truly lousy job, banging the sensitive underbelly of the ship (where the expensive and somewhat delicate sonar dome resides) against the buoy. Fortunately, the captain was a great ship handler, and he took us back off the buoy and coached me through a better landing, despite the brisk wind and steady current. When it was over, he lit an unfiltered Lucky Strike cigarette (smoking was allowed in those days on Navy ships), smiled somewhat thinly at me, and said, “I hope you’re better at finding submarines. Welcome to Hong Kong.” It was the beginning of a long and warm association for me with the South China Sea, and the myriad cities, nations, and cultures that surround it. • • • THE SOUTH CHINA SEA is big—the size of the greater Caribbean—and surrounded by huge economies: China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and others. Through the South China Sea in any given year pass about half of the world’s maritime trade, half of its liquefied natural gas, and perhaps a third of its seaborne crude oil. There is evidence of human habitation stretching back thousands of years. Many theories exist as to the origins of the flow of people, goods, and languages across its waters: whatever the truth, we know that an early maritime network quickly became well developed and expansive. It is a sea rich in fish and having plenty of rain, with the access to fresh water facilitating long early journeys of perhaps weeks at a time. There is even scattered evidence of trade between the ancient Mediterranean civilizations and the people of the South China Sea Rim. More recently, in the first centuries A.D., the trade between India and Southeast Asia enriched the people of the South China Sea. As in the Indian Ocean, the discovery of how to harness the power of the monsoons provided a significant impetus to early trading. Settlements in southern China and the Mekong Delta of the Funan Empire were among the first trading stations in the region. Over time in the first millennium A.D., the rivalry between what are today China and Vietnam first manifested itself as the cultures came into conflict. Also during this period, the South China Sea emerged as the seam between the two great civilizations in India and China, both of which would be impacted deeply by European exploration starting about 1500. Additionally, a trade between China and the Arab world emerged toward the end of the first millennium A.D. Globalization, which we think of as a modern phenomenon, has been alive and well for a very long time. Across the centuries, various Chinese dynasties dominated the western side of the South China Sea, notably the Tang and Song dynasties, which controlled much of the littoral a thousand years ago. They pressed trade and controlled the ability of individual cities and regions to participate in the lucrative routes. By the time the Ming dynasty ascended in 1368, the DNA of trading, commerce, and seafaring exchanges was embedded in the South China Sea. Even as the Ming leaders looked inward to the land, the sea continued to be a vital part of the region’s economy. Illustrating this well are the voyages of the so-called Eunuch Admirals (a term that provides me with a certain amount of personal discomfort to contemplate, I must admit). These were big expeditions, one hundred to two hundred ships, with thousands of sailors and troops. There is a fair amount of controversy about their purpose, but most historians seem to think they were to intimidate, discipline, enforce commercial codes and taxes, and create a sense of awe toward the dominant Chinese. Of note, these voyages were an anomaly; they were discontinued after several decades, and the ships were left to rot. China focused internally for the next five hundred years. One interesting commodity that flowed across the wide South China Sea was silver. With Manila as a trading crossroads giving the Spanish Empire in the Americas a toehold in Asia in the Philippines, the Spanish were able to provide much-needed metal currency to the Chinese. While silver also came south from Japan, it was the Portuguese and the Spanish who were largely able to fill China’s need for hard currency. This led to the Chinese southern and eastern coasts being integrated into the global economy through access to the South China Sea. What emerged in this period was a trading competition, often verging into open conflict among primarily the English, the Dutch, and the Portuguese. Despite arguments by the Portuguese that they deserved full authority due to their discovery of the sea routes, international law of this period provided the latitude for the intrusion of other trading partners, most particularly the Dutch and British. In the early 1600s, the tiny Dutch state possessed thousands of ships with tens of thousands of well-trained and motivated sailors, and largely dominated global trade with an axis between European Amsterdam and Batavia (Jakarta in present-day Indonesia). But by the late 1700s the British in the form of the East India Company were coming into their own. This led to the acquisition of Singapore in 1819 and Hong Kong in 1842. The Opium Wars of 1839–42 and 1856–60 were a result of a weak Chinese state colliding with the growing colonial powers. Meanwhile, both the French in Indochina and the Germans on the south Chinese coast were establishing colonial footholds. By the late 1800s, even the United States, traditionally averse to colonial holdings, was seduced into the view of naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan that colonies (really “coaling stations” or geostrategic forward bases) provided the foundation of sea power and thus world influence. Mahan’s seminal 1890 work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, was taken up enthusiastically by the young American president Theodore Roosevelt at the turn of the century, and the resultant echoes in the South China Sea were profound. And of course increasing in influence and capability, moving along like a shark under the smooth surface of the water, was Japan. The eventual collision of the Second World War was inevitable and enormous, but it began with a relatively mild series of disagreements in the South China Sea. The key event for the United States in the region was the Spanish-American War, which was precipitated by the sinking of the cruiser USS Maine in Havana harbor, in the Spanish colony of Cuba. On a winter day in early 1898, the ship suddenly exploded while swinging peacefully at anchor. Led by William Randolph Hearst’s newspaper chain, Spain was blamed for the sinking, the cry of “Remember the Maine” swept the country, and the United States declared war on the disintegrating Spanish Empire, leading to the annexation of Cuba as a U.S. territory after the war. As an aside, I have long kept a painting of the USS Maine just before the explosion in my various offices—one hangs today in my Massachusetts office on the quiet New England academic quad of Tufts University, where I am the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. People often ask me why I keep a painting of a doomed ship on the wall. Why not a valiant and heroic U.S. Navy ship, perhaps the carrier Enterprise or the destroyer Barry, both of which passed under my command? The answer is twofold—first, and most important, the painting reminds me that your ship can blow up underneath you at any moment, so you better have a Plan B and, metaphorically speaking, know where the life rafts are located. The second reason is perhaps a bit obscure, but important to me. After the Maine was sunk, the Navy salvaged the ship nearly fifty years later, and virtually all of the evidence points to the conclusion that she was not sunk by Spanish saboteurs after all. It appears the explosion was internal, most probably from a boiler or an ammunition storage area. The charge to war was predicated, it would seem, on false evidence. So the second reason I keep a painting of the Maine around is to remind me not to jump to conclusions in the heat of the moment. Stop, consider, and above all, question the fact pattern being presented to you—a pretty good reminder. The reverberations from the explosion of the Maine, and the U.S. charge into war, were felt thousands of miles away in the South China Sea. In Manila harbor, the aging Spanish fleet was bottled up and attacked by the superior U.S. fleet under Admiral George Dewey. He pushed his ships into the harbor in a surprise move and caught the Spanish fleet at their moorings. This was on the cusp between the age of sail and the age of steam, and Dewey took full advantage of the maneuverability conferred by his steam engines, passing up and down the Spanish line and hitting them with effective fire that destroyed the Spanish ability to fight. It marked the end of effective Spanish colonization in the Philippines, ending centuries of domination; it also marked the beginning of the engagement of the United States as a colonizing power, something that did not turn out well. During this period at the tail end of the nineteenth century, the Japanese also were moving south into the South China Sea region. Although they were initially focused on Korea, they also took Taiwan from the ineffectual Qing dynasty in China. This was followed by the Boxer Rebellion, an indigenous uprising that roiled China and affected the colonizing European powers, ultimately causing thousands of deaths. The weakness of the Qing dynasty was an aberration in the long history of Chinese domination of the South China Sea—as Deng Xiaoping was said to have told Henry Kissinger in so many words, China is a great civilization that has had a couple of bad centuries. That weakness, so apparent in the twentieth century in particular, is outside the norm, and current events in the South China Sea show that the pendulum is swinging back strongly toward a policy of strong Chinese activity throughout the region. By the 1930s, the outlines of conflict were clear. A rising Japanese power needed natural resources and tried to negotiate agreements with a distracted and poorly led United States just emerging from its own internal economic catastrophe. With Japan rising and increasingly dominating the littoral of the South China Sea—from taking chunks of China itself to Taiwan to moving south into Vietnam—the United States was relatively impotent. The South China Sea, for the first time in a thousand years, was turned into essentially the territorial sea of a single power: Japan. It took four years of war to release it again. • • • FROM THE VERY START of the U.S. entry into World War II, the South China Sea became a key objective of our strategy. Why? Because it was the highway over which Japanese logistic support was flowing to their forward forces, which were rapidly overrunning large swaths of the western Pacific Ocean and the East Asian mainland. As discussed earlier in the chapter on the Pacific, the first blows of the Japanese that landed effectively against U.S. forces after the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941 were struck against the U.S. garrison in the Philippines on the cusp of the South China Sea. On the island of Luzon, the U.S. commander, General Douglas MacArthur, was forced to abandon his headquarters in Manila and head to the Bataan Peninsula, which could be more easily defended. MacArthur also held the nearby Corregidor Island. The South China Sea was clearly going to be a central objective of both sides, controlling as it does the sea lanes of communication that run athwart East Asia and the routes to the oil and rubber of the south. So the garrison at Corregidor grimly settled in for a siege, with little hope of anything beyond a delaying action and the faint hope of relief in place. But by early March 1942, it was clear that the position was indefensible and would fall, and President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur to escape; the thought of the most senior general in the U.S. Army falling into the hands of the Japanese, especially after the Japanese success in attacking Pearl Harbor, was inconceivable. Nonetheless, MacArthur tried to stall: after all, he had been a general officer since 1918 and had held four-star command throughout the 1930s. He was a proud and indomitable spirit. But eventually he realized that discretion would be the better course than valor at that point. His departure proclamation is often quoted today: “The President of the United States ordered me to break through the Japanese lines and proceed from Corregidor to Australia for the purpose, as I understand it, of organizing the offensive against Japan, a primary object of which is the relief of the Philippines. I came through and I shall return.” As a young officer in the 1980s, I met the famous retired vice admiral John D. Bulkeley, who as a young lieutenant was given the mission of getting General MacArthur out of the Philippines. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his command of the torpedo boat squadron throughout the Corregidor campaign and for the safe passage of General MacArthur. By the time I met him, he was an intimidating figure, a crusty seadog who had been recalled to active duty to lead the Navy’s Board of Inspection and Survey. His charge was to make sure that our ships were combat ready, and he was a good choice for the job. At the time, I was a young and untested department head on a “fancy new cruiser,” as he styled it, the AEGIS-equipped Valley Forge. Bulkeley came down to the waterfront to pick apart our damage control capability, and to stand in front of him explaining why we had failed to correctly align the firefighting water system on the ship was embarrassing to say the least. As he quite artfully chewed me out, I kept looking at the single ribbon on his uniform, the Medal of Honor, knowing that he also held the Navy Cross and a slew of other combat awards. I remember thinking that he represented a direct line from the World War II Navy, and his combat runs across the South China Sea dodging Japanese gunfire remain legendary. Would I ever be able to muster the same level of courage and honor and commitment, I wondered? At virtually the same time MacArthur fled Corregidor, the unchallenged Japanese fleet was moving to dominate the entire South China Sea, headed down the coast of Borneo and building forward operating stations for air and ground troops on the littoral of the sea. The only force between them and domination of the South China Sea was the ABDA fleet of light cruisers and destroyers, which stood for American (our small Asiatic fleet), British, Dutch, and Australian. This handful of ships was truly the “Fleet the Gods Forgot,” and it was under the command of a Dutch two-star admiral, Karel Doorman. It was destroyed in February 1942, leading to the surrender of Java and the fall of the entire Dutch East Indies. This provided the Japanese with oil (from the oil wells in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra) as well as rubber, quinine, tin, and other strategic necessities. The South China Sea provided a wealth of riches to Japan’s so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. But inexorably, the Allied net began to close. From this point forward, the action shifted to the broader reaches of the Pacific outside the South China Sea. The Japanese, bounded by their limited population base, had taken on an unsustainable task, and the blow at Pearl Harbor made any agreement with the United States impossible. The dual thrust of the U.S. and Allied forces began to hammer back, and by the end of 1943, U.S. forces were headed toward the Philippines again. The bloody battles of 1943 and the island-hopping campaign enabled MacArthur to position his forces by March 1944 to head toward the Philippines and the South China Sea. The most important sea battle—while not fully decisive—was in the Philippine Sea in mid-June 1944. Here Admiral Marc Mitscher was able to take the pressure off MacArthur, who then carried the fight back into the heart of the South China Sea. In October 1944, early in the afternoon, MacArthur climbed down from the cruiser Nashville into a landing craft and went ashore onto the Philippine island of Leyte, taking long strides through the knee-deep water after the coxswain dropped the ramp. As promised, he had returned, and the South China Sea became an American lake later that month, after the decisive sea battle of Leyte Gulf, which shattered the heart of the Japanese fleet. The full liberation of the Philippine Islands followed in short order, and not long afterward—deprived of the resources flowing across the South China Sea and faced with a nuclear armed America—the Japanese surrendered. In the course of my career, I spent a great deal of time in and around the Philippines, which in many ways are the seam between the broader Pacific and Asia proper. They endured centuries of Spanish colonization, experienced the half-hearted attempt of the United States to be a colonial power in the first part of the twentieth century, and finally, as independence appeared assured, fell into the center of a brutal world war. Their nation is also like the Caribbean in that it so often resembles a bull’s-eye for the various tsunamis that reoccur again and again in that part of the world. Yet despite so much bad luck and poor governance, the people of the Philippines have a lightness of soul that shines through, a kind of good-humored ability to deal with adversity, and a deep spirituality. I first encountered the Philippines in the mid-1970s as a young ensign on a destroyer headed into the beautiful natural harbor of Subic Bay, where the U.S. Navy had historically had a large sea and air base. It was a bustling tropical setting, with beautiful beaches, cold San Miguel beer, and very friendly hostesses working across the “shit river” that led to the town and the countless bars, strip clubs, and houses of ill repute. In fact, as a division officer, I had my hands full trying (and frequently failing) to keep my sailors from falling in love with and marrying the beautiful young local women. We had a “cooling off” period that a commanding officer could impose to prevent premature nuptials, but persistence often found young sailors falling into true love. Many of those marriages, by the way, turned out very well when the young brides made their way back to our home port of San Diego, where they more often than not turned out to be thrifty, sensible Navy spouses. Over the course of my career, I have met many a “deployment bride” from the Philippine Islands, and I would say they fared pretty well. The strategic value of the Philippine Islands is obvious from a glance at a map, and the U.S. bases there—both the huge naval and air complex at Subic Bay and the even larger air base at Clark Airfield near Manila—were mainstays of U.S. naval and geopolitical strategy in the region throughout the cold war. With “an anchor to windward” in the South China Sea, the United States was able to maintain a strong presence in these waters throughout this period. While there were numerous skirmishes between the United States and China, especially over the protection of Taiwan, the major set-piece battle of the cold war in the South China Sea was, of course, the war in Vietnam. At the outset of the cold war, with former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower in the White House, there was significant reluctance to get more deeply involved in the region, even given the dangerous and seductive idea of what would eventually be called the “domino theory.” This was the idea that if the United States did not prevent individual local regimes from becoming Communist states aligned with either Moscow or Beijing or both, they would fall together, like dominoes, and the United States would have to face a significant Communist bloc in the region. There are many problems with this theory, and President Eisenhower, who had seen so much of war, worked hard to avoid entangling the United States in any sort of land war in the region. While he acknowledged the theory, he managed to avoid a significant ground force engagement in Asia. Even when our World War II allies, the French, found themselves on the losing end of a vicious insurgency in French Indochina—today’s Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos—Eisenhower refused to either send troops or threaten the use of nuclear weapons. The French were defeated by the insurgent Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, and expelled from Vietnam after a huge loss at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The United States was deeply worried about this, and many here used the domino theory to begin arguing for more U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which of course came to fruition not on Eisenhower’s watch, but on that of his successor, John F. Kennedy. As the 1960s unfolded, the South China Sea became a principal maritime focus of the United States. While the cold war raged globally, requiring the efforts of the U.S. Navy from the Arctic to the Mediterranean to the Baltic to the deep Atlantic, there was considerable naval activity in the South China Sea. This was because of the increasing tempo of U.S. operations on behalf of South Vietnam as it fought against both the North Vietnamese Army (supported by China) and the insurgency of the Viet Minh and Viet Cong within South Vietnam itself. This required increasing the level of U.S. troops ashore throughout the early-to-mid-1960s under both presidents Kennedy and Johnson. At the peak, the United States supported more than half a million Army and Marine combat troops ashore, with the Navy fleet in constant support. Maritime activity included complex aircraft carrier strikes ashore against targets in both North and South Vietnam; coastal and riverine operations in direct support of the soldiers and Marines ashore; logistic supply to units ashore and operating at sea for prolonged periods of time; maritime surveillance and intelligence gathering; insertion of SEAL patrols and support of them from the sea; and bombardment with naval guns of targets in the coastal regions. The South China Sea became an American lake throughout much of this period, with hundreds of U.S. warships in operations throughout. The transit route between Vietnam and the Philippines was a well-trodden path for U.S. sailors indeed. Throughout the early 1960s, U.S. involvement increased year by year, tripling in 1961 and again in 1962. The relatively young American president, Jack Kennedy, sensed the slippery slope toward the “Americanization” of the war effort. As his date with destiny in Dallas approached, his enthusiasm for the war was diminishing rapidly. After his tragic assassination, Lyndon Johnson felt the need to demonstrate his tough approach toward communism. With a war record that was suspect to begin with, Johnson always seemed intimidated by his Joint Chiefs of Staff and his brilliant secretary of defense, Robert McNamara. Perhaps the clinching event that drove further U.S. involvement was the so- called Tonkin Gulf incident of 1964, in which a group of North Vietnamese torpedo boats supposedly attacked two U.S. ships off the coast of Vietnam at the northern end of the South China Sea. The USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy managed to fire hundreds of rounds of heavy artillery at what most observers have since concluded were “phantom targets” in two highly suspect “attacks.” These attacks were used by the Johnson administration to gain congressional approval for direct military action in Vietnam, and the rapid increase of U.S. forces in the country followed, as well as strikes against North Vietnam. Thousands of lives ended and many more were dramatically changed by the events that flowed from the Tonkin Gulf incident. In terms of maritime operations in the South China Sea, the U.S. Navy was the dominant force. Over the course of the war, nearly two million sailors served in theater. The missions were varied, but on the deep ocean, supply and logistics were critical—more than 95 percent of all the material and personnel that headed in and out of Vietnam sailed at sea on Navy and merchant marine vessels. Two Navy hospital ships were the first destination for many of the wounded. Additionally, the U.S. Navy spent a great deal of time training the South Vietnamese navy, which, by 1972 when the United States disengaged from active combat, numbered more than eight hundred ships and more than forty thousand men—believe it or not, the fifth-largest navy in the world in that year, albeit mostly composed of tiny riverine and coastal patrol craft. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy continued a strong effort from the South China Sea. In 1972, it was flying more than 3,800 sorties a month, and Navy destroyers and cruisers fired well over 100,000 long-range shells at shore targets. Mines were used from aircraft to seal off North Vietnamese ports. As the war ramped up, peaked, and gradually began to falter due to a lack of support in the United States, an aversion to mounting casualties, political disillusionment flowing from Watergate, and bad strategic choices by U.S. military leaders, it was clear that the United States would withdraw. Eventually nearly sixty thousand U.S. troops would die in this war, and perhaps five million Vietnamese. The U.S. Navy continued its operations in support of the South Vietnamese government while it still survived, but when Congress cut off funding in the mid-1970s, the game was over in Saigon. The U.S. embassy was overwhelmed, and the last, sad act of the U.S. Navy was to operate air and sea ferries to save as many U.S. supporters among the Vietnamese along with our embassy and remaining troops. Viet Thanh Nguyen’s recent novel The Sympathizer is a searing portrait of those final days and the evacuations out of Saigon and captures perfectly the zeitgeist of the moment of failure. Decades later, in the early part of the twenty-first century, I went to Vietnam for the first time. Not to Saigon (now of course renamed Ho Chi Minh City), but to the north, to Hanoi. I was part of the delegation of Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, who firmly believed that a coherent strategic relationship between the United States and Vietnam was strongly in our interest. We were treated like royalty, and I sensed the deep interest on the part of senior Vietnamese officials in a relationship with us. Why? Because of the economic, political, and military benefits that would allow Vietnam to maintain an independent posture vis-à-vis China. As our motorcade sortied through the streets of Hanoi, I saw a motorcycle go by with a box of small piglets on the back. In a wire box about the size of a small apartment’s refrigerator, they were hurtling precariously through the narrow streets and overtook us before zooming on as we pulled up to the famous prison where Senator (then Navy pilot) John McCain had been held and tortured. The United States and Vietnam had shared a dark chapter, but I hoped the future was brighter for the relationship between the nations than it was for those piglets. It appears that is the case, as the relationship between the United States and Vietnam continues to expand across political, economic, and security dimensions. So as the United States withdrew once and for all from Vietnam in the mid- 1970s, the U.S. focus in the South China Sea continued with our allies in the Philippines and Taiwan, as well as working to improve defense and economic relations farther to the south, with Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The story of the United States and Taiwan is particularly worth considering for its importance in the region. • • • IN THE 1950S, the other significant conflict affecting the South China Sea was on the sea itself—between mainland or Communist China, led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist Chinese in the Republic of China on the island of Taiwan. Sitting astride the northern entrance to the South China Sea, Taiwan has a long and challenging history of being conquered and colonized over the centuries. Also known as Formosa, the island has been subjected to invading forces numerous times (including Dutch, Spanish, and Chinese), and more recently was a Japanese colony from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of World War II. After the loss of the bloody civil war on mainland China, the republican Chinese, led by Chiang Kai-shek, retreated to Taiwan and for several decades maintained the fiction that they were the “true” government of China. They even held the UN Security Council seat throughout a portion of the post–World War II period until it was turned over to the Communist mainland regime in 1971. Throughout the cold war, the United States stood with Taiwan, and it continues to provide a great deal of political and military support today. But during the late 1970s, the United States noted a change in Chinese global policy that affected events in the South China Sea—the Chinese shifted their top national security threat from the United States to the Soviet Union. The Chinese began to help the United States diplomatically, and the tension across the Taiwan Strait was visibly reduced. As a result, sadly, the U.S. Navy—which for decades had been visiting Taiwan—stopped pulling into port there. The two great liberty ports, both cherished by sailors, were Keelung and Kaohsiung. Both were notorious for the beauty of the women, the strength of the liquor, and the inexpensive costs of the clubs ashore—all the things our fearless sailors were looking for on a trip ashore after a month or more at sea. I went out as shore patrol officer on one of the final liberty runs ashore in Keelung, a bustling commercial port at the top of Taiwan. It is a warm and tropical city, with a lot of rainfall, and we had our hands full rounding up sailors who had imbibed a bit too much and returning them to face justice aboard their ship. It was all like an extended scene out of the musical South Pacific, and I had a couple of burly petty officers to do the heavy lifting. But what I remember most vividly the next day was taking a tour of the port and learning about the role of the city during the Opium Wars of the nineteenth century. The British were fighting the weak Qing dynasty and tried three times to capture the city, which was strongly held by the local Chinese admiral. He captured and executed a handful of British sailors, and the city remained a free zone throughout most of the century. It reminded me of how the sweep of history had crossed that island so many times—the Dutch, the Spanish, the British, the mainland Chinese of course, the Japanese, and finally the Chinese republican forces who still held out against the Communist regime ashore. Like Sicily in the Mediterranean, Taiwan was strategic ground and fought over frequently, with the indigenous people endlessly bearing the brunt of war. As I walked about the port in my Navy uniform, it occurred to me how strategically vital this island remains, plugging like a stopper the great flask of the South China Sea and sitting athwart the sea lanes between Korea, Japan, China, and all the states to the south. Mahan would have advocated planting a flag there and building a coaling station. Those days are gone, but continuing engagement by the United States makes a great deal of sense, it seemed to me on that spring day long ago, and still does today. The final leitmotif of the South China Sea over the past two decades is the geopolitical contest between an outsize China that is rising inexorably and the handful of small but dynamic nations that share the littoral of the South China Sea with their massive and increasingly assertive neighbor. The history of the waterway is not only about ships passing through it, and the small and great wars on the coasts; it is about the scattered island chains that provide a means for nations to claim chunks of the sea if they can only establish claim. This is the story of the seemingly constant conflict over the Paracel and Spratly islands, for example, as well as over Mischief Reef. What drives all this, of course, is the presence of hydrocarbons in the South China Sea. While most of the nations would be content with the rules and regulations generated by the United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty, which came largely into force in the 1980s, what is in dispute is access to the seabed and the oil and gas that exists there. Some estimates put the total amount of oil and natural gas at levels similar to the Middle East. This is a mother lode of resources, especially for the smaller players along the littoral. So it’s no surprise that there has been a constant game of occupying the island chains for nearly fifty years. What is new is China’s strategy to build artificial islands. This has begun in earnest in the past several years, and already the Chinese have built dozens of islands, mostly in the southern and eastern portions of the South China Sea. They are making them large enough to have caught the attention of the U.S. military and political actors in Washington. Admiral Harry Harris, who is Japanese American and the first Asian American four-star officer in the U.S. armed forces, has called the construction of the artificial islands “the great wall of sand.” The United States has undertaken a series of Freedom of Navigation missions to challenge China’s claims of sovereignty. Admiral Harris has elsewhere called the Chinese claims “preposterous,” and most international legal scholars agree. And in mid-2016, the international courts ruled definitively against China, which has thus far simply ignored the ruling and continued to aggressively build artificial islands and conduct its maritime operations as though it owned the South China Sea in its entirety. This situation will grow over the coming decades, and the potential for active combat is not insignificant. Instead of stone, brick, and wood, this new “great wall” consists of artificial islands strung out across the South China Sea—a region Beijing claims by virtue of historical right. China’s claim is encompassed by what it terms the “nine-dash line,” a radical demarcation of maritime sovereignty that takes an enormous bite out of the legitimate territorial claims of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries ringing the South China Sea. The crucial context of this behavior is that the South China Sea—Asia’s “cauldron,” as geostrategist Robert D. Kaplan calls it—is bubbling like the witches’ kettle in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. The South China Sea matters not only because it is contested territory, but because it’s hugely important to the smooth operation of the global economy. More than $5 trillion of the world’s annual trade passes through the South China Sea, all under the watchful eyes of the (oddly named) People’s Liberation Army Navy. China’s aggressive behavior in building these artificial islands tracks with its disregard of other norms of international law. Some of these provocations include lack of clarity on the claim itself—a claim that, again, international lawyers widely regard as preposterous—including an air-defense identification zone over the East China Sea directed at the United States, Japan, and South Korea; the placement of a mobile oil platform in Vietnam’s coastal waters; and the widely reported (and massive) cyberthefts of U.S. intellectual property, industrial secrets, and personal data. The specifics on the construction of these artificial islands are staggering. Thus far—and construction continues—China has created nearly three thousand acres of land out of the ocean. Just consider that the highly touted and massive U.S. aircraft carriers (from which can be launched a wing of more than seventy jets and helicopters) are only about seven acres of flattop. Are these artificial islands similar to hundreds of unsinkable aircraft carriers in the South China Sea? Think that shifts the balance between the two competing militaries? You bet it does. Besides the obvious geopolitical and military issues, significant ecological damage is also under way, according to many scientists. One expert from the University of Miami, John McManus, called China’s building of man-made islands “the most rapid rate of permanent loss of coral reef area in human history.” Add to this the internal tension under which President Xi Jinping’s regime is operating: falling real estate prices, an aging population, an imbalance of men (too many) and women (too few), terrible ecological damage requiring significant mitigation, and above all, a sputtering economy that is stunting growth. When authoritarian regimes come under pressure, they tend to look outward to find ways to distract the population. Nationalism emerges. Such is the case in China today. Witness Xi’s September 2015 speech at the United Nations—full of barely concealed vitriol directed at the government of Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe. The tension between Japan and China has been waxing and waning over the past several years. Now it’s increasing again. What is the best approach for the United States? This tense situation is out in the open, and Xi’s late September 2015 visit to Washington did not fundamentally change anything. First, despite provocations, the United States must maintain open communications with China and seek ways to reduce the chances of an inadvertent collision either between the United States and China (unlikely) or between China and one of its immediate neighbors (far more likely). The U.S. relationship with China encompasses economic issues, geopolitical cooperation from Afghanistan to Iran, and global environmental issues—the South China Sea dispute is only one element. Dialogue is crucial. And the agreements on military- to-military contact and cybersecurity that the two presidents discussed during Xi’s visit are better than nothing. Second, the United States needs to strengthen its relationship with existing allies and partners in the region and encourage them to work together better. This applies especially to Japan and South Korea, which, for a host of historical reasons, have long had an uncomfortable relationship. The United States can help build better ties between the two neighbors by promoting military exchanges and exercises, enabling conversations at important events like the Shangri-La Dialogue (an annual gathering of strategic thinkers in Singapore), and encouraging so-called Track II engagement, which is exchanges and dialogue conducted not through government channels (Track I) but instead through academic and research institutions. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive multilateral trade agreement, is a big element: building a network of even stronger trading ties can ensure that America’s friends and allies cooperate with one another. And in particular, working more closely with Vietnam makes good sense—and this should include lifting bans on weapons sales. Third, the fundamental tenets of international law are against China’s approach in the South China Sea. The United States should sternly emphasize this in international forums like the United Nations, the G-7, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The intellectual underpinnings of international legal judgments on the South China Sea are very clear: nations cannot simply declare a “historical claim” and take over what other nations regard as international waters. The United States, as a global maritime power, should not miss any opportunity to object. The recent negative ruling against China further buttresses this strategic approach. And frankly, the United States should finally sign the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the treaty that governs the world’s oceans, to maintain the high ground in these conversations. Fourth, and finally, the United States should exercise its traditional rights of transit under international legal norms: its Freedom of Navigation operations. That means overflying Chinese territorial claims and sailing U.S. ships through China’s claimed water space—the waters within twelve miles of these islands. The United States has a long tradition of countering unjustified historical claims by sailing and flying through international waters and airspace. Now is the time to exercise it in the South China Sea. None of these strategic prescriptions by themselves will resolve the challenges of the South China Sea. Nor will simply moving U.S. military aircraft and vessels through claimed Chinese air and sea space suffice. Pushing back on Chinese claims in the South China Sea requires a broader strategy that treats this violation of international law in the larger context of both Chinese behavior and Sino-U.S. relations. Above all, it will require U.S. leadership alongside America’s many partners and friends throughout East Asia. China’s Great Wall was at least partially successful in keeping foreigners out. Its Great Wall of Sand will not be. Echoes of this argument from five hundred years ago—of the sovereign states’ rights in the coastal zone versus the value of mare liberum or the freedom of the high seas—are very much with us today. When I first sailed in the South China Sea in the 1980s, we were only marginally concerned about China. Our ships went pretty much wherever we wanted. But of late, the Chinese— advocating ownership of more or less the entire South China Sea—are vastly more aggressive. Even more disturbing, they are building these artificial islands in a further attempt to solidify their claim to these seas. All of this dates back at least five hundred years, and in many ways a couple of millennia in terms of historical claim to the waters. From the perspective of the United States, acquiescing in these claims will lead to further closure of the high seas, and thus necessitate our Freedom of Navigation operations: short, sharp patrols intruding into claimed territorial seas that we contend are in fact high seas and open to all. To understand this controversy requires looking backward into the long history of the region. • • • HAVING SPENT MUCH OF A long nautical career in the Pacific, I am hard-pressed to think of another time of greater military competition in the Asian region, at least since the end of the Second World War. In particular, arms expenditures are rising throughout Asia, especially in the bubbling cauldron of the South China Sea. Unfortunately, we are merely at the start of an entirely predictable and dangerous arms race as nations in the region increasingly respond both to the perception of a rising military power in China that seems more assertive in a strategic sense and to growing evidence of instability on the Korean Peninsula. All of this happens as the American “Pacific pivot” fails to gain traction in the face of crises in Syria, threats from the Islamic State, and ongoing tension with Russia over Ukraine. In terms of military spending, China (which has the second-largest national defense budget in the world after the United States) is on track to double its already significant defense spending by 2020, increasing about 7 percent each year. Meanwhile, the U.S. defense budget and those of European nations in particular have been declining. The Chinese are also buying and building large aircraft carriers, having just begun construction on the first one to be built in China. They are also rapidly improving their offensive cyber capability, which will be central to military operations in the future. The other nations of the region are responding. Japan has not only increased its defense budget but also passed legislation (not without controversy and protests) that will allow for offensive Japanese military action in defense of allies under attack—clearly strengthening its military alignment with the United States. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and virtually every other nation in the region are likewise increasing their defense spending. On average, the East Asian nations are spending at least 5 percent a year more on defense than was the case several years ago. And we should remember that the United States and Russia, the first-and third-largest defense spenders in the world (and the two largest arms exporters), are also Pacific powers. At a recently completed World Economic Forum in Davos, we saw a bit less public strain between Asian leaders than in the past couple of years, which is good. But in 2014 at Davos, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe said that he saw the Chinese-Japanese relationship as reminiscent of the antagonism between Great Britain and Imperial Germany a century earlier, on the eve of the First World War—hardly a reassuring thought. Since then, the two leaders—Prime Minister Abe and President Xi—have managed to appear together at several events and there seems to be less overt tension in the air. But in a variety of conversations I have had with senior military and political leaders over the past few months, it is clear that the subtext remains one of significant competition and indeed potential conflict. Several of the nations involved in territorial disputes with China are moving closer to the United States. These include Japan (already among the closest of allies of the United States in the East Asian region), Australia (basing U.S. Marines ashore on its northern coast), and Vietnam (which continues to operate closely with the United States in both military and commercial spheres). The Philippines presents a more complicated case. Until 2016 they were moving toward a much closer relationship with the United States. However, their newly elected and highly unpredictable populist president, Rodrigo Duterte, is now distancing himself from the United States, which has criticized him for violating human rights and encouraging the killing of drug offenders and criminals with impunity. In addition to swearing (frequently) at the United States and President Obama, Duterte has indicated a desire to reduce overall military cooperation with the United States and perhaps align himself with China (and possibly Russia). His mercurial nature makes it difficult to predict how this will turn out, but it certainly throws another layer of tension and unpredictability into the already turbulent South China Sea. The completion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (which does not include China) would further align the signatories with the United States, although its future is in doubt as President Trump opposed it. All of this activity is at least in part a response to a perception of increased military and political aggression on the part of China. • • • IN ADDITION TO increased Chinese defense spending and assertiveness, there is the North Korean problem. With yet another nuclear detonation, Kim Jong-un has definitively claimed the dubious honor of leading the most dangerous nation in the world. The North Koreans are armed with a small arsenal of nuclear weapons; led by an inexperienced, unstable, emotional, and medically challenged dictator (with a truly bad haircut); possessed of technologically advanced ballistic missiles; and in a virtual state of war with their closest neighbor, South Korea. All of this has an additive effect on the already tense relationships in the region, especially for Japan and South Korea, which must factor into their defense spending the presence of North Korea. Another fascinating dynamic is the unfolding role of India as a global security actor, which will have knock-on effects in East Asia. India has historically stood a bit apart from East Asian politics, reasoning that it has enormous internal challenges and plenty to do in operating along the vast Indian Ocean littoral. But increasingly we are seeing India under dynamic prime minister Narendra Modi reaching out to engage with the United States and Japan in increased military and security cooperation. This began with counterpiracy operations off the Horn of Africa and now includes military exchanges and joint exercises. The outlook remains very concerning, and it appears unlikely that there will be any significant reduction in tensions or in defense spending over the next decade and beyond. What should the international community and the nations in the region be doing to help create stability? First, at the tactical level, the nations in the region should at a minimum encourage military-to-military direct contact. This can lead to defined protocols to minimize the chances of accidental ship and aircraft collisions, misunderstandings that escalate into shooting incidents, and even structuring agreements that would prevent cyberattacks on military command and control systems, which are highly destabilizing and particularly dangerous. Such military-to-military contact can be done bilaterally between the military staffs or organized in parallel to regional conferences. Additionally, when such regional gatherings do occur—for example the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) annual convocation—having a portion of the event that includes high-level and candid political conversations about security is important and can create a higher level of confidence. Alongside such governmental conferences, private sector engagement (in maritime shipping, commercial air traffic control, cyber agreements, and environmental technologies for example) can be an excellent way for views to at least be exchanged in a neutral forum. Third, finding ways for the militaries in the region to collaborate operationally, especially at sea, is important. This can be in simple maritime exercises that focus on noncombat operations—such as medical diplomacy, disaster relief, and humanitarian operations. It can also include quasi-military training or operations together for events upon which the nations do agree— piracy, for example, or humanitarian evacuations from a disaster zone. Fourth, the use of international negotiating platforms to resolve territorial disputes could be key. Putting such disagreements before international bodies like the International Court of Justice in The Hague, another mutually agreed- upon United Nations body, a third-party government, or even an agreed-upon binding arbitrator should be considered. Unfortunately, such international legal activities are not binding, and it appears unlikely that China will accept such outside interference in its “backyard.” • • • OVERALL, THE ARMS RACE in East Asia is simply a reflection of the geopolitical tensions that will remain high in the region for the foreseeable future. While there are ways to reduce such tensions, they are unlikely to diminish as the twenty-first century unfolds, so buckle up. After putting all of this together, what is the right U.S. strategy for the South China Sea? Can it be separated from our thinking about the broader Pacific and the world ocean? What would Mahan tell us about its importance and our approach? While it is impossible to pull out a single sea from the whole of the oceans and develop a global strategy based upon it, the South China Sea is unique in its geopolitical significance. Here resources, great and powerful maritime states, and critical sea lanes of communication converge in the most populous region of the world. The United States must retain a presence here. There are several ways we can do this. We should maintain a network of bases and access agreements around the littoral of the South China Sea. The logical places to consider are in the west (hopefully the Philippines, perhaps even a return to Subic Bay), the east (in Vietnam, Cam Ranh Bay is a logical spot), and the south (Singapore, where we already have a robust presence, makes the most sense). In the north, we should continue to explore a strong refueling and resupply arrangement with Taiwan, even if this makes China upset (which it will). With a package of four bases, or at least four significant agreements for access and resupply, we could operate quite freely in the region. Additionally, we need to have a strong relationship with each of the nations around the littoral. We already have such relationships with Japan and South Korea, just outside the South China Sea; but we need to pursue exercises, military exchanges, and maritime engagement with Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Continuing to pursue good maritime relations with Thailand, Indonesia, and even Cambodia would also be helpful. The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the resulting economic interconnections will be helpful strategically. The big question over time will be whether or not to encourage China to participate. It is too soon to tell, frankly, whether or not China’s intentions in this region will permit recognition of international norms, and maritime and littoral boundaries. If China truly intends to attempt to claim the South China Sea as its territorial waters, the prospects are slim for an accommodation. Having said all of that, it is crucial that we maintain an open and constructive relationship with China where we can. Despite our frustrations with their piracy of intellectual property, cyberattacks, unsupportable maritime claims, internal human rights violations, lack of democracy or liberty, and other points of disagreement, there are ways we can find some zones of cooperation. In the maritime sphere, for example, the possibility exists to work together on disaster relief, medical diplomacy, counternarcotics, counter–human smuggling, and environmental issues. The key is recognizing that there will be areas of significant disagreement, but that does not totally preclude working together on specific areas. And there will be flare-ups between the United States and China. Over the past decade, we have suffered several, including an aggressive Chinese confrontation in 2009 with a U.S. surveillance ship, USS Impeccable, operating completely legally in international waters (although within the exclusive economic zone of China); and a Chinese fighter jet collision with a Navy electronic P-3 Orion aircraft in 2001, forcing it to land on Chinese territory. Both of these incidents were eventually worked out diplomatically, but are indicative of the cut-and-thrust of both U.S. and Chinese maneuvering in the South China Sea. And in fairness, we should consider our own reactions if Chinese intelligence and surveillance vessels and aircraft were routinely operating in the Gulf of Mexico, close to U.S. installations and within our exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Those incidents bring up an interesting aspect of international law that pertains both in the South China Sea and elsewhere. The United States failed to sign the massive 1984 United Nations Law of the Sea Treaty (one of only thirty nations worldwide to refuse, sixteen of which are landlocked). In that treaty, the conditions under which nations can transit another nation’s exclusive economic zone (two hundred nautical miles) are somewhat ambiguous. The United States chooses to interpret it as permitting us to conduct national surveillance (a euphemism for spying); other nations (China, India, and others) vehemently dispute this. The text is unclear. This disconnect is what has led to incidents like this involving U.S. spy ships and aircraft operating inside the EEZ but outside the territorial sea (twelve nautical miles). More such incidents will follow, especially in the contentious waters of the South China Sea. Overall, the South China Sea will be a maritime hinge upon which huge geopolitical issues will ultimately swing. The United States must consider it a crucial zone of maritime activity in the twenty-first century. If we cede it to China—something China deeply desires and would consider inevitable—our global strategy will fail. While we should not push ourselves into a cold war with a rising China, we need to be mindful of our values and the importance of international law. As a young officer sailing these waters nearly four decades ago, I was deeply impressed with the history and civilization of China. We need to respect its culture and importance in this region and upon the dark blue waters of the South China Sea, but not surrender our own participation on international high seas and with close friends and allies. It will be a delicate balance to strike, but a crucial one. Much as with the Russian Federation, we should cooperate where we can, but confront where we must. 6. THE CARIBBEAN STALLED IN THE PAST The Caribbean as it appeared to cartographers Pierre Lapie and Ambroise Tardieu in 1806. The Caribbean Sea remains the part of America’s backyard about which most citizens know very little. Any understanding of the modern Caribbean actually begins in Madrid, at the Spanish Naval Museum. I went there first in 2009, on my initial visit as the NATO commander. The chief of defense of Spain, an extremely elegant four- star air force general, put me in the capable hands of his chief of the navy for much of the day, and together we spent a couple of delightful hours wandering through the maritime history of Spain—a good deal of which focused on the Spanish conquest of the Americas, centered upon naval operations in the Caribbean. In the museum I saw the earliest map of any part of the Americas, the chart of Juan de la Cosa, which despite all of its understandable inaccuracies (it was drawn up in 1500 by an experienced sailor but not a formally trained mapmaker), is quite recognizable to modern eyes. Over the part of the map where Central America ought to be located is an image of St. Christopher, the patron saint of travelers—probably an intended homage to Christopher Columbus. Columbus, as any pre–politically correct schoolchild of the 1970s will remember, was not Spanish, but Italian. He was born in Genoa in the middle of the fifteenth century, probably around 1450 or so. Known in Spanish as Cristóbal Colón, he has come to us in anglicized form as Christopher Columbus. He probably traveled extensively around the western Mediterranean and down the coast of Africa. This was a period in which the Portuguese were daily discovering new ways to harness current and wind to reliably explore beyond the edges of the known world. Some reports indicate that he traveled north as well, perhaps as far as Ireland. Genoa in the early years of Columbus was like the bar scene in Star Wars, with Marco Polo playing Han Solo. It was full of exaggerated tales of the Far East, the riches of trade, swaggering characters and sea captains, and plenty of shady opportunity. The son of a lower-middle-class weaver, Columbus would have grown up with a sense of horizons opening up, and a dream of making it to the richest lands of all—the China of Marco Polo’s tales. By the mid-1470s, he had moved to Portugal and set out to find a sponsor for a voyage to the west, eventually turning to Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain (specifically Aragon and Castile, respectively) for sponsorship. The year 1492 was important in the consolidation of Spain and the removal of the final vestiges of the Muslim world from the Iberian Peninsula—on January 2, eight hundred years of Islamic rule over some portion of modern-day Spain came to a close through the so-called Reconquista. Given the optimism and enthusiasm over these august events, it was not hard to eventually persuade the royal couple (mainly Isabella, a sea captain’s daughter and granddaughter) to finance the expedition to the west, through what was called the Ocean Sea. Columbus demanded and received excellent terms: the title of admiral, significant control over the disposition of discovered lands, and a large share of the profits. The voyage to the Caribbean was soon financed and the expedition was divided among the three famous ships—the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria—in August 1492. By early October, the “Admiral of the Ocean Sea” is believed to have arrived in the Caribbean on a small Bahamian island today known as San Salvador, the name first given it by Columbus. Thus did Europeans come to the Americas, at least in the case of the Caribbean Sea. And what a disappointment for Columbus! Far from the glittering palaces and pleasure domes, the gold and silk, the spice and treasure of Asia, he found instead the traditional culture of the Amerindians, who went about mostly naked, built and produced little beyond bare subsistence, and had little idea about gold. Columbus explored and discovered Cuba and Hispaniola without finding anything of conventional value. He departed at the turn of the year in January 1493, bringing a few pieces of gold (he left nearly forty sailors behind to try to develop a gold mine on Hispaniola), some fruits and birds, and several terrified Indians to show at court. Despite utterly failing at what he actually set out to do—to find a western sea route to the Far East—Columbus put sufficient spin on the voyage’s narrative to intrigue many in Europe. Further voyages quickly followed, and investment flowed. On his next voyage in 1493, Admiral Columbus discovered other important islands—Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Guadeloupe, and Antigua. Small bases and commercial entities were established, and more kept coming. There was a haphazard quality to it all, understandable given the depth of geographic misunderstanding that had led to the discoveries. When I was first a sea captain myself, in late 1993, my destroyer, the Barry, was ordered to the Caribbean to conduct humanitarian work and enforce an arms embargo against Haiti. It was a strange first voyage, as this was just after the end of the cold war and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Frankly, I would rather have sailed my brand-new AEGIS combatant up into the Baltic Sea to chase Soviet submarines, but that ship had sailed, so to speak. So off to apply soft power in the Caribbean I went, with an inexperienced crew and all of us trying to find our sea legs on this, the first significant voyage of the newly commissioned warship. We sailed right by the island of San Salvador at the entrance to the Caribbean, and I called the crew up on deck and gave a very short description of Columbus’s first voyage, calling on my excellent fifth-grade history teacher’s pedagogy, concluding with the dramatic words, “Just think, here we are just over five hundred years later—half a millennium—sailing in the same waters as Christopher Columbus, the great explorer, headed to help create security in this part of the world. Columbus’s legacy continues.” I felt pretty good about my impromptu history lesson. But when I went down to the wardroom for dinner, a couple of my junior officers (who were nearly two decades younger than me and one of whom was African American) pointed out that Columbus’s voyages had led mostly to enslavement and death for the locals. Good point, I thought. We should remember that History, with a capital H, is always a throw of the cosmic dice. It seems to provide both the good and the bad in endless measure, and only God can sort it out in the end, I suppose. One man’s vaunted explorer is another man’s genocidal conquistador, and how those cosmic dice land on the table is so often a random walk. Indeed, the “Accidental Sea” could just as easily be the name of the Caribbean Sea given the nature of its discovery; but as my younger and wiser junior officers correctly pointed out, before very long, the deliberate and dark scourge of slavery to fuel the production of sugar and other crops would begin to take root throughout these beautiful and pristine islands. Colonization of the Caribbean was also fueled by the desire to proselytize and convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. The Age of Exploration, setting out on the vast oceans of the world, washed ashore on the quiet Caribbean—with explosive effect felt down to the present day. And on reflection it is hard to deny that the ultimate outcome, sadly, was not so much the product of an accident after all, but of a series of acts of avarice and greed that shape the sensibilities of the islands today. • • • THE CARIBBEAN IS A BIG SEA—if you include the Gulf of Mexico, which we will do for our purposes, it surpasses the Mediterranean as the world’s largest body of water that is not categorized as an ocean (after the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans in that order). It is roughly 1.6 million square miles, about half the size of the continental United States. It is a sort of massive pot-shaped body of water, and it is easy to picture the Caribbean as the rim of a huge volcano. One side is shaped by the long finger of Florida pointing downward on the western side, dropping like the boot of Italy toward the island of Cuba. Americans don’t always appreciate the size of Cuba, by the way—if it were laid out on a map of the United States it would stretch from Washington, D.C., to Chicago. Indeed, when President Kennedy was being briefed on the Bay of Pigs operation in the White House in the early 1960s, the commandant of the Marine Corps, a World War II veteran, overlaid the map of Cuba on one of the United States in that fashion to make the point. He then overlaid on the map of Cuba another map with a single dot at its center—it was tiny Tarawa, where in the Pacific War thousands of Marines had been killed to take that small island. Cuba is a big place. Cuba runs more or less northwest to southeast, and below it is the large island of Hispaniola, shared by the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and the Creole-and French-speaking Haiti, probably the unluckiest and certainly the poorest country in the Caribbean. Below them are the long string of islands forming the western border of the Caribbean, which are a mix of nationalities indeed, representing the constant resetting of imperial European ambitions in the Caribbean: British, French, Dutch, Danish, and Spanish are all represented across the centuries, and the present-day culture of each island is a kind of Euro- mélange. At the foot of the island chain and just north of South America are the twin islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Richer than most of the rest, and representing a curious blend of English and Spanish culture, T & T in many ways has the best of both worlds: a British language and legal backbone overlaid on the warm Caribbean and Spanish island cultures. Because they are blessed with oil reserves (which has been a mixed blessing at times, in truth), they can afford to provide a higher level of resources for social and structural programs than many of their counterparts nearby. My principal memory of my visits there while I was a combatant commander was the exuberance of the motorcycle escorts that accompanied my convoys from the airport to the capital and the government houses. The tall, elegant police motorcyclists would literally stand on their motorcycles and direct traffic without touching the handlebars, moving at very high speed. I have been in motorcades in more than a hundred countries; this was the most dangerous. I described this to the head of U.S. Special Operations Command, a four-star Army Green Beret who had spent his life in combat and danger, and he said, “Those sound like some troopers with a death wish.” Yet it all seemed to fit with the energy and the humor of a nation with a love of public theater and plenty of propensity for risk. Across the north coast of South America, the Caribbean Sea laps against the three Guyanas: French Guiana, Suriname (the former Dutch Guiana), and Guyana (formerly British Guiana). They are sort of three tin soldiers guarding the southern mouth of the Caribbean, representing the three principal colonizing powers that arrived after Spain. Each has its own character, culture, language, and political situation, but the one that sticks in my mind is Guyana, the former British colony that sits farthest to the west. Known principally to Americans as the site of a bloody cult murder-suicide in 1978 known as the Jonestown Massacre after its megalomaniacal perpetrator, Jim Jones, it gave American English the phrase “to drink the Kool-Aid,” as in to believe in the cause despite all evidence to the contrary. It is a physically beautiful and relatively resource- rich nation with a quietly defeated air and a political system straight out of the Borgias. I went there first in the mid-2000s as the commander of U.S. Southern Command, determined to visit all of the thirty-plus nations of the region in the first couple of months on the job. My staff told me not to bother with the three Guyanas because “nothing ever happens there.” But I liked the idea of at least setting foot on each of the countries of the region, and after a brief back-and- forth with my doubting chief of staff, we set up a trip after, of course, visiting the bigger, more important countries: Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia. I arrived and was duly shuttled to see the president (or was it the prime minister?), and in his dusty office with the blinds drawn against the tropical sun, I asked him what the greatest challenge he faced was. Poverty? Drugs? Crime? (All of these were pretty obvious problems.) He shook his head and sighed, admitting that each of those was indeed a challenge; but he said the biggest problem was emigration. “Everyone who can attain a high school degree leaves as soon as they can. Mostly they want to go north to your country, but they will go anywhere to get out of Guyana.” It was a sad comment from a sad man, and made me think how lucky we are in the United States—for all our problems and mistakes and challenges, wherever I go people still want to come to, not leave, our country. We talked a bit more, I promised to be helpful in training and equipping his small and relatively docile military, and on I went. In all of the places I visited on the Caribbean Sea, in many ways Guyana was the saddest. • • • COLOMBIA IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL and troubled country in the Caribbean. It ought to work well given the lush beauty, incredible natural resources (gold, oil, rich farmland, gorgeous harbors), and geopolitical position, both commanding the southwestern Caribbean and possessing a long Pacific coast. It sits at the crossroads of North and South America as well as the Caribbean and Pacific, and would also possess the Panama Canal (and Panama) if the United States had not essentially created an independent Panama in 1905 by financing and guaranteeing a revolution and breakaway there in order to build the Panama Canal (“We stole it fair and square”). I spent a fair amount of time afloat in the Caribbean off the coast of Colombia over the years, especially in the first decade of the twenty-first century while charged with the so-called War on Drugs mission as the U.S. commander based in Miami. I had sailed through the waters earlier in my career, mostly en route to or from the Panama Canal, but as a four-star admiral I was responsible for helping our Colombian friends stop the flow of drugs that departed the Colombian ridge—much of it over water routes through the western Caribbean. The volumes of cocaine are staggering, certainly in the hundreds of tons. At one point early in my tenure, we captured a fully formed submarine built in the jungle of Colombia and launched into the Caribbean Sea with a crew of three, diesel propulsion, an excellent communication suite, and—wait for it—ten tons of cocaine in the hold. Street value north of $150 million: an example of powerful innovation and determination. These were the new pirates of the Caribbean, and their remit was law across much of the western Caribbean. Just north of Colombia is the beating heart of the American economy (American in the broad sense, encompassing all of the Americas, North, Central, and South): the Panama Canal. Built on what was once Colombian soil after a U.S.-engineered coup and subsequent “independence,” it opened in 1914 after much death and suffering among the workers, most of whom came from all around the Caribbean littoral and were directed by American engineers (after a previously failed attempt in the late 1880s led by Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps). This is a story of maritime engineering well told by historian David McCullough in his brilliant book The Path Between the Seas. • • • FOR A MARINER, there is no experience quite like transiting the Panama Canal. It is such a specialized nautical operation that even the United States Navy, which famously believes in full accountability for its commanding officers, relieves a CO of his or her command accountability while in the canal. I went through it first in the mid-1980s as the operations officer on a brand-new Ticonderoga- class cruiser, the fourth of the class, USS Valley Forge. I loved that ship, which I had helped build at a shipyard in Mississippi. When we sailed away, it very much had a “new car smell,” and the paint was pristine on its gray hull. As the operations officer, I had charge of the physical care of the exterior of the 567- foot ship, and my boatswain mates took enormous pride in the sides. When we approached the narrow sliver of the canal, I thought my crusty boatswain mate Chief Petty Officer Gene Jones would have a heart attack worrying about scraping our sides on the tight openings, where ships are literally pulled through the locks by mini-trains on both sides. The Panamanians were experts, and the transit went smoothly with hardly a scrape. But that feeling of coming from the open water of the Caribbean Sea into the tiny, vulnerable locks—of giving over responsibility for navigating your ship to the canal workers and the pilot—was an uncomfortable one. I was happy to break free on the southern side and kick up the speed to a full 30 knots, blasting swiftly into the endless Pacific and leaving the canal behind. • • • UP THE COAST OF Central America you sail past the most dangerous countries in the world—after Panama comes Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, and Mexico. Collectively they have the highest violence rates in the world—more violent deaths per hundred thousand in the population than anywhere else, including Afghanistan and Iraq. Tragically, much of the violence is essentially an export of the United States, driven by the vast demand signal of our market for narcotics, armed by automatic weapons and handguns manufactured in our factories, and led by the gang culture created in southern California and sent south with deportees three decades ago. The Caribbean coast of Central America is a kind of Wild West that in places has changed little from the days of the pirates. It has hidden ports and forts that are no-go zones for law enforcement, places from which the drug runners operate with complete impunity. • • • I FIRST SAILED to the Caribbean in 1975, while I was in my fourth year, a senior —properly referred to as midshipman first class—at the U.S. Naval Academy. Every summer the entire Brigade of Midshipmen, some four thousand strong, dispersed all around the world on their summer cruises. These were not experiences like going on a Carnival cruise line and enjoying piña coladas in the sunshine while shopping in the ship’s arcade. Summer cruises for midshipmen at Annapolis consisted of flying to some port of embarkation, slinging a huge sea bag over your shoulder, and trudging up a steel gangplank. The idea was to learn something about “the fleet,” which at that point in my seagoing career was merely a distant theory. In the humid summer of 1975, I was bused down to Norfolk, Virginia, where a dozen classmates and I embarked in the brand-new aircraft carrier Nimitz. She was a floating city; more than 100,000 gross tons, the length of three football fields, and from keel to the top of her mast about the height of the Empire State Building. After a quick indoctrination we were under way and headed down the East Coast of the United States into the Caribbean Sea. After a couple of days, we entered the Caribbean through the Windward Passage, the strait that lies between the islands of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and Cuba. The captain came on the ship’s announcing system, the 1MC, and said we were passing through the same water as Christopher Columbus centuries earlier, a speech I was to duplicate nearly two decades later as a destroyer captain. As a midshipman on Nimitz, however, I was having a cheeseburger in the wardroom and decided to forgo the soft ice cream sundae bar in tribute to the no doubt far more rigorous experiences Columbus and his sailors faced. Our first port of call was not exactly a tourist destination: Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. In those days, of course, it was not internationally infamous as a prison for terrorists but rather as a backwater training facility for ships getting ready to deploy. The main purpose of Guantánamo Naval Station for most of its history was logistic support—a Mahanian coaling station. Over time, because it was out of the main Atlantic shipping lanes and had a ready logistic base, it became the center of training on the Atlantic coast. In practice this meant that warships would show up for three weeks of brutal training to prepare for combat. Everything a ship could do was exercised, from gunfire to damage control (fighting shipboard fires and flooding after taking incoming fire) to aviation operations and under-way replenishment. It was a tight, twenty-hour-per-day syllabus, designed to put the ship’s crew under the maximum amount of stress. The beauty of doing this off Guantánamo Bay was that it provided an opportunity to get the full attention of the crew—who were a long way away from their families and friends. The bars and tattoo parlors of Norfolk seemed a distant memory to the sailors. But realizing that you cannot get the maximum effect by strictly training the crew at sea, the Navy in its wisdom let the sailors come ashore for a couple of days each week to blow off some steam. So my first chance to set foot ashore in the Caribbean was as a twenty-year- old midshipman on the athletic fields and tennis courts of the naval station under a full-on summer sun. Along with four thousand of my new best friends, I worked out and drank beer for 35 cents a glass with occasional shots of the high- end 50-cent rum to wash it down. Predictably, by the end of the day, the world was spinning a bit, and I went down to the pristine beach with a couple of my Annapolis classmates to sober up and contemplate the world from the vantage point of the sea. The Caribbean is a gorgeous body of water at night, and that evening the moon hung full and low over the gently rolling waves. As is the case in most of the Caribbean, the landscape of Cuba is dry and rocky once you get away from the beaches; but the beauty of the trade winds and the luminous turquoise water more than made up for it. As I leaned back and watched the moon rise, I thought of all the ships sailing and steaming by that southern point of the long island of Cuba, centuries of history, much of it bloody, passing by me. The next day we were back aboard the huge steel decks of the carrier and listening to the endless gong of the general quarters alarm. • • • IF YOU LOOK BACK at the colonial history of the Caribbean, it is easy to be reminded of Winston Churchill’s famous description of the traditions of the Royal Navy: “Rum, buggery, and the lash.” Indeed, the sea is named for one of the earlier Amerindian tribes, the Caribs, who were effectively wiped out by the intrusion of guns, germs, and steel, as author Jared Diamond titled his magnificent book on why Europe colonized so much of the world and not vice versa. Pre-European times in the Caribbean are not well understood or documented. The Europeans gave a variety of names to the indigenous tribes they discovered, all of whom they simply saw as candidates for conversion to Christianity and slavery. Some of the terms from those early days of collision include “Taino” or “Tanyo,” meaning a native who was relatively cooperative; or “Carib,” meaning a warrior and generally a cannibal; or Arawak, who was somewhere in the middle. Cultural anthropology was not a strong suit of the Spanish conquistadores, and the opportunity to preserve the language, history, and culture of the locals was largely squandered. What is notable is the lack of seamanship or open sea voyaging on the part of the early inhabitants of the Caribbean. Other than some offshore fishing, there is little evidence or record of serious voyages, the use of sails of any kind, or the construction of vessels capable of containing more than a handful of sailors. Thus the monstrous vessels of the arriving Spaniards, although quite tiny by today’s standards, were overwhelmingly impressive to the native populations. These were not entirely unsophisticated societies. The Caribbean natives had probably come into the broad basin of the Caribbean Sea thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The best guess would be that they were searching, not for gold and silk like the Europeans, but for land, freedom from oppressors to the south on the South American continent, food, and fish. At the time of the European arrival, they lived in villages and settlements, some of which were as large as five thousand souls. The overall population of the Caribbean islands is impossible to estimate, but suffice it to say that the overwhelming majority died in the decades after the European arrival. As Mel Gibson’s brilliant movie Apocalypto depicts, set on the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the arrival of the Europeans was absolutely an apocalypse to the local inhabitants. • • • THE NEXT ACT in the drama of the Caribbean actually began when a little-known friar named Martin Luther nailed his views to the door of a cathedral in present- day Germany in 1517. The result ultimately was the creation of a pool of gasoline to which the king of England, Henry VIII, put a match in trying to sort out his marital arrangements. Thus emerged Protestantism and the schism in the Catholic faith, resulting in more than 150 years of significant war and bloodshed, with lingering effects far into the nineteenth century. Overlaid on all of this, of course, was geopolitics and imperial rivalry. Soon Europe was immersed in political and religious wars between Protestants and Catholics that would continue to burn in one form or another for the next five centuries (and sputter along today still in Ireland and the Balkans to some degree). Inevitably, these huge European wars and disputes ashore began to play havoc with the emerging system of societies in the far Caribbean, especially on the oceans. The principal combatants were, on one side, the Spanish Catholics who over the next several centuries would do all they could to consolidate a massive empire in the Americas; convert and essentially enslave the indigenous populations; extract great treasures of gold, silver, and precious gems; and conduct monopolistic trade in everything the New World had to offer, notably sugar, and—as time went by—tobacco. On the other side were the hardy Protestant English and Dutch, both of whom launched explorers and raiders from the North Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea itself. Somewhere in the middle, and less effective, were the Catholic French and Portuguese, who carved out holdings on the South American continent. Overall, it was an age of sea empires fighting in a relatively small space in and around the islands of the Caribbean and the littoral coasts of the larger land masses that bound it. One of the main targets of the Protestant sea raiders was the treasure-laden galleons of the Spanish crown. These would sail every year from Spain, carrying trading goods to the New World. The flota (fleet), as it was called, would number dozens of significant ships. Upon arrival in the Americas, they would unburden themselves of goods and load into their creaking hulls the precious spoils of empire—silver from the mines of Potosí in Bolivia, gold and emeralds from Colombia, tobacco and sugar, and even goods from China and the Philippines that came across the Pacific. By the latter part of the sixteenth century, the Spanish had created the first global market, and they took enormous rents and profits from it. Such ships were incredible targets, and both the navies and the authorized commerce raiders from the Protestant states gleefully attacked. Perhaps the most iconic Protestant sea raider was Sir Francis Drake, who made his name in the Caribbean with a series of daring raids and was the darling of his monarch, Queen Elizabeth, with whom he may or may not have had an affair. In the late 1500s, he conducted raids on Spanish ports in Colombia and Florida, burning and pillaging as he went. After a stint of more honest battle in opposing the Spanish Armada in the Atlantic as it sailed toward England in 1588, Drake returned to his first and best love, pirating. He eventually died of disease in the Caribbean in 1596, having made himself rich. But Drake was hardly the only pirate. There were hundreds of buccaneers (so called supposedly for their habit of roasting both meat and captives over a slow- burning wood fire on frames, called boucans in French) plying the Caribbean during the 1500s and 1600s. The Caribbean was not the scene of large pitched battles, but rather a kind of nautical Wild West. There were certainly naval warships, and as time went on and “civilization” descended, they became the dominant force in the region. But throughout the first century of the Caribbean’s colonization, the maritime dynamic was largely that of commercial trading vessels being attacked by opportunistic pirates—all of this fancifully and farcically brought to life, of course, by the swashbuckling and swishing Captain Jack Sparrow in the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean films. Many of those incidents are loosely based on the exploits of Sir Henry Morgan, a Welsh-born privateer whose life and career are truly the stuff of legend. After a highly successful (and vicious) career as a buccaneer, he returned to England, was slightly reprimanded (wink, wink), then made the governor general of Jamaica, much to the disgust of the Spanish. He milked that gorgeous island for a great deal of wealth by continuing to make it available to sea rovers, and eventually died there in 1688. I went to Jamaica for the first time in the late 1970s, a period of considerable turbulence in the island’s history. Relatively newly independent, Jamaicans were finding their way through a natural transition from reliance on a British backbone of governance to a system (and a set of political choices) more aligned with their culture, history, and proclivities. Not surprisingly, they turned dramatically left. While as a mid-twenty-something Navy lieutenant this was not entirely clear to me, what came across quite vividly was a sense of dramatic, indeed revolutionary, sensibilities that were sweeping the island. This was not a simple land of Red Stripe beer, jerk chicken, joint-puffing and reggae-playing Rastafarians, and gorgeous tourist vistas. Clearly there was much more afoot. This became clear to my small liberty party of ship’s engineers from the carrier Forrestal when we decided to get beyond the tourist zone in Montego Bay and tried to go watch a cricket match being played by two all-black teams. With all black spectators. And no welcoming committee, to say the least. We weren’t exactly threatened so much as aggressively ignored, much like the college students in the movie Animal House who try so desperately and pathetically to relate to the band in the all-black roadhouse they invade. Needless to say, we pressed on pretty quickly. After experiencing much the same syndrome in a number of other venues, we decided that prudence was in order and we headed back to the beaches of the north shore. The following evening, I had the bridge watch as we pulled up the anchor and headed fair out to the clear waters of the Caribbean. The evening winds were pushing us hard, and I was struggling to get the ship on course, despite having four huge propellers and a hundred thousand horsepower at my disposal. Finally, I got us straightened out on course and as the sun was setting we turned east and headed into the winter twilight away from Jamaica. As the watch settled into a routine, I tried to put together the little I knew of Jamaican history with all that I had seen and experienced, and I realized the trip had made a lasting impression on me—especially the sense of the overhang of history, the ghosts that rattle our past and somehow exist just beyond the edge of our vision. Since then the Caribbean has always had that effect on me: of being in an edgy dark dream from which I have just awakened, but incapable of really understanding the land in which I find myself—despite enormous sympathy and affection for the islands, coastlines, and people of this remarkable region. • • • THE EUROPEAN LAND WARS of the 1600s inevitably began to bleed over into conflict at sea. The British came late to the Caribbean, but they came to see the power, not only of sugar and tobacco, but increasingly of chocolate, ginger, salt, and indigo. By the latter part of the seventeenth century, their fleet was sailing for open war in the Caribbean, seeking to wrest territory away from Spain. After a complex series of battles, the British ended up with many long-term colonial possessions—Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, St. Kitts, and other islands. The Dutch, not to be left out, took and held several islands more toward the southern Caribbean, as well as Dutch Guiana (now Suriname). In one of those absolutely delicious and yet tragic historical ironies, the Dutch traded the colony of New Amsterdam for Dutch Guiana. When that occurred in the seventeenth century, they were regarded as roughly equivalent properties. Today, of course, New York City is worth a couple of trillion dollars, while the capital of Suriname, Paramaribo, is among the most impoverished capitals in the Americas, a city of less than half a million people. And soon the French began to move in, securing smaller islands and taking a slice of the Caribbean coast of South America, which became French Guiana (which remains today a department of France). Each of the colonizing powers merged private and public efforts by creating maritime trading and commercial companies, which functioned as quasi-official forces to bolster their national claims in the region. These West Indies companies (by various names among the various nations) were akin to the East India companies that would ply the Indian Ocean a century or so later. • • • BY THE 1700S, the economic outline of the next two hundred years was set. It consisted of a slave labor–based economic model that brought African labor to the Caribbean to produce sugar and other agricultural products. These were sent to Europe, which provided the muscle to collect the slaves. The triangular flow of ships went from Europe to Africa to collect slaves, then to the Americas with tradable goods and slaves, then back to Europe to bring the treasure of the Caribbean home. Sugar itself was well known globally before the colonization of the Caribbean, with origins in the Pacific and Indian oceans, and was once planted extensively in the Levant. But those sources faltered, the European sweet tooth grew, and the appetite for sugar began to drive the economy of the region. There were also Indians and indentured whites involved in the extremely labor- intensive process of growing, cutting, crushing, storing, distilling it into molasses and rum, and transporting. Sugar cane has only about 10 percent sugar in it, and the process of extracting it is brutally difficult work. In addition to the terrible and obvious human misery involved, the triangular trade also contributed to disease and death. This was not only through the exposure of indigenous natives and African slaves to previously unknown microbes; it was also dangerous for the Europeans, who would themselves face diseases rising from the combination of stagnant water and mosquitoes that resulted when land was fully cleared. Yellow fever was a particular scourge that attacked Europeans, but not Africans (who had a reasonable level of immunity, having been exposed to a variant in Africa). This further drove the demand signal for the “adaptable Africans” and away from using white labor of any kind. All of this shaped the destiny and demographics of the Caribbean through the 1700s and on into the 1800s, until nations finally began to be repulsed by slavery, beginning with Great Britain, which banned the transatlantic slave trade in 1807; the United States, which fought a civil war to end slavery in the 1860s; and finally Brazil, which abolished slavery in 1888. But the damage had been done, the culture of slavery blighted these societies throughout those years, and its effects continue to be felt today. The numbers are extraordinary and utterly tragic—certainly millions were moved across the infamous Middle Passage, perhaps as many as 12 million, with up to 2 million perishing along the way. But we will never actually know the true numbers. • • • THERE IS ALWAYS a kind of theater about the Monroe Doctrine, which was issued by President James Monroe in the 1820s and largely ignored by the European powers for the next hundred years or so. The idea was that the United States would not permit any further colonization or manipulation of the nations of the Caribbean, and that our nation would be a sort of guarantor of good behavior. It was paternalistic, condescending, and quite unenforceable by a nation with virtually no armed forces, a small population, and a confused political culture, and an indifferent approach to international relations generally, to say nothing of being a slave-owning country itself. Over the decades, as the strength and power of the United States grew, the Monroe Doctrine began to have more teeth to it, and would be invoked from time to time to push back against European ambitions in the region. Throughout the nineteenth century, it was mentioned but seldom honored, until the United States burst on the colonial scene more or less by accident as a result of the war with Spain. The principal connection of the Caribbean nations to the wars of the twentieth century was through the soldiers exported to fight for their colonial masters. During World War I, the British West Indies Regiment, formed from the islands, saw combat in Europe, although the black islanders were often relegated to support and logistic duty, to their dismay. French and Dutch troops likewise participated with their national elements. The United States confined itself to a series of interventions throughout the early part of the century, principally by the U.S. Marine Corps, to enforce stability, uphold the banking laws, and keep the Europeans more or less out of places like Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Central America. The United States also purchased the Virgin Islands from the Danes, a pretty good buy at $25 million, even in 1917, when you look at real estate prices there today. I remember taking my destroyer into both St. Thomas and St. Croix in the mid- 1990s and thinking what a wonderful stroke of luck the United States had in three national purchases—the Louisiana Purchase, which gave us essentially the western continental United States; Alaska, which gives us our window on the north and vast natural resources; and the Virgin Islands, which afford us strategic reach into the Caribbean alongside Puerto Rico. • • • THINGS BEGAN TO really heat up in the Caribbean during the cold war. What set the stage, of course, was the rise of caudillos, a Spanish term for military dictators who came to dominate virtually all the nations of Latin America and the Caribbean by the latter part of the twentieth century. These dictators, naturally enough, gave rise to countervailing freedom movements, some of which were associated with communism, and suddenly the cold war arrived in the sunny Caribbean—with ground zero being on the island of Cuba. After the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro came and visited the United States, and it looked as though there might be an amicable relationship. But Castro quickly became associated with the Soviet Union, and in the dynamics of the cold war it was “you are either with us or against us” on both sides. The United States did all that it could to undermine the Cuban regime, most notably with the failed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. This CIA-supported mission ended up with a thousand Cubans dead, a couple of thousand more jailed by Castro, and bitter enmity that endured for decades. The height of danger, and the moment at which the Caribbean became the epicenter of the world, was over a ten-day period in October 1962 in the Cuban Missile Crisis. This is a story best told by Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow in their masterful book Essence of Decision, about the Kennedy administration’s successful effort to avoid a nuclear war. The Navy conducted a significant blockade of the island to prevent more Soviet missiles from sailing to Cuba. Eventually the crisis was defused after some clever diplomatic maneuvering, but it is extraordinary to think how close the world came to a nuclear exchange and a completely changed and diminished world order in those days. The cold war hovered over the Caribbean throughout the second half of the twentieth century as a sort of ongoing symphony playing in the background, but the real theme was independence. Most of the islands and other small countries finally broke free from their European overseers, virtually all peacefully: Guyana and Barbados (1966), the Bahamas (1973), Grenada (1974), Dominica (1978), St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (1979), Belize (1981), and St. Kitts and Nevis (1983). Each has its own rich culture and history, although in economic terms most remain relatively poor today. By the 1980s and 1990s, Haiti had become the center of a great deal of violent activity—both from political turbulence and from Mother Nature. In the 1980s, the dictator Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier was forced from power and a series of elections and coups ensued. When elected president Jean- Bertrand Aristide was forced out by his military in 1991, the United States put pressure on the coup leaders to turn over power peacefully. My destroyer, USS Barry, was dispatched to Haiti as part of an arms embargo (read: show of force) in the mid-1990s, and all I can remember is steaming placidly up and down the coast, boarding a couple of coastal steamers carrying bananas, and holding barbecues on the fantail for a very bored crew. I remember looking at the dark coast of the island and thinking about all the blood spilled there over the years in the slave times, the heroic but doomed slave revolt, the massacres, the earthquakes and hurricanes. There cannot be a less lucky country than Haiti. I returned to Haiti roughly twenty years later as a four-star commander in the days after one of the seemingly endless hurricanes had knocked down a great deal of the very shaky infrastructure. I visited with the Haitian president René Préval in the beautiful but poorly maintained presidential palace, toured the city, and tried to be helpful by directed delivery of aid and supplies. The country seemed to be on a bit of an upswing, with significant international aid coming in and a real effort at reconstruction getting traction. Over my three years in Southern Command, I always felt Haiti’s luck was changing. But I was wrong. The really big disaster came just after my time, in 2010, when a massive earthquake killed perhaps 300,000 people (these are highly disputed figures) and completely destroyed the capital of Port-au-Prince, including flattening the presidential palace. The epicenter of that quake was just outside the city, and the destruction was essentially complete. Since then, Haiti has had enormous difficulty mustering the kind of support it needs, as the world’s attention has moved on to Syria, sub-Saharan Africa, and many other troubled spots. One other moment of cold war excitement in the Caribbean was on the tiny island of Grenada, which had suffered a left-wing coup in 1979 and then a brutal countercoup that led to the execution of the prime minister, Maurice Bishop. The newly installed government appeared to the Reagan administration as dangerous to the thousand or so U.S. citizens (including, famously, many U.S. medical students). That the government also had Marxist tendencies was an additional problem. The United States invaded Grenada ostensibly to protect U.S. citizens in a scene reminiscent of the many U.S. invasions in the Caribbean in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century—six thousand U.S. Army, Marines, and Navy SEALs came ashore in Operation Urgent Fury in 1983. They easily restored order and turned over power to the governor-general. Ironically, today you can drive by the monument to the U.S. soldiers killed just outside the international airport—named for Maurice Bishop, the left-leaning leader who was overthrown and executed. Of note, Operation Urgent Fury further exposed the inability of the various branches of the U.S. military to work coherently together, which was first significantly observed following the failed rescue attempt of the Iranian hostages a few years earlier. The problems were in communications, doctrine, logistics, and tactics; the Grenada invasion led to major overhaul and the implementation of a new joint approach for the armed forces. As usual, it is little remembered in U.S. history, but looms as a significant event in the history of this small, beautiful island. Indeed, that invasion of Grenada is a sort of metaphor for the lack of U.S. interest and engagement that has been the pattern in the Caribbean. Over my years as commander of U.S. Southern Command, based in Miami (some would say the true capital of the Caribbean and Latin America), I came to know the Caribbean very well, visiting every major island over a three-year period. It is a lovely and vibrant part of the world, dominated by a clear and gorgeous body of water, yet despite its preternatural beauty, it is unfortunately also a part of the world that does not live up to its potential, with poverty, poor growth, corruption, and violence acting as the four horsemen of the tropical apocalypse. It is a part of the world that seems perpetually stuck in the past in so many ways. When I contemplate the Caribbean, I am often reminded of one part of the Pirate’s Code in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies: “Any man who falls behind is left behind.” In the Caribbean, it feels like everyone somehow fell hopelessly behind the rest of the world, and the region has yet to catch up. Let’s face it: while physically beautiful, the Caribbean is a sea of nations that by and large don’t function terribly well. Central America is the most violent region in the world; Colombia is struggling for peace, fighting a virulent insurgency for sixty years; Venezuela is oil rich and politically poor, unable as a result to even stock goods on the shelves; the three Guyanas (British, now simply Guyana; Dutch, now Suriname; and French, still a very poor department of France) are immersed in poverty; almost all of the islands are poor with weak, corrupt governance; Puerto Rico is in economic default; and Cuba, the “Pearl of the Antilles,” is shamefully the last dictatorship in the hemisphere. Even the Caribbean coastline of the United States and Mexico, the two wealthiest nations, has some of the poorest internal states and regions along the Caribbean Sea (e.g. Mississippi, the Florida Panhandle, southeast Texas, and much of the Mexican Caribbean. Why is this? It is the result of a lethal combination of history and geography, including a legacy of racism, slavery, piracy, anarchy, and small wars. Additionally, the region has a pattern of general physical exploitation with little regard to sustainability. What agricultural development has occurred most often has been conducted to the point of exhaustion, using mono-crop agricultural approaches. Finally, natural disasters (hurricanes, earthquakes, fire) are endemic. Just as a nation like Haiti begins to make progress, for example, it seems there is a devastating hurricane or an earthquake or both. There is no other maritime region that has been dealt such a bad hand of cards, both by history and by nature. Additionally, the region is a significant transit zone for narcotics flowing largely from the Andean Ridge in South America and up into the United States, the largest drug market in the world. In that regard, by the way, I would prefer to simply park the moral question of whether people should or should not use drugs. All of our societies are grappling with that issue now, and many serious analysts and political leaders are beginning to advocate legalization. My concern here is quite simply about the money. The cash that comes out of this huge, multibillion-dollar industry is unregulated, and much of it goes into corruption and violence, undermining fragile democracies and stifling growth in other sectors. The idea of a “war on drugs” is limiting and simplistic, and has clearly failed—we need a strategy to fight corruption and violence, which are the root problems. We need to think holistically about the root causes and what we can do together in the Americas to address them. In terms of causes, it is tempting to focus on the proximity of the United States itself as the heart of the problem. The argument goes that the Monroe Doctrine, dating from the 1820s, made the region into a sort of stifled American lake that was never allowed to achieve its potential. Mexicans have a saying: “Pity poor Mexico, so close to the United States, so far from God.” There is a bit of that feeling in the islands as well, where the United States tends to be blamed for everything from the lackluster economy to bad weather when it comes. All of that strikes me as a classic H. L. Mencken solution: clear, simple, and wrong. The situation is far more complex. The great irony, of course, is that the region ought to work very well. Despite a bloody history early on in the colonial period, there has not been a major war fought in the region between nations for centuries. The Caribbean is nestled in the heart of the Americas, the richest zone of commerce and natural resources in the world. To the north and increasingly to the south are industrialized societies with which the nations of the Caribbean have strong and important demographic connections—think of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and El Salvador, all with enormous immigrant populations in the United States on a per capita basis. While the Caribbean Sea itself can be fickle and bring terrible storms during the hurricane season, it is a natural “tropical silk road” that links all the economies and provides a shimmering tourist industry. Despite the overhang of colonialism, many of the nations in the Caribbean maintain strong links back to advanced nations and economies in Europe, including the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands. There is a good deal of material to work with in terms of advancing the societies of the region. What can the United States do? And perhaps more important, what are we willing to do? First, we need to begin with a recognition of our responsibilities to the region. Despite our frustration with decades of failure to achieve progress, we have both a moral and a pragmatic set of reasons to expend resources here in the Americas, and I would argue especially in the Caribbean Sea and basin. Given our historical engagement (including multiple military invasions over the past couple of centuries), as well as our penchant for claiming responsibility (the Monroe Doctrine), the moral argument seems fairly clear. The pragmatic case is equally clear. By building up capable local partners in the region through cooperation—economically, politically, culturally, and in the security dimension—we strengthen our own shared region. The tired and offensive cliché of “America’s backyard” has to go and be replaced by a Partnership for the Americas, and the Caribbean—the neediest region of the Americas, encompassing the Central American nations—is a good, practical place to start. If even a tiny fraction of what has been spent in Afghanistan on development had been deployed in the Caribbean, we might have seen extraordinary results. It is never too late to start. Second, we need to encourage the nations of the Caribbean to work together. The reality is that they are individually too small to achieve real political throw weight. There are some nascent organizations in the Caribbean, but they have never proven themselves effective in moving the global needle politically. We should provide resources, advice, and training to the Caribbean organizations that focus on collective action, and also revitalize the moribund Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has always been a kind of geopolitical afterthought to NAFTA and CAFTA. Third, our security cooperation has been limited in its approach and effectiveness. Almost entirely focused on the failed “war on drugs,” it has not provided the kind of wide-spectrum engagement that might improve the broader security situation in the region. The local forces need training and resources to improve in rule of law, basic investigative work, advanced anticorruption techniques, surveillance, intelligence, and human rights. U.S. Southern Command is the right conduit for this. A fourth thought would be to build in a constructive and methodical way to draw on the huge diasporas from the region located in the United States today. The Cuban American community, for example, has resources and deep business experience. Each of the other national groups brings different regional strengths within the United States to bear. Connecting the Caribbean diaspora is crucial. Fifth, we should do this in cooperation with our partners Mexico and Canada, the other two North American economic powers. We all have a shared interest in a successfully functioning Caribbean. Sixth, the United States should work to develop a collective Caribbean strategy. We have one for the Arctic—why not one for our southern neighbors clustered around the Caribbean Sea? Seventh, we should think more aggressively about so-called Track II diplomacy, coupling the private sectors in the United States and the region together. This can be done through educational reforms, programs in the arts, sports diplomacy, and medical exchanges. Given that the languages of the region are overwhelmingly English and Spanish, our two core national languages, we have a huge comparative advantage in doing this in and around the Caribbean Sea. When I was the military commander at U.S. Southern Command, we tried a number of innovative things to connect with the region. One was a series of baseball clinics conducted by U.S. troops (carefully screened semipro-caliber ballplayers) and financed partly through donations from Major League Baseball teams. There are many creative approaches in this vein that would help foster human connections. Overall, this is a region where a little bit of attention and resources go a very long way. There are humanitarian and pragmatic reasons to overturn the Pirate’s Code of “fall behind, left behind”—let’s work harder to help our Caribbean neighbors sail ahead. 7. THE ARCTIC OCEAN PROMISE AND PERIL The Arctic Ocean holds a unique place in sailors’ lore and explorers’ stories. Map created by Sir John Ross, 1855. Despite its rapid opening, the Arctic remains the world’s least-understood ocean. A THE PROMISE OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN lmost every one of the world’s oceans has been the site of epic battles— some more than others—and there is no well-traveled global body of water that has escaped significant bloodshed. Indeed, it is impossible to estimate how many men and women have died at sea in combat all across the globe down through the centuries that man has sailed the world’s oceans. But there is an exception: the Arctic Ocean. Indeed, with that sole exception, at the bottom of every watery corner of the world lie the rusted weapons of long-dead sailors, their battles ended forever. The last ocean never to have seen any significant level of active combat is the Arctic, existing as it does at the top of the world, far from the reach of mankind. Today it offers the tantalizing chance of becoming a zone of cooperation and peace. But the enormity of its resources represents a prize that will draw increasing attention from many quarters, creating tension and danger. Today the Arctic world is in a delicate state of tension: between environmentalists who are terrified we will destroy the last pure place on the earth and the developers who want to exploit the enormous natural wealth (albeit responsibly by their lights); between Russia and NATO, which increasingly face off across the Arctic Ocean and are perfectly capable of stumbling backward both metaphorically and literally into another cold war; and between scientists who want to preserve the ocean for science diplomacy and well-intentioned tour operators who want to open a booming ecotourism and educational industry in the last great frontier. The Arctic Ocean is a place of both promise and peril, as well as mystery. Above all, as we look at the Arctic, we should consider the place it holds in the collective imagination of the world. The region that even today many in the Scandinavian nations refer to as the “High North” was often thought of as a temperate zone waiting to be discovered. Early maps of the North Pole often showed an area with arable land and a moderate climate at the top of the world, and this misconception persisted for centuries. Early projections by Gerardus Mercator, one of the greatest sixteenth-century cartographers, showed such habitable zones in his 1595 charts. Even as late as the mid-1800s, the theory of mild temperatures and warm climates at the North Pole put forth by serious geographers like the German August Petermann was taken seriously by explorers. And virtually every civilization has a myth or two attached to the Arctic, notably the story of Santa Claus in our own Western canon. • • • THE SMALLEST OF THE WORLD’S great oceans, the Arctic Ocean (also occasionally called the Northern Ocean) has always been a zone of mystery, shielded from human sight throughout much of recorded history. Early maps generally depicted it as a huge world of water, replete with gorgeous cartouches on the edges of the charts dominated by dragons and demons; in other cartographic representations it appears with vast oceans but with great hidden temperate land areas in the center of the massive ice fields. Even today, we know more about the moon or Mars, and have mapped them more carefully and fully, than we have the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. Remarkably, defining the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean remains somewhat difficult, as even the term “Arctic” has varying definitions. It is scientifically and widely accepted to be the portion of the globe north of which there is continuous daylight during the summer solstice—this being 66 degrees, 33 minutes, and 45.9 seconds. Some alternative definitions have to do with temperatures in the region, for example, the portion of the earth with median temperatures of 50 degrees or less in July. Politically, some try to define it as the ocean bordering those countries with Arctic indigenous populations. As always in the human mind, defining a region varies depending on the observer’s biases and theories about who should dominate it and how—and the Arctic, despite its shrouded character, is no exception. It is worth noting in this regard how fundamental the Arctic is to Russia. Fully 20 percent of Russia’s population lives within the Arctic Circle, as opposed to essentially zero Americans and really only a handful of Canadians. The Russians, by the way, fully self-identify as an Arctic nation in ways that certainly transcend the feelings of any other sovereign state with the possible exception of Canada. They have just launched the largest and most powerful nuclear icebreaker in the world, the Arktika—567 feet long, 33,000 tons, 80,000 shaft horse power, and capable of breaking through up to ten feet of ice. Strangely, for a region that is essentially devoid of human settlement, the Arctic is today the fastest-growing region in the world—each of the Arctic nations is actively pushing for the opening of settlements, increasing military activity, expanding resource exploitations, and generally staking claims with humans in the High North. In terms of the Arctic Ocean, in reality, of course, it is essentially a bounded sea with two major openings, tightly confined at the Pacific end and relatively broadly accessible on the Atlantic side, with long continental shelves along either side. With the warming polar climate, temperatures are higher for both air and water and the permanent ice cover—the central feature to a mariner’s cautious and skeptical eye—is eroding year on year. Virtually every reputable scientist looking at the global environment today sees a continuation in this trend, which will provide access for the first time in human history to an enormous trove of treasure in the form of natural resources, geopolitically important terrain, and highly efficient sea lanes of communication. By 2040 there will be an open passage for essentially twelve months of the year, and another decade later there will no longer be ice over the North Pole. It is ironic that the Western world searched for centuries for the elusive passage to Asia through the Canadian Arctic: the Northwest Passage. Today, with no effort other than pollution and global warming, we have opened it with increasing alacrity. In terms of size, the Arctic is about 5.4 million square miles, covering an area roughly akin to the size of the continent of Antarctica. This is the promise of the Arctic Ocean: it covers an estimated nearly 15 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil (perhaps 100 billion barrels), 30 percent of the similarly estimated gas (some 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 44 billion barrels of liquefied natural gas), and possibly a trillion dollars or more of nickel, platinum, cobalt, manganese, gold, zinc, palladium, lead, diamonds, and rare earth metals. In round terms about 25 percent of the proven reserve hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) are in the Arctic. It is also a huge incubator for human life–sustaining protein in the form of fish—50 percent of U.S. fish stocks come from the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone off the coast of Alaska, for example. The same is true for many of the other nations that ply these waters, both within their exclusive economic zones and on the high seas (where the competition from non-Arctic nations is robust and rising). All of this takes place in an area that by square mileage is only 2.5 percent of the globe. In terms of geopolitical ownership, it is worth noting that with the full Russian continental shelf claims, nearly 80 percent of the proven reserves of the Arctic will be in Russian hands. And most important in commercial and geopolitical terms, the fabled Northwest Passage is opening fairly rapidly as the ice cover recedes. Several years ago, over a million tons of cargo transited the Arctic routes and by doing so cut thousands of miles off the traditional sea paths across the lower trade routes. This cargo—which is rising in tonnage each year—falls broadly into three baskets: adventure tourism (the smallest), transarctic shipping (within the port system of the High North itself), and global shipping that has a specific destination around the world but outside of the Arctic itself. There are two key routes that connect Asia and Europe—the Northwest Passage that runs along the North American continent and the Northern Sea Route that runs along Eurasia, essentially along the coast of Russia. Both routes are at present unpredictable and risky, but their use is growing. Obviously, Russia will seek to develop the Eurasian route. One key sea lane of communication today is the tight Bering Strait off the coast of Alaska, which is the only route between the Arctic Ocean and the vast Pacific Ocean at one end of the Arctic Sea. Taking this as a rude metric of the increase of shipping, the U.S. Coast Guard says that traffic through the Bering Strait increased nearly 120 percent from 2008 to 2012. All of this shipping must move over an area of open sea that is nearly undeveloped in terms of conventional ports, navigational aids, buoy systems, and other supporting maritime systems. For example, Barrow, Alaska—the major U.S. port on the North Slope—is accessible on a reliable basis only by air. Even Russia, which has invested heavily in its portion of the region, has limited coast guard coverage throughout the area. All of this represents an exciting opportunity for mankind in the form of resources that have heretofore been unattainable given the harsh conditions, ever-present ice, and long distances from global communication centers. The promise of the Arctic Ocean is undeniable, but it sits in the center of a region that presents great peril as well. • • • THE FIRST TIME I sailed north into the waters of the Arctic Circle, I was in a Navy destroyer in the late 1970s operating in the western Pacific. We were detached from routine patrol around Japan and ordered to head to the west coast of Alaska. Fortunately for us, this was during high summer and while it was not exactly balmy, we were not in unusually uncomfortable seas. The highlight was learning that we would indeed dip our bow inside the Arctic Circle, which would make all of us on the ship “Blue Noses” in Navy parlance. This is usually accompanied by a ceremonial dip in a tub of very cold water on the bow, but because we had no previous Blue Noses in our crew, no one was excited about organizing such a ritual. Thus I earned my Blue Nose certificate without actually taking a dunk in the icy water of the Arctic Ocean. In geopolitical terms, this was the height of the cold war, and our mission up there was to test the antisubmarine warfare gear on the ship under extreme conditions. We did so without actually stumbling on a Soviet submarine, at least as far as I could tell. As the ship’s antisubmarine warfare officer, I was more worried about getting the long towed array cable off the reel on the ship, into the water, and back aboard in one piece than I was about actually finding a submarine. Over the next two decades, there were plenty of interactions between U.S. and Soviet warships in the Arctic, generally under the ice by submarines. It seems metaphorically sensible that such confrontations were largely conducted in the silent, dark depths of the Arctic, unseen and in many cases unreported. Like those games of cat and mouse, much of what happens in the Arctic, as in Vegas, stays in the Arctic. We dodged a bullet in the cold war and avoided real combat between NATO and the Soviet Union—but looking ahead to the unfolding potential for confrontation around the Arctic Ocean, I often think back on that first voyage and hope that we can again avoid actual sea battles at the top of the world. THE PERILS OF THE ARCTIC OCEAN Why do I worry? A variety of perilous conditions will influence the speed with which mankind will be able to exploit fully all of the promise of the Arctic Ocean. Let’s examine some of the challenges in the region. The first and most evident form of peril remains simply the brutal character of the climate. In his extraordinary recent book (2015) about the doomed U.S. Arctic Expedition of 1879, In the Kingdom of Ice: The Grand and Terrible Polar Voyage of the USS Jeannette, Hampton Sides takes the reader deep into the mariners’ experiences in the High North. At one point, speaking about the captain of the Jeannette, Navy lieutenant George Washington De Long, Hampton says, “He became more and more intrigued by the Arctic, by its lonely grandeur, by its mirages and strange tricks of light, its mock moons and blood- red halos, its thick, misty atmospheres, which altered and magnified sounds, leaving the impression that one was living under a dome.” They set sail in April 1879 from San Francisco, and almost all died in the course of their expedition. Today, their bravery in the Arctic is commemorated by a lonely monument in the cemetery at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. The story is also echoed in Ian McGuire’s extraordinary 2016 novel The North Water, about a whaling expedition that goes terribly wrong and creates the ultimate confrontation of good and evil—against that most unforgiving environment in the High North. What makes the harsh conditions even more dangerous, of course, is the lack of facilities for rescue or monitoring of any kind. Taking the U.S. Coast Guard as an example, the closest Coast Guard air station to Barrow—the largest U.S. city on the north shore—is located in Kodiak, about a thousand miles to the south. While there are small commercial airports in some of the northern U.S. cities of Nome, Prudhoe Bay, and a few others, there is very little infrastructure to conduct search and rescue. The Arctic is also famously difficult for the basic transmission of command and control signals. Cellular coverage is virtually nonexistent for obvious reasons, and the general propagation of any form of radio signals is limited. All of this means that if a mariner is in trouble in the Arctic, he or she is in serious trouble. A second form of peril in the Arctic Ocean today is the confused governance that surrounds the region, especially at sea. Given the confluence of five large key landholders bordering the Arctic Ocean—Russia, Canada, Norway, the United States, and Denmark (by virtue of Greenland)—there are competing national and international regimes at play. At the international level, there is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which was created in 1982 after more than a decade of negotiation by essentially every nation on earth. It was significantly modified in 1994, and today forms the backbone of the regime of the oceans broadly. Oddly, given its enormous maritime interests, the United States has not signed the convention but instead relies on “customary international law” to gain as many of the benefits of the convention as it can. Most nations believe that the UNCLOS framework is both usable and functional in the Arctic Ocean today, and a 2008 agreement (the Ilulissat Declaration) memorializes that theory. In addition to the Law of the Sea treaty, there is the Arctic Council, a high- level, consensus-driven forum for the Arctic nations (Russia, Canada, the United States, Norway, and Denmark plus Sweden, Finland, and Iceland). The indigenous people of the region are represented by five nongovernmental organizations that are also permanent participants in the council; they cover the interests of the majority of people living north of the Arctic Circle. The United Nations has a maritime organization headquartered in London— the International Maritime Organization—that focuses on shipping and its regulation. It has been at work on a so-called Polar Code that would provide agreed-upon guidelines for shipping in the Arctic Ocean. Along with the UN Law of the Sea treaty and the Arctic Council, the International Maritime Organization participates in all the relevant conversations about the Arctic Ocean. At the national level there are perils as well. Each of the key stakeholder countries has organizations that attempt to provide governance over both its nationals and within sovereign parts of the Arctic Ocean, but that also affect other entities, for example ships in transit. The third peril of the Arctic is geopolitical competition. It is instructive to look at the alignment of the five key states bordering the Arctic Ocean—four are part of NATO (the United States, Norway, Canada, and Denmark) and one is an uneasy “partner” to NATO: the Russian Federation. As relations continue to deteriorate between NATO and Russia, it is becoming clear that the Arctic Ocean potentially will be more and more a place to revisit the mistakes of the cold war. Overlaying the geopolitical competition is the warming of the ice, which opens up more and more of the Arctic Ocean for interaction between military forces. The average ice cover in 2012 was 1.3 million square miles below the average of the twenty-year period from 1980 to 2000. In addition, the age of the sea ice is a trend worth noting. Younger ice implies the warming and breaking up of the older caps. The ice caps are both thinning and receding, and the geopolitical impact—opening much more of the open Arctic Ocean—is significant. There is a growing fear that another environmental danger is not fully appreciated: that the Arctic’s permafrost could melt as a result of global warming, releasing massive amounts of methane gas. This would be like dumping enormous amounts of carbon into the world’s environment, with potentially catastrophic results. A few numbers to understand this risk: first, the warming trends. Every time the earth’s temperature rises one degree, we see the temperature at the North Pole rise about five degrees, largely the result of methane gases. At the same time, we are globally concerned about the tipping point resulting from carbon emissions, which will occur when around 1,000 gigatons of carbon are dropped into the environment; at the moment, there are roughly 550 gigatons already at play. If we see even a two-degree rise in Arctic temperature, it is possible that 1,700 to 1,800 gigatons of carbon-equivalent methane will be released—immediately overshooting the carbon “budget” that nearly two hundred nations agreed to try to meet at the Paris Climate Summit. While not the result of policy in the Arctic directly, the warming effect on the permafrost there could be the catalytic event that drives global disaster, according to some experts. Looking at the geopolitical approach of each of the significant Arctic nations is crucial to understanding the complex overlay of relations in the region. While there is nothing inevitable about conflict—or even competition—it appears at the moment that a period of real coordination or cooperation is unlikely. This is the result of the resurgence in aggressive Russian behavior in Europe, which has bled over into relations in the High North. But the view is more complex than a simple “here we are back in the cold war” sigh. Let’s look at several of the key Arctic Ocean nations individually. RUSSIAN FEDERATION The majority of the vast Russian coastline lies above the Arctic Circle, and the High North is a central pillar of the Russian Federation’s worldview. It also has by far the largest Arctic population (around four million) and the best infrastructure. Russia sees the promise of the Arctic with great geopolitical clarity, and will maneuver to be a dominant player. The Arctic is also a part of the world that figures deeply in the Russian mind-set and self-image as a nation of rugged individualists who are capable of surviving in the harshest of conditions. Russia will always care deeply about the Arctic Ocean in ways that other Arctic nations (particularly the United States) do not. This does not presuppose that we are headed into a new cold war (literally and figuratively) in the Arctic Ocean, a sort of zero-sum Great Game of the High North. It is entirely possible that the Arctic Ocean could become a zone of cooperation, not one of competition or, God forbid, one of actual conflict. However, it is necessary to be clear-eyed about Russian infrastructure bordering the Arctic Ocean. It will remain as it has been for centuries the home of the North Sea Fleet, and provide the bases for the Russian nuclear ballistic missile submarines, many of which will operate from bastions in the Arctic Ocean. Russia is increasing the number of troops it stations in the Arctic region, as well as expanding its bases dramatically. All of the Russian Arctic-oriented strategies that we have observed over the past five years—both overtly and through intelligence gathering—view overall national Russian priorities as being centered on the region, featured in documents including The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation Through 2020 and the even more specific Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Arctic Through 2020 and Beyond. Much of the Russian focus will be on developing the Northern Sea Route that runs along its northern landmass. Eventually, this route will save 40 percent off the time between Europe and Asia, which will lower transport costs and connect northern Russia to global markets for Russia’s hydrocarbon exports. Use of the route will require shippers to develop vessels that can withstand the harsher conditions, and it will be quite hazardous for many years to come. There are currently very few facilities for refueling, repair, navigation, and search and rescue in the event of calamity. The Northern Sea Route will also create governance challenges given the multiple regulatory regimes that will gradually come into play as this new sea lane comes on line. Russia will also seek to successfully defend its various territorial claims in the Arctic Ocean, many of which have persisted for more than six decades. Famously, the Russian Federation planted a Russian flag on the Lomonosov Ridge (a huge piece of the continental shelf that is entirely underwater and well beyond the 200-mile limit of the Russian coastline) in 2007, and Russia still has significant border disputes with Norway, the United States, and Canada. With the United States, for example, there is ongoing controversy concerning the maritime boundary in the Bering Sea. With Norway, while some issues have been resolved, there remain disagreements over fishing rights in the Barents Sea. There are claims and counterclaims surrounding extended continental shelf disputes involving Denmark, Norway, Russia and Canada. While there is a great deal of disagreement and controversy, over time there is reason to hope for cooperation in the High North. In spite of the acrimony and the snippy rhetoric both from and directed at Russia, most of the actions Russia has taken in the Arctic Ocean have been fairly pragmatic. The potential for open conflict, while very low, is not entirely absent—all the more reason that the nations along the maritime borders of the Arctic Ocean should work diplomatically for a zone of cooperation. CANADA With more than 1.2 million square miles of Arctic territory and the world’s second-largest land area in the High North, staunch NATO ally Canada has always placed a premium on its role as an Arctic protector, in both the idealistic ecological sense and in terms of a realistic geopolitical framework. Canada has the longest coastline of any country in the world, and 65 percent of it runs along the Arctic Ocean. Throughout the first decade of the twenty-first century, Canada has consistently spoken and acted with a central focus on the region in general and the Arctic Ocean in particular. In particular, the Canadian military has expanded its operational surveillance of the Arctic Ocean and the approaches to Canadian territory. Some of its purchases include a new icebreaker, patrol vessels with some “new ice” capability, a deepwater port in Baffin Bay, and a winter “fighting school” for the army. Canadian work in mapping is also noteworthy. The former Canadian chief of defense General Walt Natynczyk was quite focused on the Arctic Ocean. When I asked him slightly tongue in cheek what he would do if the Canadian High North were invaded across the Arctic Ocean, he said, “Well, Jim, I suspect my first duty would be search and rescue to save the invaders”—his point, of course, being that the conditions in and around the Arctic Ocean are hardly conducive to real military operations supporting an invasion. And this represents the slight Canadian schizophrenia about the Arctic: while they are strategically aware of potential challenges and are willing to play realpolitik to protect “their” parts of the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean, they are also big believers in a balanced and multinational approach to the region. They have been strong supporters of the Arctic Council throughout its history, as well as key participants in international conferences and proponents of focusing on the High North. In the context of NATO operations, the Canadians are the least enthusiastic of all twenty-eight nations in seeing a NATO presence in the waters of the Arctic, preferring an approach that puts the Arctic Council and its military committee in the driver’s seat, not NATO. The Canadians, who are otherwise strong NATO players who participate in virtually every operation, are extremely proprietary about the Arctic. They see a significant alliance presence as somehow undermining their stewardship. Additionally, there is a significant pro–indigenous people and antimilitary bias throughout much of Canadian society, cutting across the political spectrum. All of this is in marked contrast to the Norwegians, who have a more “lean forward” stance seeking a larger NATO presence in the region—largely the result of their centuries of unhappy interaction with the Russians, whom they perceive as particularly aggressive at the moment. In meetings, top Norwegian military personnel often bemoaned to me the “lack of NATO concern” about their part of the Arctic. They have been adapting their command and control systems to make it easier to “plug and play” with NATO systems so that the alliance can at least have situational awareness of what is going on along the longest border of NATO: the High North. The Canadians also have a handful of territorial disputes at the moment. They are in dispute with the United States on a fairly large portion of the Beaufort Sea (the body of water just north of the eastern Alaskan/western Canadian border). While not of great significance, there is no quick or easy solution to this argument. Likewise, they disagree with the Danes over some of the boundaries of the Lincoln Sea (a tight body of water between the eastern border of Canada and the western border of Greenland) and ownership of a small island—Hans Island. They are also—along with the EU and USA—pursuing an agreement over the disputed Northwest Passage. This dispute is the most significant and quarrelsome. In essence, the Canadians believe that much of the Northwest Passage lies within their “internal waters,” while most other nations believe that the passage is an “international strait,” which allows greater freedom of movement for all nations. There are significant equities at play, and this argument is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. The other two disputes are fairly straightforward and are moving toward resolution. None of the three seriously threaten the peace in the High North, but are indicative of the wide variety of disputed elements in and around the Arctic Ocean. EUROPEAN ARCTIC NATIONS: NORWAY, DENMARK, SWEDEN, FINLAND, AND ICELAND While the northern European nations all have long traditions of engagement in the Arctic, they collectively lack sufficient resources, geopolitical influence, or populations to make a strong case for deep involvement at the level of Russia, Canada, and the United States. They will pursue their individual national agendas through both the European Union (all are members with the notable exception of Norway), in a NATO context (all are members save Finland and Sweden, which are close partners to NATO), and via the offices of the Arctic Council. Each of the European Arctic nations has a slightly different set of issues in the Arctic, and at the moment they show little sign of cooperating collectively to establish a European Arctic position on anything. For Iceland, the Arctic was a zone of danger throughout much of the cold war, when the relatively small island was in the crosshairs of potential Soviet nuclear strikes to blind the U.S. air and maritime defense zones. Iceland was also regarded as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” in the strategically vital Greenland- Iceland–United Kingdom gap in the North Atlantic. This was the passage through which Soviet ballistic missile submarines would have to pass in order to attain launch positions against the United States. Thus the Icelandic geopolitical status from those days is as something of a battleground—not a pleasant place to be. They look askance, therefore, at the deterioration of relations between the United States/NATO and the Russian Federation. Icelandic diplomats are very hopeful of seeing the High North become a zone of cooperation, not a zone of conflict. The Icelanders, who possess no actual territory within the Arctic Circle, see themselves as the potential beneficiary of enhanced trade routes, becoming a kind of hub port on the “Cold Silk Road” across the top of the world. They sponsor an annual conference that is essentially the Davos World Economic Forum of the Arctic Ocean, called, sensibly enough, “The Arctic Circle.” This provides a platform for their active approach to peaceful dialogue in the region. They are also highly interested in potential oil and gas fields within their exclusive economic zone, as well as their responsibilities for search and rescue in their “near abroad” in the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The Icelanders will try hard to remain relevant in the core discussions of the Atlantic Council, trying to stake out a position alongside the big five (Russia, Canada, USA, Denmark, and Norway). Denmark is an Arctic nation by virtue of its long possession of Greenland and the Faroe Islands. It has ruled Greenland since 1721, but there is an ongoing political debate about how this ownership will unfold in the twenty-first century. Greenland and the Greenlanders have been increasingly vocal in demanding greater autonomy, and there are voices increasingly raised in favor of independence altogether. Greenland is huge, and there are many military installations dotting the coastlines to which the Danes grant access to NATO and the United States, including the important Thule U.S. air base in the northwest corner of the island. The uncertainty regarding Greenland’s future is exacerbated by the discovery of increasing levels of gas and oil beneath its waters, which provides a realistic level of income and encourages the indigenous Greenlanders to consider independence seriously. Finally, the Danes are pushing for a series of very detailed underwater mapping exercises designed to sustain their extensive claims to great swaths of the Arctic seabed, up to and including the North Pole itself. Overall, we will see the Danes play a visible and aggressive hand regarding the Arctic Ocean. They will seek to hold on to Greenland and will offer higher and higher degrees of autonomy to the inhabitants there while retaining sovereignty. This will require a higher degree of military engagement in the region, especially from new installations in and around Greenland. Copenhagen will not give up its significant stake in the High North willingly. Norway, a rich country of vast territory and only five million inhabitants, has the resources but not the population to have significant Arctic impact by itself. The Norwegians, more than any other of the NATO/European Arctic states, keep a weather eye on their Russian neighbors. They have several territorial disputes with Russia, some of which have been solved and others of which linger on with little likelihood of resolution. The Norwegian island of Svalbard, high up in the Arctic Ocean, dominates the Barents Sea and constitutes a significant thorn in the side of Russian ambitions in the region. The Norwegians are concerned not only about hydrocarbons, but about fishery rights as well. There are significant stakes for Norway in the High North, especially as easily tapped oil and natural gas along its more southern coasts are depleted in the years ahead. Most expect Norway to continue to be the nation most concerned about a potential “resource war,” or at least an armed conflict of some sort in the Arctic Ocean. This has led Norway to take an aggressive stance on the role of NATO in the High North, constantly pushing it to be aware and informed operationally as to what is moving in the northern latitudes of the alliance. As the NATO commander from 2009 to 2013, I often conferred with my Norwegian counterparts about their concerns and attempted to assuage them as to NATO’s interest and engagement. Sweden and Finland, the two remaining Arctic nations, are part of the Arctic Council by virtue of a small segment of their land territory that lies within the Arctic Circle, but neither has significant coastline on the Arctic Ocean itself. Nonetheless, Sweden and Finland—non–NATO members both—watch the Russian Federation with concern over its increasingly expansive operational profile in the Arctic Ocean near both nations. Neither nation is looking for disputes with Russia, and of course both were essentially neutral throughout the cold war. Sweden and Finland have drawn closer to NATO over the past decade, including sending significant forces on deployment to Afghanistan. Swedish Gripen jets also participated with great success in the Libyan operations alongside NATO partners. As Russian behavior in the Arctic and in Ukraine makes these two nations nervous, they can be expected to seek even closer ties to NATO. It is possible they will consider membership in NATO, but that step appears unlikely absent yet another dramatic change in Russian activity. In regard to the Arctic, both will be quietly assertive of their prerogatives as Arctic nations, but both are also well aware that without coastline on the Arctic Ocean, their options for operational activity are limited. THE UNITED STATES It is striking to imagine how different the United States’ and Russia’s geopolitical positions would be if Russia still owned Alaska, which the United States purchased from Russia in 1867 under the vision of Secretary of State William Seward. Derided at the time as “Seward’s Folly” or “Seward’s Icebox,” the acquisition stands second only to the Louisiana Purchase as the best deal this country ever made. The United States has never placed a great deal of emphasis on the Arctic. Throughout our history, the country has placed the most strategic importance first on dominating the vast continental lands, then turned to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as the highways to the rest of world with expanding trade and geopolitical responsibilities. Until 2009, there was literally no stated U.S. policy articulated concerning the Arctic and the Arctic Ocean. The first such document came out as the Bush administration was leaving early in 2009; titled “Arctic Region Policy,” it was issued both as a National Security Presidential Directive and as a Homeland Security Presidential Directive. Frankly, the document is pretty thin reading, with little to encourage the U.S. government to devote resources to the High North. Throughout much of the cold war, the Arctic Ocean was a busy thoroughfare for U.S. and Russian nuclear submarines playing an elaborate game of cat and mouse, best illuminated in Tom Clancy’s brilliant novel The Hunt for Red October. The High North was also an air battlefield minded by the North American Air Defense Command, headquartered in Colorado. Teaming with Canada in air defense, the United States built a system of early warning air defense radars across the Canadian and U.S. coastlines that exist today and are still on watch for long-range forays by Russian strategic bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. In the post–cold war period, there was at first more amity in the Arctic Ocean region, but as relations between Russia and the United States (and NATO) have deteriorated sharply—especially since the invasion of Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea—the cat and mouse and watchful air defense on both sides have resumed with gusto. There is also the emergence of a more significant Chinese intercontinental strategic missile threat to worry about, and more recently the highly unstable North Korean regime of Kim Jong-un has acquired long-range ballistic missiles to marry up with its small arsenal of nuclear weapons. The North Koreans detonated their fourth nuclear explosion in early 2016. Given that these missiles can find their shortest path from Asia to the continental United States over the Arctic Ocean, it is clear that this Arctic path for ballistic missile launches opens a new strategic front from Asia to the United States itself. All of this places a much higher premium on U.S. strategic focus on the Arctic Ocean than was the case even two or three years ago. Perhaps even more important to long-range U.S. strategic thinking is the enormous amount of natural resources in, under, and around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic zone possibly holds 30 billion barrels of oil and more than 220 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Such estimates may only scratch the surface as they are generated in a very conservative way by the U.S. government. Additionally, vast levels of timber, fresh water, coal, copper, gold, silver, zinc, and rare earth elements are present. Fortunately, given the strategic importance of the region to the United States, the various governmental organizations are now beginning to spend time and resources conducting coherent strategic planning on the Arctic. The Department of Defense via the Navy laid out a reasonable road map in late 2009 and has updated it along the way. The plan includes budgetary line items for strategic planning, operations and training, investments (including weapons, sensors, and installations), strategic communications, and environmental assessments. More recently, in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security via the U.S. Coast Guard promulgated a similar strategic vision, its “U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Strategy.” The Department of State has appointed former commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Bob Papp as a sort of “Arctic czar” and designated him the U.S. representative to the Arctic Council. Even President Obama has joined in and recently became the first U.S. president to visit the Arctic, in the late summer of 2015. What is lacking, unfortunately, is a sense of a coherent, focused national effort despite the nascent efforts of the disparate interagency organizations. Much of the U.S. engagement under the Obama administration is focused on working through the Arctic Council. This organization, founded twenty-five years ago, has eight permanent members: Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden. It also has twelve permanent observers: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, China, Italy, India, Japan, South Korea, and even Singapore. Obviously, many of these nations do not leap to mind as “Arctic family members.” But attaining status as an Arctic observer is tied to international shipping activity and physical presence on other strategic shipping points. More nations will apply and gain observer status in the years ahead. For the United States, the Arctic Council represents the best international forum for raising concerns and questions about the behaviors of other Arctic and non-Arctic states. The council also sponsors dialogue among all of the militaries of its permanent members. Of note, when looking over a list of the number of operational icebreakers in the inventory of various permanent members of the Arctic Council, the shortcomings of the United States are particularly noteworthy: Russia: 30-plus icebreakers, of which 7 are nuclear powered, including the new Arktika, the pride of the Russian fleet Finland: 7 Sweden: 7 Denmark: 4 Canada: 6 United States: 3 Norway: 1 China: 3 (although not a permanent member, it has more under construction) It seems quite clear that the “hidden” days of the Arctic are coming to an end. The High North is an emerging maritime frontier with increasing human activity, rapidly melting ice packs, hugely important hydrocarbon resources, and a competing international agenda. • • • THERE ARE MANY BROAD CHALLENGES facing the United States as we look north to the Arctic waters. First is the rising geopolitical tension with Russia, which has arisen principally out of events in Syria and Ukraine, but will ultimately have repercussions in the High North. We are seeing increased Russian activity with its highly capable and numerous flotillas of icebreaking ships (such flotillas are strictly Russian in character, and are clusters of icebreakers that operate together), as well as their stated intent to build military bases in the Arctic region. Second is the environmental and ecological damage brought on by the melting polar ice cap, which is straining the entire delicate ecosystem. Third, associated with the melting ice is the growing commercial sense of an oil and gas rush up north. As the principal Arctic nations explore and exploit hydrocarbons, competition and disputes will rise in number and intensity. Fourth, the United States has no serious culture of engagement in the High North, and as pointed out earlier, today we have only a single truly functioning icebreaker (the other two on the list above are out of service at the moment), compared with dozens operated by Russia. We simply lack the idea of an “Arctic identity” that Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, and Denmark (by virtue of Greenland in the latter case) have. WHAT DOES THE UNITED STATES NEED TO DO? Ensure that the United States remains a leader in the Arctic Council. All of the nations bordering the Arctic Ocean (the six noted above as well as Finland and Sweden) meet frequently to work on issues in the High North. These include exchanging information about military operations, protecting the environment, creating standards for the exploitation of natural resources, practicing salvage and rescue operations, conducting climate studies and other scientific cooperation, and various other activities in the Arctic zone. The United States needs to put real resources behind our participation, sending top government figures (in addition to Admiral Papp) to consultations, appropriating significant funds for the activities committed to by the Arctic Council, and driving policy by shaping coalitions within the council. Build more icebreakers. If the United States intends to be serious about operating in the Arctic Ocean, we need the ability for both military and commercial ships to get through the ice pack. While many of our submarines are hardened and can break through the ice, if we are going to take advantage of the reduced shipping distances, move our oil and gas offshore structures, and support everything from science diplomacy to responsible tourism, we simply need more icebreakers—this is the path to credibility in the Arctic. At this moment, Russia, Canada, Finland, and Sweden all outpace us, and Denmark and China are building more vessels now. Our weak level of response must be reversed. A good icebreaker costs money—between $800 million and $1 billion. The reason buying one is hard is because they must compete with other high-cost items like Navy Arleigh Burke–class destroyers, advanced fighter aircraft, and sophisticated Army command and control systems. But going forward, the necessity and usefulness of such a vessel seems clear, especially when we have such limited capability in that area. Take a leadership position within NATO on the Arctic. There are varying views of the role of NATO in the High North, which run from Canada’s somewhat laissez-faire philosophy of “High North, Low Tension” in terms of NATO involvement, to Norway’s desire to integrate national and NATO surveillance systems to cover the Arctic aggressively and thoroughly from an alliance perspective. The Norwegians often say the High North is the unguarded flank of the alliance, because they fear Russian territorial aggression and a fight over hydrocarbons. The Canadians lean back and don’t want NATO engagement; the Norwegians lean forward and want a great deal of NATO in the High North. The U.S. position tends to lie somewhere in between these two views. We should lead NATO to engage more directly and realistically, with exercises, surveillance, overflight, and training in the Arctic Ocean. Enhance the dialogue with Russia. The reality is that Russia has the most at stake of any nation in the Arctic, and by working with the Russians we can ensure that the region becomes a zone of cooperation—not of competition or, even worse, actual conflict. Despite our disagreements in other areas, we need to maintain the conversation with Russia about the direction of the High North. Russia is building an operations center focused on the Arctic. We should explore how we could be part of that in some cooperative way, sharing our engagement with our Canadian friends and allies, as well as other NATO allies. In the dialogue with Russia, much of the conversation will focus on commercial and navigational issues. Of note, some scientists are predicting a truly “blue north”—one that has water, not ice, during much of the year—by 2030. Shipping, oil and gas, tourism, science, and many other commercial interests will dominate the agenda over time. Our Arctic czar should spend time with the private sector to fully understand the issues and find linkages with public sector efforts, which can then be translated into a dialogue with the Russians. Take an interagency approach. U.S. interests in the High North will cut across cabinet departments—Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, Coast Guard, Department of the Interior—as well as agencies such as EPA, NOAA, and so on. Working hard to make sure that the entire U.S. government is represented will be important. This concept is of course central to the DNA of a Coast Guard officer, making the choice of a retired four-star admiral and Coast Guard commandant sensible—the “Coasties” work with many other organizations and entities within the big tent of the Department of Homeland Security, such as the DEA, Customs, Fisheries, and so forth, and thus are very comfortable in an interagency environment. In a metaphorical sense, it is worth thinking about Arctic policy in the same way a United States submarine captain approaches the dangerous navigational task of breaking through the ice with his warship—something our attack submarines do with regularity as they patrol the northern seas. Like our Arctic policy, broaching a submarine through polar ice requires careful navigation, delicate planning, and determination. Sailing the Arctic Ocean is different from sailing any other body of water in the world, and full of dangerous and unique challenges. Any sea captain planning an Arctic voyage will have spent a great deal of time studying the waters, learning about ice and the damage it can do, and seeking advice and counsel from others about the specific difficulties of the intense cold, the crushing ice, the brilliant lights of summer and the deep dark of the winter nights. Any U.S. Navy sailor who has gone above the Arctic Circle is awarded a certificate as a Blue Nose sailor. But very few even of the limited number of Blue Nose sailors have done the most challenging maneuver of all: breaking through the icepack itself in a submarine and bursting to the surface at the North Pole. Each U.S. Navy submarine that has performed this feat recognizes the significant danger imposed on the boat by the dangling ice keels, large tongues of ice hanging down from the ice pack itself. Avoiding these is crucial, as is understanding the precise thickness of the ice pack at the proposed point of surfacing. The entire maneuver is controlled carefully by the submarine’s captain himself and uses a detailed checklist with two-man control over each step of the standard operating procedure or SOP. Sonar—a pinging of sound through the water that measures distance by listening to the reverberation back—is used to find a flat spot, and the delicate controls of the submarine are used to maneuver the boat just below the surface of the ice. Throughout most of the cold war, most of our boats had hardened sails (the towerlike structure on the top of the boat) for this operation, but even given the hardening, it remains imperative to lower all masts and antennae while situating the boat below just the right patch of “clean” and hopefully thin ice. To make a cheap pun, finding the thin ice feels like “walking on thin ice” above—you know that a wrong step could be disastrous. Once the thinnest ice patch is located and the ship is positioned beneath it, air is then blown into the ballast tanks, creating the reserve buoyancy and the essential upward thrusting energy needed to break through the ice. Like most submerged operations, this one is quiet and nearly silent throughout most of the boat. But in the conning space—the underwater part of the submarine where all maneuvering is conducted while the boat is submerged—and of course in sonar control, the crunching sound of the ice on the hull is discernible—a low, grinding, pulsing sound until the final breaking of the ice layer. Once the boat has broken through, the crew can ascend the tower and carefully open the clamshells on the sail of the submarine and check the full status of the hull of the boat as it hangs just through the ice on the surface. Sailors wearing special cold weather exposure suits are initially tethered to the boat as the hull above the ice is checked for damage. Eventually, the goal is to get every one of the hundred or so sailors over the side to walk on the ice, snap pictures, and safely avoid polar bears—which amble right up to the hull. There are many places in the world a captain can take his or her ship, but only a submarine can sail through the pure, cold water of the Arctic Ocean, submerge under ancient ice, and ultimately crash its sail up to the sky at the top of the world. There is a real danger of militarizing the High North. We cannot afford to stumble back into a new (and colder) cold war. There are essentially three choices for the Arctic: a zone of cooperation (best), a zone of competition (probable), and a zone of real conflict (possible but less likely). At the moment, with Russian versus U.S. and NATO relations at a post–cold war low, I would bet on a deepening zone of competition. We will see Russia aggressively build out its military presence. In one sense, this is quite natural: as the ice “barrier” that protected that northern coast melts, the natural Russian concern about its borders (the result of many bad experiences over the centuries) kicks in and we will see more military activity. This will quickly become a self- fulfilling prophecy as the United States and the other NATO countries respond. What can break the cycle? As discussed above, it will require a multifaceted approach: international (with the Arctic Council as the primary vehicle), interagency (getting the Department of Homeland Security, which includes the Coast Guard, to work with the departments of Defense and State), and private- public cooperation. We need all three. A good example of the latter would be building emergency response platforms in the High North. The question is whether the United States can provide international, interagency, and private-public leadership in the Arctic, especially with regard to sustainable infrastructure development in the Arctic Ocean. Given our responsibilities, are we prepared to respond to disasters and fully participate in the High North—with search and rescue capability, environmental disaster mitigation, scientific diplomacy, and other activities? Unlike centuries past, when sea ice covered the north polar region perennially, today there is navigable open water from the Bering Strait to the Barents Sea during the summer. This increasing access to rich resources is awakening all flavors of human activities and associated societal responses, not just from the Arctic states but from our entire world. This leads directly to the hot-button topic of energy exploration, development, and production in the Arctic Ocean. Oceanic travel across the top of the earth cuts a third off the distance between Europe and Asia, compared with transits through the Panama or Suez canals. What are the implications for new trade routes or trading patterns, which historically have changed the balance of power among nations? How will we use the Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage, or Transpolar Sea Route into the future? Vast fishery enterprises are seeking to feed a hungry world, preparing to jump into areas of the Arctic high seas where marine living resources are unregulated beyond sovereign jurisdictions. Can nations collectively demonstrate shared stewardship and commercial restraint to ensure the lasting vitality of Arctic marine ecosystems? Wrapped up in charged dialogues about climate, atmospheric temperatures over the Arctic are rising twice as fast as those in the rest of the earth. Can we turn down the vitriol to appreciate that we are just in our infancy to address climate and other planetary-scale impacts that require coordination among all nations? So as we conclude this look at the Arctic, where does all this leave us in this vast northern sea? Can we conceive and build sustainable infrastructure in the Arctic Ocean that will resonate with utility and hope, not just for the region but globally? In this quest, it is important to recognize that economic prosperity, environmental protection, social equity, and societal welfare are all necessary. We have a responsibility to act in the interests of present generations as well as future generations. Moreover, in the Arctic Ocean as elsewhere on earth, we have a shared struggle to balance national interests and common interests. The challenge for the United States and the other Arctic states, with the central involvement of the Arctic indigenous peoples and the effective engagement of non-Arctic states, is responding in a balanced manner to the opportunities as well as the risks from the opening of the Arctic Ocean. • • • MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO, in 1879, the United States was seized with “Arctic fever” tied to the later disproved notion of a temperate land zone in the center of the North Pole—essentially a “land rush” that never materialized. A U.S. Navy expedition was launched onboard the doomed USS Jeannette, which voyaged into the Arctic “carrying ‘the aspirations of a young republic burning to become a world power.’” It became icebound and was crushed, stranding the crew as winter approached. As masterfully depicted in Hampton Sides’s In the Kingdom of Ice, most of the brave sailors died trying to bring the United States into the High North. We have largely stayed on the sidelines since then in this vital geopolitical part of the world. But with the appointment of an Arctic Czar, or what I like to call an “Ice King,” and an increased focus on the High North, we must again assert our engagement in a challenging but critical part of the globe. Broadly speaking, the United States is better positioned to take a significant role in the Arctic Ocean than was the case a decade ago, despite shortfalls in leadership attention, interagency cooperation, icebreakers, and other specialized equipment and appropriate infrastructure and installations. The question is whether in this period of constraining resources for the United States there will be sufficient long-term vision to make the key investments necessary. Will agencies of government invest in training personnel to understand and plan for an Arctic Ocean future for the United States? Will our Defense and Homeland Security departments follow through on the road maps they have generated over the past several years? Will presidential leadership go beyond photo-op travel and renaming mountains in honor of indigenous peoples, and truly grapple with both the promise and the peril of the High North? William Seward had the vision required to ensure an Arctic future for his nation. It was said of him during his lifetime that he was “one of those spirits who sometimes will go ahead of public opinion instead of tamely following its footprints.” Let us hope we can sail into the Arctic with his spirit as a guide. 8. THE OUTLAW SEA OCEANS AS CRIME SCENES Piracy was a problem in every region from the Americas to Europe and Asia. Map by Emery Molyneux and Edward Wright, 1599. Although the locus of this challenge has shifted to a new region, piracy is still a scourge in our modern world. Visit http://bit.ly/2oUprUM for a larger version of this map. Having looked at each of the world’s major bodies of water essentially in isolation, we need as well to examine the entirety of the global ocean system. As I mentioned at the outset, the British Royal Navy, perhaps the first truly worldwide force capable of projecting power anywhere on the face of the earth, put it best: The Sea is One, meaning that no matter how large or small a given body of water is upon the oceans, in the end it is connected and a part of the single system. And it is a busy system indeed. On any given day, it is impossible to accurately measure the number of surface ships at sea, but we can approximate the number of ships generally. By reading through a variety of sources (including Clarksons, the “bible” of international shipping), it is possible to estimate that there are between fifty and sixty thousand large commercial ships —bulk carriers, cargo ships, tankers, container ships, chemical ships, passenger and roll-on/roll-off ships, and liquefied natural gas tankers active throughout the world. These are the ships that I passed thousands of times in my years as a warship captain. The interactions between the world’s warships (perhaps five thousand, including many very small coast guard vessels) are generally quite professional. What I felt over the forty years of my career was the way the oceans became more and more full; by some estimates there are four to six times more ships plying the world’s oceans than there were some thirty years ago. If you look at a map of the world from space with the high-density shipping lanes marked in red, orange, and yellow, the strategic highways and choke points are quite clear—red belts through the South China Sea, the Mediterranean, clusters around the Suez and Panama canals, long strips around the bottom of Africa, arrows of red in and out of the Arabian Gulf and through the Strait of Malacca. It is a vast and busy universe in which tens of thousands of vessels of all descriptions are under way at any given moment. The good news is that over the past three thousand years since man began to explore the world’s oceans, we have learned a great deal. Mankind has developed extraordinary technology that allows us to accurately map every body of water, to plunge to the bottom of the sea, to track fish, birds, and mammals that inhabit it, to monitor and navigate the thousands of ships that ply it, and to take highly precise measurements of everything about the waters of the world: temperature, acidity, alkalinity, salinity, and on and on. But despite the fact that we are incredibly informed about the oceans in many ways, there are still vast trenches of the oceans that are unexplored, and there remains much we do not know, especially about how the oceans function as a coherent system. In a certain sense we have incredible knowledge of the oceans, but little wisdom about them. Nowhere is this more clearly true than when we look at the broad ocean challenges that exist today. Some have called the oceans “the biggest crime scene in the world,” and others have referred to them as “the outlaw sea.” Sadly, both of these statements are in many ways quite true; and worst of all, we do not have real granularity in our knowledge of what transpires on the oceans in two potentially very destructive zones: criminal activity and environmental damage. • • • IN TERMS OF CRIME COMMITTED on the oceans, there are many sources, but to name a few that are of particular concern: piracy, a scourge that has been part of the oceans since the very beginning of man’s intersection with the sea; narcotics smuggling, an enormous business that moves heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines, and other illicit substances on a huge global delivery network with substantial maritime pathways; illegal dumping of toxic substances, which of course bleeds directly into the environmental challenges we will address below; weapons smuggling, which involves moving all manner of lethal equipment from high-end ballistic missiles to small but deadly handguns; illegal fishing, a business that is destroying the world’s fish stocks rapidly; and smuggling of contraband, from the level of nuisance shipping of untaxed cigarettes to the movement of big sums of paper money (both counterfeit and valid). Below we will look specifically at piracy as a case study of the criminal activity on the oceans, and examine the ways in which global security forces, the shipping industry, the insurance industry, and international organizations have tried to address the piracy challenge. There are many lessons learned that can be applied to other criminal activities on the outlaw sea. We will also look quite specifically at the world of fishing, where much abuse of the law occurs that thus far has seen relatively little effective mitigation by the international community. The other significant challenge to the global ocean, of course, is the environment. Here we see extensive damage that has many sources: global warming that is helping melt the polar ice caps and contributing to the rise of the ocean’s sea levels; rising acidification in many parts of the oceans, which is highly detrimental to various levels in the global oceanic food chain; warming of the oceans, which changes migratory patterns and again damages fragile ecosystems; construction damage to delicate coral reefs; pollution that is pumped directly into the oceans either deliberately or accidentally from land or sea; hydrocarbon recovery (both oil and natural gas), which has both deliberate and accidental effects on sea life and coastal ecosystems; higher levels of UV and other forms of radiation; mineral recovery, which will be exacerbated over time by the desire to mine the deep seabed for cobalt, copper, nickel, magnesium, and rare earths; and the simple act of humans populating the coastal regions of the world and inserting large urban centers adjacent to the oceans. When these are taken together, the damage to the global maritime environment may be the biggest threat we face as a species. In terms of impact on the world’s oceans, the three biggest topics that completely transcend not only national boundaries, but also the artificial boundaries between various seas and oceans, are piracy, fishing, and the environment. They are intertwined, and each merits a significant look. PIRACY I must admit that as I prepared to take up my duties as the NATO commander in 2009, I did not initially put piracy at the top of my list of worries. Afghanistan, the Balkans, Syria, Russia, and Libya looked like the places that would absorb the lion’s share of my energy and attention. But as I began to fully comprehend the extent of the piracy challenges in East Africa—centered mostly on the waters off Somalia—it became clear that I would be doing something very traditional for a Navy admiral: chasing pirates. Certainly piracy has been a part of the maritime landscape for more than three thousand years, with reports of early piracy taking place in the waters of the Mediterranean in the times of the ancient Greeks by the “sea people,” as well as parts of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific. Julius Caesar was captured and held captive briefly by Sicilian pirates. Much of Viking culture was built on the norms of maritime piracy launched both from and on the sea. Over the centuries, pirate cultures have been very entrenched in a variety of locations, notably North Africa under the so-called Barbary pirates in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Caribbean in the “golden age of piracy” in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and more or less continually in the Strait of Malacca and South China Sea. While there was a general lull in piracy in the post–World War II period, by the latter part of the twentieth century it had returned in force in a variety of areas around the globe and continues to the present. Notable zones of pirate activity around the world today include the waters of the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea off the northeast coast of Africa, the Gulf of Guinea on the central west coast of Africa, the Strait of Malacca between the Pacific and Indian oceans, and to a lesser degree, in the littoral waters of the South China Sea and Caribbean. The acts of piracy range from small-scale attacks on private yachts to major takeovers of massive international tankers, with the objective of holding the ships and crews for ransom. A variety of observers estimate the cost to the global transportation network caused by piratical activity to be between $15 billion and $20 billion. This includes the cost of increased insurance premiums, ransoms, legal fees, embedded security guards on the ships, inefficient routing to avoid highly pirated zones, additional lookouts, technology and equipment added to ships to prevent successful pirate attacks (e.g., concertina wire and other physical barriers, firefighting water flushing systems on the sides of the ship), and national expenses in sending warships and operational staffs to oversee global counterpiracy operations. As I took over the job of Supreme Allied Commander at NATO, I reflected on the slightly delicious irony of the need for the military operational leader at NATO to spend a serious chunk of his time learning about piracy, of all things. Many observers had opined that choosing an admiral as the sixteenth Supreme Allied Commander was a mistake—after all, there had been a long, unbroken chain of fifteen prior generals, going back to the first Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight Eisenhower. The concerns of the alliance had always focused on ground combat and high-tech aviation, with a much smaller level of attention paid to things maritime. Indeed, throughout my own career up to that point, I had not paid a great deal of attention to piracy. But finally, I thought, I am going to have a chance to chase some pirates, a mission near and dear to a seagoing officer’s heart. The reason NATO became interested in the piracy mission off Somalia was simple: money. It was beginning to have a very high impact on European companies and indeed on the cost of goods flowing through the East African and North Arabian Sea waters. Additionally, it was increasingly clear that the local terrorist group, Al Shabaab, was beginning to “tax” the Somali pirates and use the funding to undertake acts of violent extremism not only in Somalia but in neighboring countries as well. And we could see flickers of connection between Al Shabaab and Al Qaeda. Indeed, the African group has now pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State. So these international terrorist linkages were of legitimate concern. The roots of Somali piracy lie in a variety of factors. First is the simple difficulty of making a living in any legitimate fashion in Northeast Africa, which has suffered decades of civil war, strife, and depredation. When young, unemployed men find a relatively lucrative (although very dangerous) way to make a living, they are easily recruited. Second, the traditional source of income for many who turned to piracy had been fishing. Due to overfishing and ecological damage in the immediate waters, the ability to make a living fishing had diminished in the latter part of the twentieth century. An excellent explanation of all of this from the point of view of the Somalis (who have some legitimate grievances against the big shipping and industrial companies) can be found in Jay Bahadur’s highly readable book The Pirates of Somalia. Third, the local water conditions are conducive to pirate activity. Before the real ramp-up in pirate activity, the normal shipping route was quite close to the coast of Somalia as well-laden commercial ships sailed to and from the Suez Canal. The water conditions are calm enough to permit small-boat assaults on the vastly larger commercial ships. And finally, the shipping companies themselves were largely complacent, not having experienced a high level of attacks in recent decades. By 2009, the piracy situation was at a level demanding international intervention. As I came into office, the number of attacks was rising dramatically, peaking in 2009–10 at more than three hundred. Nearly twenty major ships were being held hostage and worse, more than a hundred mariners with them. While there was relatively little fatal violence, the insurance rates were rising, innocent sailors were held in execrable conditions (usually confined to a small space in a sweltering hulk of a ship anchored in an inlet on the Somali coast), and the flow of resources to local terrorists was rising. Clearly more needed to be done. A combined maritime force was increased in the local waters, consisting of warships (typically frigates, destroyers, and light cruisers) from the twenty-eight nations of NATO, the European Union, and a loose coalition of Gulf State navies assembled by the United States. Additionally, a very diverse group of nations decided to pitch in, revulsion of piracy being something virtually every nation can agree upon. This led to the deployment of ships from nations that do not normally cooperate with NATO: Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and—quite surprisingly—even Iran. Indeed, this global maritime coalition became an example of what the international community could accomplish if it chose to work together. I spent a great deal of time working the diplomatic aspects of the coalition, visiting various capitals. It was relatively easy work given the overarching view that the global commons needed policing against piracy and that it was in everyone’s interest to participate. In particular, this became a real zone of cooperation between NATO and Russia that paid dividends in everything from sharing maritime tactics to exchanging communication devices to facilitate connectivity at sea between our forces—hardly something that is the norm in terms of working with Russia pretty much everywhere else. The effort to overcome piracy in East Africa has been relatively successful: by 2013, as I concluded my service as Supreme Allied Commander, attacks were down significantly and they remain so today. The success is the result of a combination of several key factors. First, the presence of warships has been vital. A frigate or a destroyer with an embarked helicopter or two can cover thousands of square miles of territory and brings the ability to instantly overcome armed pirates, sink their vessels, apprehend them, and incarcerate them (at least temporarily) at sea. They also clearly represent the international community. Over my four years as NATO commander we typically had three to five NATO vessels on station, matched with a similar number for the European Union. Given that the rest of the informal coalition against international piracy also had three to five ships, this became a substantial force. However, despite the presence of those warships, we were often a step behind the pirates. This was because of the sheer size of the operational area off the coast of Northeast Africa, a space roughly the size of Europe. When people would question why we couldn’t catch all the pirates, I would point out that even fifteen warships would be like fifteen police cars trying to cover all of western Europe. We also supplemented the ships with long-range maritime patrol aircraft. These heavy, wide-bodied, four-engine aircraft lumbered over vast amounts of territory and could remain airborne for eight to twelve hours, operating from bases in Oman, on islands in the Indian Ocean, or from the Horn of Africa. Used throughout the cold war for antisubmarine patrols, these airplanes have the ability to swoop down to the very surface of the ocean, use radar from higher altitude to scan the ocean surface, and provide command and control to helicopters or ships engaged in searching for the pirates. The United States operated P-3 Orion aircraft and the British the comparable Nimrods, and several other allies had similarly equipped planes. Additionally, for overall command of the operation from the air, NATO had available the massive Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) E-3 plane, a flying village with extensive radar, communication, and well-trained personnel. These were under my direct command as the NATO Supreme Commander for global operations, and I deployed them on the counterpiracy mission as well. Tactically, we decided to use an old-school solution: convoys. Rather than letting each of the fifty thousand tankers and commercial ships that transit the area over the course of a year operate on their own, we insisted that for their own protection they be herded into convoys that could operate together. While we did not have enough ships to provide each convoy with an escort, we were often able to keep a warship sufficiently close to each of the patrols to respond to and ward off the pirates. We also debated whether to go ashore and attack the pirate havens, most of which were well known to us, but we were unable to develop the political consensus for doing so given the chances of collateral damage and the difficulty in absolutely identifying the pirates ashore—because their boats and equipment could look a lot like a typical small fishing skiff or a dhow used for legitimate commerce. There was also the lack of a national government with which we could coordinate such onshore action. So much of our tactical execution was done at sea on international waters, where international law gave every nation the authority to respond to piracy. The hardest part of the operation was actually what occurred after we caught a pirate, which we did with increasing frequency. These were young men, ethnically Somalis, most addicted to a mild narcotic called khat that has been chewed in the area for centuries. They have no papers, don’t self-identify with a particular functioning government, and thus we had no one to whom we could turn them over for prosecution. Naturally the minute we closed in on them, they would also throw overboard their scaling ladder and guns, so when we boarded their small vessels we would find “innocent fishermen” and have little evidence of their wrongdoing in many cases (unless we had caught them in the act and filmed them on video camera, of course). Eventually several of the local governments proved willing to take them on for trial and conviction, notably Kenya. The pirates were lucky that we couldn’t fall back on the centuries-old punishment for such crimes and string them up from a yardarm. While several of the nations in the coalition might have been actually willing to do so, we followed normal mores of Western judicial process throughout the time I was engaged in the exercise. In addition to the military instruments, both surface and airborne, the shipping industry itself took on the challenge of dealing with the pirates. Initially, this effort focused on routing and convoying, essentially charging captains to work closely with one another at sea and participate in our convoying mechanisms. They also became much better over time checking into the operational centers we established (in the Arabian Gulf and other littoral areas) over radio when they entered and exited the area. The ships gradually worked harder at sharing observations of pirate activity, and also exchanged ideas for warding them off. This included using the speed and size of the commercial ships; putting up various reasonable effective barriers on the sides of the ships, including barbed wire; tactics to counter a boarding operation, including use of fire hoses at full blast; nonlethal devices such as sonic blast and shock mechanisms; and simply manning the deck and throwing the ladders back into the sea when the pirates attempted to grapple on. The problem with all of those measures is that they required the merchant crews to do something for which they were neither trained nor particularly well oriented. Mariners today are used to very small crews, good meals, and creature comforts; the idea of fighting pirates does not come easily. Instead, many of the shipping owners developed plans for the mariners to retreat to a citadel inside the ship and radio from there for help. The film Captain Phillips about the taking of the Maersk Alabama by Somali pirates and the subsequent rescue of the hostage captain provides a vivid and accurate portrayal of a ship takedown and one way the scenario could play out. What ultimately changed the dynamic altogether and has largely resulted in the dramatic reduction of piracy on the east coast of Africa was the decision by the shipping companies to put security teams on board. This was a new wrinkle in the millennia-old fight against pirates. Initially, the shipping companies wanted no part of this approach due to liability concerns. They were justifiably concerned that any mercenary team they hired might kill an innocent fisherman or other mariner at sea. This actually happened, by the way, and it was not even mercenaries who made the crucial mistake—a well-meaning Italian marine security team on an Italian-flagged vessel managed to shoot and kill two Indian fishermen in 2012. The case occurred twenty miles off the coast of Kerala, India —on the high seas but well within India’s exclusive economic zone (two hundred nautical miles) and is still in litigation, with potentially a significant prison sentence awaiting the adjudication in an Indian court. Despite legitimate concerns over the potential for incidents like this, shipping companies have finally turned to mercenary firms for protection. This has led to the embarkation of two to six personnel from private contractors, normally well armed and reasonably well trained (at least in the use of the firearms). The host of problems raised by this include how to provide weapons and ammunition, where to base such groups, how they are trained and certified, and what the rules of engagement are for them. Because their activities occur largely on the high seas beyond the jurisdiction of any one nation, this has become a complicated branch of international law. There is a sort of Mad Max quality to these forces, despite the efforts of the contractors to train and certify them. While they are not exactly rogue warriors, their presence can make more traditional military sailors nervous, much as police in a city don’t like to see armed bodyguards or armed mall guards for that matter. Nonetheless, the results have been striking: no ship embarking an armed security detail has ever been successfully hijacked. This is because the defending team has such a huge advantage in the height of the big tankers and also because the pirates are very lightly armed, untrained themselves, and quite vulnerable during the actual act of boarding. Knowing all of this, the pirates will normally simply sheer off when confronted with consistent fire from a potential victim. Finally, in addition to national military action and the good work of the industry, there has been additional work ashore by the international community. Let’s face it—we are not going to solve piracy solely out at sea. It will require addressing the conditions ashore that lead young men to take up a dangerous and chaotic life. We also need deterrence in the form of local coast guard and police, and a judicial system with real teeth in it. Much of this hard nation building in Somalia has been undertaken by the European Union, and the results—while mixed—are somewhat encouraging. The nascent governmental structures in Somalia, Somaliland, and Puntland—the three “national entities” on the eastern part of the Horn of Africa—are showing increasing capability to respond to piratical acts from the shore side, receive and try pirates, and incarcerate them. So the good news is that in the pirate waters off the coast of Somalia, there has been a dramatic reduction in successful piracy. But as is so often the case in fighting transnational threats (terrorism, narcotics, human slavery, smuggling), when the international community is able to address it in a given area, it often pops up in another. So it is with piracy, which is showing a great deal of vitality on the other side of Africa in the Gulf of Guinea. I remember sailing into the Gulf of Guinea on a short cruise as a splinter off operations in the Mediterranean. It is a huge body of water, with many littoral deltas converging as the rivers originating in West Africa run down into the sea, including most notably the Niger and the Volta. In those days thirty years ago, it was a sleepy part of the world. No more, as it has become one of the largest oil and gas hot spots in the world, with much onshore and offshore production in sight. A long history of outlaw operations has coupled with the rise of an Islamic radical group, Boko Haram (which means literally “the Western way is forbidden”). Together, these twin forces are driving up the incidents of piracy to the degree that a variety of Western nations are looking at “getting the band back together” and mounting a mission on the west coast of Africa similar to the one we did several years ago on the east coast. The good news is that there are more capable coast guards, better police and military ground forces, and at least existent courts and judicial systems, albeit highly corrupt and vulnerable to bribes and outside influencers. It seems likely that the next chapter in suppressing serious piracy will take place in the Gulf of Guinea, which looks and often functions like a throwback to the days of Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness—chaotic, dangerous, and fully in need of a restoration of order. In the end, this particular problem of the outlaw sea will not be solved on the seas themselves, but will require more stability ashore, honest policing, fair courts, legal incarceration, fused intelligence, and above all the “long game” of jobs and education to keep potential pirates from following Johnny Depp’s path. Globally, the number of piracy incidents is roughly flat over the past couple of years, with the caveat that this has always been a relatively underreported phenomenon, especially on the east and west coasts of Africa. The best overall source of information remains the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery Against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP), which is a loosely knit group of nations that work together to fight piracy specifically off the Horn of Africa. The directorate also keeps an eye on global trends, and as the piracy meter creeps up on the African west coast, it is likely we will hear from them. As with the other aspects of crime at sea, the key will be cooperative engagement. Hunting pirates is a team sport indeed. FISHING A second major challenge to the legal regimes of the oceans involves fishing. Given the size of the world’s oceans, which cover 70 percent of the earth’s surface and reach depths of more than seven miles, it stands to reason that there are massive stocks of fish. Innocent of all knowledge of territory or international agreement, they are the subject of enormous global activity, valued at well over $225 billion. Europe, the United States, and Japan all have big and growing appetites for fish, as does China—the largest exporter of fish in the world. It is worth noting that this consumption at the industrial scale is largely centered in the developed world, which imports three quarters of the total value of all fish produced. There is significant downward pressure on fish stocks through overfishing, much of it in violation of nations’ exclusive economic zones, international agreements and conventions, and even customary historical fishing grounds. One recent study hypothesized that more than 60 percent of all fish stocks worldwide require “rebuilding,” and the literature is replete with warnings of a global fishing collapse. This is borne out by statistics that show a sharp rise in fish caught “in the wild” (as opposed to obtained from fish farms) from the 1950s to the early 1990s, but essentially no growth since then. From a nonfishing mariner’s perspective, there are parts of the world where it is nearly impossible to sail without becoming encumbered with fishing fleets. In my career, the worst of this could be found in East Asia, where massive Chinese, Vietnamese, and Filipino fishing boats were endlessly plying their craft in the littorals of the South China Sea. As we would approach the Philippine Islands in the 1980s, you could smell the fishing fleets—a mixture of gasoline, wood smoke, and the tang of the fish themselves—from miles out to sea when the wind was right. Often operating with small, dim lights, they were highly vulnerable to our massive, 9,000-ton destroyers and cruisers moving at speed through the waters of the fishing grounds. Since the fishing boats were almost entirely made of wood, they would not “paint” clearly on our surface radars, and we would often station additional lookouts with binoculars on the forecastle to try to pick them out of the hazy horizon. Fishery management is a big industry unto itself, with many sincere efforts made to regulate this global trade. Since the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was essentially ratified worldwide, nations have worked very hard to control the 200-mile exclusive economic zone that provides the legal authority and the concomitant responsibility to manage fish stocks within those waters by each nation. Beyond the EEZ, fishing is regulated by a series of international treaties—by some counts more than seventy in total. The treaties generally address fish, but also include agreements about turtles, seals, polar bears, dolphins, and other species. Most of the treaties have a designated secretariat (a small administrative organization), but little real means of enforcement. Herein lie the problems, and the perception of an “outlaw sea.” Despite well-meaning efforts, most observers believe that nearly 90 percent of all fish stocks are “fully exploited, over-exploited, depleted, or recovering from depletion”* Many are declining rapidly, such as tuna—down 50 percent from peak stocks. Indeed, the “oceans are cleared at twice the rate of forests” on land, a chilling prospect. There are several discrete problems with fishing that are causing the decline in fish stocks, each worth examining quickly. The first is simply our inability to provide accurate measurement metrics. While we can today track total biomass reasonably well (when it is reported, and let’s understand that there is a great deal of underreporting happening on the outlaw sea), we are not able to accurately measure the size and level of reproductive capability of fish that are caught. As Professor Bill Moomaw has said, “the artificial truncation” of portions of the fish population over time destroys the productivity of the populations (Moomaw and Blankenship, 14). It is also worth noting that because nets tend to catch the biggest fish, the bias of the catch is to remove the larger members of the species, with obviously detrimental effect over decades. The most blatantly obvious reason for declining fish stocks is simply overfishing. This occurs simply because of greed and economic necessity for poorer fishermen, as well as a lack of concern for the long-term consequences by the big industrial operations. As a seagoing officer, I would often come upon big fishing operations, including the lighter (but still large) long-line fishing platforms, as well as the big net seining operators. There would often be big fish- processing plants located in the same area (Russia and China in particular operate such plants), which were capable of rapidly processing catches and avoiding the probing eyes of inspectors. The key practice contributing to overfishing is destructive fishing practices such as bottom trawling, which not only affects the fish but can be very damaging to the ocean floor as well. There is also the unfortunate tendency of governments to turn a blind eye to relatively local fishing due to the political impact in the sovereign nation, as well as reluctance to avoid the cost, expense, and inconvenience of an inspection regime (a coast guard) and an attendant court system to rule on charges of overfishing. This tends to go under the header of illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing, or IUU. Such IUU activities by some measures account for a third of all fish catches, or billions of dollars. Why do we let this happen? As Admiral Hyman Rickover of the U.S. Navy said when asked why he decided to stop naming submarines after fish, breaking a decades-long tradition: “Fish don’t vote.” Until fish begin voting, unfortunately, it seems unlikely that there will be sufficient political pressure generated to right the ship of overfishing. Another problem that generates overfishing is one that is quite controllable by governments: the application of subsidies. Governmental monies sometimes directly support the kinds of problems outlined above as national leaders attempt to help local economies. In particular, such subsidies result in the overbuilding of fishing fleets. Some observers believe that nearly $20 billion annually flows to the fishing industry, encouraging the continuation of fishing long after stocks are depleted beyond the point at which such activity remains economically viable. Shockingly, one out of every four fish (i.e., 25 percent of the world catch) is categorized as “bycatch.” This is simply “accidentally” bringing aboard fish and other seagoing species that are not part of the target catch. When vessels use huge, industrial-level trawls—especially when dragged along the seabed—the collateral damage is extreme. The international community has been utterly ineffective in managing this. I think back to my own experience in the Gulf of Mexico watching shrimp boats bring in their big catches with hundreds of sea turtles, ocean fish, and even marine mammals—once you understand the environmentally destructive power of this kind of bycatch, it is hard to watch from the bridge of your warship. Tied to this is a growing trend in using brutally destructive fishing techniques such as explosives and cyanide, which pose a threat not only to the orderly management of fishing but to delicate coral reefs as well. Think of the oceans as a kind of war zone, in which there are daily atrocities, horrifying collateral damage, and no rule of law. There is an international political component to this, of course: flags of convenience. This is the long-standing practice whereby commercial operators “flag” or register their ships (the way you register a car) in a country that provides, shall we say, a flexible level of enforcement. Not unlike offshore bank accounts, this is merely a means to avoid accountability in the fishing world (and, of course, more broadly in all commercial shipping). In addition to seeking lower standards of enforcement on various practices (fishing, pollution, etc.), shippers also try to find the lowest-priced option. Today somewhere between one thousand and two thousand fishing ships fly a flag of convenience. Many of these are from small Caribbean nations, including Belize (the old British Honduras in Central America), Honduras, and Panama (famous for flags of convenience). The nations profit from the registration fees, and it makes life hard for mariners generally and enforcement personnel (like coast guards) because it is difficult to place effective sanctions on violators—the flag of convenience nation has no real incentive to punish offenders and often has less sophisticated court systems. Indeed, if you look broadly at global shipping, about 55 percent of all ships (fishing, tankers, cargo, passenger, and so on) fly a flag of convenience, and 40 percent are under three nations: Panama, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. As a naval officer, when I saw those three flags I knew there was going to be a very difficult negotiation if I wanted to send over a boarding party to check for terrorists, drugs, cash, or anything else moving illegally on the high seas. Taken together, this represents a steady decline in the productivity of the oceans, and the long-range implications for the world’s fishing industry are concerning. Unless there is a great deal more regulation and scientific engagement—by private companies, nations, and international organizations— we should fear for the integrity and level of protein we can expect to draw from the sea going forward. After all, in today’s world, more than a billion people rely on fish for the protein in their diet, and roughly the same number work on or in the oceans of the world—this despite concerns that fish stocks may have declined as much as 50 percent since the 1970s according to some estimates. Finally, we should recognize the potential geopolitical tension over fishing that is rising worldwide. Elements of the massive Chinese fishing fleet, for example, consisting of thousands of vessels, have been repeatedly apprehended conducting illegal fishing operations. Indonesia alone has caught and destroyed (by explosion) more than a dozen fishing vessels; Australia has a long record of such apprehensions, as does South Korea. All of this exacerbates the tensions in East Asia and the western Pacific—already one of the most volatile regions of the world. ENVIRONMENT Piracy and fishing are sadly very significant sources of illegal activity at sea. But the biggest act of criminal behavior being practiced on the high seas is the willful and preventable damage to the environment that goes on every day. Through the destruction of the maritime world, we are literally watching future generations robbed of their birthright. This is stealing from us all, until and unless we can work coherently together to preserve the riches of the sea for mankind’s future. This was a guiding premise in the negotiation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea three decades ago, but sadly the treaty has not had a sufficient effect on the damage that is unfolding before our eyes. When I arrived at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy on the campus of Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts, in the fall of 1981, I was just completing five years at sea on a destroyer and an aircraft carrier. Beginning with my graduation from Annapolis (where we never studied or thought about the environment in any of my classes), I reported to my ships and blithely watched our engineers pump dirty bilgewater, full of black oil, over the side with impunity. We had dumped completely uninspected garbage into the oceans within visual distance of the coasts, and filled the oceans with plastic, toxins, medical waste, slightly radioactive materials, and all manner of utterly unsafe products. I certainly didn’t think of myself as a global lawbreaker; everything I just mentioned was “normal underway operations.” If I thought about it at all, I would have reflected that the oceans are a huge place, they seem to be able to regenerate themselves, and nothing we were doing was anything other than “the way we always did it.” In my time at the Fletcher School in the mid-1980s, I began to learn about the science, policy, and physical reality of the oceans in ways I never had as a seagoing officer. Sometimes you have to step back from something you love—in this case my seagoing professional life—to really understand it, and especially to be able to judge where it is inflicting harm despite holding no malign intentions. I would have self-identified in those days (as I do today) as someone who “loves and follows the sea.” But it took me two years of intensive study and the production of a long dissertation to achieve a PhD in international law with a focus on the Law of the Sea treaty. Climate change is very real and having increasingly evident effects on the oceans, beginning with the most obvious impact from global warming: sea temperature. As nearly all (more than 90 percent) of the extra heat generated by mankind eventually ends up affecting the oceans, it should be no surprise that temperatures are rising both at the surface and at great depth. There are increases in temperature felt as deep as nearly ten thousand feet, and in parts of the oceans the temperature rise is close to a full degree Fahrenheit. While this does not sound especially significant, it has a gradual but inexorable effect on the existence of life in the sea, and already the migratory patterns of many species are under pressure. There is movement toward the poles, which has knock-on effects, especially on fishing. Rising temperatures in the oceans also affect ocean currents. There is a complex interplay between salinity, wind, currents, and the resultant upwelling of nutrients from the deep ocean that sustain many of the traditional fishing grounds around the globe. If there is a greater differential between the surface temperature and that of the deeper waters, these upwelling currents are diminished, and it negatively affects ocean life. Additionally, as salinity decreases near melting zones of ice (nearer to the poles), there will be rising levels of acidification and a depletion of ozone—further exacerbating environmental damage. While such rising temperatures are of concern, it is sea level rise that has potentially the greatest effect on human life over time. The rise in sea level is related to the melting of the polar ice caps and the increase of water volume in the oceans. The numbers are increasingly alarming, and the rate of rise is accelerating, with some observers saying that sea levels are rising twice as fast as in the past. This is principally occurring because global warming is causing a melting effect of the glaciers and ice pack at the poles. The potential effects of this are clear: coastal ecosystems are among the most delicate in the world and have important environmental effects such as filtration of water, control of storm waters, and providing nutrients to species in these areas. There would be massive disruption in near-coastal fishing zones and possible knock-on effects in the cycle of global warming. Rising sea levels would also over time claim a great deal of currently arable and habitable land and return it to the sea—meaning coastal living areas would be lost, some small islands would literally become submerged, and current ports would be lost. With nearly three billion people living on coastlines around the earth, all of this will make for difficult adjustments globally. • • • TWO OTHER CRUCIAL PROBLEMS AFFECTING the oceans are oil pollution and resource exploitation. Both are intertwined, especially in regard to liquid hydrocarbons, and both are having deleterious effects on the oceans, despite improvements over the past decades in awareness, regulation, and enforcement. Oil spills are the most dramatic and obvious, and they can come from offshore rigs, onshore piping systems, or from oil tankers operating at sea. Perhaps the most obvious visually is the offshore oil rigs. Removing resources from the seabed of the oceans is a very complex and difficult business. Throughout my career at sea, as I approached the coastlines of dozens and dozens of different countries, I would be saddened by the proliferation of big, ugly offshore oil rigs. I have passed through significant oil spills a few times, and the obvious devastation—seabirds coated in oil and struggling on the sea surface, legions of dead fish, a sickly, shiny sheen to the waters—is sadly well known. To sail through such a horrible miasma is a memorable experience. I did so in early 1991 during the first Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein’s troops deliberately opened risers into the Arabian Gulf from land-based piping and oil rigs and pumped more than 400 million gallons of oil into the northern Gulf, covering some four thousand square miles with oil. They were trying to reduce the operating efficiency of the coalition forces that were marshaling for the liberation of Kuwait following the Iraqi invasion. It had little effect on our ability to operate in the region, but the resulting damage still plagues parts of the Gulf. The most iconic and highly publicized example of broad area damage from offshore drilling remains the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 from the Deepwater Horizon rig. The short-term effects are well known, starting with the eleven oil-rig workers—essentially mariners—who died and the more than 200 million gallons of oil that flowed into the waters of the Gulf. Following an explosion on the rig, oil was pumping into the Gulf at well over 2 million gallons a day. Engineers struggled to cap the site for nearly three months, and a wild variety of solutions were put forward, including the use of a tactical nuclear weapon. Nearly six hundred miles of pristine coastland was oiled and ruined, and the livelihood of millions of residents interrupted or lost. An enormous amount of remediation and compensation has been accomplished, as well as significant direct fines levied. Unfortunately, the long-term cost is still difficult to assess, as the damage to so many fish and birds simultaneously may have generational effects; there are reports of defects to the circulatory systems of a variety of species. Most of the top-ranked oil spills in terms of gallons into the water over the decades have been from tankers. As a mariner, I have passed at sea thousands and thousands of big oil tankers over the years, and the vast majority appear to be well operated and professionally handled. We would often exchange friendly signals, and on one or two occasions provided distress relief or medical support. These enormous tankers, some of them three times the size of the U.S. super aircraft carriers, are operated with a tiny crew—just a dozen or so, as compared with several thousand on a carrier, for example. But when something goes wrong, it goes wrong with a vengeance, and nothing is worse that one of these behemoths discharging oil into the sea. As Americans, we tend to remember the Exxon Valdez spill into Prince William Sound in Alaska. This came not from an offshore installation but from a ship that was grossly mishandled, and the spill covered 1,400 miles of coast and killed (by most estimates) millions of living organisms including half a million seabirds. Yet this spill is not even in the top thirty in history and put “only” 11 million gallons into the water as compared with more than 200 million from the BP disaster. These big incidents from offshore rigs or tankers certainly shock the conscience and are remembered decades later, but they are really dwarfed by the steady amount of oil that enters the world’s waters year after year through routine pollution. This comes from illegal dumping in the dark of night, accidental inclusion of oil in garbage dumped at sea, and the flow of oil down to the oceans from freshwater sources, largely rivers, which themselves receive automotive effluents or oil-based pesticides. Some experts believe more than 500 million gallons a year of such steady, insidious oil pollution takes place. While the big incidents like the Deepwater Horizon/BP or Exxon Valdez disaster can be overwhelming in a given spot and of course receive enormous media attention, it is likely that the long-term, underreported but steady oil pollution into the oceans is actually the bigger threat. This quiet but massive input of oil into the sea deserves much greater study for its potential long-term effects. While it is easy to focus on oil pollution because the effects are so visible, there is also a high level of concern about chemical pollution. This is most typically from broad industrial activities, which end up producing dangerous chemical substances that then find their way into the oceans. An example would be the flow of contaminated silt, essentially dirt, which rolls into the sea. The silt is carried along by deep river currents and over time can include significant levels of pollutants from industrial and residential activity all along the riverbanks thousands of miles upstream. Man’s agricultural activities also contribute greatly to this form of pollution, largely from the use of nonorganic fertilizers. Auto activity, in terms of both exhaust and liquid effluents, also ends up frequently in the oceans. Toxic chemicals such as mercury also find their way into the seas, accumulating in the tissues of big fish species such as swordfish and tuna. And of course there is simple, obvious pollution in many low- regulation nations, where factories pump industrial waste, human excrement and urine, and other liquid substances directly into rivers or the sea. Another concern that I often witnessed over the years was the dumping of plastics and garbage directly into the sea. Certainly the U.S. Navy’s hands are not clean in this regard; I vividly remember all manner of plastic-laced garbage being thrown overboard. I would stand on the fantail of my destroyer in the 1970s and watch hundreds of seagulls come and look over the garbage we tossed carelessly over the side. We have come to understand the damage caused by plastics, and the world’s navies and responsible merchant fleets, at least, have modified their behavior accordingly. With apologies to Ian Fleming and his immortal novel Diamonds Are Forever, as far as the oceans are concerned it is plastics that are forever. Even as they degrade into smaller shapes and sizes, they still retain their fundamental composition. As a result, when marine animals—especially birds and turtles—ingest the garbage, they consume plastics, which are increasingly found not just in the seas but in the digestive systems of large segments of marine life. As for other refuse, much of it is biodegradable or can be manufactured so that it will disintegrate without harm to the sea, but some vessels and garbage disposal operations continue to discharge highly toxic materials including contaminated medical waste (needles, tubes, stents, etc.), sewage (close to shore), chemicals, drugs, and other nonbiodegradable items. Looking to the future, there is both good and bad news. The bad news is that the vast array of activities that damage the oceans will only increase—there will be a higher demand for fish-based protein, and for hydrocarbons, and the increasing world population (probably headed to at least 10 billion by the turn of the next century from the current level of about 7 billion) will cause more pollution, including dumping of garbage, plastics, medical waste, and sewage. All of this will damage the oceans, with particular impact close to shorelines, especially on delicate and important coral reefs. And there will be new activities in the oceans, including a likely increase in the recovery of minerals, probably from the deep seabed where plentiful nodules of copper, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and rare earth minerals lie like so many potatoes waiting to be gathered and hauled to the surface. The good news is that we still have time to react and take measures to protect the oceans, beginning with stronger enforcement of the existing accords, negotiation of new international regimes, and a focus on using the oceans in responsible ways in all of our strategic communications globally. We will never fully tame the vast reaches of the outlaw sea, but we can take proactive steps to reduce risk. WHAT ARE WE TO DO? What are we to do about the outlaw sea? As citizens of our individual nations, how do we collectively approach this enormously transnational problem, given that most who follow the sea spend their lives and careers focused on national concerns, as I did? In many ways, this is the most important question that mariners and those who truly love the sea must deal with as we sail further on into the twenty-first century. At the heart of any approach to the challenges of the outlaw sea is the creation of an enhanced level of international cooperation. Only through a high level of integration among international, interagency, and private entities can there be any hope of addressing the challenges inherent in the vast world of the sea. Unfortunately, to date the results of such efforts have been mixed at best. Certainly the development of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—an international negotiation concluded in the 1980s—has been largely successful. In the early 1980s, there was enormous enthusiasm for the treaty, a massive negotiating project that created the first truly global regime for ocean management. While it has obviously not solved all the problems of ocean governance, it is hard to imagine the level of chaos on the seas without it—even given that the United States, a huge maritime power, has refused to sign it (in a disagreement over deep seabed mining provisions, a foolish position pushed by U.S. neoconservatives). I remain hopeful that using the Law of the Sea treaty as a base, we will be able to negotiate other international instruments and—even more important—enforce them through a combination of sanctions, judgments in national and international courts, and shaming nations that do not follow the rules. So overall, I am cautiously optimistic about international maritime cooperation. On the other hand, efforts such as the pledge in 2010 by the world’s nations to protect at least 10 percent of the world’s oceans as protected reserves by 2020 have foundered—to date only 2 percent of the oceans have been so designated. While there have been some successes (the United Kingdom, for example, has created a reserve area in the South Pacific near Pitcairn Island that is three times the size of Great Britain itself), international efforts are lagging overall. Likewise, the jury is still out on a plethora of well-meaning efforts to address fishing, pollution, and the global environment. In terms of interagency cooperation, again we see a mixed picture. While the Obama administration moved on creating a U.S. government plan against illegal fishing, there has been a lack of sufficient resources placed against the goals. Neither the Coast Guard nor the U.S. Navy has spare capacity to undertake the kind of sweeping tasks outlined in the plan. The good news is that the interagency spirit is willing, but the flesh, so to speak, is weak. This is typical of how interagency projects fail, both in the United States and in other countries. Unfortunately, there is no consistent voice for the oceans in the vast majority of governments. Another immensely important zone of cooperation will be the intersection of efforts by the public and private sectors. International shipping companies, for example, are increasingly working together with international organizations (such as the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations) to create norms of behavior on the oceans. These run the gamut from agreements on “pumping and dumping”—discharge of anything from a ship—to levels of qualification of crew members, engineers, deck watch standers, mates, and captains. Many fishing companies are likewise working more closely with governmental and international organizations to bring order out of the largely chaotic world of fisheries. The oil and gas companies are cooperating at a higher level with such authorities as well. Getting past a sense of adversarial politics in all of these ocean areas will be crucial. In Bill Moomaw’s superb report on the oceans, he and his coauthor identify seventy-six “treaties, agreements, protocols, and frameworks that address the management of one or more species, fishing practice, or marine resource at global or regional levels” (Moomaw and Blankenship, 39). This sort of international cooperation demonstrates both the hope and the challenge of such an approach: many were lacking a formal secretariat, scientific body, and enforcement mechanisms. Of the seventy-six, only six had all three. This is the case in other areas of maritime management as well. Clearly, much more work will need to be done in the international space to build not only agreements but the right kind of management and enforcement as well. The best way to do this will be under the overarching umbrella of United Nations organizations (especially the International Maritime Organization) and using the principles that guided nearly two hundred nations through the arduous decade-long negotiation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must be more innovative and experiment at sea with new ideas of governance and bring more actors into ocean policy. Creating more protected marine areas will be helpful, as will the idea of establishing sanctuaries at sea for fish, birds, and mammals, much as is done on land. Certification programs that clearly indicate to the public which companies are doing business in ecologically thoughtful ways will matter, and encouraging corporate social responsibility at sea will be crucial. Linkages with aquariums, zoos, environmental advocacy organizations, and think tanks all have applicability as well. The course we must chart for the oceans involves work between and within governments, and above all within the private sector. But underlying all of that effort must be a coherent campaign of strategic communications. Unless we can convince the public of all our nations that the oceans are not a vast, invulnerable dumping ground and an endless source of protein, we will not succeed globally in altering the course we are on. We have a long way to sail before we can feel confident that the outlaw sea has been tamed. 9. AMERICA AND THE OCEANS A NAVAL STRATEGY FOR THE TWENTY- FIRST CENTURY New environmental challenges will tax the oceans in ways never seen in human history. This map displays the world’s land and sea elevations. Current global commercial fishing activity. Courtesy of Global Fishing Watch. Ifirst heard of Alfred Thayer Mahan when I was seventeen years old and a freshman (a “plebe,” as we were not-so-affectionately termed) at the U.S. Naval Academy. Part of the first-year curriculum for the entire thousand-man (and it was all men in those prehistoric days) class was a course titled simply “Sea Power.” Some of my wittier classmates dubbed it “Z-Power” to imply that it was boring, but for me it was anything but a sleeper. The modern version of the course had been created by a venerable historian, E. B. “Ned” Potter, who had also written a classic blue-covered textbook of the same name. Luckily for him, every year he sold a thousand copies of this hardcover text, which no doubt kept him well supplied with the small-batch bourbon of which I am told he was quite fond. I still have my plebe-year copy of the book, a little battered but still very much a text I open from time to time, and of course the title of this work is taken in homage to Potter’s course, although the context and approach are entirely different. The structure of the course was built simply upon the chronological history of man’s military journey on the oceans. It began in prehistoric times, moved quite briskly through the age of galleys sailed by the Greeks and Romans, segued into the classic battles like Lepanto in the Mediterranean between the Ottomans and the Hapsburgs, included plenty of material on the American Revolution at sea, followed by a quick nod to the Barbary pirates and the heroics of Stephen Decatur. Then it slowed and began the long sail through nineteenth-century American sea power, with an emphasis on the Civil War, before launching into the real set pieces of World War I and World War II at sea. It was (and remains) unashamedly Western oriented (completing the course, you would have thought that the Chinese didn’t build boats). It was unapologetically told from a very American point of view, and was extremely traditional in its outlook. And the high priest of it all was Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan. One former secretary of war, Henry Stimson, opined that Mahan manifested “the peculiar psychology of the Navy Department, which frequently seemed to retire from the realm of logic into a dim religious world in which Neptune was God, Mahan his prophet, and the United States Navy the only true church.” Mahan was born in 1840 in, of all places, West Point—home of the U.S. Military Academy, where his father was a professor. Mahan’s middle name was an homage to the so-called Father of West Point, Sylvanus Thayer. Everything about his early life would have predicted he would become an Army officer, but he set his course early for the Naval Academy and graduated second in his class of 1859. He was part of the Civil War Union Navy, and over the course of his career spent the requisite time at sea, working his way up to the rank of captain and holding command of a number of ships. Yet he was, by all accounts, an indifferent seaman whose propensity to bump into other ships and navigational buoys was noted by his superiors. But he began writing books early and often, expounding a theory of sea power that would make him perhaps the most influential naval officer of his generation. Mahan’s desire to read, think, write, and publish occasionally landed him in hot water with his superiors, including one famously damning fitness report that said succinctly, “It is not the business of naval officers to write books.” (Here I must note that the book you are reading is the seventh I have either written or edited, none at the level of Mahan’s classics; but I too found my naval career a bit bumpy at times due to that desire to write. The Navy sometimes retains a level of skepticism toward those who would proffer their views in print, but fortunately I think overall there is a respect for intellectual effort as well as good seamanship in the course of an officer’s career.) Late in his career, Mahan was tapped by Rear Admiral Stephen B. Luce, the intellectual force in the Navy’s move from sail to steam in the late nineteenth century, to come to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island, first as a lecturer and later for two terms as the second president of the college, following Admiral Luce. Mahan’s lectures, which were deeply admired and absorbed by Theodore Roosevelt among many others, were eventually translated into a series of classic books on sea power and history that are still studied closely today and form the basis for American sea power on into the twenty-first century. He died at the age of seventy-four of congestive heart failure, having finally been advanced to rear admiral (on the retired list) very late in his life and career. The basic theory of Mahan’s body of work is that national power derives from engagement via the world’s oceans along three key vectors: production (which leads to the need for international trade and commerce), shipping (both merchant and naval), and colonies and alliances (spread across the globe, forming a network of bases from which to project sea power). All three of these basic concepts still pertain today, although they need a bit of updating as we will discuss in more depth below. In addition to these three key vectors, Mahan also returns again and again to a handful of principal conditions that affect a nation’s ability to develop and wield sea power effectively. The first is the most straightforward and immutable: geography. As he says, “The seaboard of a country is one of its frontiers; and the easier the access offered by the frontier to the region beyond, in this case the sea, the greater will be the tendency of a people toward intercourse with the rest of the world by it.” In the case of the United States, our vast coastlines afford immediate access to the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans, as well as the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea to the south. This is an enviable position for developing and exploiting sea power, as we have seen repeatedly in our history. Coupled with enormous natural resources and relatively temperate climate, the geography of the United States features perhaps the best set of circumstances to build the nation into a sea power. A second factor cited frequently by Mahan that remains important today is the actual size of the seacoasts. Mahan’s comments here are quite specific: “As regards the development of sea power, it is not the total number of square miles which a country contains, but the length of its coastline and the character of its harbors that are to be considered.” The United States has 133,000 kilometers of coastline as measured along the tidewater boundaries—an enormous stretch, virtually all of it easily accessible from the land and situated in temperate zones. This is among the largest coastlines in the world (measuring coastlines, by the way, is a tricky business, and the numbers used here are from the World Resources Institute). Only Canada has a larger coastline by this measure, and much of it, of course, is inaccessible much of the year. Mahan also cites the importance of the native population in determining a nation’s ability to use sea power. As we increasingly see in this century, demography is destiny in many ways for nations. Mahan’s view was that it is not only the number of the population, but their fitness to conduct the business of using the oceans—shipbuilding, working on ships, propensity to join the Navy and Coast Guard—that is critical. As he says, “the number following the sea” matters. Closely associated with the number is the “character of the people.” In this regard, Mahan (like Theodore Roosevelt as president) believed in an activist philosophy of life, with an aggressive commercial approach to seas—specifically the economic incentive of the people to want to engage in trade globally. As he said, “The tendency to trade, involving of necessity the production of something to trade with, is the national characteristic most important to the development of sea power.” In terms of the characteristic that drives all this, he also said, “It seems scarcely necessary, however, to do more than appeal to a not very distant past to prove that, if legislative hindrances be removed, and more remunerative fields of enterprise filled up, the sea power will not long delay its appearance. The instinct for commerce, bold enterprise in the pursuit of gain, and a keen scent for the trails that lead to it, all exist; and if there be in the future any fields calling for colonization, it cannot be doubted that Americans will carry to them all their inherited aptitude for self-government and independent growth.” No shrinking violet, Mahan, but rather an unabashed capitalist (and imperialist, frankly) who also would have been happier to see the United States more aggressively pursuing colonies abroad like our European counterparts. A final factor upon which Mahan lays emphasis is the “character of the government.” Consistently throughout all his writings he calls on the U.S. government to fully understand the importance of sea power—a national imperative in the view of Mahan. He says, “It would seem probable that a government in full accord with the natural bias of its people would most successfully advance its growth in every respect; and, in the matter of sea power, the most brilliant successes have followed where there has been intelligent direction by a government fully imbued with the spirit of the people and conscious of its true general bent.” Mahan—aided by Rear Admiral Luce and truly energized by Teddy Roosevelt—preached this doctrine religiously throughout the senior part of his career. And his ideas caught the attention of policy makers not just in the United States but across the Atlantic as well, including in both England and Germany. All of these underlying factors are important to his thesis, but at its heart, Mahan’s siren call is for a big, muscular fleet: think of the Great White Fleet of Teddy Roosevelt, sailing the globe, refueling at well-selected coaling stations (which we would call forward bases today), and inspiring fear and awe in the nations of the world. This is the relevance of the expression “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” The key was being able to overmatch your opponent in terms of fleet fighting capacity—essentially using the inherent mobility of naval forces to concentrate and defeat an enemy at sea in a decisive battle. But there is a strategic concept behind all of that: the ability of a nation to use sea power to ultimately contain powerful nations that have concentrated their use of forces ashore, ignoring the sea out of lack of interest, or an inability to see the force of the sea power argument, or simply because they lack the geography, character, and political will to exploit the oceans. Let’s begin with the ancient Greeks: Athens was a sea power (with a good deal of land force character as well). With both land power and sea power, Athens was initially able to hold off Sparta (an essential land power) in the Peloponnesian Wars. Sparta, with its center of gravity deep inland on the southern peninsula of Greece, was a “heartland” power. Over time, the Spartans realized they needed to create a navy to compete effectively with Athens, learning the lessons of sea power. Flash forward to the age of Britannic majesty, the British Empire. How did a small island nation, devoid of most natural resources, come to dominate much of the world’s land surface? Through the effective use of sea power, building a colonial empire “upon which the sun never set.” Mahan seized upon British mastery of sea power to set up the case for the United States to build a similar fleet, and a colonial empire, taking advantage of its coastlines, maritime DNA, and naval approach to have real influence in the world. The British, according to Mahan, were able to challenge continental (heartland) European powers like Germany/Prussia because they were able to dominate the sea lanes of communication around the world. Many analysts posited this same dynamic in the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union. The USSR was a classic “heartland power,” with huge land-force capability, the advantage of an interior position geopolitically, domination of its near abroad (through the Warsaw Pact), and a mind-set forged in the great land wars against Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, and Nazi Germany. Against the USSR stood the USA, a maritime nation—essentially an island nation—protected by its great oceans and geographic position, underwritten by a strong navy, and perfectly capable of combining with continental allies (via NATO) to ensure that the heartland nation was unable to attain its ultimate desire—to dominate the “world island,” as geopolitical analyst Halford Mackinder styled the entire Eurasian continent. As Mackinder said, “Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World.” This quote sums up the concern Mahan had about domination by a strong land power, and why sea power was so important as a counterbalance. The interesting question in the twenty-first century is whether or not shifts in power, international norms, or technology have substantially altered the Mahanian approach. Personally, I believe his message still rings true for the United States. As we seek to craft an international maritime strategy for the nation, Mahan’s point of view—adapted somewhat for today’s world—still presents a timeless message. Taking his principles as a starting point, what advice can we imagine Mahan presenting the president today? First and foremost, he would emphasize the need for the United States to regard itself as a maritime nation. This means supporting a reasonably sized civilian merchant marine; a powerful, capable navy; a robust shipbuilding industry; a competent fishing fleet; efficient ports and infrastructure; icebreaking capability for the Arctic; and the ability to conduct broad area surveillance of the ocean approaches to our nation. Mahan would also emphasize to today’s president the importance to the United States of defending the concept of an open global commons—the rights of high seas passage and transit, the importance of the UN Law of the Sea treaty (which he would support, as virtually every active-duty admiral in the U.S. Navy does today), and safe passage free from piracy, political interference, or natural barriers. The open flow of free goods on the oceans (95 percent of global trade moves by sea) is crucial to a geopolitical power like the United States. This means challenging attempts to close the global commons by nations such as China, which is building artificial islands and declaring much of the South China Sea a “historic claim.” A third key element in Mahan’s prescription would be a strong system of alliances and partnerships around the world. He would have thought in terms of colonies, which are—praise the Lord—things of the past. In their place today, we need strong alliances, with NATO at the top of the list. By working with NATO, the United States has reliable and immediate access to bases and logistic support all around the periphery of Europe and up into the Arctic. Our warships can pull into port in Rota, Spain; Souda Bay, Greece; Portsmouth, England; Toulon, France; Bremen, Germany; and essentially anywhere within the twenty- eight nations of the alliance. Over my time as a Navy commander, I have frequently made port calls, refueled, sent my crew on liberty, conferred with close colleagues from allied navies, and generally found support and sustenance in our alliance. Similarly, in the Pacific, we have formal alliances with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea—all of equal value in ensuring a global system of operating locations. In addition to alliances, the United States needs an active network of partners and friends—nations that we are for a variety of reasons not ready to engage with a formal alliance—but with which we have warm relations nonetheless. Nations in this category include Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Israel, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Finland, Sweden, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. I have made port visits to each of the nations mentioned above and have found a welcoming committee in each place. These partners and friends are an essential part of our global maritime network as well, and part of our maritime strategy would include embracing them. When you put all the capability of our allies, partners, and friends together, it is a formidable naval force indeed—that approach toward international coalitions must be central to our global maritime strategy. Fourth, Mahan was keenly aware of the importance of the private sector in ensuring that the United States maintain a robust maritime capability. In his view, the primary key was supporting the maritime industry and the global trading capability. In today’s world, both of those are necessary, but they are not sufficient. Another key component of an effective global maritime strategy for the United States must be a high level of private-public operational integration and cooperation. One key example is in the world of sharing intelligence and information on ship movements at sea, both passively through the Global Positioning System and associated beaconing systems, and through active shared reports. This is crucial to ensure an open and free global navigational system, especially in the face of potential piratical activity in places like the Strait of Malacca, the east and west coasts of Africa, and the Caribbean Sea. Another example is specific to piracy, and that is exchanging operational protocols— embarked security teams, convoy operations, distress reporting systems, and countermeasures on individual ships. And all facets of global shipping systems —ships, ports, loading cranes, buoyage systems—are now vulnerable to cyberattack and are therefore a shared responsibility between the U.S. government and the U.S. operators. Mahan was very focused on the rise of competing sea powers, and in today’s world he would signal concern about two: Russia and China. Russia has rebounded from a period of decline in its military capability and is today using a highly targeted program of rebuilding its fleet. While in total ship numbers slightly smaller than the United States, the Russian fleet is very actively focused on the undersea world. While Mahan was not writing about the incredible advancements in submarines, by the end of his life he would have been aware of their growing potential to influence war at sea. The Russians have certainly taken the idea of submarine capability to heart and continue to expand the number, technology, and operational reach of all their submarines—both nuclear and diesel powered, and including both attack and ballistic missile versions. Likewise, the Chinese are improving all aspects of their oceangoing fleet, with an emphasis on technology, undersea capability (both offensive and defensive), long-range surface-to-surface missiles used to attack American aircraft carriers, and long-range land-attack precision cruise missiles. This is in addition to their very capable nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. Mahan’s advice would be to keep a weather eye on the rising power of both of these potential competitors at sea and maintain the ability to defeat both. What would Mahan have missed or gotten wrong? I think the biggest surprise to Mahan would have been the rise of undersea warfare as a critical (some would say dominant) element of naval and maritime strategy. Coupled with this, of course, would be the advent of nuclear propulsion, which gives these undersea warships the ability to submerge for long periods of time (months), limited only by food supplies on board—they can propel themselves and create both water and breathable air. And he would have been stunned at the size and capability of today’s submarines—while some small diesel-powered boats were in existence by the end of his life, to think of a 19,000-ton, 560-foot-long warship with missiles capable of destroying large cities and creating nuclear killing zones around the world all while being under the water and essentially invisible would have been too much even for a man used to ranging freely across the oceans of the mind. A second surprise: it would have been hard for him to conceive of the way in which warfare has gone from service-specific to joint, meaning highly integrated among the land, sea, and air components. The way in which the United States would fight a war today depends utterly on seamless command and control between the services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps), integrated munitions that can be shifted between them, and operations that use all branches to create shock and awe—missile strikes, aircraft attacks, naval gunfire, Marines landing and flying to an objective, heavy Army units right behind, all of it collectively creating a sense on the part of the enemy that defeat is inevitable. For Mahan, naval forces would have generally operated within their watery domain, fought a great battle with an enemy fleet, and been tasked with sea control, logistic resupply for forces ashore, and occasional power projection from cannons and Marines over a beachhead. But the essence of the fleet was to find and destroy the enemy fleet, thus ensuring control of the vital sea lanes of communication. He also, naturally enough, would have had no conception of the importance of cyber. The world of information, command, communications, and cyberwarfare simply had no existence in the period of time in which he was writing. It is hard enough for us to keep up with the latest changes in information warfare, let alone expect Mahan to imagine them. Perhaps the biggest technological change on ships would have been the use of computational power to direct weapons, giving them a distance, accuracy, and lethality he could not have imagined. The major cultural change, of course, would have been the advent of instantaneous communications, meaning that a captain’s decisions in battle are far more subject to “helpful advice” from a fully informed chain of command. I suspect the latter would not have been good news, as Mahan was someone who prized the initiative, verve, and confidence of the American naval commander at sea. But all good things must end, and in today’s world a captain still maintains a certain amount of tactical control over operations, even if he (or she!) is receiving a great deal of broad operational and strategic guidance. Additionally, it is hard to imagine that Mahan could have predicted the integration of space and unmanned systems into the nautical battle world. The vast expanses of the ocean always provided a sort of natural hiding place for ships, and the challenges of navigating across the trackless oceans challenged even the best of navigators. Electronic aids to navigation emerged in the middle of the twentieth century (radio beacons, for example), and radar deployed from aircraft began to shrink the unknown spaces of the sea. Once satellites were launched, and the Global Positioning System put in place, the world of the oceans was finally effectively mapped and tracked from on high. This has changed the character both of navigation itself and of how combat is conducted —virtually all naval weapons today depend on guidance obtained at least in part from GPS systems. One final surprise for Rear Admiral Mahan would have been the emerging importance of undersea cables in linking the world together and creating a sort of undersea sea lane of communications (quite literally) upon which we all depend. One other important aspect of thinking through a maritime strategy for the twenty-first century is what lies at the bottom of the ocean. In addition to a formidable geography—just like the surface of the earth, with high mountain ranges, valleys, plateaus, plains, and on and on—there are critical cables, man- made of course, that carry much of the world’s knowledge and commerce. At the bottom of the world’s oceans, like so many snakes surrounding the globe, are the standard commercial fiber optic cables that carry 99 percent of the world’s international telecommunications daily. They move information at a brisk clip: two terabits of data every second, including nearly $5 trillion every twenty-four hours in financial transactions. About two hundred of them carry the vast majority of all that vital information. As one observer recently commented, “Though often mentioned in passing, the fact that the overwhelming bulk of Internet activity travels along submarine cables fails to register with the public. High-flying satellites orbiting the crowded skies, continent-spanning microwave towers and a million miles of old 20th Century copper phone wire all carry but a fraction of the Earth’s Internet traffic compared with deep-sea fiber-optic cables.” As we consider the role they play today and what the potential might be for further enhancements, there is both promise and peril to consider. First, the peril—as strategists are increasingly aware, these cables are vulnerable. While their extreme depth protects them up to a point, advanced industrial nations—including the United States, the Russian Federation, and China—all reportedly have significant ability to monitor, exploit, damage, and destroy the cables. During the cold war, both the USA and the USSR were believed to have attacked antisubmarine systems and arrays at similar depths. As Steve Weintz wrote recently in the National Observer, “If you wish to practice hybrid warfare—disruption and degradation with little overt engagement—then the ability to cut submarine cables at will and at depth gives you a very powerful weapon. Cut up undersea hydrophone networks and you deafen your adversary. Cut Internet cables and you have the ultimate denial-of- service cyber weapon.” There have certainly been plenty of incidents of accidental cable cuttings and losses of data resulting from such activities. In 2006 and 2008, accidental destruction of cables effectively shut down Internet services to several large countries or parts thereof, including, among others, Egypt, India, China, and Pakistan. Fortunately, the cables are fairly substantial: typically, a couple of inches thick and well insulated with galvanic padding. But they are quite vulnerable, especially at cable heads when they emerge from the water. In Egypt just a couple of years ago, swimmers were caught while trying to cut through a major 12,500-mile cable. Internet speeds throughout Egypt plummeted by more than 60 percent. Overall, the cable system is fairly robust in facing routine challenges— accidents, anchors dragged over them, corrosion, low-level attacks. The challenge will come as nations and transnational groups (criminal cartels, terrorists) find ways to disrupt them on a massive scale. Even with the 285 cables on the bottom of the world today and the 22 “redundant” or “dark” cables in reserve, the vulnerabilities are clear. Both individual nations and international organizations should collectively be thinking through disaster scenarios and considering how best to use collective defense of these cables going forward. So much for the peril; but what about the promise of this system? Are there new technologies coming that can leverage and improve this capability? The good news is a resounding yes. First, the information technology itself is improving—and it has to. Just a couple of years ago, the Internet moved about five gigabytes per capita. It will hit fourteen gigabytes per capita in 2018. And with billions more devices connecting to the Internet in the next decade, the problem is obvious. Fortunately, we are able to use new phase modulation and also improve what is called submarine line terminal equipment (SLTE). This will boost capability by more than fifty times. Additionally, the prosaic ability to lay, adjust, repair, and maintain the cables is improving through the use of unmanned systems, big data analysis, and better materials. Additionally, there are increasingly creative ideas about how to leverage the cable system to improve access to high-speed Internet around the world. Satellites—at least for now—are just not the answer. Their signals capacity is severely limited by latency and bit loss, whereas underwater fiber optic cables deliver signals at nearly the speed of light (they are optic, after all). So what can we do to amp up their contribution? One idea is to create mobile networking hubs, both airborne and on the surface of the sea. The airborne vehicles could operate at forty to fifty thousand feet in altitude, which would enable broadcast to 250 nautical miles in all direction while receiving data from as far as 500 nautical miles. The surface hubs would be a system of “risers” above the cables to move the data to the surface and make it accessible to the mobile airborne hub. Such a system could have serious commercial viability, of course. It could also be very advantageous to military planners seeking another means of moving data. The key is the relatively low cost of moving data compared with satellites —this system, even considering the added cost of the mobile airborne hubs and the risers, would be orders of magnitude less expensive than satellite systems, and vastly faster. From a military perspective, this would be a redundant system to the backbone satellite systems in use today. This is also an idea rife with potential for public-private partnerships, as the risers could be connected via the systems that oil and gas industry platforms are using today. As with any system for communications, there is both risk and reward possible. In the case of submarine cables, we should increase our ability to protect this vital portion of the global communications grid and seek innovative ways to leverage its capability. So if all of that reflects Mahanian thinking, where are we today? Are these classic ideas and principles important today, as well as the new technologies that are all part of our idea of twenty-first-century sea power? The short answer is yes—up to a point. In March 2015, the chiefs of the nation’s sea services—Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard—unveiled “A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower,” charting a forward, engaged, ready course to meet the nation’s global maritime strategic responsibilities. Then–chief of naval operations Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, then–Marine commandant General Joseph F. Dunford Jr. (he has since been promoted to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff), and Coast Guard commandant Admiral Paul F. Zukunft underscored the growing importance of increasing cooperation among the services to achieve the maximum forward presence and war-fighting capabilities required for national defense and homeland security. I enjoyed leading a conversation among the three of them at the official rollout of the document in Washington in 2015. This is not about diminishing the criticality of our nation’s air and ground forces: far from it. The document is about how the maritime world fits into the broader geopolitical context out of efforts to create twenty-first-century security. A bird’s-eye view of the shipyards, port facilities, Navy ships, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Special Forces bases and stations in and around the nation certainly reminds us that the United States is a global maritime power. This is as true today as it has been since the beginning of the Republic. What is often forgotten is the critical importance of a maritime strategy to go with all that capability. The sea services have developed such strategies for three decades, and they have been largely successful in driving the size, deployment patterns, and impact of our maritime forces. In 1986, with the fast-growing Soviet navy as the potential adversary, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps published “The Maritime Strategy,” aimed at using maritime power, in combination with the efforts of our sister services and forces of our allies, to bring about war termination on favorable terms. This flowed from presidential guidance. As then–secretary of the Navy John Lehman once reminded, President Ronald Reagan, when asked to summarize what his policy toward the cold war would be, replied: “We win and they lose.” Pretty simple. As a newly selected lieutenant commander (still a very junior officer), I was in the Pentagon as a special assistant to the chief of naval operations and had a chance to play a small role in the formation of “The Maritime Strategy.” Because I had a brand-new PhD, it was assumed that I was at least marginally capable of thinking and writing. This translated mostly to getting coffee for the actual authors, senior captains not only with comparable degrees but in possession of actual experience as strategic planners. But in hanging around the process, I learned a great deal about how these strategies are put together that I was able to use when I was more senior. In a nutshell, it begins with a political idea that “now is a good time” to put out a fresh strategy. This normally comes either when a high official (a secretary of defense or the Navy, or a chief of naval operations or Marine Corps commandant) comes into office. Or occasionally when a distraction is needed from the negative flow of events. A small team of bright officers is selected, several of whom will have had experience doing such work in the past. They will be given office space, a small support staff (such as Lieutenant Commander Stavridis), and will put together a draft concept. This will then be vetted through the enormous staff groups in the Pentagon, a process that can take months. Various offices will attempt to drive their particular areas of emphasis to the top of the priority queue, for example subsurface warfare, the threat of cyber affecting seagoing operations, tactical strike operations with aircraft, unmanned vehicles, and so forth. Lots of horse trading goes back and forth at increasingly higher levels in the food chain, until the leader of the drafting group—having done his or her best to synthesize all the “helpful input”—will take the melded draft concept to the decision maker, say the chief of naval operations. This august leader will provide a blessing, and now the true hard work begins—writing the actual words that will be part of the strategy. No one should ever underestimate the passion that goes into the heart and mind of a human being offered the chance to edit another’s prose. Once the drafting team produces an actual draft—sentences, paragraphs, a title, and so on —it must be sent around not only to the Pentagon staff, but to the various fleet elements as well. Lots of “helpful input” comes back, and is again considered (and mostly rejected) at this point. Finally, a smooth draft is completed that can go “outside the life lines of the Navy (or Marines)” and be presented to the Department of Defense (the boss) and informally to think tanks, influential thinkers and writers, retired august figures, and the like. All of this will typically have taken about nine to twelve months, but incredibly the product is usually pretty balanced and often contains some basic, useful guidance. “The Maritime Strategy” of 1986 was big and bold and really captured the imagination of the Naval Service. Subsequent strategic road maps would be published in 1992, 1994, and 2007. The massive blue-water threat of the USSR faded and the sea services became more skilled at littoral warfare as guided by the strategy titled “. . . From the Sea” in 1992. (Note: the three dots in front of the words “From the Sea” were intentional, meant to imply the flexibility of the Navy.) The world economy—largely dependent on sea transport of commerce—was becoming more interconnected. The challenges to national security were evolving to include wars between major powers, regional conflicts, international terrorism, piracy, and response to natural disasters. There was one constant. Whenever a new international crisis faced the nation, the president then in office would continue to ask, “Where are the carriers? Where are the Marines?” Why? Because they form the ready strike forces that are sustainable from the sea. “A Cooperative Strategy for the 21st Century” addresses the challenges and opportunities before the sea services from 2015 to future horizons, framing the strategic discussion in terms of: Global security environment Forward presence and partnership Sea power in support of national security Force design: building the future force World changes since 2007 are presented in summary and then examined in detail: “Today’s global security environment is characterized by the rising importance of the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the ongoing development and fielding of anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities that challenge our global maritime access, continued threats from expanding and evolving terrorist and criminal networks, the increasing frequency and intensity of maritime territorial disputes, and threats to maritime commerce, particularly the flow of energy.” Chinese naval capabilities, the longer reach of that navy into the Indian and Pacific oceans, and China’s growing territorial claims are highlighted, as are China’s participation in international exercises and disaster response missions. In the strategic context, these are understood as both challenges and opportunities. But of course it is not all about a Pacific pivot: Europe still matters deeply. More U.S. ships, aircraft, and Marine Corps forces will be operating in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. In broader terms, if the sea services’ global forward presence is imperative, the expansion of naval and Marine Corps planning and operations with allies and other friendly nations on seas around the world goes hand in hand. Such partnerships provide increased international stability in peacetime and increased combined-force capability in time of conflict. In parallel, the Coast Guard, as a regulatory and law enforcement agency, and one of the nation’s five armed services, is expanding combined operations—with more than sixty bilateral agreements already in place with foreign governments —countering international illegal operations and further enhancing maritime stability. The sea power now required to protect the homeland, provide national security, and provide sea control includes: The Navy’s powerful carrier strike groups, centered on a massive U.S. nuclear-powered carrier with its embarked air wing, accompanied by a brace of cruisers and destroyers Amphibious task forces with their embarked Marines Surface warships and submarines operating independently or in small tactical groups Cutters of the U.S. Coast Guard, which have reasonable war-fighting capability If the maritime strategy is to be implemented and succeed, it will be essential to have all-domain access—that is, access allowing both protection of U.S. operating forces wherever they may be and effective projection and mission completion by those forces in areas contested by foreign powers. In the words of the chief of naval operations, “We must be able to create access in any domain. That means altering how we plan and coordinate actions in the air, sea, land, space, and cyberspace domains, identifying and leveraging the right capability mix to assure access and freedom of action.” Against the current background of budget constraints, flexible, agile, and ready forces and the most highly trained and capable sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen—“our greatest asymmetric advantage”—will be required. This will include a balanced force of submarines, aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, and surface combatants for deterrence, sea control and power projection, and maritime security needed to combat terrorism, illegal trafficking of people, drugs, and arms, piracy, and the safeguarding of freedom of navigation. There is one top-priority, underlying message throughout the new maritime strategy: the need for sea power is greater than ever. Again, this does not diminish the need for other forms of national power—land, air, special operations, cyber. But make no mistake: there are extremely difficult international threats and challenges in the years ahead. It is essential that we provide the forces and the people the sea services require, and this new strategic vision does a commendable job articulating the case. Throughout the nearly four decades of my long career on active service in our Navy, I worked on many strategic plans. The Navy, along with the other services, is constantly tinkering with a new version. Sometimes it truly laid out big visions (“The Maritime Strategy” and the associated six-hundred-ship Navy of the 1980s come to mind) and other times the “visions” are somewhat incremental and timid. As we head for the turn and conclude two decades of this incredibly turbulent twenty-first century, it is high time for some “blue sky” (some would say “blue water”) thinking. The oceans remain largely ignored as much more than a convenient highway for our goods. If the United States is to prosper and lead in this century, we need a coherent national strategy, of which a significant component should be based on the timeless strategic principles of Mahan as adapted for today’s world—the power of our geography, national character, and a keen sense of the potential of the oceans. One final thought to consider is how we should look geographically at each of the world’s oceans from a strategic sense. While the essence of sea power is the connective power of the unity of the oceans into a single global commons, there are historic, cultural, political, economic, and military reasons to think about each from a strategic perspective. Let’s begin with the “twin towers” of the world’s oceans, the North Atlantic and Pacific. Like two massive guardians, they flank the continental United States, providing distance—which translates into time and insulation from the rest of the world. U.S. strategy throughout our history has been to ensure that we have benign neighbors to north and south, and we have achieved that, enjoying an excellent relationship with both Canada and Mexico. The Caribbean is largely harmless, and the prospects of war in the Americas are remote. All of this translates into three key strategic elements: maintaining a cordial relationship in the Americas, especially with Canada and Mexico; ensuring that we have sufficient sea power to maintain sea control in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific; and controlling the Panama Canal to provide the ability to “swing” the U.S. fleet as necessary. In practical terms this translates into approximately 350 significant battle force ships, divided into at least twelve carrier battle groups. There have been multiple studies over the past thirty years that have validated these numbers again and again. During the 2012 election, President Obama mocked Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney when Romney suggested that we needed a set minimum number of ships. Obama pointed out, correctly, that we don’t need cavalry units anymore when Romney accurately said our fleet was the smallest in decades. Romney was right—quantity has a quality all its own when it comes to ships, and the enormous distances of the Atlantic and Pacific testify to the need for a formidable U.S. fleet. Events since 2012—the rise of China’s navy, a much more assertive Russia with a significant naval building program, distributed threats around the world—make the argument for higher numbers of ships even more salient. U.S. maritime strategy must be built on an absolute ability to control the ocean approaches to our nation. We are not seriously challenged today, but if we neglect fleet size and military spending, the day will come when we cannot take for granted the sea lanes of communication to and from our continent. This is the basic building block of our strategy. There are, of course, two powerful fleets for the Atlantic and Pacific. Each is commanded by a four-star admiral, and there is also a numbered fleet for the Pacific coast called the Third Fleet. The Third Fleet is commanded by a three- star vice admiral reporting to the overall commander of the Pacific fleet. The old Second Fleet, which patrolled the East Coast, was decommissioned in 2011 and has been taken over by the four-star commander of the Atlantic fleet. Both fleets have two key missions: protecting the coasts of the United States and the territorial seas, as well as the high seas of the Atlantic and Pacific; and conducting training and exercising to prepare the Navy ships that will go forward and operate on deployments to the Sixth Fleet (Mediterranean), Fifth Fleet (Arabian/Persian Gulf), Seventh Fleet (western Pacific and Indian Ocean), and Fourth Fleet (Latin America and Caribbean). This structure remains viable at the moment, although over time the United States should consider an Eighth Fleet for the Indian Ocean as operations increase there. We do not need a fleet for the Arctic (yet), but we should reserve the number for a Ninth Fleet for the High North. Interestingly, the Navy has designated a numbered fleet for cyber operations, the Tenth Fleet. After the North Atlantic and Pacific, the closest ocean space is, of course, the Caribbean. Not only is it the “soft underbelly” of the United States, but it is also the waterway that controls the Panama Canal. The vast majority of trade transiting the Americas goes through the canal, and we must control the approaches to its passage. In 1962, the United States almost went to war with the Soviet Union when it sought to emplace nuclear-tipped missiles on the island of Cuba. While there was legitimate concern about the presence of such weapons so close to U.S. borders, the geostrategic reason for the confrontation was simple: the United States cannot cede control of the Caribbean to anyone else. Today when I think about the Caribbean, it is even clearer than ever that we need to invest there in the broadest terms. This region—the Caribbean and the waters of Latin America—is the purview of the Fourth Fleet. The newest of the modern U.S. fleets, it has its headquarters in northern Florida and reports to the combatant commander in Miami. When I arrived as commander of U.S. Southern Command in 2006, there was no designated fleet controlling the area. I had to requisition forces from the Atlantic Fleet commander, who had many missions of his own and was not always fully attentive to the needs of the region. Working with the chief of naval operations at the time, an old friend and fellow captain of destroyer Barry, Admiral Gary Roughead, we were able to stand up a small but symbolically important new command: the Fourth Fleet. This was not without controversy in the region, and some of the nations perceived it as a return to U.S. imperialism. Cartoons of me appeared in various publications around the region in the left-leaning countries like Argentina, Nicaragua, and especially Cuba (of course) showing an admiral with a battle helmet and a long spear through the heart of South America. I kept making the point in all my visits that the Fourth Fleet was focused not on combat but on the real missions of the region: humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, medical diplomacy, training and exercises, protection of the Panama Canal from sabotage, and counternarcotics. Over the past decade, that message has landed and the protests have faded away. However, I still treasure the fact that I was personally condemned in Granma, the official publication of Cuba, on the front page by Fidel Castro himself. This is why the naval station at Guantánamo Bay is a very important U.S. installation. We need to reimagine Guantánamo Bay in strategic terms, getting away from the idea of it as a prison colony for terrorists—a failed construct from a geopolitical perspective. The base serves today as the logistical, training, and naval hub of the Caribbean and South Atlantic. It is where the U.S. military stages and operates its extensive program of humanitarian activity, medical diplomacy, and disaster relief—swinging into action after the frequent hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters of the region. Guantánamo Bay is leased from Cuba (although the Castro regime disputes the legitimacy of the agreement and doesn’t cash the rent checks). The “normalization” of relations with Cuba is a good thing on balance, as it will probably end up creating more pressure for liberalization of the regime in Cuba than the embargo had accomplished across the decades. Over time, it will gradually have the effect of helping the people of Cuba achieve their potential. And—ojalá, as is said in Spanish, “God willing”—it will ultimately strengthen the democratic movement there and resolve the last remaining dictatorship in the Americas in a positive way. Over the next five years, the United States will come under serious pressure from the Castro regime and its partners in the Americas (Venezuela, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Bolivia, and others) to close the naval station and return it to Cuban sovereignty. They will say: you gave back the Panama Canal, closed bases elsewhere (in Ecuador, for example), and generally do not deploy forces without the consent of a host government. If relations with Cuba are “normal,” why would Cuba not get the same treatment? One answer would be to begin using the base as the hub of a U.S.-led international effort to address the challenges of the region. Naval Station Guantánamo, with the cooperation of Cuba and the United States, could be used for: Large-scale disaster relief efforts as the inevitable hurricanes and earthquakes devastate the region Humanitarian relief work, cooperating to build clinics and schools and develop sources of clean drinking water Basing hospital ships and training vessels focused on civil improvement projects and education Storage of relief supplies—major facilities for this already exist Collective counternarcotics efforts, partnering with the Joint Interagency Task Force in Key West All of this would require a delicate negotiation with the Cubans, agreement from the United States to continue providing the lion’s share of the funding, and cooperation from other partners (Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico all have capacity). It would probably also require closing the detention facility as other nations are unlikely to participate without the departure of Joint Task Force Guantánamo (the detainee command). All very complicated. But the idea of essentially internationalizing Naval Station Guantánamo has real possibilities and would allow the United States and Cuba to work together on a positive project going forward. The odds of the United States’ needing the base for combat operations are essentially nil—luckily we enjoy peace here in the Americas. We should explore the possibilities for collective use of Naval Station Guantánamo in addressing the real problems in this hemisphere: poverty, natural disasters, development, and narcotics. • • • MOVING A BIT FARTHER AFIELD from the continental United States, it is the two “forward seas” that matter most: the Mediterranean Sea and the South China Sea. Each is ringed with U.S. allies and friends, and each faces a variety of challenges both internal and external. For the Mediterranean, it is the pressure of violent extremists, at the moment surging principally from the so-called Islamic State, that is the most dangerous element, from the Syrian seacoast to the long stretch of Libya. Additionally, there is pressure from Russia, which seeks to maintain bases on the Mediterranean and continues to press south from its Crimean bases in the recently annexed region of Ukraine. Our NATO friends and allies need our support and presence in the region. The job of patrolling the Mediterranean falls to the Sixth Fleet, which is based out of Italy. It has a flagship and a handful of surface combatants (typically AEGIS guided missile destroyers and cruisers) and also can access aircraft carriers and amphibious readiness groups that are in transit or swung north through the Suez Canal from the Indian Ocean and the Gulf in times of need. As events over the past several years have demonstrated, the eastern Mediterranean is a zone of conflict akin to the South China Sea. We should therefore increase the size of the Sixth Fleet and have a permanently deployed flotilla of at least ten ships to the Mediterranean (today we typically have two or three). In the South China Sea, we should likewise be working closely with allies (the Republic of Korea and the Philippines, as well as Japan just to the north of the region) as well as with friends (Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore). We currently have an aircraft carrier strike group permanently stationed forward in Japan, and that should continue. We need to increase the number of our submarines in the region, basing them out of Guam or Japan. Forward naval presence in the South China Sea will be necessary to maintain a balance in the region. North of the South China Sea, we will also need a maritime-based plan to deal with North Korea over time. Let’s start with why we care. North Korea is arguably the most dangerous nation in the world—they have a small arsenal of nuclear weapons, a budding ballistic missile capability that will soon be able to deliver them at range, and they have continually demonstrated the propensity to use military force while occasionally conducting an actual nuclear weapon test. The nation has significant malnutrition, a huge prison population on a per capita basis, no democratic means of succession, and territorial disputes with its southern neighbor, the Republic of Korea. The North Koreans also regularly threaten the United States, Japan, and other countries that they perceive stand in the way of their economic and political objectives. Taken together, the pattern of behavior and basic fact pattern on the ground in North Korea demand a plan for dealing with this pariah state. First, the international community should be increasing sanctions dramatically. Given the level of sanctions leveled on Iran for merely pursuing a nuclear weapon, why would there be any fewer sanctions applied to a state that has such weapons and detonates them in unnecessary tests? The U.S. Congress just passed a revised, tougher set of sanctions that will begin to go after international cash accounts and penalize banks that do any kind of business with North Korea—this is an important step that other nations should follow. Japan is likewise imposing new, stronger sanctions. Other nations in the region— especially China—should follow suit. Another important element is preparing appropriate levels of missile defenses, especially in South Korea and Japan. This means adding the state-of- the-art Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system to the arsenals of both countries. Given that there are tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers and their families in both countries, this is in the interest of both the host nations and the United States. The United States, South Korea, and Japan should work together to finance and put in place this highly capable system, which has a range well over two hundred kilometers and flies at Mach 8-plus to effect terminal kills of incoming ballistic missiles. China will not like this (seeing it as at least partially directed against Chinese systems), but will need to accept the need on the part of the other nations. Perhaps the Chinese concerns will lead to a more aggressive stance toward Pyongyang, which would be helpful. Indeed, much depends on Beijing in terms of reining in Kim Jong-un. While the young leader’s attitude toward China is ambivalent at best (he killed his uncle, the central interlocutor, early in his regime), the Chinese have real economic leverage. They should be encouraged to use it, and if necessary, the sanctions regime against North Korea should apply to Chinese banks and businesses conducting commerce there. In addition to THAAD, more advanced Patriot Air Defense and AEGIS maritime-based air defense systems should be deployed to the defense of South Korea and Japan. Both nations have versions of Patriot, and Japan has AEGIS ships; but these systems can be modernized, and all three nations should conduct exercises and training together to link them into a coherent regional missile defense system. Additionally, there is more that the United States and its allies can do in the cyber world. While North Korea is notoriously difficult to penetrate (because it carefully screens its links to the Internet), it does use portions of the Web for specialized security functions, and its military rides on a computer-based backbone that can be accessed, albeit with difficulty. Working closely with our South Korean and Japanese cyber counterparts, we should use cyber aggressively to sabotage the North Korean weapons programs, insert monitoring devices in their critical infrastructure, and generate the means to attack their electrical grid if necessary and in response to a North Korean attack against the South. The North Koreans have already lashed out at a U.S. company, Sony Pictures, over cyber circuits, destroying millions of dollars in equipment and doing significant business damage to Sony’s interests by releasing thousands of embarrassing internal e-mails. In terms of additional military preparations, the United States should do all it can to link South Korea and Japan in the air defense area, as well as in maritime cooperation. Working together in the air and at sea can help provide a deterrent effect on North Korea, balancing the strong U.S. ground forces on the Korean Peninsula already. Conducting a large, annual, U.S. Joint Staff–sponsored exercise in the region specifically focused on North Korea and the danger it poses would make sense. It should have a strong cyber component as well. Finally, despite all the frustrations and dangers, we need to do what we can to keep a means of communication open with North Korea. While fruitful negotiations seem unlikely, we should be generally open to dialogue—but careful not to fall into the familiar trap of North Korea: bad behavior, negotiations, concessions on food, fuel, and sanctions, and no change in overall behavior. It is a depressingly familiar cycle. This is where working with China over time might have a helpful effect—without Chinese engagement and economic clout, any attempt at negotiation will be unlikely to succeed. As in the film The Interview, which mocked Kim Jong-un and was the motivation for the Sony Pictures attack, it is easy to laugh at the chubby young leader. But he is a clear and present danger to the region, and we will need determined collective action—economic, military, and diplomatic—to counter his growing potential to provoke a major crisis in the heart of the world’s economy, East Asia. • • • ALL OF THIS WILL BE the purview of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, historically the largest and most capable. It will need the most advanced weapons systems, to include antimissile technology on AEGIS combatants, significant carrier presence (at least two, one permanently in Japan and the other roaming the Pacific), strong Marine Corps elements (on Okinawa and Guam), ballistic missile submarines as the most survivable leg of the triad to deter China, and strong special forces and cyber support. The Seventh Fleet should remain headquartered on the islands of Japan, our strongest ally in the region, and will also require a string of bases around the Pacific. Some of the key nodes are on the home islands of Japan, the South Korean Peninsula, and Okinawa. Additionally, we should explore at least cooperative arrangements to base a light footprint in the Philippines (the legislature there appears poised to approve a return to historic Subic Bay), on northern Australia (probably in Darwin), and— over time—in Vietnam. Access to bases in Singapore is essential, and the defense relationship there is very strong. The major body of water the greatest distance from the United States, literally on the other side of the world, is the Indian Ocean. Here our strategy must first and foremost take into account the emerging superpower India. We should do all we can diplomatically, culturally, militarily, politically, and diplomatically to strengthen our ties with India. This should particularly include cooperating in the maritime realm, including a new series of exercises and training with the Indian navy; promoting sales of advanced naval hardware, notably the AEGIS combat system on surface combatants; cooperating on operating nuclear submarines; working with India and Japan on naval exercises focused on counterpiracy in and around the approaches to the Indian Ocean; and developing a program of maritime science diplomacy for the Indian Ocean. In addition to working closely with India, our two major Anglophone allies New Zealand and Australia are important as well. Australia is of major geostrategic importance given the size of its coastline, which includes a huge coastal “waterfront” on the Indian Ocean. Great Britain continues to own Diego Garcia and deploys internationally to the Arabian/Persian Gulf as well, and our involvement there will be crucial. The Arabian/Persian Gulf will continue to be a vitally important waterway for the United States, and the linkages between the greater Indian Ocean and the Gulf will be a “hot” seam in maritime affairs. The United States must continue to maintain a significant naval fleet (numerically, the Fifth Fleet) in the region. It is mandatory to maintain a carrier strike group (a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and a handful of AEGIS guided missile escorts) in the region 24/7. Additionally, having a Marine Expeditionary Unit (also known as an Expeditionary Strike Group) in the area will be advisable. The latter consists of three large amphibious ships that carry a specially trained and reinforced Marine Expeditionary Unit (about two thousand Marines, aircraft, and the ability to move them with extreme speed). We should also have a strong minesweeping and special forces capability. Clearly the region will continue to be contentious, and given the high level of global hydrocarbons moving through it the United States will need to work with coalition partners to keep it open. Finally, there is the Arctic. The strategic terrain at the top of the world will be increasingly important to U.S. strategy, and our approach in the High North must include first and foremost ensuring that we have sufficient icebreakers. This means a strategic program to purchase (or lease) icebreakers. At an absolute minimum, a coherent U.S. maritime strategy should have four heavy and four medium icebreakers. Fortunately, pretty much everyone in Washington agrees with the idea that we need icebreakers, and we need them now. Our global maritime strategy should have an icebreaker component built into it. Additionally, we need more transportation and exploration infrastructure (roads as well as ports and airstrips) in the High North. While we have some in place and plans for others, the fall in oil prices in 2015–16 has slowed the pace of construction. In addition to shore-based infrastructure, we also need sea-based structures that can be used for emergency search and rescue, environmental disaster response, and scientific research. These can be built on the basic structures of offshore oil and gas platforms and—when hydrocarbon prices rise again—can be built into the tax base levied on the companies exploiting the natural resources of the region. There is not a U.S. Navy fleet assigned to the Arctic, and at the moment one is not necessary. The best approach would be to make this an area of focus for the U.S. Coast Guard, with the Department of Defense acting in support. What remains? Both the far South Atlantic and the South Pacific are relatively secure and can be considered theaters where an “economy of force strategy” can be used. This simply means that we do not need permanently deployed ships or permanent bases in either region. We will need to make occasional cruises to support presence and conduct basic military-to-military contacts, but no significant forces will be required. Taken together, it is clear that many of the principles of Mahan apply—we still need forward bases, extended fleets, and secure logistics (although not so much coal anymore). But what we can add to the Mahanian construct is international (both alliances like NATO and informal coalition partners), interagency (especially with the Coast Guard), and private-public cooperation. This twenty-first-century global maritime strategy is the right one for our nation, requires a fleet of around 350 ships, is affordable, flexible, and provides the nation both hard-power and soft-power options—a smart-power approach for the seas. • • • THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES on a voyage that is both personal to the mariners who sail it and of vital geopolitical importance. In the end, we are an island nation, bounded by oceans and nurtured on the global commerce, international markets, fishing expeditions, hydrocarbon offshore rigs, and strategic waterways of the world’s oceans. Without the oceans and our ability to sail them, we would be enormously diminished as a nation. Our ability to navigate, both literally and figuratively, through the oceans will be a determinative part of the voyage of our nation in this century. I began this volume with the thought that there is both a deeply individual component to sailing and understanding the oceans and a key geostrategic element to the idea that the sea is truly one. Taken together, it seems clear that the nautical character of our nation will continue to be vital, indeed essential, for all that the future promises to our country and the world. Let us continue to sail in our ships, which take our sailors daily out of sight of land, and leave us gazing at the eternal vista of the deep sea, where we stand on a narrow hull, rolling before the waves and the wind, knowing we are at heart a nation that will forever depend on sea power and our sailors for security and prosperity. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS First, my research assistants during academic year 2015–16, Matt Merighi and McKenzie Smith, contributed to chapters 1 and 2 on the Pacific and Atlantic, respectively. Commander Jeremy Watkins helped with ideas for chapter 9 on strategy and contributed data for the arms race in the Pacific highlighted in chapter 1. Some of this material was published in previous public writings of mine, mostly in Foreign Policy, The Wall Street Journal, Nikkei Asian Review, Signal magazine, and Proceedings (U.S. Naval Institute), and is reprinted with their permission. All of it is original work of mine, of course. In particular, some of the material at the end of chapter 1 on the Pacific is based on a column I wrote for Nikkei/Financial Times Asia in 2015. At the end of chapter 3 on the Indian Ocean is some material from a column in Foreign Policy written in 2014. The final paragraphs of chapter 4 on the Mediterranean are based on material published in Foreign Policy in 2015. Chapter 5 on the South China Sea has several paragraphs based on articles from Foreign Policy and Nikkei Asian Review from 2015. Chapter 6 contains some material from a column in Foreign Policy in 2015. Chapter 9 includes material on undersea cables and the new maritime strategy that appeared in Signal magazine. Captain Bill Harlow, a close friend and colleague of more than three decades, has been a superb supporter, adviser, and sharp-eyed editor of this manuscript. My friend and agent Andrew Wylie supported this idea and helped persuade Penguin Random House to take the plunge (pun intended) to publish such a watery book. Scott Moyers, a gifted agent and now an editor at Penguin Press, conceived the idea and persuaded me to take on the challenge of crafting this broad and deeply personal book. My wife, Laura, as always, has been a stalwart and patient source of love and support, even when our weekends were a bit curtailed as deadlines loomed. All errors of fact, content, or imagination are mine alone. I dedicate this book to all the sailors at sea: Godspeed and open water to them all, wherever the wind and waves have taken them.

Mahan’s massively popular The Influence of Sea Power upon History was signally successful in so doing, becoming part of the intellectual backdrop to America’s acquisition of Caribbean and Far Eastern colonies and the construction of a world-class battle fleet. Unfortunately, Mahan’s thesis also impressed many influen- tial Germans and Japanese. Their aspirations were dashed at Jutland and Midway. The last of these battles gave the United States unchal- lenged mastery of the world’s oceans, a position it continues to occupy 70 years later. Today, China is emerging as a potential competitor. In this volume, David Gompert asks what these earlier contests can tell us about that which is now on the horizon. History teaches many lessons. The difficulty is picking the right one. Well aware of this, David offers herein reflections on three encounters between rising and declining sea powers. Two of these ended in war, that between Germany and the United Kingdom in 1914 and between Japan and the United States in 1941. The third, that between the United Kingdom and the United States, led to a gradual and largely amicable transfer of first regional and then global predominance from one navy to the other. None of these outcomes is particularly appealing, as David Gompert’s analysis makes clear. Must America ultimately fight for iv Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific or cede its naval primacy? If one projects recent Chinese and Ameri- can economic growth rates several decades into the future, it becomes hard to envisage how one outcome or the other can be avoided. How long would an otherwise preeminent China be content to see a smaller, poorer, less powerful rival dominate the world’s sea-lanes? How long would an otherwise weaker America wish to guard global trade routes for China’s trade at America’s expense? These are the questions with which this important study grapples. Of course, China may not continue growing faster than America. After all, Japan did not. Even if China does, will it inevitably choose to challenge America’s maritime superiority? Maritime competition between the United States and China is already being shaped by new cyber, space, and other technologies of which Admirals Nelson, von Tirpitz, and Yamamoto never dreamed. The geo-political and geo-economic environment in which this com- petition is waged has also evolved. Never in human history have the benefits of peace, in terms of rapidly improving material well-being, been so great, nor the consequences of war, in terms of nuclear devas- tation, been so catastrophic. As a result, interstate conflict has become exceedingly rare. Indeed, no two major powers have gone to war with each other in more than half a century. Great nations still compete for power, influence, and wealth, but do so upon a somewhat differ- ent set of assumptions about the risks of conflict and the rewards of cooperation. For these reasons, it would be imprudent to assume that Sino- American naval rivalry must end like any of those cited in this volume. It would be equally imprudent, however, to assume otherwise, as this study makes clear. The past may not chart the future, but it’s the only map we have. Maritime competition with China will almost certainly increase over the coming years. At the very least, China will challenge American dominance of the seas immediately adjacent to it. David Gompert illuminates herein the prospects for that contest in the light of current and future capabilities, existing American and Chinese strat- egies, and the prior experience of such great-power rivalries. v Preface The idea for this book originated during research done by the author and Phil Saunders of the National Defense University on the mutual strategic vulnerabilities of China and the United States. That work, which culminated in The Paradox of Power: Sino-American Strategic Restraint in an Era of Vulnerability (National Defense University Press, 2012), proposed measures the two powers could take to reduce the dan- gers of conflict in the nuclear, anti-satellite, and cyber-war domains. But it left dangling one problem, arguably as important: the maritime domain—in particular, the looming competition and potential con- frontation between Chinese and American sea power in the Western Pacific and adjacent seas. Just as that region has entered a period of change, owing to China’s expanding power, so is the nature of sea power changing. As a consequence, great uncertainty surrounds the question of who will control these vital waters—a question of importance for the United States, China, the rest of the region, and the world. With global eco- nomic integration, reliance on sea-borne trade and sea-based resources is growing. So is interest in cooperative maritime security, an idea advanced by the world’s leading naval power, the United States. At the same time, technology is increasing the vulnerability of naval vessels and shipping on the oceans’ surface. If the latter development means that the maritime domain may become less secure, the former develop- ment suggests an alternative to maritime competition and confronta- tion. Indeed, the rush of technology could push rivals at sea to become partners at sea instead. vi Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific With regard to both developments, the future relationship between American and Chinese sea power—in classical terms, the “established power” and the “rising power”—is central, especially in East Asian waters. This study explores that relationship along several dimensions: theoretical, historical, economic, geo-political, and tech- nological. It does so from the standpoint of U.S. interests, though with an eye on Chinese and other foreign interests. The imperative of mari- time security and the challenge of vulnerability are not unique to the United States or to the Western Pacific. However, it is on U.S. interests in the Western Pacific that changes in sea power may have their first big effects. This study comes at a time of heightened recognition of the importance of this region to the world and to the United States. Its findings should be of interest to policymakers, opinion makers, practi- tioners, and scholars involved in any aspect of Sino-American relations, Asian affairs, naval and maritime questions, or political-military issues in general. While the issues are complex, the author has tried to present them in an accessible way.

The Future of Mahan’s Ideas.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 187 xi Summary American power in the Western Pacific has been, is, and will remain largely defined by sea power. Yet China views nearby U.S. sea power as a menacing presence, a counterweight to its regional interests, and a potential barrier to its access to the world’s oceans, resources, and markets. It is therefore deploying anti-ship missiles, submarines, and other capabilities that threaten the U.S. surface fleet. China is also expanding its own naval forces in East Asian waters to back its ter- ritorial claims, secure its trade approaches, and extend its influence. Because this vital region could become unstable or fall under China’s sway if U.S. sea power recedes or is allowed to become vulnerable, the United States can be expected to react to this challenge. Thus, a classic case of an established sea power resisting a rising one is shaping up in the Western Pacific. Such rivalries have a way of ending up in confrontation and war. Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914), widely recognized as the father of sea-power theory, held that a world power needs overseas access to raw materials and markets to expand its production beyond its consump- tion and thus grow stronger. Observing how Great Britain’s “outsized” Royal Navy enabled its industrial, commercial, and imperial success, he concluded that sea power is key to world power. In turn, sea power demands national—not just naval—consciousness, consensus, com- mitment, and stamina. As Mahan saw it, rivalry between sea powers is inherent in Darwinian world power-politics. Any sea power worth its salt must be able both to safeguard its maritime access (sea control) and, if need be, to disrupt the access of its rivals (sea denial). The core of xii Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific sea power, Mahan argued, is the offensive strength of the concentrated battle fleet. Mahan’s ideas shaped the great sea-power rivalries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His The Influence of Sea Power upon History was compulsory reading for German and Japanese officers, and propo- nents of American imperialism, notably Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Randolph Hearst, appropriated his theories to make their case. Having established continental control and devel- oped an industrial economy, the United States turned to sea power in order to obtain possessions, achieve world power, and rid its hemi- sphere of foreign presence. Great Britain, the dominant sea power of the time, chose not to oppose U.S. sea power because it faced more severe dangers elsewhere and competing demands for resources and social reform at home. Imperial Germany directly challenged British sea supremacy, which was seen as a threat to its overseas access and an impediment to becom- ing a world power. London regarded the combination of Germany’s hegemonic potential in Europe and its challenge to British sea power as a strategic threat and responded by further strengthening the Royal Navy and aligning with its old enemy and Europe’s weaker power, France. Anglo-German animosity, stoked by the race to build dread- noughts, contributed to conditions that led to World War I. Although sea power did not decide that war’s outcome, the pattern Mahan posited of rising powers challenging established ones resumed, now in the Pacific. Japan’s sinking of the Russian fleet in the Strait of Tsushima in 1905 had already signaled its arrival as a great, if regional, sea power. With Britain fatigued and America isolationist in the 1920s, Japan sought control of East Asian waters to acquire possessions, mar- kets, and resources needed to sustain its own industrialization. Japan relentlessly expanded its navy, built a formidable force of aircraft car- riers, and honed the skills of its skippers and sailors. Belatedly, the United States responded by increasing and deploying its fleet forward in the 1930s, threatening the lifelines on which Japan depended to pursue conquests and expand its war-making capacity. Japan felt com- pelled to attack Pearl Harbor. America’s industrial might and superior Summary xiii aircraft carriers prevailed, annihilating Japan’s sea power and, ironi- cally, making it dependent thereafter on that of its victor. Of these three cases, the most encouraging, obviously, is the Anglo-American one, which ended not in war but in maritime coexis- tence, cooperation, and eventual alliance. However, the United States is not about to defer to China in East Asia as Britain deferred to America in the Western Hemisphere. At the other extreme, the violent climax of Japanese-American sea-power rivalry does not ordain a similar result for China and the United States; after all, China is not engaged in aggression and the United States has not threatened to sever its sea links, as in the Japanese-American case. The Anglo-German case, which also ended badly, seems more analogous to the Sino-American case. This raises the question of how Britain and Germany might have resolved their rivalry peacefully and even cooperatively. In fact, British and German statesmen lacked the vision and political clout to resist the drive of their naval strategists, build on common interests in maritime security, and thus avert a costly arms race and, perhaps, war. More fundamentally, neither Britain’s strategy of wielding the threat to deny sea access to any adversary nor Germany’s determination to negate that British threat permitted com- promise. For China and the United States today, the Anglo-German dreadnought race is a cautionary tale. Today, while the United States and China have convergent global interests, they are at loggerheads in East Asia, from Korea to Taiwan to Southeast Asia. Given the importance of U.S. sea power to regional security and American influence, conditions seem set for the sort of rivalry that ended in violence in the Anglo-German and U.S.-Japanese cases. China’s vast claims in the resource-rich South China and East China Seas are causing U.S. allies and others to look to the United States for backing. Despite common Chinese and U.S. interests in maritime security—95 percent of China’s trade and 90 percent of U.S. trade is sea-borne—a clash between the rising and established sea powers is brewing in East Asian waters. While the Chinese have not embraced global sea power, in Mahan’s sense of the term, they are moving from coastal defense to extending their naval reach into disputed water to protection of trade routes. They xiv Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific are also collaborating with U.S. and other navies to combat piracy off Africa’s east coast; but such modest endeavors, far from the Western Pacific, in no way imply Chinese acceptance of U.S. naval strike forces near China. Of greatest concern, the Chinese are exploiting informa- tion technology—for sensing, networking, and guiding platforms and weapons—to improve and extend their targeting of surface ships with missiles, submarines, and cyber weapons. (In contrast, Chinese air- craft carriers will present a negligible threat to the U.S. fleet and be quite vulnerable.) While the Chinese are presently concentrating on such anti-naval—essentially sea-denial—capabilities, these constitute sea power no less than traditional surface naval forces do. Sea power, after all, is not power upon the sea but power of the sea—a distinction Mahan did not make in his world of battleships and gunnery. Defending surface fleets against extended-range missiles and quiet submarines is difficult, expensive, and of diminishing utility in the face of China’s accelerating anti-naval build-up. With technologies at hand, neither ballistic missile defense nor anti-submarine warfare can keep up with the offensive enhancements of a large, capable, and resolute rival. Because of their strike capabilities and importance in U.S. military intervention in East Asia, U.S. aircraft carriers are in the crosshairs of Chinese strategy and Chinese weapons. Both Mahan’s 19th-century dictum that the key to sea power is concentrated naval force and the 20th century’s application of that dictum—the carrier— are being overtaken by 21st-century targeting and networking technol- ogy. As the battleship became vulnerable to and marginalized by the aircraft carrier by World War II, missiles and submarines will endanger the aircraft carrier and its primacy in the Western Pacific in the years to come. The U.S. Navy, in cooperation with the U.S. Air Force, is responding to this adverse trend with preparations to counter China’s anti-naval and other anti-access capabilities, under the heading “Air- Sea Battle.” While this is an option worth having, using it would be escalatory, in that most targets are on Chinese territory. It could also be destabilizing, given that it would be most effective if employed at the very outset of a conflict, thus increasing China’s incentive to strike first and early, or even preemptively. Moreover, because Air-Sea Battle Summary xv relies on computer networks for command, control, and targeting, it is exposed to Chinese cyber-attacks. It is a potentially risky military strategy on which the United States ought not to depend, and it will not solve the vulnerability problem. If there is a technological remedy, it lies in outflanking Chinese targeting, figuratively speaking. Taking full advantage of network- ing, the United States can and should shift toward more distributed, numerous, diverse, elusive, small, long-range, and hard-to-find naval strike forces, while also exploiting two promising offensive technolo- gies: drones and cyber-war. A more survivable U.S. strike posture along these lines would be neither escalatory nor destabilizing. Rather, by facing China with a far more complex targeting challenge, it would discourage Chinese preemptive attack, obviate the need for U.S. pre- emptive attack, and allow time for a crisis to be defused. Carriers will remain invaluable for the United States in other regions and will surely remain in its global fleet; but their vulnerability is becoming an opera- tional liability in the Western Pacific. As this reality becomes apparent, the carrier’s potency in East Asian politics will also recede. Conversely, more survivable, if less conspicuous, U.S. sea power would sustain U.S. influence and interests in the region. Eventually, even more distributed and less visible U.S. forces may be targetable, especially with the advent of cyber-war. By that time, U.S. sea power and thus U.S. influence and war-fighting ability in the Western Pacific may be eclipsed by Chinese anti-naval and naval forces. In any case, the United States is unlikely to shift rapidly to more sur- vivable sea power, given the long lead-times required, fiscal constraints, and institutional-industrial inertia. Given technological trends, an unfavorable time-line, and the fact that the United States cannot retreat from the waters of this vital region, it should also pursue a political alternative to head-to-head sea-power rivalry—one that engages its regional partners and, ide- ally, China itself. With the rapid expansion of sea-borne commerce and sea-based resource extraction that has accompanied globalization, the idea of collective maritime security, first championed by Admiral Mike Mullen (in 2005, when he was Chief of Naval Operations), has gained momentum in a number of regions other than East Asia. If the xvi Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific targeting and networking revolutions invalidate Mahan’s prescription for concentrated naval power, U.S. leadership in organizing coopera- tive maritime security in East Asia may invalidate his premise that sea power is necessarily adversarial. Even as the dominant sea power, the United States cannot provide sea control in every ocean, littoral, and choke-point where it is needed in today’s world. Just as the United States is capitalizing on its strength at sea to mobilize and lead others toward cooperative maritime security elsewhere, it should try to do so in the Western Pacific, where the stakes are greatest. More specifically, the United States should propose and pursue an East Asian maritime partnership, inviting to join all states that share its interest in assured access and passage. Such cooperation could be pred- icated on the norms that disputes should be settled nonviolently and that civilian shipping engaged in peaceful, peacetime trade should not be threatened. These norms could be buttressed by enhanced maritime information-sharing, crisis consultations, joint exercises and operations (e.g., against non-state threats), and measures to avoid incidents. Real- istically, resolving the region’s complex maritime legal disputes should not be a precondition for creating or joining the partnership; but a pledge to refrain from force in the meantime should be. Neither the United States nor China would be expected to reduce its sea-power capabilities or relinquish any of its options in the event of war. While such undertakings would not preclude naval/anti-naval competition or conflict outright, they could reduce mistrust and mistakes of the sort that are more likely than rational forethought to trigger Sino-U.S. hostilities. The goal of East Asian maritime cooperation would not be to exclude China but instead to convince it to join. The participation of the region’s increasingly capable navies would encourage China to join and bolster a multilateral approach to security or else to oppose and divorce itself from a formidable naval grouping. Apart from China, a number of East Asian states are developing some of the world’s most advanced naval and anti-naval forces; while the United States and China’s oceanic neighbors should not seek to align against China, China should take care not to give them cause to do so by rejecting a cooperative arrangement. Indications that some Chinese are getting Summary xvii worried about regional isolation—owing to China’s growing power and assertiveness—could enable its political leaders to overrule the almost certain opposition of its military. Thus, the United States can at least open the door to the sort of maritime cooperation that eluded British and German statesmen before rivalry at sea became too intense to halt. It might well be that Chinese nationalism, weak civilian control of the military, and suspi- cion of American motives would make China’s accession unlikely, at least for now. Chinese ambivalence toward Sino-American military-to- military contacts over the years suggests a need for American patience and persistence. A cooperative approach to maritime security in East Asia may be a long shot and might get watered down (forgive the pun). But the advantages of an arrangement that could build familiarity and confidence while reducing dangers at sea are substantial. Moreover, as noted, the United States would not limit its capabilities or its freedom of action in the event of war. It is a high-return, low-risk idea worth trying. In parallel, technology permits the United States to transform its sea-power posture in the Western Pacific to one more survivable, operationally and politically, whether maritime cooperation ensues or not. In sum, the United States should move beyond dependence on concentrated surface forces while also pursuing a cooperative alterna- tive to history’s classic reaction to a rising sea power. China and the United States have powerful reasons to avoid confrontation and the risk of war in East Asia. Because growing capabilities for sea denial may deprive both of assured sea control, the pursuit of strategic advan- tage at sea may leave both with diminished security at sea. The United States has technological and political options that, in tandem, can add crisis stability, lessen the intensity of sea-power rivalry, and reduce the danger of conflict, even as it shifts toward a posture that would enable it to prevail were conflict with China to occur. xix Acknowledgments The author thanks several people for their inspiration and help in the thinking and effort that went into this book. L. Paul Bremer, a col- league and friend of many decades, was the first to pose what turned out to be two pivotal questions: How might the British have averted naval rivalry and then confrontation with Imperial Germany in the years prior to World War I? What can we learn from their failure to do so that could shed light on how the United States ought to deal with China? In reading and discussing drafts of this book, Ambassador Bremer provided incisive and constructive criticism. Likewise, James Dobbins, another “old” associate and friend, was a source of penetrating questions and original ideas regarding all three of the historical cases, as well as the Sino-American case at hand. As it turns out, Ambassador Dobbins is as good at history as he is at diplo- macy and policymaking. His support in lining up the resources that enabled this work to be done is much appreciated, as is his willingness to write the book’s Foreword—a fine essay in its own right. A goodly share of the understanding of Chinese thinking and strategy that informs this book is the result of the author’s collabo- ration with Phillip Saunders of the National Defense University. While he may not agree with all of the analysis and findings here, Dr. Saunders will see that the influence of his writings and our conver- sations is significant. Nothing beats getting tough reviews from well-qualified peers to push an author to improve his analysis and writing. I was fortunate that David Shlapak of RAND and Lawrence Cavaiola of the United States Naval Academy were meticulous and thoughtful in their reactions xx Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific to earlier versions of this work. Both questioned important assump- tions and conclusions. If the final product is thought to be good, they deserve a lot of the credit. For their able research assistance, I also want to thank Samuel Berkowitz and Celene von Dutzman, both of whom provided signifi- cant input and a keen eye for accuracy and clarity. If, despite all such help, this book contains any errors of detail or logic, they are the author’s alone. xxi Abbreviations A2 anti-access A2AD anti-access, area-denial AD area-denial ASAT anti-satellite ASW anti-submarine warfare BMD ballistic missile defense C4ISR command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance GDP gross domestic product PACOM U.S. Pacific Command PLA People’s Liberation Army PLAN PLA Navy WMD weapons of mass destruction 1 Chapter One Introduction “Command of the sea is not ‘naval.’ It is one of national policy, national security, and national obligation.” —A. T. Mahan1 Sea Power and the Western Pacific: Importance, Scope, and Definition Since Commodore Matthew Perry arrived, uninvited, with a squadron of U.S. warships in Edo (now Tokyo) Bay in 1854, American Pacific power has been defined by American sea power.2 It was sea power that enabled the United States to assert itself in these waters and lands around them in the late 1800s. During the 20th century, U.S. fleets patrolled and, when called upon, controlled the Western Pacific, con- firming that the United States has a Pacific calling to go with its Atlan- tic heritage. Today, with its heavy reliance on East Asian products and markets, the economic interests of the United States in the region are greater than ever. The Asia-Pacific share of total U.S. trade has risen from 5 percent in 1900 to 15 percent in 1950 to 30 percent today, larger even than U.S. trade with the rest of North America.3 Meanwhile, China’s rise as a great power presents the United States with both the risk of regional strife and the chance for global cooperation. As the United States recovers from its decade-long preoc- cupation with extremist threats in the Middle East and South Asia and 1 Alfred T. Mahan, “The Importance of Command of the Sea: For an Adequate Navy, and More,” Scientific American, Vol. 105, No. 24, December 1911, p. 512. 2 Japan’s leaders acquiesced in Perry’s visit because they thought the country was defenseless. 3 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012 Statistical Abstract, Washington, D.C., 2012. 2 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific turns its attention to East Asia, it is again sea power, though in forms yet unsettled, that will lend strength to the United States’ diplomacy and its ability to wage war if need be. At this juncture, it is important to assess the implications of China’s growing power, depending on how it is used, for America’s renewed interests, depending on how they are defined. Although the sea is only one of the domains in which Chinese power affects U.S. interests, it is as crucial as any, and the subject of this book. At times, including ours, the United States has sought and gained predominant sea power, hence sea control—defined by two prominent 20th-century proponents of sea power as “the ability to use the sea in defiance of rivals.”4 In a vast region of capable nation-states and eco- nomic vitality, where sea-borne trade is crucial, a policy of sea control can invite challenge: After all, one state’s sea control can be seen by others as a threat to their own access, i.e., sea denial. Because these time-weathered terms are still useful, if sometimes misunderstood, it is worth clarifying them up front. In essence, sea control is defensive, and sea denial is offensive. The former is the abil- ity to assure continuous freedom to navigate in any and all important waters of choice. The latter is the ability or action at least temporarily to deny others access to waters considered important.5 Because the ulti- mate purpose of oceanic access is trade, sea control, strictly speaking, is meant to protect shipping, and sea denial is meant to menace it. For our purposes, control includes being able safely to operate one’s navy where one wishes, and denial includes being able to endanger and dis- rupt such naval operations. Sea control is not the mirror image of sea denial. It is theoreti- cally possible, if practically unlikely, to have sea control without being able to exercise sea denial—to enjoy yet not be able to prevent access. 4 E. B. Potter and Chester W. Nimitz, Sea Power: A Naval History, Upper Saddle River, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1960. 5 Thanks to Michael McDevitt for an explanation of this important distinction, in “The PLA Navy’s Antiaccess Role in a Taiwan Contingency,” in Phillip Saunders, Christopher Yung, Michael Swaine, and Andrew Nien-Dzu Yang, eds., The Chinese Navy: Expanding Capabilities, Evolving Roles, Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 2011, pp. 191–214. Introduction 3 Conversely, sea denial does not require sea control, since even with- out assured access there are ways—land-based missiles, for instance— to disrupt an adversary’s access.6 In view of technological trends and Western Pacific geography, we will see that this distinction is of con- sequence, and that technology is affecting sea control and sea denial differently. At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between sea con- trol and sea denial, in that the naval capabilities with which a power assures its own access can also be used to deny access to others. The submarine or aircraft carrier that secures a patch of ocean for one’s own use can also threaten its use by others. From the Chinese perspec- tive, there is a strong relationship between U.S. sea control and U.S. sea denial in the Western Pacific today, as there was from the Japanese perspective prior to World War II. Imperial Japan viewed American sea power as such a threat to its access to vital raw materials that it felt compelled to go to war. Because the Japanese, correctly, interpreted U.S. strategy as aimed at sea control and sea denial, they attacked the main instrument of both at Pearl Harbor. In the war thus begun, supe- rior American industrial might and naval prowess brought about the destruction of Japanese aircraft carriers in high-seas battles of unprec- edented scale and fury.7 Ironically, the elimination of Japan’s sea power left it dependent on the very American sea power it tried and failed to eliminate. China, the United States, and the Dynamic of Sea Power How China interprets and counters U.S. sea power and whether and how the United States can and should try to maintain both sea con- 6 As an historical example, the Soviet Union could not have achieved sea control but, largely through the use of land-based air power, had modest success in constricting the U.S. Navy’s access to waters within striking distance of its territory. 7 Of course, it was not U.S. naval power alone but its combination with unstoppable island- hopping land-force power and strategic-bombing that brought down Japan’s war-fighting and war-making capabilities. Historians still argue about whether U.S. nuclear weapons were essential to cause Japan to surrender. 4 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific trol and sea denial in the Western Pacific are questions this book will attempt to answer. At the same time, technological change is com- plicating these questions: In the late 19th century, the best weapon against the battleship was another battleship; in the middle of the 20th century, the surest way to sink an aircraft carrier was with planes from another aircraft carrier. As the result of major and continuing increases in the range and fidelity of sensors, communications, and weapons, these simple equations have fractured. The capabilities a sea power uses to assure its access are not necessarily the only or even best ones to deny another power’s access. It no longer takes a carrier to sink a carrier. The U.S. Navy is as indispensable as ever to the ability of the United States to conduct its business, secure its interests, fulfill its responsibilities, and maintain stability in this region (and other regions) of critical importance to the American and global economies. Although China and the United States are not inevitable enemies, especially as long as they are economic partners, the expansion of Chinese power is prompting many Asian nations to look to American resolve and muscle for reassurance. Questions have arisen about whether China will become both able and determined to challenge American sea power: able because of its stunning economic and technological development; determined because it sees the U.S. Navy as threatening to Chinese ter- ritory, regional interests, and global access. As we will see, Chinese writings on this matter do not provide clear evidence of intent to wrest control of the Western Pacific from the United States and its fleet.8 Defending mainland China and prevent- ing U.S. intervention in the event of conflict over Taiwan have thus far been the most explicit purposes declared by the Chinese. Yet the requirements of even these limited objectives are causing the Chinese to extend the reach of their naval and anti-naval forces farther and farther into the Pacific, at least to the so-called First Island Chain.9 In addition, China has displayed a willingness to use naval force to 8 Daniel M. Hartnett and Frederic Vellucci, “Toward a Maritime Security Strategy: An Analysis of Chinese Views Since the Early 1990s,” in Saunders et al., eds., 2011, pp. 81–108. 9 The First Island Chain is the southern tip of Japan through the Philippines. The Second Island Chain includes Japan, Marianas, and Guam. Introduction 5 back its claims in disputes over territorial demarcations and maritime rights.10 By implication, American sea denial will not be tolerable to China in the Western Pacific’s nearest and most important waters: the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Yellow Sea. By further implication, China may be moving, albeit slowly, toward a posture of sea denial in the Western Pacific, which would be equally unacceptable to the United States. Assured access of U.S. shipping and naval forces to East Asian waters is as important as it has ever been. Even in their boldest formulations, the Chinese see naval ambi- tion and competition mainly in regional terms.11 Chinese strategists and leaders have not articulated a commitment to, or even a firm grasp of, sea power in the classical sense. Unlike Great Britain, the United States, Imperial Germany, and Imperial Japan, China has not elevated sea strategy to the level of grand strategy—that is, so essential to national well-being and world standing as to warrant building and operating a blue-water fleet with strike power and transoceanic reach. But China may be drawn in this direction as its access to the world’s commodities, markets, and thus oceans grows in strategic importance. Beyond trade, the increasing value and expected abundance of resources in and under the seas have added another incentive to gain and use sea power— whether competitively or collaboratively is unclear—especially for rap- idly developing economies such as China and its East Asian neighbors. For these reasons, rather than be dissuaded if the United States seeks to remain dominant in the Western Pacific, the Chinese could be all the more determined to break that dominance. Whether China sprints or sidles toward sea-power status and strategy, it is yet to be seen whether and when it can organize the req- uisite operational capabilities. Modern China is a land power, not a “seafaring nation” in the mold of the United States, Great Britain, and formerly Japan, Spain, and France.12 Even if ample resources and tech- 10 In fairness to China, other East Asian states, e.g., Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines, have also dispatched naval vessels on occasion to back up their claims. 11 Hartnett and Vellucci, 2011. 12 Others deserving of the description of a seafaring nation include Portugal, Australia, Chile, the Netherlands, and Norway. 6 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific nology are applied, there are requisites of doctrine, expertise, seaman- ship, and safety to meet. Sea power must be institutionalized, not just constructed. Naval “hardware” is no better than the “software” that runs it, at sea and at home. It took Imperial Germany, another emerg- ing land power, from roughly 1880 to 1914 to marshal the know-how and confidence to confront British sea power (and even then without success).13 That the Soviet Union, despite massive investment, never seri- ously challenged American sea control in the Pacific or Atlantic illus- trates the difficulty a great land power faces in operating naval forces against more seasoned sea powers. China faces many hurdles—naval architecture, integrating new technology, underway-replenishment skills, basing options, and able sailors, from deckhands to admirals— that will take a generation or more to overcome, especially if it means to have a blue-water navy of its own. Yet, acquiring sea power, and being a sea power, does not neces- sarily mean having and using power upon the sea. Theory, as we will see, suggests that sea power is the ability to exert power over what occurs at sea—or power of the sea. When those theories were offered in the 19th century, extant technology and capabilities made power upon the sea—notably, grand battle fleets—necessary if not sufficient to have power of the sea. Nowadays, power from elsewhere—under the sea, over the sea, from land, from space, and through “cyber-space”—can be used to exert sea denial, if not to maintain sea control. Thus, even with no grand fleet, presently or eventually, China (and others) can have sea power. Indeed, it is China’s current commitment to anti-naval capabilities, sea-based and otherwise, that make our topic more urgent than waiting to see whether China builds a blue-water navy. By proper definition, China is already creating sea power and challenging Ameri- can sea power, whether or not it tries to replicate U.S. naval forces. Likewise, how the United States responds to this Chinese chal- lenge may involve forms of sea power unlike the naval forces on which it has relied and relies today. While the forms of both Chinese and U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific may be untraditional, the purposes will 13 Peter M. Swartz, “Rising Powers and Naval Powers,” in Saunders et al., eds., 2011, pp. 1–22. Introduction 7 essentially be those that have motivated sea powers traditionally: to assure or deny access for shipping and navies. As the Chinese consider how best to gain sea power, it is important that today’s naval force not be an anchor on American thinking. Even as China becomes a sea power, in familiar or new ways, his- tory indicates that Sino-American naval rivalry and conflict are not inevitable. The cases of Great Britain and Germany before World War I and of the United States and Japan before World War II show that naval competition can end in hostilities. But the case of Great Britain and the United States in the late 1800s suggests that an established and a rising sea power may evolve into co-existence, cooperation, and even, when confronted by common enemies, alliance. If the past is a guide, it is a mix of entangled interests, relative naval strength, and competi- tive hubris that determines whether sea powers collide or collaborate. Technological Change Today’s U.S. Navy has powerful offensive naval capabilities. In con- trast, given its current aims and limitations, China is concentrating on defensive, or anti-naval, capabilities. Again, technology is funda- mentally altering the relationship between offense and defense, and thus between denial and control of the sea. In particular, improve- ments in targeting are posing increasingly severe threats to surface ves- sels within range of new sensors and weapons. Consequently, naval strength, which has historically been equated with surface warships, may be trumped by anti-surface capabilities, such as long-range mis- siles guided from space against targets tracked from space. In response, the key capabilities in sea power may soon shift from surface fleets to capabilities under and above the seas, as well as drones. Compounding these new developments is the prospect that sea power will be endan- gered or even redefined by cyber power, targeting computerized com- mand and control systems. Already, concentrated battle-fleets are being replaced by distributed networks of ships and sensors, at once necessi- tated by the vulnerability and enabled by the networking that informa- tion technology provides. 8 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific While the U.S. Navy is grappling with the effects of these techno- logical changes, it could be an even bigger challenge for Chinese naval forces, given China’s inexperience and U.S. advantages in targeting. Even if China is determined and able to become a sea power, it may discover that traditional surface forces, acquired at great cost in money and time, are not survivable—and perhaps not necessary. From their writings and investments, we know the Chinese are aware of the impli- cations of advances in targeting and networking: They are exploiting these very technologies to threaten the U.S. surface fleet in the Western Pacific. The impact of long-range precision-guided weapons is a con- sideration that will weigh both on the Chinese as they decide how to pursue sea power and on the Americans as they decide how to maintain sea power in the Western Pacific. The particular problem of sea denial in the Western Pacific is a subset of a larger challenge faced by the United States, given its general reliance on power projection to and throughout this distant region. The Chinese are employing a variety of technologies to achieve what in strategic jargon are called “anti-access” (A2) and “area-denial” (AD) capabilities with missiles, air, naval, anti-satellite, and cyber-war weapon systems. (Hereafter, A2 + AD = A2AD—now a popular mili- tary acronym.) U.S. air bases, facilities, and land forces stationed in or dispatched to the region are also becoming more vulnerable. However, because U.S. sea power figures centrally in U.S. strategy, influence, and possible operations in the Western Pacific, it is with this particular vulnerability that this study deals. Thus, technology is changing and even revolutionizing how we conceive sea power, sea denial, and sea control. It is making important the distinction between power of the sea and power upon the sea. Pres- ently, it is shifting the balance between defense and offense at sea in favor of the former, making control harder and denial easier. Technol- ogy also means that rival sea powers of the 21st century, unlike those of the 19th and 20th, need not and most likely will not try to mimic each other’s naval forces in kind or size. The response of Imperial Germany to British sea power was to build a High Seas Fleet that could chal- lenge the Royal Navy by resembling the Royal Navy: After all, it took battleships to sink battleships, until submarines and airplanes entered Introduction 9 the picture. Likewise, Imperial Japan and the United States each built more and more, and bigger and bigger, aircraft carriers as the best and perhaps only sure way of neutralizing the other’s aircraft carriers. Now, by reducing the importance of proximity of forces, technology— notably sensor, missile, and global communications technology—is superseding such same-for-same linkage. It follows that competition between rising and established sea powers, like China and the United States, will probably be asymmetri- cal, though not necessarily less heated than the naval arms races of old. Apostles of American sea power would be unwise to take great comfort in the fact that China is not building a large carrier fleet—and unwise to take great comfort in the large carrier fleet the United States can deploy in the Western Pacific. The Oceanic Commons Just as technology is changing the nature of sea power, globalization is changing its assumptions. Relationships between states with power- ful fleets, or between established and rising powers, have been largely competitive since the era of mercantilism and competing imperial ambitions—indeed, since ancient times. As we will argue, economic integration and dramatic growth in sea-borne trade have made the oceans a “commons” of an interdependent world. All who depend on these commons share an interest in uninterrupted and unthreatened flows of energy fuels, raw materials, parts, and goods. The growth of direct overseas investment, multinational production, interwoven supply chains, and declining self-sufficiency makes it counterproduc- tive to interfere with the sea-borne trade of other nations, which his- torically has been a strong motivation for sea power. Whether common interests in maritime security will supersede competitive, distrust- ful impulses could be a pivotal issue in the relationship of U.S. and Chinese sea power. If any major country has benefited more from global economic integration than the United States, it is China. World trade has enabled China to expand production far beyond what domestic demand would 10 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific justify, which has in turn created the industrial and technological capacities to allow China to be a major sea power, whatever form that may take. Yet, globalization has also given rise to non-state actors, such as pirates and terrorists, who might interrupt these flows or else traffic by sea in drugs, humans, fighters, weapons, and other illicit cargoes. Likewise, rogue states, with or without traditional navies, might use new technologies and daring tactics to disrupt or misuse the mari- time commons. This has caused the United States, notwithstanding its naval superiority, increasingly to stress collective maritime security, as we will see.14 China, too, has much to gain from such cooperation, even if it means collaborating with U.S. naval forces to protect maritime inter- ests that it and the United States share. Thus, even as China and the United States may be drawn toward competitive sea power, they may also be drawn toward cooperative sea power. If it were not for great- power politics and mistrust, China might elect to rely on American sea power to patrol and keep open the sea-lanes on which it depends. Keep in mind that until the late 19th century, when American leaders deter- mined that global ambition demanded sea power, the United States depended on the Royal Navy to maintain maritime security, even in the Western Hemisphere. Although there is no explicit indication that the Chinese prefer to “free ride” on U.S. worldwide naval dominance, they are in fact a beneficiary of the security that the U.S. Navy pro- vides along oil-supply routes from the Persian Gulf to East Asia. More- over, if China rejects maritime cooperation, perhaps out of distrust of the United States, it may encourage even closer cooperation between the United States and others, including two other naval powers, Japan and India. While the Chinese might believe that these others will side with the United States anyway, some in China are concerned about its isolation. If China were to cooperate with and, by implication, depend on American sea power, it would risk being disadvantaged if cooperation 14 Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Naval Operations, “A Global Network of Nations for a Free and Secure Maritime Commons,” speech at Naval War College, Newport, R.I., Sep- tember 2005. Introduction 11 breaks down and the United States uses its sea power to contain and deny China access. Does China want to gamble on U.S. acceptance of the Kantian logic of common security, even as U.S. capabilities permit it instead to follow the Hobbesian logic of raw power? Geo-Politics Interest in common maritime security may be on the rise, but it has not replaced sea-power politics. In both China and the United States, there is plenty of doubt about the other’s true calculations and intentions: Is China content to see the United States remain the dominant sea power in the Western Pacific? Probably not. Might the United States take advantage of its sea dominance to threaten injury to Chinese interests in a crisis? Presumably. Would China exploit a decline of U.S. sea power to increase its influence over East Asia? Likely. Would the United States regard growing Chinese naval capabilities as a contribution to common maritime security? Almost certainly not. Would either regard the oth- er’s sea power as interchangeable with its own in confronting threats to common interests? Emphatically not. In short, the Western Pacific is and will remain an oceanic space in which the world’s two strongest powers each view the other’s presence as potentially inimical. One of the most important features of geo-politics in the West- ern Pacific is that these two powers are not alone. A tenet of sea-power theory has been to ally with friendly states that augment naval capabili- ties or provide bases and welcoming ports.15 The United States enjoys close political and security relations with some capable mid-level Asian naval powers, such as Japan, Australia, and now India. The harder China presses its maritime claims and ambitions, the more these and other East Asians will look to the United States and its navy. This is already becoming a countervailing factor—politically, at least—for the growing strength of China, whose assertiveness in recent years has reju- 15 Alfred T. Mahan, Naval Strategy: Compared and Contrasted with the Principles and Prac- tice of Military Operations on Land, London: Sampson Low, Marston, and Company, 1911, pp. 118–131. 12 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific venated U.S. alliances that enable and supplement U.S. sea power from Northeast Asia to the Indian Ocean. In addition, the United States and China themselves are suscep- tible to shifting geo-political pressures that could affect their respec- tive commitments to sea power in the Western Pacific. Just as the United States turned its strategic orientation from Europe during the Cold War to the Middle East in the post-9/11 decade and lately to the Pacific, it could turn again. For example, if the Persian Gulf fell under threat from Iran, U.S. military options would rest on naval, as well as land-based, air-strike capabilities. Barring another massive U.S. defense build-up, this could divert forces, resources, and attention from the Western Pacific, leaving China less vulnerable and perhaps bolder. China’s shift from an ancient land power to would-be sea power has been a part of a larger strategic swivel from its rivalries and con- flicts with Russia and India to its push to challenge U.S. predominance at least around Taiwan and potentially in the wider Western Pacific. This too could change. Suspicions between China and India simmer, even if their border disputes have been put on the back burner by both countries.16 Although India has more immediate concerns with Paki- stan and militants affiliated with it, and China is preoccupied with the United States, Sino-Indian tensions could flare again as a result of hegemonic competition or deadly incidents that fuel persistent ani- mosities. Less likely but not excluded is the onset of Sino-Russian con- frontation over resource-rich Asiatic Russia, where Chinese migration and investment are weakening Moscow’s grip. Yet, even the resump- tion of troubles with its land neighbors would not cause China to view U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific with equanimity, especially if the United States and India formed an encircling anti-Chinese alliance. Recall that Imperial Germany had its own land adversaries when it launched its effort to end Britain’s sea dominance. If there is a flaw in established sea-power theory, it is the failure to recognize that the quest of sea power by one state can stimulate a similar quest by another, and so on in a costly spiral of worsening mari- time insecurity for both. Great Britain’s policy of maintaining naval 16 The Economist, “Smoke Without Fire?” June 2–8, 2012, p. 54. Introduction 13 strength equivalent to the sum of any other two powers’ naval strength did not dissuade Germany from mounting a major challenge: quite the opposite. Likewise, Imperial Japan’s effort to have sea power second to none in the Pacific led to a major expansion of the U.S. Navy in the late 1930s. In both cases, the urge for sea power caused competition, fanned antagonism, and helped bring on war. Is competition the dominant dynamic in the case of China and the United States? Or could it be attenuated and even replaced by an appreciation that maritime partnership in the region would leave both China and the United States more secure at lower risk, lower cost, and friendlier relations? After all, Chinese and American ships cooperate, if warily, to protect shipping from Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In East Asia, however, the Chinese have been cool and coy to U.S. overtures in such a direction, though this may not be a reason for the United States to abandon the idea. In sum, changes wrought by global economic integration, techno- logical change, China’s growing power, and shifting U.S. and Chinese geo-strategic orientations might or might not point toward the sort of collision between sea powers modern history has seen. It depends on choices made by U.S. and Chinese political leaders. Geography The future of sea power, like the history and study of sea power, is to a very large degree a function of geography. The importance of sea-based trade, the possibility of securing and disrupting this trade, the abil- ity to extract sea-based resources, the concentration and movements of naval forces, and, of course, ease of oceanic access all depend on it. Relative sea power, and thus rivalry between established and rising sea powers, is both driven and constrained by geography. Japan enjoyed an advantage over Great Britain and the United States in seeking to control the Western Pacific, as did (and does) the United States over all others in the waters of the Western Hemisphere. As true world sea powers, both Britain and America overcame the problem of distance by building and operating multi-ocean navies. 14 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Geography also determines whether passage is easy and safe, or not. Germany required access to colonies, resources, and markets through the North Atlantic, which meant passage through the con- fines of the British-patrolled North Sea. Geography forced the Soviet navy to transit narrow waters largely controlled by the United States and its allies (Norway, Denmark, the UK, Turkey, and Japan) in order to reach open ocean. “Like Germany, the Soviet Union would find its fleets bottled up in a major conflict, while those already at sea would become hostages to fortune.”17 All else being equal, powers with several wide paths to multiple seas have an advantage—thus, island powers such as Great Britain and Japan, as well as a two-ocean power like the United States.18 Geography obviously affects American and Chinese sea power in the Western Pacific. At first glance, the United States appears to be dis- advantaged by the distances its navy must travel to get to and operate in the Western Pacific. Thus, naval nuclear propulsion, at which the U.S. Navy excels, enables its carriers and submarines to reach and remain at sea virtually anywhere; but nuclear propulsion is also a constraint—an expensive one at that, given the cost of such engineering plants. How- ever, America’s apparent geographical disadvantages have been attenu- ated by the presence of reliable regional allies with deep-water harbors, modern facilities, and good navies of their own. In the Western Pacific, Japan, Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, and other allies largely offset the problem of distance, and will thus remain critical to Ameri- can sea power and interests in the region. In addition, of course, the homeland security afforded by the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has long been and will remain a major U.S. advantage, unless and until technology reduces the difficulty adversaries face in threatening American soil (as has already occurred with respect to strategic nuclear weapons and is occurring with respect to cyber-war). 17 Observation from James Dobbins of RAND. 18 Russia (and previously the Soviet Union) has been unable to turn its continental size into a sea-power advantage because of limitations on ice-free basing and the need to pass through tight choke-points in all directions. Introduction 15 Generally speaking, China has the opposite of U.S. advantages and disadvantages as far as the Western Pacific is concerned. Being on the Western Pacific, its naval forces as well as shipping in and out of China are close enough to receive at least some protection from the mainland. Insofar as its main maritime security interests are in the waters of the region, its need for a blue-water fleet, both expensive and vulnerable, is reduced. Moreover, it can use land-based sensors and weapons to track and, if need be, strike U.S. vessels in the Western Pacific, giving it sea-denial options that do not depend on traditional high-seas naval forces. But a look at the map reminds us—surely reminds the Chinese— that geography is not an unambiguous blessing for China (any more than the vastness of the Atlantic and Pacific are an unambiguous bless- ing for the United States). China has three geographic problems. First, its territory is exposed, by virtue of proximity, to threats from U.S. sea-based strike power in the Western Pacific. Unless and until China has the ability to maintain a comparable naval presence as close to the United States as U.S. naval presence is to China—or develops sensors and conventional weapons of transoceanic range, which are decades away at the soonest—it must live with this disparity. China’s second geographic problem is nearly as noticeable on the map. To reach the high seas that its fleets and shipping need to cross for access to world markets and resources—the Pacific and Indian Oceans—they must pass through relatively tight waters crowded with islands and countries that may not be sympathetic to China in crises or war. Chinese control of the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea is a daunting challenge, not to mention unacceptable to the United States and others. Beyond these waters, China’s access to the Pacific and Indian Oceans involves running a gauntlet of straits and other choke-points patrolled by U.S. forces. Small wonder that Chinese strategists tend to see access to the world and its oceans in much the same way late-19th-century Germans did: not as welcoming expanses but as harrowing narrows. The intricate geography of the Western Pacific is even more disad- vantageous to China when taking into account that most of the other states of the region are allies of the United States or, if not allies, at least 16 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific looking to the United States for security in the face of China’s grow- ing strength. Maybe the United States will allow long-standing alli- ances to decay or fail to develop new security relationships; but it seems at present determined to avoid just that. Conversely, perhaps China will earn the deference of its neighbors from Northeast to Southeast Asia; but it seems at present more likely that its growing military and naval capabilities—its A2AD and coastal fleets—will have the oppo- site effect. The starting point, by virtue of the path history has taken, is that the United States has the advantage of strong allies and expand- ing relationships, which in turn mitigates its geographic liabilities and aggravates China’s. As long as the United States maintains it presence and influence, including its sea power, in the region, China may be inclined to remedy this strategic problem by tacking away from rivalry and toward cooperation at sea. In that case, U.S. interests in the West- ern Pacific could be protected without having to confront a challenge to U.S. sea power. This introduction requires one further clarification: What is meant by “Western Pacific”? Narrowly defined, the Western Pacific is just that, and thus does not include the South China Sea, East China Sea, Yellow Sea, or other important bodies of water that wash against China and other countries in East Asia. China might be more relaxed about U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific if the U.S. Navy did not frequent the seas adjacent to China. But of course, the U.S. Navy does frequent those seas, which are more critical and more contested than the Pacific beyond them. While U.S. and Chinese sea power, includ- ing anti-naval power, might eventually vie for control of the entire Pacific, Indian, and other great oceans, the waters where maritime competition—or, perhaps, cooperation—will be most intense in the next decade or so are those near China. For our purposes, we will con- sider them to be parts, and perhaps the most important parts, of what is broadly called the Western Pacific. Introduction 17 Structure This book is about the strategic choices that American and Chinese decisionmakers face, shaped by geography, history, technology, eco- nomics, and politics. It is structured according to the factors likely to determine whether China will feel compelled to challenge U.S. sea power and interests in the Western Pacific and what the United States can and should do about it. Chapter Two reviews the theory and his- tory of sea power, including lessons from notable past rivalries and how they ended. Its point of departure—port of embarkation, if you will—is the work of American naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840–1914), whose reflections on sea power and history shaped naval strategy, capabilities, relations, and conflicts to come.19 Theory and his- tory provide the scenery for how Americans and Chinese may act out such ideas as sea control, sea denial, global reach, concentrated naval power, safeguarding versus severing sea lines of communication, and offense versus defense. As ranges of accurate weapons have increased by orders of magnitude—from a few miles for gunnery to thousands of miles for missiles—the particulars of past naval rivalries and battles become less germane. Yet, the point is not that the modern history of sea power will furnish definitive answers to the case of China and the United States, but that it may provide clues about how one power’s leaders will view and react to the other. By the end of the book, we will see which lessons from the theory and experience of sea power apply to the Sino-U.S. case despite technological change. 19 The view that Mahan was the father of sea power theory is not universally held. In For the Common Defense: A Military History of the United States from 1607 to 2012 (New York: Free Press, 2012), Allan Millet, Peter Maslowksi, and William Feis argue that Mahan mainly summed up somewhat earlier work by Admiral David Dixon Porter and Stephen D. Luce, though with the “advantages of writing eloquently and at the moment when imperialism and navalism were in full flower.” Further, Mahan was in the thrall of British sea dominance and therefore did not understand the dynamics and consequences of rivalry. Finally, he did not appreciate the importance of technology or anticipate that it would call into question some of his ideas. This author considers these criticisms to be not entirely unfair. The intent is not to exalt Mahan but to refer to ideas that were as much his as anyone’s to illuminate more recent and prospective developments concerning sea power. 18 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Chapter Three analyzes current and prospective U.S. and Chi- nese interests in the Western Pacific, Asia, and the world, insofar as they bear on sea power. How the United States and China assess each other’s capabilities and intentions, and thus set their own requirements, will be affected by how they perceive both divergent and convergent interests. Despite their interdependence and relatively compatible cur- rent global outlooks, contradictions between U.S. presence and Chi- nese aims in the region point toward the possibility of intense and potentially dangerous competition. This chapter will consider both American and Chinese perspectives and prospects regarding sea power. Chapter Four deals with the effects of technological change. As both powers seek to master and incorporate the technologies of the information revolution, sea power will have to adjust to the growing vulnerability of surface fleets and the roles of anti-naval, undersea, unmanned, space, and cyber-war capabilities. With advanced targeting making surface forces less survivable and with advanced networking offering options to distribute forces, sea denial may get easier and sea control harder. The technologies being used to improve naval and anti- naval capabilities are largely based on commercial technologies that are propelled by and spread through global markets. As China grows increasingly competitive in those markets, lasting U.S. advantages in applying technology to solve operational sea-power challenges cannot be assured or assumed. The United States holds cards it can yet play to slow the effects of Chinese advances, but it will have to play a more daring game than established sea powers or the U.S. Navy itself usu- ally does. Chapter Five considers prospects for regional cooperation in pro- viding maritime security. Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, and key Southeast Asian states have strong interests in how American and Chinese naval strategies and capabilities develop and interact. Inso- far as China is perceived as eroding U.S. naval dominance and polit- ical resolve, other regional actors could become more accommodat- ing toward China and its claims in regional waters, even leading to a Chinese sphere of influence prejudicial to U.S. interests. Alternatively, under U.S. leadership, these states could form a maritime-security coalition, which China could be invited to join. Introduction 19 Chapter Six offers conclusions about sea power in the Western Pacific in the coming two decades, based on theory and history, U.S. and Chinese interests, the course of technology, and the positions of others in the region. It suggests necessary changes in the forms of American sea power and a way to advance U.S. interests without waste- ful competition and dangerous confrontation. Both East Asia and sea power are of great and growing importance to world progress and U.S. interests. Yet both are entering periods of uncertainty and discontinuity. For the United States, the status quo has been comfortable but is not sustainable: The United States cannot dictate the path and use of technology any more than it can contain the rise of China. “Steady-as-you-go”—the order that has served regional stability and U.S. interests since World War II—has run its course. The United States faces tough choices that require bold decisions. 21 Chapter Two Theory and Lessons of History “If navies, as all agree, exist for the protection of commerce, it inevitably follows that in war they must aim at depriving their enemy of that great resource.” —A. T. Mahan1 Factors of Sea Power Sea power is the product of economics, politics, technology, and geog- raphy: necessitated by economics, textured by politics, enabled by tech- nology, and shaped by geography. From international economics comes the need to transit the oceans safely and predictably. From international politics come confrontations and hostilities that may prompt nations to interfere with other nations’ sea-borne trade, giving rise to the need for navies.2 Domestic politics allow naval officers, business interests, and politicians to advocate, machinate, and formulate the particulars of sea power. Technology, defined to include the skill and ingenuity of people, can determine the balance between offense and defense, as well as the capabilities that afford the greatest operational advantages. If technology is equally accessible, the amount of resources a nation com- mits to naval capabilities determines its sea power. Geography, while largely beyond the control of nations, can make them more or less vul- nerable and more or less able to project sea power where needed. 1 Alfred T. Mahan, The Interest of America in Sea Power, Present and Future, London: Sampson Low, Marston, and Company, 1897, p. 128. 2 Mahan derived the importance of sea power from the economic need for unchallenged use of the seas and the strategic value of challenging an adversary’s use of the seas. John B. Hattendorf, ed., Mahan on Naval Strategy: Selections from the Writings of Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan, Annapolis, Md.: Naval Institute Press, 1991. 22 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Sea-power theory is about how these factors combine in competi- tion and conflict. It was born of the great-power naval competitions of the 19th century and earlier, and in turn it influenced 20th-century war and peace. As elegant as the theory may seem, it originated in a world very different from ours. Thus, any merit there is in trying to apply to the 21st century the theory and history of the 19th and 20th depends on how the factors of sea power—economics, politics, and technology—have changed. The extent and effects of such change are the underlying analytic questions of this book. Global economic integration has greatly expanded international trade and investment across regions, making sea transport more impor- tant. In addition to commerce, the seas have become more coveted and contested because of raw materials beneath them and thus the question of who owns or controls them. Ravenous appetites for energy, minerals, and food among rapidly developing and developed countries alike have made ocean exploitation more economical—in fact, lucrative enough to risk conflict. In East Asian waters, estimated resource concentrations have huge economic implications for numerous countries with contra- dictory claims and have opened a new front for competition. At the same time, globalization may attenuate geo-political rivalry insofar as one nation’s success depends on that of others. If all powers can prosper from trade that depends on international tranquility in which trade can grow, it is harder for any of them to justify violating that tranquility for unilateral gain. Globalization can also reinforce shared interests in secure trade, making confrontation between sea powers less likely. As we will see, contradictions between globalization and great-power rivalry are evident in the case of Sino-U.S. relations and in the role that sea power plays in those relations. The domestic politics of sea power seems to have changed very little since the 19th century: Special interests in navies are as active as ever. In Washington and Beijing today, admirals, industrialists, and politicians are not motivated to downplay the other power’s capabil- ities, though they lack the influence of naval advocates in London, Berlin, Tokyo, and Washington a hundred years ago. In contrast, tech- nology has gone through several revolutions since then, most of which bear on sea power: aviation, missilery, nuclear power, digital network- Theory and Lessons of History 23 ing, and high-resolution sensing. Thus, the concept of sea power was formed in a specific 19th-century context, important aspects of which no longer obtain. That context was one of rivalry—economic, imperial, and military—among nation-states. While weak states had ample reason to fear stronger ones, it was the possibility of conflict between great powers, thus their peacetime pecking order and behavior in crises, that ordered world affairs. After Napoleon, Europe’s great powers endeav- ored to avoid war by managing their relations in variable alliances that brought both national advantage and international equilibrium; or so they thought. Still, they were rivals, and as such they saw one another’s military forces as potentially dangerous. While the great-power system survived for 100 years, when it disintegrated in horrific violence, war- making capacity—increasingly mechanized—was the currency of both rivalries and alliances, as well as the backdrop of world affairs. As Mahan put it, “[U]pon organized force the world so far has progressed and still progresses. Upon organized force depends the extended shield, under which the movements of peace advance in quietness.”3 For all his ideas about how to wage war, Mahan himself expected, and hoped, that great-power warfare’s growing destructive potential would make it less likely or at least more restrained. He died in 1914 before World War I would demolish his hope. In fact, the sea power Mahan prescribed combined with the power-politics he assumed to produce the conflict he dreaded. With trade expanding, grand navies were putatively threatening. Implicit in Great Britain’s strategy of maintaining an outsized fleet was the intent to deny to other powers the maritime prerogatives the Brit- ish were determined to maintain for themselves. As captured in the quotation at the beginning of this chapter, fleets were essentially dual- purpose: able both to protect and to sever economic lifelines. A strong navy was inherently strategic in that it implied a threat to strangle a rival. Thus, an established great power, e.g., Britain, required naval strength to maintain its strategic advantage, as rising powers, e.g., the 3 Alfred T. Mahan, Some Neglected Aspects of War, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1907, p. 89, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991. 24 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific United States and Germany, sought it to eliminate their strategic disad- vantage. Vying for advantage occurred even as commerce was expand- ing. (Keep in mind that trade also had a competitive aspect, based on the mercantilist belief that one country could prosper most at the expense of others.) The premise of sea power was distrust between great powers, notwithstanding their trade. Industrialization added both to the economic criticality of maritime trade and to the naval capability to disrupt it. Today’s established great power and rising great power—the United States and China—seem to distrust each other enough not to let their economic lifelines, critical waters and, in China’s case, coasts go undefended, or to eschew naval rivalry in favor of naval collabo- ration. Indeed, naval competition is now heating up in East Asia, a region that owes decades of strong economic growth to trade. Simply put, the United States regards sea control as essential to its economic and security interests in East Asia, and China is no less adamant that U.S. sea control threatens Chinese interests and even Chinese territory. If the world’s most important relationship, in some of the world’s most important waters, is being shaped by goals of sea control and fears of sea denial, the theory and lessons of sea power are worth learning. Bearing in mind limits on the value of lessons from a bygone world, this chapter will examine the theory of sea power as it arose in the late 19th century, as well as three cases where economics and geo- politics combined to cause competitive surges in naval capabilities: that between Great Britain and the United States (roughly 1880–1895), that between Great Britain and Germany (1890–1914), and that between the United States and Japan (1930–1941). In each case, an established sea power (Great Britain, Great Britain again, and the United States) was perceived by a rising one (the United States, Germany, and Japan, respectively) as having the means and presumed intent to frustrate its aspirations, throttle its economy, and even threaten it directly. Yet the cases differ in their causes, in the interests of their protagonists, and in their outcomes. The chapter concludes by drawing lessons for the Sino- American case from these cases and from the theory behind them. Theory and Lessons of History 25 Sea Power Then and Now The concept of sea power gained both definition and prominence as the West’s colonial powers began to industrialize in the second half of the 19th century. Control of and access to empires was thought by many to become more critical as Britain, France, Germany and others developed manufacturing and built railroads, creating a hunger for fuels, ores, and other materials.4 In turn, these European states came to rely heav- ily on overseas markets for their manufactures, which allowed domestic production to exceed domestic demand, thus spurring growth. Broadly speaking, world economic development was ignited by industrializa- tion and international commerce (and has continued since, except for world war and depression). It is estimated that global per capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew negligibly from the 11th century until the mid–19th century, then grew by 300 percent by the end of the 19th century, then by 900 percent during the 20th century.5 Thus, the most significant progress in human material conditions has coincided with expanded use of the world’s water “highways,” as Mahan called them. With industrialization, oceanic trade graduated from spices and vices to goods and resources essential to economic success. With its natu- ral blessings, under-utilized geographic expanse, swelling immigration and population, and growing domestic demand, the United States was later than the European powers to develop the need for resources, mar- kets, or a strong navy. Despite growing trade among them, the European powers were naval competitors. Size mattered: both of multi-ocean fleets and of the economies needed to build, maintain, and operate them. The Nether- lands, Portugal, and Spain could no longer keep pace with Great Britain and France, and their possessions shrank correspondingly. In contrast, newly unified Germany could catch up and keep up, and its posses- sions expanded correspondingly. Industrialization enabled those still 4 It is true that two of the fastest growing economies of the late 19th century—Germany and Japan—had no overseas possessions. In both cases, however, industrialization led to increased interest in overseas resources, markets, and possessions, as well as in sea power. 5 Lawrence J. Broz, “The U.S. and the World Economy in the 19th Century,” February 2012. 26 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific in the game to construct larger, faster, and less sinkable steel-armored ships propelled by steam power and equipped with increasingly accu- rate long-range guns. Great Britain—first to industrialize, with the largest empire and greatest dependence on imports and markets—led in naval capabilities, which motivated old adversaries France and the United States and future adversary Germany to follow suit. Emerg- ing from isolation, undergoing rapid industrialization, and in growing need of materials and markets, Japan was close behind. It was at this time that American naval officer, professor, and strat- egist Alfred Thayer Mahan offered lessons, theories, requirements, and implications of sea power. His fame and impact came as the United States turned its attention from post–Civil War recovery and conti- nental expansion to global potential. Mahan’s political champions had conquests and empire in their sights.6 More than that, they wanted war: if not with Britain (disliked by them but strong) then with Spain (disliked and weak). While Mahan did not share their martial gusto, he was as unabashed as they in believing that the United States could and must become a world power. Mahan formulated in writings and teachings (and Roosevelt then retailed in corridors of power) the idea that the key to greatness, fortune, empire, and military success was sea power. In essence, sea power was both a prerequisite and a manifesta- tion of national greatness, as Great Britain demonstrated in Mahan’s world. American sea power, thus world power, was but a gleam in Mahan’s eye when he began his work (1884). His theories were informed by his reading of history from Roman to modern times, but rooted deeply in the 19th century’s prime example: the Royal Navy and its indispens- able role in enabling Britain’s new economic model and commanding its empire. In the words of Robert Massie: The Victorian Age, Pax Britannica, Splendid Isolation, the Empire on Which the Sun Never Sets, existed because “Britannia Ruled the Waves.” Essentially, she ruled unchallenged. Former 6 Evan Thomas, The War Lovers: Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst, and the Rush to Empire, 1898, New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2010. Theory and Lessons of History 27 antagonists, the Spanish and the Dutch, had no navies to speak of; Russia and the United States were deeply engaged in consoli- dating control over their own landmasses; the German Empire did not exist. Although its old enemy, France, had the world’s second largest fleet, “Great Britain’s naval supremacy remained unshaken.”7 Mahan’s theory flowed from his observation that the 19th centu- ry’s greatest power was its greatest sea power. What Great Britain had practiced, Mahan articulated: Because sea power can deliver national economic success and strategic advantage, it warrants the national commitment that it requires. In the British case, growing commer- cial and financial strength “enabled the country to adequately fund outsized naval fleets, and those fleets protected the trade and achieved the victories that enabled the British economy to flourish.”8 Mahan noticed that Britain had peers (France, for instance) in all categories of power save one: sea power. It was their superiority at sea that enabled the British to excel in exploiting industrial technology, in expanding production (well beyond domestic demand), and in securing access to the world’s abundance of raw materials. This implied that sea power was the sine qua non for world power and strategic advantage. Indeed, Britain’s navy made it the superpower of the 19th century. Knowing this, British leaders built and followed a national strategy based on sea power, and they saw to it that the Royal Navy would get the resources it needed to remain supreme. To Mahan, the heart of sea power was the offensive potency of a concentrated fleet. This was consistent with his belief that the “first principle of warfare is concentration—drawing force together at the centers which for the moment are important.”9 But his concept was much larger than concentrated offensive naval power, encompassing 7 Robert K. Massie, Dreadnought: Britain, Germany, and the Coming of the Great War, New York: Ballantine, 1991, p. 373. 8 Swartz, 2011. 9 Alfred T. Mahan, Lessons of the War with Spain and Other Articles, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1899, p. 258, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991. 28 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific geography, navigation, economics, demographics, culture, and politics. Mahan both traced and predicted how sea power influences “history,” by which he meant the rise and fall of powers, the gain and loss of pos- sessions, the ability to rule in peace, and the means to prevail in war. His line of thinking went like this: • To succeed economically and grow strong strategically, a nation needs to industrialize and produce more than it consumes. • Production requires more raw materials than the nation has. • Trade—importing materials and exporting products—is there- fore vital to national economic success. • The oceans are the great highways of that trade. • Use of the oceans is vital to any nation that relies on trade and aspires to succeed economically and strategically. • The ability of a state to protect this use and to deny its enemy of it can determine the outcome of wars, competition over power, and international standing. • While sea power is important for any state, it is crucial for those with the potential and goal to become world powers. • The most effective measure in war at sea is to sever the enemy’s sea lines of communication. • The ability to destroy the enemy’s fleet is crucial to assure this is achievable and should be the main goal of war. • Offense is dominant; given offensive dominance, defense is needed only to enable offense. • Speed is important, but not as important as concentrated force. • Distance is a problem unless mitigated by bases and allies. • Because battle fleets can only be defeated by battle fleets, the capabilities to control the seas are essentially the same as those to deny others such control. For Mahan, sea power was power upon the surface of the seas— naturally enough given the state of technology. Submarines were nov- elties; aviation was science fiction; space satellites had not been imag- ined. Because communications were line-of-sight and gunnery ranges were at most a few miles, concentrated force necessitated concentrated Theory and Lessons of History 29 fleets. Fleets were tethered to bases, even more so when coal replaced sail. Placing one’s fleet between the enemy’s fleet and its homeland was the key to victory.10 Blockades, commerce raiding, and amphibious warfare were considered secondary to the “clash of battle fleets.”11 Although sea power took a specific form in his mind’s eye, Mahan’s concepts were deeper and transcendent. Again, power upon the sea was essential because it was the way to attain power over what transpires at sea. While he did not anticipate the importance of sub- marines or contemplate aircraft carriers, he would have had no diffi- culty regarding them as inputs to sea power or amending his insistence on concentrated battle fleets to accommodate them. Long-range land- based anti-ship missiles would have been a greater shock to Mahan’s thinking; but in the end, he would have admitted that they were part of the sea-power equation because they could visit offensive force upon navies and shipping. Even cyber-war can be fit into the purposes and essence of sea power as defined by Mahan. Looking back, the battle- ship formation expressed but did not define the concept of sea power. Looking ahead, naval forces will hardly be the only way to acquire and use sea power. Mahan’s work was both descriptive and prescriptive: He sought to persuade his own country’s powers-that-be to commit to become the sea power that its size, location, ambitions, and seafaring ways implied it could be. He did battle not only with American apathy toward sea power but also with the idea that the fleet’s purpose was to serve as the nation’s “first line of defense”—a defense-mindedness that insulted three of his core beliefs: that the United States should be a global power, that global powers need navies less to guard their coasts than to safeguard their trade and prosperity, and that offense—the ability to disrupt another power’s trade by first destroying its fleet—was the heart of sea power. 10 The failure to get between the German High Seas Fleet and the safety of the German coast prevented the Royal Navy from turning a tactical victory into a strategic one in the Battle of Jutland. John Irving, The Smoke Screen of Jutland, New York: David McKay Com- pany, 1966. 11 Alfred T. Mahan, Some Neglected Aspects of War, p. 89, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991. 30 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Upon publishing The Influence of Sea Power upon History, Mahan became hugely successful intellectually and politically—a strategic celebrity. His ideas rode a wave of national enthusiasm for world pos- sessions, respect, and influence—based on claims of political, cultural, and racial (Anglo-Saxon) superiority, stirred by Roosevelt’s “American- ism” and formulated in Lodge’s “Large Policy.”12 From this moment, the U.S. Navy became synonymous with U.S. greatness (just as the Royal Navy meant British greatness). From 1890 to 1900, the U.S. fleet grew from 42 ships, of which 8 were steel and none were battleships, to 140 ships, of which 100 were steel and 8 were battleships.13 In that decade, the Navy steamed past the U.S. Army in political influence and public esteem. Roosevelt, Lodge, and Hearst favored war, not only for conquest but also to reinvigorate national spirit. Mahan demurred, arguing that deterrence is preferred to war, though it requires even greater naval predominance: “Force is never more operative than when it is known to exist but is not brandished.”14 On the whole—again, observing the Royal Navy during the 19th century—the greater the sea power, the less likely it had to be used.15 Though Mahan supported the acquisi- tion of colonies, his stress on offense was not meant to be a call to start wars, only to destroy enemy forces if war occurred. Mahan’s concept was hijacked by others with a jingoistic fervor he did not share. Though based on British experience and motivated by American ambition, Mahan’s ideas “caused a global sensation.”16 In 1884, Kaiser Wilhelm wrote, “I am just now . . . devouring [The Influence of Sea Power upon History] and am trying to learn it by heart.” He had it placed in the wardroom of every ship in the German fleet. The book was required reading in Japan’s naval academy.

Theory and Lessons of History 31 regarded it as scripture: “Lodge would use Mahan as a preacher used the Bible.”17 Roosevelt, as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, leant Mahan’s ideas political force, rhetorical thunder, and generous funding.18 The traction of Mahan’s theory of sea power was badly weak- ened by World War I, which was mainly decided by land warfare (even between sea powers). The culminating Anglo-German naval battle, Jutland, ended in a tactical draw but a strategic win for Britain, which retained its mastery of the seas and consequent ability to gradually strangle the German economy and starve its population. Britain’s blockade of Germany affected the war’s course and outcome; but it also spurred development of the submarine to elude surface combat- ants and sink shipping. In general, World War I left losers and victors alike (except Japan) tired, broke, disinterested in more overseas posses- sions, and inclined to reduce, not increase, their fleets. It was the railroad, another product of the industrial revolution, that was seen as enabling great land powers to consolidate control, compete, move troops, and determine the outcome of war, more so than control of the seas.19 It was then that English geographer Halford Mackinder offered a competing and, considering World War I, more popular theory that land power, facilitated by rail transport, was the key to great power.20 (Ironic that an Englishman fashioned the theory of land power while an American did so for sea power.) It took war in the Pacific between Japan and the United States two decades later to revive Mahan’s theory of the importance of navies in war, peace, and history. 17 Thomas, 2010, p. 72. 18 Thomas, 2010. 19 John Whiteclay Chambers II, ed., The Oxford Companion to American Military History, New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, pp. 720–721. 20 Warning in 1918 that Germany’s defeat did not end the danger it posed, Mackinder famously wrote: “Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland: Who rules the Heart- land commands the World-Island: Who rules the World-Island commands the World.” Quoted in John Halford Mackinder, Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction, London: Constable and Company, 1919. 32 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Half a century after Mahan, with the benefit of learning from the Japanese-American conflict, E. B. Potter and Admiral Chester Nimitz (retired commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in World War II) updated Mahan’s ideas.21 Based mainly on American naval success (something unknown to Mahan), they wrote: The capacity of a nation to use the sea is based upon the char- acter and numbers of its population, the character of its govern- ment, the soundness of its economy, the quality and numbers of its harbors, the extent of its coastline . . . and the location of homeland, bases, and colonies with respect to sea traffic. . . . A warring nation that has achieved a predominant capacity to use the sea is said to have command or control of the sea [which] con- sists of (1) the ability to defend one’s own sea communications and (2) the ability to deny the enemy the sea communications he requires to carry on the war. . . . Bases are indispensable to naval operations for both logistic and strategic reasons . . . needed to replenish, repair and protect fleets and also to maintain them near important communications routes. They also incorporated naval aviation into sea power theory: aircraft carriers replacing battleships as the most important platforms; the need for fleet concentration reduced; the risk of fleet concentration increased; and “gunboat diplomacy” promoted to “carrier diplomacy” to influence friends, foes, and crises. Writing during the Cold War, Potter and Nimitz were also more mindful than Mahan of the value of allies in creating and using sea power, whether for basing or supplementing the U.S. Navy. NATO became the first peacetime broad-based naval (and military) alliance, and the United States both supported and relied on the naval capabili- ties of (once rivals) Britain and Germany, as well as others. Another historical adversary of the United States, Japan, also became an ally and naval partner, though of limited capabilities and reach. Mari- time security became collaborative. To this end, U.S. leadership was 21 Potter and Nimitz, 1960. This is the standard textbook for generations of midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. Theory and Lessons of History 33 as important as U.S. supremacy, though the latter obviously facilitated the former. Unlike Imperial Germany and Imperial Japan, the United States “multilateralized” sea power. At the same time, American strat- egy then and now requires U.S. naval power—and U.S. military power in general—to be robust enough to assure national security regardless of the strength and reliability of allies. With the help of its allies, U.S. sea power went essentially unchal- lenged during the Cold War, giving the United States the ability to assure maritime security, reinforce NATO, strike the Soviet home- land, and take on a new submarine-based strategic nuclear mission. Although the Soviets invested heavily in naval and long-range, land- based anti-naval capabilities, they were never able to threaten U.S. sea control, much less rival it. With East-West confrontation concentrated on the western and eastern edges of the Eurasian land mass, the Cold War could be described geo-politically as one between a great land power and a great sea power. If the Soviet Union ruled Mackinder’s “Heartland” and most of his “World Island,” American command of the seas, trade, economy, and defense of the sea-connected “Free World” validated Mahan’s thinking. Owing to its sea power, the geo- graphic remoteness of the United States from key theaters of East-West confrontation proved to be more advantageous than disadvantageous. The Cold War also reinforced U.S. reliance on global force projection, much of it by sea and supported by the ability to strike from the sea. In addition to its limited ice-free, risk-free access to open oceans noted earlier, the Soviet Union’s failure, despite considerable effort, to exercise serious sea power in the North Atlantic or Western Pacific suggests a deficit of understanding, commitment, and competence to do so. The Soviet Union had negligible sea-borne trade, being isolated from the Western economy and reliant mainly on commerce with its client states, which with the exception of Cuba were land neighbors. Its main reason to build a fleet was self-protection in the event of World War III, both by holding U.S. naval strike power at a safe distance and by impeding U.S. reinforcement of NATO.22 This narrow moti- vation proved inadequate to make the Soviet superpower a sea power 22 Swartz, 2011, p. 7. 34 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific as well. Being a non-trading land power with a military dominated by generals, the Soviet Union lacked the commitment that made Britain, Germany, the United States, and Japan sea powers. It proved the rule that national consciousness of the importance of the seas is needed to provide the resources, patience, and persistence for navies.23 The only parts of sea power the Soviet Union possessed—ships—are of limited value absent the whole package. As important as ships are the skills needed to crew and command them. Referring to the officers of the Royal Navy during the 19th cen- tury, Robert Massie wrote, “Going from ship to ship as they progressed in age and rank, experienced the sea and learned to command. The ultimate lesson was constant: in the British Navy it was not the ships but the men who won.”24 The same can be said for German, American, and Japanese officers and sailors—and French, Spanish, Dutch, and Portuguese ones before them. Superior British seamanship and confi- dence on the high seas, whether in the English Channel or off China, were products of generations of experience, which has no substitute. Operating globally is qualitatively more demanding than operat- ing coastally or regionally. It is also more potent because it gives the global sea power options the regional sea power does not have, such as “swinging” fleets from region to region or surging them from home bases in response to need. Both the Germans and the Japanese erred in calculating that the worldwide span of British and U.S. sea power, respectively, would be a disadvantage against regional sea power; for both Great Britain and the United States were able to bring far forces to bear when required to do so. What can distinguish the best navies from all others is the regularity with which they steam at great dis- 23 The Soviets did, however, succeed in placing a significant fraction of their strate- gic nuclear forces at sea—more specifically, under the sea on ballistic-missile submarines. Although they did not match U.S. prowess in submarine-based strategic deterrent forces (preferring to depend more heavily on land-based missiles), they were able to avoid large- scale detection by U.S. anti-submarine warfare systems. In this regard, substantial U.S. and growing Chinese reliance on submarines for strategic deterrence is not called into question by current technological developments, and will be left outside the scope of this study of sea power. 24 Massie, 1991, p. 374. Theory and Lessons of History 35 tance, detached from their support. When coupled with two-ocean access, as the United States has, such ranges facilitate coverage of high seas, trade routes, and critical waters worldwide. A land power can be a sea power, as the American and German cases show. But the strategic culture of the land power may relegate its naval service to junior status and fail to attract and develop the person- nel required for blue-water superiority. The Soviet Navy never matched its investment in ships with an investment in sailors. In current par- lance, the Soviet Union concentrated on the “hardware” of sea power while neglecting the “software.” Whether China can master both sides of sea power is a key question to which we will return. These intangible qualities and the experience it takes to hone them explain why it can take decades to achieve sea control, let alone dominance, even with the industrial capacity for large-scale naval con- struction. Japan made a national commitment to become a sea power 60 years before Pearl Harbor, and 25 years before crushing the Russian fleet in 1905. Even with extraordinary political and industrial drive, it took Germany 30 years to confront the Royal Navy (at Jutland), and then it fell short. As rising sea powers mount such massive efforts, established ones can invest and maneuver to meet the challenge, as Britain did toward Germany and as the United States did toward Japan and may now do toward China. The chapters that follow will investigate how Mahan’s proposi- tions are withstanding technological and geo-political change, par- ticularly the military-information revolution and globalization. But it seems that his basic explanation of sea power—answering vital national needs, enabling national greatness, reflecting national char- acter, requiring national commitment—is valid still. As we will see, the degree of national commitment is bound to affect the prospect or at least the timing of sea-power competition between the United States and China: The Americans are at a very different point in a very long national learning curve. At the same time, in sharp contrast to the Soviet Union, China depends vitally on sea access and thus has a strong incentive. At present, that access depends on the forbearance of the U.S. sea power, which the Chinese are disinclined to assume. 36 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific We will return to the relationship of Chinese and U.S. sea power in the next chapter, after devoting the remainder of this one to the search for relevant lessons from three historical cases, two of them involving the United States and one of them set in the Western Pacific. Anglo-American Naval Relations While the United States was in the process of gaining continental size and control, Great Britain was establishing sea power in its fullest sense: a far-flung empire, control of the high seas, the ability to defeat invasion, and unmatched global influence. Following a reduction in ship levels in the wake of the Napoleonic wars and War of 1812, Brit- ain steadily built and maintained a fleet of incomparable scale and strength. The Royal Navy had to fight few pitched battles against rival powers at sea during the rest of the 19th century, prompting Mahan to observe that a state with superior offensive naval capability should not have to use it. Britain’s sea power gave it worldwide freedom of action and access, accepting no regional power’s sphere of influence. As Spain lost most of its American colonies, British presence in the West- ern Hemisphere became the largest exception to the Monroe Doctrine. Relations between the United States and Great Britain were strained for much of the 19th century. Chronic American Anglopho- bia got a violent boost in the War of 1812 and flared up nearly to the point of hostilities during the Civil War, as London pondered recogni- tion of the Confederacy (which it then declined once it became clear that the Union would prevail).25 Although the United States frowned on British presence in the Western Hemisphere throughout the 19th century, challenging the sea power that backed that presence was out of the question, especially with more important continental tasks.26 There 25 When two Confederate emissaries were removed by the U.S. Navy from a Royal Navy ship, outrage in both America and Britain nearly brought on hostilities. Engulfed in a Civil War and being totally overmatched at sea, the United States backed down. 26 The other persistent, if unrealistic, U.S. strategic notion in the 19th century was to con- quer Canada. Theory and Lessons of History 37 was modest American interest in sea power after the War of 1812, but this soon dissipated. Until the very end of the century, the U.S. Navy paled in comparison to the Royal Navy. As late as 1880, Britain out- numbered the United States in major combatants by ten to one (377 to 39).27 What the Americans lacked in naval tonnage they lacked even more in experience. The formative experience for Mahan’s generation of naval officers was the blockade of the Confederacy. Simply put, the United States lacked the motivation to be a sea power until the late 19th century. Given its expanding size and boun- tiful natural resources, its economy depended little on foreign trade and therefore little on assured maritime access. U.S. trade in 1845 was essentially at the same level as it was in 1825, roughly one half of which was with Great Britain during this period. Then, Southern cotton trade with British textile manufacturing took off, accounting for most of a doubling of U.S. exports between 1845 and 1860. But this did not impel the United States to invest in a powerful fleet; rather, it made blockade and coastal shelling its most important missions. Although Americans saw British sea power as potentially threatening to their shores and ships, the lack of strong economic interests left the United States without a strategic justification for building a grand, costly fleet. Indeed, beyond its littoral waters, U.S. maritime security was largely afforded by the navy of its would-be rival, Great Britain. Given higher priorities than overseas trade and sea power, America defaulted to the Royal Navy. The Civil War forced the federal government to build a large (700-vessel) fleet to strangle and bombard the South. In the course of that conflict, the U.S. Navy successfully denied British trade with the South, though London never tasked the Royal Navy with full-scale breaking of the Union blockade. By 1865, the United States had the world’s second-strongest navy. However, its purpose was to regain con- tinental control, not to extend power or protect trade globally. Con- sequently, American naval power contracted dramatically after the Civil War—again, the United States was looking inward. By 1880, although the United States was becoming one of the world’s great eco- 27 Naval History and Heritage Command, 2011. 38 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific nomic powers, its navy was no better than 12th in strength.28 This was the U.S. Navy in which Mahan served until he turned to the task of explaining its utter inadequacy. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy was gradually being transformed from the world’s supreme wooden-hulled, sail-propelled force to its supreme steel-hulled, steam-propelled force. While the United States continued to chafe against British defiance of the Monroe Doctrine, enabled by the Royal Navy, it was not until it set its sights on becom- ing an imperial power toward the end of the century that rivalry with Great Britain affected American thinking about sea power. Given cer- tain parallels between the United States at the end of the 19th century and China at the beginning of the 20th—both being rising powers with expanding interests facing established sea powers—the national mind-set that led a thriving American land power to decide to become a great sea power is worth close analysis. Economics supplied some of the motivation: U.S. foreign trade tripled between 1865 and 1880 (much as China’s foreign trade has multiplied in the last quarter-century). But the primary impulse was to be a global power, and the primary obstacle was Great Britain. Mahan identified the way, Lodge furnished the ide- ology, and Roosevelt supplied the cheer. Because Mahan presided over the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, his ideas were circulating throughout the U.S. Navy’s senior ranks, especially its newest captains and admirals. While Ameri- can naval officers did not then (and do not now) command such politi- cal power that they can claim national resources for naval accounts— as did British, German, and Japanese admirals—they were active in developing modern capabilities. Naval attachés fanned out abroad to glean ideas from more experienced navies.29 They often encountered German and Japanese counterparts engaged in similar activities. (The Chinese are not the first to “borrow” militarily useful technology from others nations.) As a result, when the United States got around to becoming a sea power, it went directly to steel, steam, long-range guns, battleships, and long-legged cruisers. 28 Swartz, 2011, p. 11. 29 Swartz, 2011, p. 11. Theory and Lessons of History 39 A wave of American Anglophobia crested over the Venezu- ela boundary-dispute crisis (1895), when Roosevelt and Lodge urged war.30 The New York Times front page reported: “Country Is Aroused, Want To Fight England.”31 However, the American hawks’ agenda got way ahead of the investment in sea power they needed to carry it out. The U.S. Navy had three battleships to the Royal Navy’s 50, against which American ports were defenseless. As it became apparent that the small and untested U.S. fleet would not last long against Britain’s naval preponderance—a discrepancy that would take decades to correct— American imperialists shifted their attention to a more inviting target: Spain, a fading power, clinging to its remaining significant possession in the American Hemisphere, Cuba. From this point on, the United States no longer treated Great Britain as a threat to its strategic interests or as a sea power to be challenged. Just as the United States chose not to take on the dominant sea power—Spain being a softer target by far—Britain chose not to treat the rise of U.S. sea power as a challenge. Turning its attention to more pressing threats, especially the gathering danger of hegemonic war in Europe, Britain stopped sneering at the Monroe Doctrine. Just as London was about to dispatch an armada to the Caribbean to settle the Venezuelan dispute on Britain’s terms, Germany threatened to go to war with Great Britain over South Africa. The British then exe- cuted a “pivot” of their own: “Within a week America was seen as a potential ally, a fellow English-speaking nation against German impe- rial ambitions.”32 At the same moment it dawned on the Americans that they would need a massive investment in sea power to end British encroachment in the Western Hemisphere, Germany “frightened Eng- land into America’s arms,” according to Henry Adams.33 The British were also realistic enough to see that the United States had the wherewithal to create an unchallengeable sphere of influence 30 The issue had little intrinsic importance but took on inordinate symbolic importance in American politics. 31 Thomas, 2010, p. 68. 32 Thomas, 2010, p. 99. 33 Henry Adams, quoted in Thomas, 2010, p. 100. 40 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific in its hemisphere. Moreover, the United States and Great Britain were increasingly interdependent economically, though bilateral trade was more important to the United States than to Great Britain. In 1880, 42 percent of U.S. trade was with Great Britain. By 1895, despite rapid growth in total U.S. trade, its trade with Great Britain was still 38 per- cent. In the Anglo-American case—though not in others, as we will see—shared interest in maritime security sapped the argument for mar- itime rivalry. Having diverged for most of American history, U.S. and British strategic interests were increasingly convergent. From Ameri- ca’s point of view and Britain’s, Anglo-American sea-power rivalry was over before it really began. Confrontation was averted mutually: The United States knew it was not strong enough, yet, to challenge British sea power in the Americas; and Great Britain knew that it could not contain the rise of U.S. sea power without exposing itself to the graver risk of German sea power. Meanwhile, Roosevelt sought war with Spain with his inimitable exuberance. Apart from the merits of liberating the Cuban people, he had two motivations (three, if one counts his burning desire to lead men into battle): a conviction that a foreign war was needed to unify and invigorate the American spirit, and a justification for the construc- tion of a world-class navy.34 Roosevelt got what he wanted: a lopsided war with Spain, several American overseas possessions, and a sus- tained increase in the size and capabilities of U.S. Navy. The event that christened the United States as a sea power and Pacific power was the destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila harbor by Admiral Dewey’s Asiatic Squadron on May 1, 1898. There was celebration not only in America but also in Great Britain, literally. Although naval expendi- tures climbed from 7 percent to 20 percent of the entire U.S. federal budget from 1890 to 1905, the British were not disturbed. After all, the United States was not challenging British sea power: Germany was. The “Great Rapprochement” (1895–1914) between the established and rising Anglo-Saxon powers resolved their naval rivalry, not because the United States was dissuaded from becoming a global sea power 34 Roosevelt relished the opportunity to lead troops into battle, having experienced danger and excitement only in hunting game. Thomas, 2010. Theory and Lessons of History 41 but because British and American interests were compatible and, with the rise of Germany, increasingly convergent. When the United States got bogged down in a nasty counterinsurgency campaign against a Filipino resistance movement following the Spanish-American War, its eagerness for empire and thus its need for naval strength receded.35 Still, by the time of the Great White Fleet’s global circumnavigation in 1907–1908, the U.S. Navy had 22 battleships, 25 cruisers, and a total of 180 warships. While the Royal Navy, twice that size, still had global superiority over the U.S. Navy, it chose not to compete in the West- ern Hemisphere, given other and more critical regions and challengers, e.g., Germany and potentially Japan. Even as Great Britain turned its main attention to Germany, the United States treated the Royal Navy as at least the benchmark, and per- haps the potential rival, of U.S. sea power. In 1912, Woodrow Wilson’s Assistant Secretary of the Navy—Franklin D. Roosevelt, following in his cousin’s footsteps—exhorted Congress “to buy and build dread- noughts until our Navy is comparable to any other in the world”—by clear implication, Great Britain’s. He argued that the American sea control must “extend all over the Western Hemisphere . . . a thousand miles into the sea . . . and wherever our commerce may be.”36 By the outbreak of World War I, the United States had replaced Great Britain as the supreme sea power in the entire Western Hemisphere, and the British were not prepared to contest this. The American digging of the Panama Canal, following aborted European attempts to do so, was both inspired by and a factor in the pursuit of this supremacy. Two features of early American sea power bear noting in rela- tion to Mahanian thinking. First, U.S. motivations, thus capabilities and operations, passed through stages: territorial defense, i.e., prevent- ing British or Spanish bombardment (neither of which was much of 35 Evan Thomas, in The War Lovers (2010), suggests that Roosevelt in particular was less enthralled with expansionism than he was with war and the chance to lead troops. Having become famous by leading his Rough Riders up “San Juan Hill,” Roosevelt largely ceased to become an advocate of conquest and empire, right through his presidency. 36 Franklin D. Roosevelt, quoted in Walter R. Borneman, The Admirals: Nimitz, Halsey, Leahy, and King—the Five-Star Admirals Who Won the War at Sea, New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2012, pp. 75–76. 42 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific actual threat); coastal patrol, i.e., securing littoral waters for approach- ing and departing shipping; economic security, i.e., preventing attack on merchant ships, convoys, commercial activities, and assets wher- ever required (e.g., in China); support for expeditionary operations (e.g., in Cuba and the Philippines); and global power-projection. For a prolonged period (roughly 1895–1930), the Americans looked to sea power to achieve regional control but not to challenge or deny rivals in other regions. Loosely speaking, Japan and Germany followed the same sequence (as China may be doing now). A second notable feature of early U.S. sea power is that its opera- tions, reflecting its staged development, were distinctly non-Mahanian. As late as the 1920s, U.S. naval forces were “divided into numerous separate ‘force packages’ . . . in order to more effectively carry out their principal missions: troop and cargo transport, convoy protection, anti- submarine and anti-surface-raider warfare, and blockade.”37 Not until war with Japan did the U.S. Navy conform to Mahan’s model of the functionally consolidated and physically concentrated battle fleet— and then, of course, centered on the aircraft carrier at least as much as the battleship. By the end of the century of its supremacy, Great Britain could no longer meet the standard of dominating all of its potential sea- power rivals: rapidly industrializing and outward-looking Germany, the United States, and Japan. It was forced, in effect, to cede the West- ern Hemisphere to the United States and then to ally with the United States and Japan against Germany, its most immediate threat (and later with the United States against Japan).38 The United States took advan- tage of British worldwide commitments and demands to become the leading sea power in its region. (As we will see, this is a pattern Ger- many tried to exploit at the time and China might try to exploit, vis-à- vis the United States, today.) Beyond naval strength, it was clear by the end of the 19th century that the economic and industrial potential of the United States would soon surpass Britain’s. As the world’s strongest economy and first to 37 Swartz, 2011, p. 11. 38 Swartz, 2011, p. 10. Theory and Lessons of History 43 industrialize, the British knew well that sheer industrial scale could decide sea power competition between two states both committed, all else being equal. Although lacking comparable naval experience, so strong was the United States becoming, and so concerned were the British with Germany’s rise, that the Crown launched a pro-American propaganda campaign at this time in hopes of winning an invaluable ally for the Great War to come. In essence, the established sea power did not challenge the rising one; and while the Americans considered the Royal Navy the standard against which to measure theirs, they had no compelling economic or security reason to contest it.39 Once Ameri- cans’ ingrained Anglophobia faded, both states recognized that their interests were increasingly aligned. It is impossible to say whether British and American naval accom- modation would have occurred but for London’s growing anxiety about Germany and its naval ambitions. There were other pressures and con- straints acting on His Majesty’s Government at that time, not least of which was economic belt-tightening that necessitated making stra- tegic compromises.40 In any case, the Anglo-American case suggests that two great sea powers—one established, one rising—operating in the same waters are not inevitably on a course to competition, much less confrontation. It must also be said, though, that while the Royal Navy continued to operate throughout the Western Hemisphere, it did not challenge U.S. sea control; indeed, it could not do so because of demands elsewhere. As the U.S. Navy grew, Anglo-American maritime rivalry was not merely defused but even transformed into a century of maritime alliance against common adversaries. While this is encouraging for the Sino-U.S. case, it is important to remember that the United States explicitly claimed and Great Britain reluctantly accepted an American hemisphere of influence. Britain rec- ognized that the United States would surpass it in the economic and 39 Interestingly, the United States brought on the Spanish-American war less for economic reasons—American corporate leaders were at first opposed to war—than for humanitarian ones. The ability of Hearst’s Yellow Press to whip up war fever was based largely on his jour- nalists’ descriptions of Spanish atrocities. Thomas, 2010. 40 First Sea Lord Sir John “Jacky” Fisher is reputed to have said at the time: “We’re out of money, so we’ll have to think.” 44 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific industrial wherewithal to maintain world-class sea power—something the United States does not recognize in China today. Anglo-German Naval Competition and Conflict In contrast to Anglo-American naval competition, which was resolved peacefully and turned into maritime cooperation, Anglo-German naval competition helped drive a friendly relationship into violent con- flict, including at sea. Again, Great Britain was the textbook sea power (quite literally in Mahan’s texts). Its grand strategy was to dominate the seas in order to prevent invasion, assure access to its empire, and, if need be, deny access to would-be enemies. Sea power enabled Brit- ain to keep Europe’s continental struggles at arm’s length, with the option to intervene with small expeditionary forces to restore the bal- ance of power, as it did against France and would against Germany.41 As a requirement of this strategy, London was determined to maintain naval forces at least as capable as any pair of adversaries that might combine against it. Britain’s policy of sea dominance confronted the growing inter- est of newly formed, outward-looking Germany in assured maritime access. Like the United States and Japan at the time (and China at pres- ent), Germany was rapidly becoming an industrial power. Its produc- tion of steel doubled every decade from 1870 to 1900, surpassing Brit- ain’s production in the 1890s.42 Its rail system grew from 3,500 miles in 1850 to 26,000 miles in 1900. Just as Great Britain’s dependence on foreign trade grew as it industrialized, so did Germany’s. As of 1914, the British and German Empires transacted 40 percent of world trade (27 percent British and 13 percent German).43 For both, the lion’s share 41 British strategy was to weigh in and, if need be, intervene with small expeditionary forces on the weaker side of any European conflict. This strategy was found to be inadequate when His Majesty’s government had to intervene on a massive scale to prevent German hegemony on the European continent. 42 Chris Butler, “The Spread of Industrialization Beyond Britain (c. 1850–1900),” 2007. 43 Edgar Crammond, “The Economic Relations of the British and German Empires,” Jour- nal of the Royal Statistical Society, Vol. 77, No. 8, July 1914. Theory and Lessons of History 45 of that trade was sea-borne. The two owned 53 percent of world mer- chant shipping.44 With industrialization and the need for materials and markets, German trade grew very rapidly, doubling total exports and imports from 1897 to 1907.45 As Germany industrialized, it had a growing requirement for raw materials and markets reachable only by sea. It also sought to make up for its late start as a colonial power by obtaining overseas posses- sions both for their economic potential and for prestige. Yet Germany’s access to colonies, resources, and markets was at the pleasure of the Royal Navy, the supremacy of which Great Britain was determined to preserve. British strategy was therefore viewed in Berlin as threaten- ing to Germany’s economic health, imperial control, and standing as a great power. So Germany embarked on a campaign not just to become a sea power but to break Britain’s sea supremacy, which the British would regard as a major threat to their interests and strategy. It took Germany about 25 years, starting around 1880, to become capable of testing British supremacy. During that time, Anglo-German relations soured and turned hostile. Although their naval competition did not cause World War I, it gave the British a reason to suspect Germany of hegemonic intentions and to fear German power. Consistent with Brit- ish policy of aligning against whichever power threatened Europe’s bal- ance, Britain moved toward alliance with its traditional enemy, France. In turn, this meant that Germany and Britain would be on opposing sides when war occurred.46 Germany’s commitment to sea power was the product of back- room lobbying by a navy that was dwarfed in political influence by a German—largely Prussian—army that had won successive wars and enabled Bismarck to create the country. Admiral Tirpitz and his col- 44 Crammond, 1914. 45 Crammond, 1914. 46 The immediate British casus belli was German violation of Belgian sovereignty and neu- trality, once Germany was felt compelled by the developments of August 1914 to attack France preemptively. But in the 20-year course of events leading to that point, the trans- formation of Anglo-German relations from amity to enmity was in part the result of the distrust sown by naval rivalry. 46 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific leagues managed to convince the instinctively Anglophile Kaiser that Great Britain was Germany’s enemy, determined to deny it access to the high seas and the essential resources and new colonies beyond them.47 The admirals, taking a page from Mahan, framed the problem not as naval special pleading but as a national imperative: Failure to back a sea-power strategy would have grave consequences for a nation that was becoming vitally dependent on sea-borne trade. The challenge was also expressed in terms of fairness and pride: What entitled Britain to deny Germany access to the seas and the possessions, resources, and markets beyond them that Britain itself enjoyed? As German wealth, power, and patriotism grew, so did German resentment of a British policy that meant to keep Germany not only down but under Brit- ain’s control. This sentiment meant that German sea power would have political support and therefore generous resources—one of Mahan’s criteria for success. Once German naval officers bent their (pliable) civilian masters to the view that Britain was an enemy, the prophecy would be fulfilled— the British, feeling threatened, began to behave that way. The admi- rals and their political allies were not subtle about their target or their objective. The Second Naval Law (1890), authorizing construction of a High Seas Fleet, began with the following: To protect Germany’s sea trade and colonies . . . there is only one means: Germany must have a battle fleet so strong that even for the adversary with the greatest sea power [Great Britain], a war against it would imperil [the British] position in the world. For this purpose, it is not absolutely necessary that the German battle fleet should be as strong as that of the greatest naval Power because a great naval Power will not, as a rule, be in a position to concentrate all its striking forces against us. But even if it should succeed in meeting us with considerable superiority . . . the defeat of a strong German fleet would so substantially weaken the enemy that its own position in the world would no longer be secured by an adequate fleet.48 47 Massie, 1991. 48 Massie, 1991, pp. 180–182. Theory and Lessons of History 47 This formulation was known as Tirpitz’s “Risk Theory.” German strategy anticipated that Britain would find it increasingly difficult to safeguard its global interests and meet challenges from multiple rising sea powers. Matching British sea power was not a necessity, since the British could not concentrate their forces on the High Seas Fleet the way the Germans could concentrate theirs on the Royal Navy. Indeed, once the Imperial High Seas Fleet was built, Britain would be hesitant to confront it and thereby endanger its “position in the world.” At that point, Germany would have the sea control it required. Late-19th-century Germany had the means as well as the will to become a great sea power. In addition to its rapidly growing economic capacity and industrial prowess, Germany would overtake Britain as world leader in science and technology. From 1871 to 1914, it had more Nobel Prizes in Science than Britain, France, Russia, and the United States combined.49 As it applied technology to naval capabilities, Ger- many’s ships were second to none in quality, speed, and weaponry. Exploiting the benefits of a late start, Germany was not encumbered with a large fleet of wood-hulled sailing combatants. In contrast, Great Britain was slow to shift to iron, steel, and steam. In addition, the German navy developed seamanship and leadership with uncommon speed. The 20 years it took Germany to become a sea power was quick by historical standards. Britain’s response to Germany’s expanding continental and sea power was to recommit to naval supremacy. Although Great Britain was slow to grasp the significance of Germany’s new-found sea power commitment (despite the Germans being so explicit about it), once it did it threw itself into construction of bigger, swifter, and better-armed capital ships, including Dreadnought-class battleships and fast, light “all-big-gun” cruisers. The British certainly understood that Germany would become a formidable sea-power rival once it put its mind and means to it. For the British, an all-out naval construction race would be a major challenge with a great cost and an uncertain outcome, espe- cially with global requirements and other sea powers looming. 49 Massie, 1991. 48 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific In fact, the Germans’ Risk Theory—that undermining British confidence in a crisis did not require that Germany match Britain’s navy—nearly worked. In the years leading up to World War I, Britain shifted to a “one-power standard,” articulated in 1912 by First Sea Lord Winston Churchill as 60 percent superiority over Germany. Thus, the German challenge forced the British to accept significant risk in other regions (e.g., the Pacific) in order to frustrate a rising sea power in the region of their greatest interest. But the Germans brought this Brit- ish response on themselves by explicitly threatening Britain’s ability to deny them access to the high seas. This begs the question of why Great Britain insisted on having the ability to deny Germany the sea access it demanded and genuinely needed. Why did Britain not offer Germany essentially the same space it offered the United States to become a sea power? Anglo-German rela- tions were friendlier prior to their naval rivalry than Anglo-American relations were for most of the 19th century. In fact, Great Britain and Germany had common, historical adversaries: France and Russia. Anglo-American kinship was no closer than that between the British and German crowns, related by blood. Against this backdrop, the Brit- ish could have offered Germany some sort of joint maritime security. They did not. While British statesmen might have moved in this direc- tion, British admirals surely would have opposed it.50 After all, a policy of retaining sea supremacy justified a major modernization of the large but aging Royal Navy. Both the British and German admiralties were politically assertive, and neither regarded competitive naval construc- tion as entirely unwelcome. If anything might have pushed Great Britain to steer away from competition and confrontation with German sea power, it would have been economics, not statesmanship. Fearful of German capacity and determination, feeling the growing burden of the shipbuilding race, and hoping to shift resources to social programs, Britain’s Liberal government did propose a mutual slowdown in warship construction (1908–1909). But the Kaiser and his admirals would have no part of 50 Admiral John “Jacky” Fisher consistently opposed any restrictions on British sea power. Massie, 1991, p. 431. Theory and Lessons of History 49 an arrangement that would have codified Britain’s numerical advan- tage. According to Albert Ballin, an influential German shipping mag- nate alarmed by the turn in Anglo-German relations, “Tirpitz . . . did not wish to negotiate. He wanted no settlement. He wanted only to build ships.” The British admiralty was only slightly less enthused about an Anglo-German deal to limit construction. The initiative was rejected by Berlin and dropped by London.51 In any case, limiting ship construction would have been, at best, a patch on the expanding gulf between British and German sea-power objectives. The story of the Anglo-German naval arms race prior to World War I—told by Robert Massie in his brilliant book Dreadnought— was like the Soviet-American nuclear arms race during the Cold War (except that the latter did not end in hot war). Strategists, military lead- ers, and politicians in both capitals seized upon intelligence and news of the latest ship designs and building plans of the other to expand and upgrade their own naval capabilities beyond any requirements except those of the competition’s internal logic. The established power was not entirely reactive to the moves of the rising one. The British were the first to lay the keels of new classes of more powerful ships, leap-frogging German designs and forcing Berlin to follow suit. If this dynamic was fed by suspicion, it created even more suspicion. While the Royal Navy remained larger and operationally superior right up to World War I, Germany was closing the gap. In 1898, when Germany’s effort went into high gear, the Royal Navy had 329 war- ships compared with 68 for Germany. Ten years later, Germany had added 162 warships, while Great Britain had added only 8. The Brit- ish, as noted, were modernizing while the Germans had to expand and modernize. If the Germans forced a quantitative naval arms race, the British set the pace for a qualitative one. Naval technology was such that each rival was building a mirror image of the other, with a par- ticular emphasis on the offensive power of the concentrated battle fleet (just as Mahan had prescribed). Broadly speaking, although the established sea power was the first to industrialize and the rising one had only just become a uni- 51 Massie, 1991, pp. 792–800. 50 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific fied state, the two were roughly equivalent in capacity to support sea power. While Germany had greater economic and industrial potential, it also had major land interests that Great Britain did not. Being evenly matched, neither had cause to back off for lack of confidence in its ability to compete. The British had strong reasons not to abandon their strategy of maintaining sea control by maintaining supremacy. The Germans had equally strong reasons to pursue relentlessly their goal of breaking the ability of Great Britain to deny access—or, according to the Risk Theory, to make prohibitive the expected costs to the British of threatening Germany’s interests and navy. It is important to reiterate that the Germans took direct aim at the Royal Navy, figuratively in building the High Seas Fleet and liter- ally in their plans to break British sea denial. As we will see also in the Japanese-U.S. case (and might also witness in today’s Sino-U.S. case), there is no better way to justify and focus the pursuit of sea power than to place that of a rival and potential enemy squarely in the crosshairs. Yet, this approach can be counterproductive and even dangerous inso- far as it provokes the targeted, established power to invest even more in its naval capabilities, to design them specifically to defeat the rising power, to view that power as an enemy, and to draw up war plans to defeat it. It is impossible to say how the events of 1914 would have unfolded had the collision between Britain’s sea-power standard and Germany’s sea-power ambition not occurred. Again, the war was precipitated by events and alignments separate from the naval arms race. Yet, the role of Anglo-German sea-power rivalry in the lead-up to war should not be underestimated. The German naval challenge precipitated not merely a British in-kind response but also a change in British foreign policy— the abandonment of “Splendid Isolation” from the Continent’s dis- putes and alignments in favor of weighing in the side of the powers opposing the increasingly powerful Germany. Even as German admi- rals depicted British sea power as evidence of hostile intentions toward Germany, British statesmen saw the growing German High Seas as a leading indicator of a strategic if not existential threat. “[A]s Britain began to fear the German Fleet, it feared also that the greatest military Theory and Lessons of History 51 power in Europe would not aspire to become a great naval power unless it wanted to dominate the world. . . .”52 As a consequence, in Massie’s words, Britain became . . . a partner of its erstwhile enemies, France and Russia. The alienation of Britain from Germany and its growing partnership between Britain and France and Britain and Russia, were caused by fear of the German Fleet. “It closed the ranks of the Entente,” said Winston Churchill. “With every rivet that von Tirpitz drove into his ships of war, he united British opinion . . . the hammers that clanged at Kiel and Wilhemshaven were forg- ing the coalition of nations by which Germany was to be resisted and finally overthrown.”53 The title of Mahan’s monumental work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, is no exaggeration in the case of Anglo-German naval competition. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the race itself and the ani- mosity it fueled could have been avoided if British and German states- men had been energized by the idea that two nations had largely shared interests when it came to trade, freedom of the seas, and even the pos- sibilities of maritime cooperation. But this is a very big if. The British were not prepared to accept and cooperate with Germany’s growing naval might any more than the Germans were prepared to trust the British to use their navy to safeguard the seas for German use. Just as Great Britain was unwilling to accept a German sphere of influence in Europe, Germany was unwilling to accept British control of the high seas. Moreover, statesmen in London and Berlin did not have the political “chops” to overrule naval interests; indeed, they had largely bought into the argument that sea power was a national imperative— economic and strategic—not a naval demand. (Because such “what-if” and “missed-opportunity” analysis illuminates choices faced today by the United States and China in the Western Pacific, we will return to it.) 52 Massie, 1991, p. xxv. 53 Msssie, 1991, p. xxv. 52 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific An epilogue to the story of Anglo-German naval rivalry and con- flict is pertinent to our study. Having failed to neutralize Britain’s sea- power advantage, and having lost World War I, Germany of the Third Reich chose not to invest heavily in a surface fleet in the run-up to and during World War II.54 Instead, it concentrated on a strong submarine force to threaten British and American naval forces and to cripple the shipping that the allies relied on for reinforcement. The Germans con- sidered anti-naval capabilities more promising, more cost-effective, and more essential than those of a powerful surface fleet. It is interesting to speculate whether a Nazi aircraft-carrier force on the American or Japanese scale would have affected the war in Europe and the Atlantic. Strategically, Hitler and his strategists were captivated not by the idea of becoming a sea power, perhaps in league with Japan, but rather by the need for “living space” to Germany’s East—in the “Heartland” that Mackinder argued was the key to command of the “World Island” and ultimately the World. While Nazi Germany appreciated the importance of the seas, especially to its enemies, it opted for sea-denial capabilities by exploit- ing submarine technology rather than imitating the Anglo-Saxon fleets (as Imperial Germany had done). With the advance of technology, sea power was no longer defined by battle fleets or confined to clashes of battle fleets. The Battle of the Atlantic—which Churchill called the “dominating factor of the war” on which “everything happening else- where depended”—pitted allied bombers against German U-boats that eluded surface escorts to attack convoys with war supplies.55 Sea power had evolved from power upon the sea to power of the sea. Although the technology of his day did not require Mahan to make the distinction, he would surely have been comfortable with it. Hitler and his lieutenants never read The Influence of Sea Power upon History, as far as we know. Had they, they would have found 54 Nazi Germany had a small but capable fleet of surface combatants, which was not used until the invasion of Norway, and then only after some pressure by the German admiralty. During the Cold War, the Federal Republic continued Germany’s tradition of naval excel- lence and was NATO’s ally in the North Atlantic. 55 Quoted in Borneman, The Admirals, 2012, p. 276. Theory and Lessons of History 53 an alternative to the theory that controlling Eastern Europe was the key to controlling the world. They might also have understood why defeating two sea powers would be harder than conquering continental neighbors. Japan and the United States Germans may not have studied Mahan between the Wars, but we know that the Japanese did so all along. Although Mahan wrote the sea-power script for his own country, the Japanese followed it exactly. After emerging from self-isolation in the mid-19th century, Japan became a sea power and as a result a great power: a seafaring island; the first non-Western country to industrialize; determined to pro- duce more than it consumed; increasingly dependent on foreign trade; growing stronger economically and technologically; capable of unified national purpose and commitment; relentless. The irony, of course, is that it was the United States that pierced Japanese insulation, result- ing in a Japanese commitment to sea power that eventually was turned against the United States. Fifty years from the time Commodore Perry opened Japan, it had arrived as a world-class sea power by its spec- tacular and surprising destruction of the Tsar’s fleet at the Strait of Tsushima during the Russo-Japanese war (1905), where both Japanese ships and Japanese seamanship excelled. Like the United States, Japan graduated its navy in phases from coastal defense to trade-route security to regional sea power. Japanese sea power continued to increase in size, quality, and experience until capable of forcibly challenging the United States for control of the Pacific in World War II. However, the United States—unlike Great Britain in the Western Hemisphere—was not about to acquiesce in foreign hegemony in the Western Pacific, euphemistically called the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere by the Japanese. This con- tradiction between Japanese and American sea-power purposes set the stage for the collision to come, prompting the obvious question about parallels with China and the United States today. 54 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Although allies during World War I, the Japanese saw the United States and Great Britain as their rivals and prospective adversaries in the Pacific. Even in victory, Britain emerged exhausted from World War I. Although the British had built more ships than it lost during the war, political commitment and resources flagged after 1919, when Brit- ish defense expenditures as a whole were “cut to the bone.”56 Though it had not suffered losses comparable to the European powers, the United States came through wary about global responsibilities and ambiva- lent about sea power. A post-war fleet-expansion plan died on the floor of Congress. The United States did, however, send much of its fleet through the Panama Canal to form the Pacific Fleet in 1920. While influential Americans continued to favor sea power in the aftermath of World War I—President Wilson, an internationalist, called the navy “our natural bulwarks”—this sentiment was swamped by isolationism. Ironically, it was one of the original advocates of American globalism and sea power, Lodge, who engineered the Sen- ate’s refusal to ratify U.S. membership in the League of Nations. The economic argument for internationalism and naval strength was erased by Depression and protectionism. U.S. foreign trade peaked in 1920, was flat until 1929, and then plummeted. With Theodore Roosevelt gone and Mahan’s books gathering dust, the U.S. pursuit of sea power went into reverse. Apart from interest in the aircraft carrier, contrac- tion of the U.S. Navy in size and strength continued in the 1920s and accelerated with the onset of the Depression. Both the need and ability to pay for a powerful navy declined: By 1933, U.S. foreign trade was one-third what it was four years earlier.57 Hoping to preserve their advantages and avert renewed naval com- petition, Great Britain and the United States organized an arms con- trol conference that concluded in 1923 with an agreement to restrict naval capabilities, with those of the United States at the same level as Britain’s and those of Japan at 60 percent: the so-called 5:5:3 formula. 56 British naval and military spending cuts following World War I were justified by an assessment that the country faced no enemy and expected at least a decade of peace (“The Ten Year Rule”). Potter and Nimitz, 1960, p. 477. 57 U.S. Census Bureau, 2012. Theory and Lessons of History 55 Ambivalent toward sea power, the United States was comfortable with these limits—though, mindful of aviation’s promise, it negotiated an exemption to permit two new aircraft carriers to be built. While Japan’s government agreed, its admirals never accepted the limits because of their belief that Japan needed a navy no less than 70 percent of the total size of the U.S. Navy if it were to prevail in a war in the Pacific. Japan renounced its obligations under the treaty in 1934, at the nadir in American sea power.58 Unscathed by World War I, Japan was poised to exploit the reduc- tion of British and American sea power in the Pacific, owing to fatigue and isolationism, respectively. From 31 warships in 1898, the Imperial Navy grew to 230 by 1908. By the time its aggression was in full swing in the 1930s, Japan had the strongest navy in the Pacific in numbers and quality. In 1940, its surface fleet had grown to 375, all in the Pacific. Like the Americans, the Japanese were committed to aircraft carriers, adding 18 from 1940 to 1944.59 For Japan, sea power permitted conquest, which in turn demanded more sea power, which in turn enabled an economic system that pro- vided the resources for naval expansion. While imperial and militaris- tic urges were factors in Japan’s quest for both sea power and conquest, economics was the main driver—or, more precisely, the readiness to use force to make and protect economic gains. Japanese foreign trade grew rapidly from 1891 to 1914 (from $110 million to $600 million), then exponentially after World War I. From 1931 to 1937, despite the Depression, Japanese total trade tripled. Japan was clear of the Depres- sion by 1933 and sustained an average annual growth of 5 percent during the 1930s. Economic growth was mainly in manufacturing, especially heavy manufacturing. Japan required more ore, more fuel, and more markets, all of them overseas. At the time their rivalry heated up, Japan and the United States were not especially interdependent economically. U.S. direct invest- 58 Seventy percent would suffice because Japan has a one-ocean requirement, whereas the United States has a two-ocean requirement. 59 The United States Strategic Bombing Survey, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japan’s War Economy, Appendix Table C-150, December 1946. 56 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ment in Japan (and elsewhere) declined sharply after 1930. Japan’s trade with the United States, which had grown from 12 percent of its total trade on the eve of World War I to 45 percent in 1927, plum- meted during the Depression. Total U.S. trade contracted from $9.5 billion in 1929 to $2.9 billion in 1932. Thanks to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, U.S. imports fell by 68 percent during those years. U.S. trade with Japan was only 7 percent ($400 million) of total U.S. trade in 1929 and 6 percent ($120 million) by 1934. As Japan’s non- U.S. trade rapidly grew, it shifted to East Asia in the 1930s, exploit- ing the difficulty of depressed Western powers to supply their Asian colonies. Its export push, including yen devaluation, in the 1930s was targeted toward Asia. Japan needed to export textiles and other prod- ucts in order to satisfy a growing need for far more strategic imports, not only to sustain economic growth but also to prepare for the war it was expecting. Japan’s drive for resources led to the accumulation of naval might and the conquest of territory, the most ambitious of which was the annexation of Manchuria in 1936. Then Japan’s production-propelled economy stalled, owing to declining external demand, and accelerat- ing militarization of the economy caused a trade deficit because of the need for war-making materials. Total Japanese trade in 1929 was 4.2 billion yen, declined by 1932 to 2.8 billion yen, but then expanded to 6.8 billion yen by 1938. It also shifted markedly from the United States to East Asia. In sum: U.S. foreign trade declined sharply during the 1930s; Jap- anese trade grew during that same period; U.S.-Japanese trade became insignificant for both; and Japanese trade became increasingly domi- nated by demand for resources to support militarization and war prep- arations. One can infer from this that the United States was becoming less dependent on the security of oceanic trade routes; that Japan was becoming more dependent on them; and that there was little Japanese- American economic interdependence that might have restrained their behavior toward one another. These striking economic trends provided the context in which the Japanese became increasingly anxious about a resurgence of U.S. inter- est in sea power, oriented especially toward the Pacific. It was another Theory and Lessons of History 57 Roosevelt who had previously served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin Delano, who dusted off the ideas of Mahan midway into the Depression. Fundamentally a job-creation and industrial-rescue mea- sure, the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 authorized new construction of cruisers and other combatants. This was followed by significant expansion, with particular stress on aircraft carriers. By 1940, the United States had 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, and 478 ships in all (over three times the number in 1933).60 From then on, U.S. naval power grew rapidly while U.S. foreign trade idled. Apart from domestic economic recovery, the motivation behind the renewed U.S. commitment to sea power in the 1930s was Japan’s growing navy and aggressive conduct in East Asia. By the time of its abrogation of the Washington Naval Treaty, Japan was acting on its imperial ambitions, in part to subdue China and in part to secure access to the raw materials of Southeast Asia. In addition to increas- ing naval construction from the mid-1930s on, the United States re- deployed much of its Pacific fleet from California to Hawaii to dis- suade Japan from further expansionism. Japan interpreted this as U.S. intent to challenge the Imperial Navy, to establish both sea control and sea denial in the Western Pacific, to threaten Japan’s increasingly vital sea lines of communications, to starve Japan of strategic materials, and to thwart Japan’s national strategy. While the United States did not directly threaten Japan’s access to fuels and other materials until just before World War II, the Japanese were not being paranoid in reading U.S. sea power as directed squarely at them. When negotiations failed, the Japanese felt compelled to attack the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor. If Germany and Great Britain clashed over sea power despite largely compatible national interests, Japan and the United States did so because their interests were in conflict. Competition in building and deploying aircraft carriers did not poison Japanese-American relations the way competition in building and deploying dreadnoughts had poi- soned Anglo-German relations. Rather, it was Japanese aggression in a region of great importance to the United States that aroused U.S. concern and led Roosevelt and his admirals—King, Leahy, Halsey, 60 Naval History and Heritage Command, 2011. 58 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific and Nimitz—to meet this challenge head-on. The United States was surprised tactically on December 7, 1941, but not strategically. It chris- tened five new aircraft carriers in the six years prior to Pearl Harbor, all of which fought against the Japanese fleet.61 Despite Japan’s impressive ship-building capability during World War II—until U.S. strategic bombing destroyed the yards—its fleet was mostly destroyed by superior U.S. naval forces, built by an even more impressive U.S. naval construction program. By 1945, the U.S. Navy was the largest and strongest the world had ever known.62 Not- withstanding its extraordinary economic, industrial, and technologi- cal development from 1850 on, Japan was overmatched by the United States in all means to compete in sea power. Japan’s GDP per capita was 29 percent of the United States’ in 1929 and, despite the more severe U.S. Depression, still only 38 percent in 1940. The rising power could have known that war with the established power, fought largely at sea, would go badly if the latter maintained its will and marshaled its resources. Japan’s leaders were badly mistaken to expect that Pearl Harbor and subsequent U.S. reverses would cause American will to buckle. Of course, it had precisely the opposite effect. U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King vowed to avenge Pearl Harbor by the “destruction of Japan as a sea power, regardless of how long and how much treasure it takes.”63 Moreover, Tokyo felt that it had no choice but war, and that the best chance for success was to destroy the U.S. fleet at the outset. Indeed, Japan’s top admiral was disappointed that the attack on Pearl Harbor had destroyed some aging battleships and other combatants but had inflicted no damage on U.S. carriers, submarines, or shipyards. Japanese realization that U.S. naval-strike and naval-construction capa- bilities would eventually overwhelm Japanese sea power led to another daring Japanese offensive six months after Pearl Harbor: The Battle of Midway resulted in the loss of all four of the carriers Japan had used 61 USS Ranger (CV-4), USS Yorktown (CV-5), USS Enterprise (CV-6), USS Wasp (CV-7), and USS Hornet (CV-8). 62 Swartz in Saunders et al., 2011, p. 12. 63 Quoted in Borneman, The Admirals, 2012, p. 211. Theory and Lessons of History 59 to attack Pearl Harbor—marking the beginning of the end of Japanese sea power and the beginning of the American dominance in the Pacific that exists to this day.64 The imbalance in American and Japanese capacity for sea power contrasts with the rough equivalence in that respect between Great Britain and Germany during their rivalry before World War I. The British thought they could maintain naval superiority, and the Ger- mans thought they could present the British with unacceptable costs if the Royal Navy had to take on the High Seas Fleet. In the Anglo- American case of 1880–1895, although the British enjoyed a huge advantage over the Americans, it was already apparent that the United States was on a trajectory of growth and industrialization that would eventually overwhelm Britain’s ability to compete, especially in a region of much greater importance to the United States. As a consequence, the superior established power yielded, in effect, to the rising one in order to deal with a graver threat elsewhere. Arguably, only Japan grossly overestimated its ability to compete. Lessons from Theory and History65 Mahan’s ideas were the product of his times: They presumed that great powers would be rivals, they reflected Britain’s success, and they sought 64 Borneman, The Admirals, 2012, p. 260ff. 65 Readers may be interested in lessons from another analysis of rising sea powers (Swartz in Saunders et al., 2011). In summary: 1. Rising sea powers are a feature of rising political, military, and economic powers. 2. When a rising economic and political power decides to build a formidable navy, it usually can do so. 3. A country has to be rich and smart to be a rising sea power. 4. All rising sea powers have eventually collided with other naval powers in combat— sometimes with other rising powers and sometimes with powers that had achieved supremacy. 5. When a rising power builds a strong navy, other strong powers strengthen their own navies. 6. Technological superiority matters in the short run, but in the long run naval technol- ogy flows more or less freely across borders among the world’s most powerful nations. 60 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific to ignite American interest in sea power. Nor was Mahan infallible: His insistence that the concentrated surface fleet’s offensive power was the core of sea power followed from temporary technological limits— the close ranges of communications, sensors, and weapons. Concep- tually, he failed to see the powerful logic and unfortunate effects of spiraling naval competition, the Anglo-German rivalry having barely begun. It is not clear that Mahan would have become the geo-strategic celebrity he did had Lodge and Roosevelt not discovered him and run with his ideas. Still, Mahan’s work—especially in its synthesis of eco- nomics, geography, and international power-politics—remains a useful frame of reference, and in any case has had enduring influence with sea-power strategists the world over. As Mahan explained, nations with both dependence on sea-borne trade and substantial economic, industrial, and technological means will seek sea power: Great Britain, Imperial Germany, the United States, and Imperial Japan all fit Mahan’s model; indeed, they read his script. Those with sufficient means but insufficient incentive—the Soviet Union, for instance—will lack the national consciousness, con- sensus, culture, and commitment it takes to become true sea powers. While a prerequisite for economic success, sea power also can enlarge such success and thus augment the capacity for still greater sea power. In particular, Great Britain and Japan—neither one a land power with abundant natural resources—built “outsized” naval capabilities in order to gain economic strength and in turn support such capabilities. When a sea power sets its requirements as a function of the actual and projected capabilities of another sea power, the results may include costly competition in naval investment, an accumulation of forces other- wise unjustifiable, growing distrust and animosity in general, and dan- gerous proximity at sea. This dynamic occurred in the Anglo-German and Japanese-American cases, but less so in the Anglo-American case. When one power’s determination to have assured access (sea control) 7.

Most of the navies of formerly rising powers are eventually allied with the United States. Theory and Lessons of History 61 threatens or is seen as threatening another power (sea denial), competi- tion is especially fierce. Again, this is how the Germans and Japanese read British and American intentions, respectively, and not without reason. While Japan and the United States had incompatible interests, owing to U.S. refusal to accept Japan’s aggression and regional hege- mony, Great Britain and Germany had fairly convergent interests when their sea-power rivalry began. That rivalry contributed to the deteriora- tion of Anglo-German relations and led to a realignment of European powers that turned a Balkan crisis into a world war. While economics—dependence on resources, markets, and thus secure trade—motivate pursuit of sea power, so does the ambition to be and be recognized as a great power, to gain world influence, and to acquire possessions or clients. The accumulation of colonies and clients with valuable resources adds further to the requirement for maritime security and sea power. While Great Britain, Germany, and Japan were more acquisitive colonial powers than the United States, American sea power contributed greatly to the winning of allies and clients in the 20th century. Becoming a full-fledged sea power takes a generation or more. Not only does it take that long to build a great fleet, but also a fleet cannot be great without naval experience and excellence. The United States and Germany were the quickest to assemble sea power in num- bers and quality. Both embraced the latest and best technology (whereas the British were encumbered with a legacy fleet and slow to change). The United States and Germany were rapidly becoming world-class industrial-technological giants, and both had made clear strategic deci- sions to achieve sea power expeditiously. In any case, it does not neces- sarily take a generation to challenge an adversary’s sea power if there is a way to do so without imitating it. Though it had no Mahan-style fleet, Nazi Germany might have won the Battle of the Atlantic had long-range allied bombers not reasserted Anglo-American sea control. Since Mahan’s time, technology has made sea power a highly asym- metric endeavor, with under-sea, over-sea, and land-based capabilities all part of the equation. In the case of Great Britain and the United States, the established sea power did not deny the rising one, competitively or operation- 62 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ally. Instead, the two, though unfriendly for most of the 19th century, came to rely on each other for maritime security. When an established sea power accommodates a rising one, rivalry may give way to mari- time spheres of influence or cooperation. Had Great Britain signaled receptivity to Anglo-German cooperative maritime security, it might have undercut the argument of Admiral Tirpitz that it was Germa- ny’s enemy. The United States could have made no such offer to Japan because Japanese aggression made cooperation impossible and U.S. sea-denial necessary. Economic interdependence does not prevent sea-power competi- tion, but the absence of interdependence can weaken inhibitions. U.S. trade with Great Britain made up the largest share of U.S. trade and was important to U.S. economic growth. Germany and Great Britain were somewhat interdependent, though obviously not enough to avoid an arms race and war. Japanese-American trade had plummeted in the 1930s and was negligible by the time rivalry in the Pacific was in full swing. Politically, strong “naval interests”—uniformed, industrial, and political—make conditions more favorable for competition than coop- eration. Generally speaking, with both budgets and fleets expand- ing, British, German, American, and Japanese governments were under little pressure to cooperate. Although Britain’s global demands and multiple challengers compelled it to accept the rise of U.S. sea power, entrenched British naval advocates were otherwise committed to a strategy of preponderance. The German admiralty wanted a big navy even if it required turning Britain into an enemy. Japanese fac- tions that favored challenging the United States and Great Britain in the Pacific were largely unopposed. Roosevelt and other political and opinion leaders were determined to achieve independent American sea power; indeed, the U.S. Navy itself has never been an especially power- ful political force compared with its Imperial Japanese, German, and British counterparts. Table 1 assesses the main factors affecting sea-power rivalry in these cases, looking for patterns to help explain outcomes. We will apply this analysis to the Sino-American case after considering U.S. and Chinese interests and strategies, technological developments, and Theory and Lessons of History 63 prospects for cooperative maritime security. For now, some prelimi- nary observations are worth making. First, all cases bear on the Sino-American case in that established and rising sea powers alike possessed economic, technological, and industrial power, relied heavily on sea-borne trade, and sought global status and influence. Table 1 Assessment of Historical Cases of Sea Power Rivalry Great Britain and the United States Great Britain and Imperial Germany The United States and Imperial Japan Reliance on sea-borne trade Great Britain: High United States: Medium (and growing) Great Britain: High Imperial Germany: Medium (and growing) United States: Medium Imperial Japan: High Bilateral economic interdependence High Medium Low Relative economic and industrial capacity and potential Great Britain: High United States: High (and growing) Great Britain: High Imperial Germany: High (and growing) United States: High Imperial Japan: Medium Naval technology, skill, and experience Great Britain: High United States: Medium (and growing) Great Britain: High Imperial Germany: Medium (and growing) United States: High Imperial Japan: High Conflicting national interests, including contested spheres of influence Low Medium High Potential for cooperative maritime security High Medium Low Political influence of naval interests Great Britain: High United States: High Great Britain: High Imperial Germany: High United States: Medium Imperial Japan: High Outcome Accommodation, cooperation, alliance Contributed to antagonism and likelihood of war Primary cause and instruments of war 64 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Second, the Anglo-American case differs from the Sino-American case in that Great Britain was not prepared to sustain a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. This left the two with compatible global inter- ests, increasingly friendly relations, and a path to cooperative mari- time security. In contrast, an exclusive Chinese sphere of influence in East Asia is incompatible with U.S. economic and security interests, although China will in any case have some influence upon its neigh- bors as much by virtue of its commercial as its military importance. Third, the Japanese-American case differs from the Sino- American case in that the established power was actively and explicitly threatening sea denial to counter the rising power’s aggression in East Asia. Japan considered this to be a direct threat to its interests and goals (however ignoble). Moreover, the two had little economic inter- dependence, and Japan had no prospect of matching U.S. economic- technological-industrial capacity as applied to sea power. Fourth and finally, the Anglo-German case is particularly inter- esting for the Sino-American case: As described above, Great Britain and Imperial Germany had divergent interests in Europe but mostly compatible interests beyond Europe, including in secure trade. The two were economically highly interdependent. Great Britain had been the 19th century’s top commercial, financial, technological, and industrial power, but Germany was closing the gap. Great Britain was unmatched as a sea power; Germany was expanding from a continental power to a sea power as well. The Anglo-German sea-power rivalry is a cautionary tale. Despite a shared need for secure trade and access to colonies and raw materials, there was no attempt to cooperate in meeting this need. Rather, each power treated the other’s naval build-up as directed at it: The Ger- mans saw sea denial as the British intent, and the British saw the Ger- mans as a challenge to their imperative of sea control—and both were essentially right in their perception. This led to a frenzied arms race, increasingly muscular capabilities (not otherwise needed), deepening suspicion, antagonism, and preparations for a war that would bleed the vitality and power of both countries—a path neither Americans nor the Chinese want to follow. Theory and Lessons of History 65 This raises an obvious question: Whether, and how, might the Anglo-German case have ended amicably? Put differently, might the logic of cooperation in pursuit of shared interests have prevailed over the logic of power politics? Might Great Britain and Germany have dis- proven Mahan’s fresh theory that sea power was inherently competitive? As already explained, admirals and sympathetic politicians in both Great Britain and Imperial Germany saw no alternative—or chose to see no alternative—to rivalry. Had these “naval interests” been less sure of themselves or less influential, Germany might not have been so explicit and blatant in challenging British sea power, and Great Britain might have suggested a path to mutual maritime security. But such statesmanship was not prominent, nor even present, in either London or Berlin. Alternatively, objective and realistic calculations in either capi- tal might have moderated the conceit there and perhaps in the other capital. Of course, rationality and humility—like statesmanship— were in short supply in pre–World War I Europe. Nonetheless, as a thought experiment, it is worth following the Anglo-German case down the path untaken. This invites two further questions: What proposal for collaborative maritime security might the British have made to the Germans, consistent with Britain’s core inter- ests? Why might the Germans have responded favorably, consistent with German interests? The answers could shed some light on whether and how, a century later, it might be possible for American and Chi- nese sea power to co-exist peacefully, consistent with the interests of both, in the Western Pacific. Had British political leaders recognized that Germany was deter- mined and perhaps entitled to have assured access to and passage through the high seas, they would have known that trying to maintain sea denial would inevitably stiffen German resolve and end in confron- tation. At a minimum, they might have offered some sort of non-denial pledge covering Germany’s peaceful use of the seas. Even if no more than a promise, such a declaratory policy could have weakened the claim of the German admirals that Britain meant Germany harm— the claim the Kaiser bought. The British might have reinforced this by proposing regular exchanges, joint exercises, and joint patrols between the two navies, under the watchful eye of statesmen. Of course, such 66 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific an approach would likely have been resisted by the British admiralty, which was increasingly suspicious of Germany and also held much of British political elite in its thrall. With British supremacy under pressure on several fronts—emerging American and Japanese power, demoral- izing conflict in South Africa, a rising power in Europe—London was clinging to its core advantage: dominant sea power. The failure then (and lesson for today?) was in the failure of political leadership. Had Great Britain followed such a course, German leaders, start- ing with the Kaiser—though not much of a statesman himself—would have at least been in a quandary. The German admirals, being inter- ested above all in building a powerful fleet, would have argued that British capabilities, not stated intentions, should determine not only German capabilities but also German policy. But with other challenges the new Germany faced on the Continent, a reasonable alternative to a costly naval arms race with Great Britain might have been intrigu- ing. With hindsight’s benefit, it is clear that cooperating rather than competing with British sea power would have served German interests. Had the two navies, despite their own misgivings, then pursued mari- time security cooperatively, the good faith and trust of the two states— friends until lately—might have been preserved. In any case, German leaders should have known that for Germany to explicitly depict the Royal Navy as justification for the High Seas Fleet would provoke the expansion and modernization of the Royal Navy. This what-if excursion is not only counterfactual but hardly plau- sible. For starters, politics would have worked against it. Again, the British commitment to dominant sea power was not just naval but national—just as Mahan theorized. It was accepted by political and commercial elites as the only way for Great Britain to be the world’s leading power and excel economically, and it was ingrained by centu- ries of cumulative success. As important, Britain’s ability and willing- ness, when push came to shove, to deny potential adversaries use of the seas was considered a strategic imperative. For Britain to have assured Germany that it had no reason to fear British sea power would have contradicted British strategy. In turn, it is doubtful that the Germans would have placed much faith in a British assurance that German sea access would not be denied. Theory and Lessons of History 67 The Kaiser who bought the admirals’ logic about British hostility to Germany was unlikely to accept a British pledge of restraint over the objections of those very admirals. With British strategy depending on naval supremacy, a promise to not use that supremacy would not have slowed Germany’s dreadnought construction. On top of the counter- strategic quality of cooperative maritime security, strong industrial interests in both countries acquired a stake in the ship-construction race, regardless of its costs and risks. Thus, given British and German strategic goals and national mind-sets, it is hard to think of a British assurance that would have prevented the costly and ultimately destructive rivalry that ensued. As Massie puts it: Why, the Kaiser and millions of his people asked, should England claim to command the sea as a right? At any moment, the British Navy could blockade the German coast, bottle up German ships in harbor, and seize German colonies. Why should the German Empire exist on British sufferance? Why should German great- ness come as a gift from another people? Geography dictated con- frontation. . . . A German Navy strong enough to protect German merchant shipping . . . and guarantee unimpeded passage to the oceans meant, in the last resort, a German fleet able to defeat the British Navy. . . . This Great Britain would never permit.66 It takes little imagination to put the Chinese in German shoes: Why should Chinese access to resources and markets vital to its future exist on American “sufferance”? Why should Chinese greatness come as a “gift” from the United States? Meanwhile, like the British a cen- tury ago, Americans today can project that as China acquires the ability to target and strike U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific, the consequence would be that U.S. access to those vital waters would be at Chinese sufferance. To paraphrase Massie, this the United States would never permit. As it played out, the Anglo-German case is discouraging for those, like the author, who believe that U.S. interests in the world and 66 Massie, 1991, p. xxiv. 68 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific East Asia are best served by the peaceful and cooperative development of Sino-U.S. relations. Powerful forces, akin to those of the Anglo- German case, propel China and the United States toward sea-power competition and possible confrontation in the Western Pacific. China wants to be a great power with a regional sphere of influence; it has growing global economic interests and reliance on sea-borne trade. It sees the United States as at least capable of and perhaps intent on sea denial in and beyond the Western Pacific. At present, China depends, by default, on U.S. sea power to provide security for its global trade. But it regards U.S. sea power as threatening in the Western Pacific, and it has rebuffed U.S. initiatives to explore cooperative maritime security. At the same time, Chinese admirals lack the political clout that Tirpitz and his colleagues had. Nor is American sea power on a domestic-political pedestal the way British sea power was. Because the United States is the world’s leading power in virtually all respects, sea power does not have inordinate importance as it did in Britain when the Royal Navy was synonymous with greatness. The United States is in a stronger geo-strategic position today than Great Britain was a century ago. Politically, at least, perhaps Washington and Beijing have more latitude than London and Berlin did to pursue cooperation at sea. Finally, the Anglo-German case suggests that Sino-U.S. eco- nomic interdependence will not prevent a naval arms race, suspicion, antagonism, and increased probability of conflict. However, as a pre- liminary hypothesis, if China does not insist on a sphere of influence at the expense of the United States in the Western Pacific, and if the two pursue maritime security with mutual restraint or cooperation, then confrontation like that between Britain and Germany, not to mention Japan and the United States, is avoidable. True, this is not the only way to avoid a sea-power clash in the Western Pacific: The United States could yield to China’s potential for sea denial. But that could endanger U.S. interests in a region of unsur- passed importance—as implied by this book’s title—and so is treated as a path to avoid. So we will need to return to the question of whether and how China and the United States can realize maritime security cooperatively—a “hard sell” in both countries, to be sure—after exam- ining their respective strategies and the impact of technology in the Western Pacific. 69 Chapter Three U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific “Even though the leading object of war be defense, defense is best made by offensive action.” —A. T. Mahan1 Introduction Whether the United States and China compete, cooperate, or merely co-exist at sea depends on how each sees its national interests and the role of sea power in defending and advancing them. In the light of theory and history, this chapter examines U.S. and Chinese interests and strategy in the Western Pacific. It looks especially at American and Chinese thinking about trade and other maritime interests, about the operational and political purposes of navies, and about sea control and sea denial. Obviously, sea power figures importantly in U.S. strategic thinking, globally and in the Pacific, as it has for a century. Yet it is unclear how this thinking will be affected by the expansion of Chi- nese power, influence, and aspirations in East Asia. For China’s part, though it has just begun to contemplate sea power and is unlikely in any case to follow the path of earlier sea powers, its potential is obvious. In considering the Sino-American case, two distinctions are worth reiterating: The first is between power upon the sea and power of the sea—the former being just an aspect of the latter. Sea power in the larger sense can be achieved with capabilities under and over the sea, and also with capabilities from land, in space, and in cyber- space. Mahan theorized that sea power is more than naval power, and 1 Mahan, Naval Strategy, 1911, p. 205. 70 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific the impact of technology since his day confirms this. In this regard, anti-naval capabilities, of the sort China is emphasizing, figure impor- tantly in sea power (as allied bombers did in the Battle of the Atlantic). Armed services other than the navies may have a role in sea power: marines, obviously, but also air forces and armies with surface-to- surface missiles. The second distinction is between sea control and sea denial, the former being the ability to assure access to important waters for naval forces, shipping, and extraction of resources, and the latter being the ability to disrupt such access, even temporarily. As we will see, the United States still has a major stake in sea control in the Western Pacific. The Chinese are fearful of U.S. sea denial, and even more fear- ful of U.S. capabilities to strike China from the sea. While they prob- ably cannot achieve sea control, they are intent on denying the United States low-risk access to seas off China’s shores. Thus, China is pursu- ing asymmetric sea power, but sea power nonetheless. While many factors affect the purposes and capabilities of both American and Chinese sea power in the Western Pacific, the largest factor is what the other country does or is expected to do. True, each has naval missions that are not directly linked to the other: China uses surface combatants to harry vessels of neighboring nations in disputed waters; the U.S. Navy is poised to stop pirates from interfering with shipping in the Strait of Malacca. But the sea-power capabilities of China and the United States are becoming coupled in a similar way as those of Great Britain and Imperial Germany and then the United States and Imperial Japan were, which is hardly encouraging. In developing new capabilities, the U.S. Navy now treats China as its main “planning case,” as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has treated the United States since at least the mid-1990s. While the two have not become locked in a spiraling naval arms race like the Anglo- German one, the logic of competition is evident in that a move by one triggers a counter-move by the other, and so on. This coupling is espe- cially strong and consequential in relation to China’s belief that U.S. naval strike forces in the region are threatening to its security and its interests. China’s response has been to improve anti-naval and other A2AD—distinctly anti-U.S.—capabilities as a high priority. The U.S. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 71 response to this Chinese response to U.S. force presence is sure to pro- duce another Chinese response. The new U.S. “Air-Sea Battle” strategy (discussed later) targets the Chinese A2AD capabilities to target U.S. forces. Already, the Chinese are investing in the anti-satellite (ASAT) and cyber-war capabilities that can disable the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais- sance (C4ISR) on which Air-Sea Battle depends. The United States could, in turn, feel constrained to counter this with ASAT and cyber- war capabilities of its own; maybe with the threat of escalation. As in chess, every move in this game is more strategic and more menacing than the last. Our horizon for analysis is 20 years. Given how complex and fluid this region and the Sino-U.S. relationship are, to say nothing of technology’s blistering pace, predicting that far into the future is more sport than science. But recall that 20 years is roughly the time it took Great Britain and the United States, Great Britain and Germany, and the United States and Japan to settle their naval rivalry—peacefully in one case, violently in the other two. So now is an important moment to consider the dynamics and implications of American and Chinese maritime strategies. Twenty years seems like a long time to avert con- flict; yet, once the logic of rivalry locks in the parties, momentum can get stronger with time. At sea, being on a collision course does not make a collision inevitable. But the extended length of time it takes to turn a large ship requires early awareness that one’s course may lead to trouble. The entry point for this analysis is not the dynamics of technol- ogy and military capabilities of the United States and China but the economics of production and trade. After all, Mahan’s theory of sea power rested on economics: To prosper, nations must produce more than they need; so they must import materials and export products, mainly by sea; so they need sea power to assure access, protect trade routes, and, if need be, sever the access and trade of their rivals and enemies. Because the United States and China are the world’s two larg- est and most productive economies, face political and demographic pressures for growth, are major trading partners, and depend vitally on sea-borne trade, we will start there. 72 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Chinese and U.S. Trade The United States became a sea power when its economic development caused it to turn to foreign trade over a century ago. China, though much poorer per capita, is starting to become a sea power at essen- tially the same stage in its development. In both cases, rapid economic growth and industrialization not only fostered trade but also provided resources and technology to build modern naval capabilities. Both the United States and China have benefited from globalization, a salient feature of which has been the expansion of their bilateral trade. The chief effect of this trade has been a dramatic expansion of U.S. imports of products made in China, often with know-how brought there by U.S. firms and financed by the expansion of Chinese credit to the United States. China’s ability to sustain rapid economic growth with moderate inflation and America’s ability to achieve moderate growth with low inflation and low interest rates depend on this trading and financing relationship. China’s dependence on trade in general is all the clearer when considering the need for rapid economic growth to maintain political stability, regime authority, and national cohesion. Total Chinese trade (exports plus imports) is now approximately $3 trillion (50 percent of GDP), and has been growing at twice the rate of GDP growth (20 percent versus 10 percent per annum) over the past decade. Total U.S. trade is roughly $3.7 trillion (25 percent of GDP), and has also grown at about twice the rate of GDP growth (6 percent to 3 percent per annum). Again, both countries depend predominantly on sea-borne trade, though a greater share of Chinese trade than U.S. trade is sea-borne—about 95 percent compared to 85 percent—because Canada and Mexico are huge American trading partners. Thus, sea- borne trade accounts for about 45 percent of Chinese GDP and about 20 percent of U.S. GDP. By implication, China depends more than the United States does on the certainty that its sea-borne trade is secure, though the United States has far greater naval capability to secure trade than China. While the United States has more Western Hemispheric trade than China, China has more Asiatic trade than the United States. But both trade extensively with all parts of the world—petroleum from the U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 73 Middle East and Africa to both China and the United States, natural gas from Central Asia to China, industrial and commercial trade with Europe for both China and the United States, commodities from Latin America to both, and food-stuffs to China from the United States and elsewhere. Sino-U.S. trade has more than tripled in the past decade, from about $150 billion to $500 billion, as has the U.S. trade deficit with China, from about $100 billion in 2002 to $300 billion in 2011. U.S. exports to China are consistently less than one-third of Chinese exports to the United States. This deficit is to a large extent financed by Chinese credit: China has accumulated $1.3 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities, making it the U.S. government’s largest sovereign creditor.2 In the past decade, U.S. trade with China has gone from 7 percent to 14 percent of total U.S. trade, while Chinese trade with the United States has gone from 22 percent to 15 percent of China’s total trade. Thus, both depend equivalently (in proportion to GDP) on trade with the other, but China’s dependence on U.S. trade has declined relatively, even as the total has increased. Still Chinese exports to the United States have grown from about $100 billion to $400 billion per annum in the past ten years (in comparison to growth in U.S. exports to China from $20 billion to $100 billion per annum in the same period). Chinese exports to the United States are about 7 percent of Chinese GDP, and Chinese imports from the United States are 2 percent of Chinese GDP. In contrast, U.S. exports to China are less than 1 percent of U.S. GDP, whereas U.S. imports from China are about 3 percent of U.S. GDP. Chinese exports to the United States have played and will keep playing a crucial role in the development of Chinese manufacturing, which has been the locomotive of China’s growth. On the other hand, U.S. imports from, not exports to, China constitute the most impor- tant U.S. interest in trade with China: American consumers, producers, and service-providers alike have come to depend critically on competi- tively priced Chinese goods—for everything from filling retail-chain shelves to supplying components for complex information systems to providing such systems. Take away Chinese exports and credit to the 2 U.S. Department of Treasury data. 74 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific United States, and both economies would suffer: China from higher unemployment and the United States from higher prices and interest rates. The Chinese and American economies have become highly inter- dependent in other ways. China helps finance the U.S. fiscal deficit, enabling politically popular federal spending without raising taxes. Although Chinese imports from the United States are much smaller in volume than U.S. imports from China, Chinese producers have ben- efited hugely—as American shareholders have profited hugely—from the transfer of technology, management skills, and distribution access that U.S. direct investment has brought China. In addition, Chinese enterprises are now deploying capital accu- mulated in large part from trade with the United States to invest directly in international production.3 China’s increased ownership abroad should increase its stake in a healthy global economic system and, as a corollary, maritime security. In this new phase, the United States looks increasingly to growing demand in China to make up for sluggish growth at home and in Europe and Japan. That the United States counted heavily on Chinese growth to lead it and the rest of the world out of the contraction of 2008–2009 suggests how much Sino- American economic interdependence has grown. Chinese collabora- tion will become more critical in managing global economic institu- tions and policies. Sino-U.S. economic interdependence, using bilateral trade as an indicator, is substantial but declining in proportion to total trade, espe- cially for China. Still, it is hard to imagine how the two economies, or the entire global economy, would weather a collapse of their eco- nomic relationship. Indeed, that specter may be the best guarantee that the two will avoid conflict, over sea power or anything else. Contrast Sino-American interdependence with the relatively small amount of U.S. trade with and investment in Japan prior to World War II, which declined sharply during the 1930s. (The similarity between Sino- American trade at present and Anglo-German trade prior to World 3 The Economist, “Being Eaten by the Dragon; Chinese Takeovers,” November 13, 2010, p. 81. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 75 War I will be taken up later.) Insofar as U.S. economic interests in East Asia warrant continued U.S. ability to preserve stability and influence in the region, it is clear that those interests are bound up in maintain- ing conditions that permit Sino-American economic ties to flourish. The United States remains a power in the Western Pacific not only because China is a potential danger but also because China is an eco- nomic partner. At the same time, China’s dependence on sea-borne trade—nearly half its economy—is feeding Chinese anxiety about the security of that trade. Chinese writings on sea power show heightened awareness of the yawning discrepancy between the importance of China’s sea-borne trade and the inadequacy of China’s sea power. Recall similar concerns in late-19th-century Germany, also industrializing and beginning to look outward. The security of China’s expanding trade, and thus of its economic growth, currently depends on American sea power, globally and regionally. This is not unlike the reliance of the United States on the Royal Navy to safeguard its trade, before becoming a sea power itself at the end of the 19th century. Given that the United States then decided, in essence, that it could count only on itself to secure the trade that fueled its growth, China’s interest in sea power should come as no surprise to Americans. Strategically, if ironically, the United States is disinclined to allow the Chinese the measure of sea control in East Asian waters that it insisted on in the Western Hemispheric waters a century ago. In theory, the mutual economic interest of China and the United States in sea-borne trade, a lot of it with each other, suggests the pos- sibility of a cooperative approach to maritime security. However, three Chinese concerns militate against maritime cooperation with the United States: First, China needs the ability to back its maritime claims and to protect its own trade, at least in its region; second, U.S. sea power is a putative threat to China’s trade; third, U.S. sea power is a putative threat to China itself. Notwithstanding Sino-U.S. economic interdependence and shared interest in maritime security, the depen- dence of China’s economy on sea-borne trade may, on balance, argue for sea-power rivalry, not cooperation, with the United States in the 76 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Western Pacific. This impulse would cause China to try to end U.S. sea control while expanding its own sea control in the region. The logic of confrontational sea power, consistent with how Mahan expected powers to behave, fits with China’s interest in reduc- ing the ability of the United States to threaten China and frustrate its wider regional interests and ambitions. The same basic logic explains why the United States is not about to cede to China the responsibility to secure the trade and control the seas of East Asia. In sum, in analyz- ing U.S. and Chinese interests and strategies in the region and beyond, we have to start by admitting that economics are as likely to excite as to temper sea-power rivalry. U.S. Interests4 U.S. interests in East Asia reflect the region’s burgeoning economic strength, its growing demands for global resources, and the influence of its strong states on world politics. East Asia’s economy has become the engine of world growth: Over the past decade, the developing econ- omies of Asia have grown at an average of 8.5 percent per annum, while the major developed economies (including the United States, the Euro- pean Union, and Japan) have grown at an average of 1.3 percent per annum—a pattern that is forecast to continue for at least another five years.5 East Asia’s human capital is vast in number, surging in produc- tivity, and benefiting, if unevenly, from political reform. Its hunger for minerals, thirst for oil, and impact on the environment all have global consequences. Asian powers—China (increasingly), Japan (still), and India (prospectively)—have worldwide interests and roles. Conflict in the region, especially if it involves these powers, could endanger global security and prosperity. In addition to risks of East Asian instability, the region’s impor- tance demands that the United States prevent it from becoming a Chi- 4 This discussion of U.S. interests in East Asia draws heavily on unpublished RAND research led by James Dobbins and co-authored by the author. 5 International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Databases, June 2011. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 77 nese “sphere of influence.” Because this consideration figures heavily in U.S. strategy and U.S. sea power, the term bears further definition. Like it or not, as East Asia’s largest country by far, as a budding world power, and with an outward-oriented economy, China is bound to have a huge role in East Asia. Not only is the United States unable to prevent this, its own stake in China’s success argues against trying—thus repeated American assurances that it will not try to contain China. A peaceful, stable, prosperous region that is under Chinese influence but entirely accessible to the United States might not be injurious to U.S. interests. In that case, the United States could learn to live with China leading in East Asia in most dimensions of power: conventional military, eco- nomic, diplomatic, demographic, and culture. Such conditions need not exclude the United States, weaken its economy, threaten its secu- rity, or preclude Sino-U.S. cooperation. A much more objectionable version of a Chinese East Asian sphere of influence would be one in which China could claim and exercise the prerogatives of power: bullying its neighbors; “resolving” disputes on its terms unilaterally; dictating foreign policies of other states (e.g., in regard to Taiwan); weakening bonds between the United States and its regional friends; harassing U.S. military forces or restricting their freedom of action; and erecting regional economic arrangements dis- advantageous to the United States, e.g., closed trade zones—in a word, hegemony. In classical balance-of-power and sea-power theory, this is the behavior implied by sphere of influence. After all, it was how great powers played their great, “zero-sum” games. From time to time, even the United States exhibited some such conduct in its hemisphere. Yet, with economic integration, sturdy institutions, agreed norms, and belief in “positive-sum” outcomes, perhaps spheres of influence need not exclude and damage powers outside the sphere. By this rea- soning, the United States could be more sanguine than it is about China’s growing prominence in East Asia. However, the combination of the region’s importance, uncertainty about China’s behavior as its power grows, and the potential for instability argues against Ameri- can complacency. Chinese dominance of East Asia could come at the expense of critical U.S. interests, if not immediately then in time. The use of force by China to seize disputed territory would have dire conse- 78 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific quences for international order and rule of law. That other East Asian states have also brandished force to stake out their maritime counter- claims underlines the region’s potential for instability in the event of U.S. disengagement or exclusion. In any case, the United States cannot ignore that Japan, South Korea, Australia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and other U.S. friends—important states in their own right—clearly see the waxing of Chinese power and waning of American power and influ- ence as harmful. That the United States has formal defense alliances with several of these only bolsters the need for balancing Chinese power and, if need be, countering its use. For all these reasons, the United States should and likely will oppose a Chinese sphere of influ- ence in East Asia, at least until it becomes clear from China’s behavior that there is no need to worry. Put simply, the United States will need to treat East Asia as a great power would unless China does not. Refusal to allow another power to dominate this region, in this sense, has been a constant of America’s foreign policy since it became a great power, sea power, and Pacific power a century ago. From the 1930s on, U.S. strategy has been to block hegemonic control of East Asia, even at the cost of war. Conforming to classical balance-of-power theory, it has put its weight on the weaker side: China (versus Japan) during World War II; Japan (versus the Soviet Union) at the outset of the Cold War; China again (versus the Soviet Union) after 1972. U.S. security interests and responsibilities in the region did not decline with the end of the Cold War; if anything, they have increased because of the region’s growing importance. The United States has persistent and potentially rising security concerns in Northeast Asia, where the defense of South Korea and Japan are binding obligations, where nuclear confrontation is possi- ble, and where the fate of North Korea is unclear. Further south, the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan dispute is important to the United States because it is predisposed to intervene militarily if Taiwan is attacked and also because it would have grave strategic and political consequences if democratic Taiwan were to be swallowed by China. In Southeast Asia, U.S. interest declined after the Vietnam War but is U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 79 on the rise now because of the growing importance of this area’s waters and states, most of which now seek U.S. security ties. Throughout the region, long-standing U.S. defense relationships are being re-invigorated and reshaped by regional concerns about the implications of unchecked Chinese power. The purposes of the U.S. alliance with Japan have gradually expanded beyond the protection of Japan to the protection of joint interests and peace in the region. There is talk of the U.S. Navy returning to Subic Bay, its former base in the Philippines (though not likely on its former scale).6 The United States also is developing defense cooperation with Vietnam and India, also motivated by mutual concern about the rise of China. While the United States disavows the intention to encircle or align East Asia against China, what the Chinese see is a region in which its allies are few—two, if one counts Burma—poor, isolated, and unreliable, whereas U.S. allies are prospering and growing in number. Although China does not at present seem to be intent on the con- quest or domination of East Asia, it has threatened military force to press its claims in territorial disputes. It insists that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic, and one should assume it would go to war if nec- essary to prevent the island’s independence. China has resorted to low- grade force to back its fishing rights and resource-exploitation rights in the East China and South China Seas. It has also sided with and propped up an increasingly desperate and unpredictable nuclear-armed North Korean regime, much to the alarm of South Korea and Japan. Regional jitters due to Chinese military power have been aggra- vated by unease over U.S. steadfastness, especially during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. At present, the United States appears resolved to back its East Asian friends, old and new, in the face of Chinese pressures. This is clear from U.S. diplomatic opposition to Chinese attempts to bully states bordering the South China Sea and from U.S. support for South Korea in the face of provocations by North Korea, China’s ally. Failure to stand alongside its friends would deplete U.S. influence with these important states and possibly weaken their resolve to resist intimidation. In the case of Japan and South Korea, there is an 6 Jane’s Defense Weekly, article by Michael Cohen, October 11, 2012. 80 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific additional risk that faltering U.S. steadfastness would tempt them to acquire nuclear weapons. Overall, owing mainly to China’s economic success, the steady expansion and reorientation of its military capabili- ties toward the Pacific, and signs of its growing reliance on force, East Asia may be entering a period of instability. Under these conditions, the instinct of the United States—true to its policy since becoming a Pacific power a century ago—is to renew its commitment to regional equilibrium, to its friends (China’s neigh- bors), to the peaceful resolution of disputes, and to the unrestricted use of the international waters by its shipping and naval forces.7 This is a matter not just of U.S. regional strategy but of U.S. global strategy. In its latest national defense strategy, the U.S. government has made clear that its preoccupation with the Middle East and South Asia since 2001 has been succeeded by the recognition that its global interests demand greater attention to Asia. East Asia is a region of global importance not only economically but also in addressing international security problems of U.S. concern around the world. Japan, Australia, and South Korea, for example, have to varying degrees supported the United States in stabilizing the Middle East and South Asia and in countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand are impor- tant in stemming the spread of violent Islamist extremism. Moreover, equilibrium and peace in East Asia are essential if the United States is to confront threats to itself and its interests elsewhere in the world, as it did in the decade following 9/11. Now, with the United States strug- gling with mounting debt and domestic challenges—nagging unem- ployment, lagging education, and sagging infrastructure—East Asia’s stability takes on added significance. East Asia’s global importance is the product of decades of unprec- edented regional peace and calm, owing to the restraint of its strongest states, including Japan and China, and fostered by U.S. military pres- ence. Conversely, turmoil, aggression, or conflict in the region could not only endanger U.S. interests there but also weaken U.S. ability to 7 The Obama administration’s “pivot” is laid out in The White House, Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense, January 2012. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 81 meet economic and security challenges globally, including at home. Although East Asia has long been free of turmoil, aggression, and con- flict, the potential for trouble exists: • in Northeast Asia, precipitated by the recklessness or collapse of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea • over Taiwan, if current promising cross-Strait political trends are reversed • in the East and South China Seas, over territorial-maritime boundaries and resources • in case of renewed border confrontation between China and Viet- nam or India or Russia. Asia’s continued economic vitality and interdependence may inhibit hostilities over these outstanding problems.8 But there is no guarantee of this: Even if Asian economies continue to prosper and trade, the growing military strength, reach, and assertiveness of China could increase security concerns and the risk of conflict in the region. Note that China figures in all four potential sources of conflict just mentioned, and that in all four the Chinese claim they have important concerns or prerogatives of national defense or sovereignty. Note as well that the potential for regional instability lies mainly in the relationship of an increasingly powerful China with former adversaries: Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and India. How China uses its increas- ing power and reach, as well as how these states and the United States respond to China, could determine whether the region stays stable, its economy stays strong, its disputes are resolved peacefully, and key Asian states play constructive roles in tackling global problems. At the same time, U.S. interests in East Asia also include the rewards of economic cooperation and the prospect of global secu- rity cooperation with China itself. Of all Asian nations—arguably all nations worldwide—China has the greatest potential to help or hinder the United States in meeting security challenges, elsewhere and in the region. Solutions to problems of energy security, maritime security, and 8 Observation from James Dobbins of RAND. 82 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific climate change depend heavily on Chinese cooperation, which could involve costs to China. So too does the growth of the world economy, the health of the trading system, and the effectiveness of international institutions, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the Interna- tional Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization. U.S. and Chinese interests beyond East Asia are not always aligned: take their differences over democratic revolutions in the Arab world and over sanctions on Iran, for example. On the whole, though, U.S. and Chinese outlooks are more con- vergent outside of than inside East Asia, where the two increasingly elbow for favor. Thus, U.S. interests in Sino-American global coopera- tion could be affected, for worse or better, by Sino-American relations in East Asia. This is bound to affect how the United States reacts to the growth of China’s regional power, including its challenge to American sea power. In summary, the enduring U.S. interests in and toward Asia are to • maintain a healthy, integrated, rule-based world economy, for which Asia is vital • preserve Asian stability notwithstanding the rise of China and the risk of great-power rivalry • keep Asia free of aggression and conflict, including the settlement of disputes by force • sustain close relations with traditional and new partners, espe- cially Japan, Korea, and India • nurture Sino-American partnership in meeting global security and economic challenges. China is the fulcrum of these U.S. interests. Just as a coopera- tive China could advance them, a belligerent and unchecked China that spurns international rules could imperil them. Because the United States still plays a vital balancing role in the region, Chinese attempts to diminish that role and expand its own could destabilize the region. Moreover, if American power were to recede as Chinese power grows, China could be more tempted to use force against its weaker neighbors. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 83 At the same time, U.S. resolve to not abandon its role in East Asian security may put it and China on a collision course. U.S. Strategy Toward China Because China could be a threat to U.S. interests in a vital region or a valued collaborator on the world stage—or both at once—U.S. strat- egy toward it is fraught with dilemma. Treating China primarily as a danger to be countered in East Asia could convince Beijing all the more to challenge U.S. power there and to reject partnership on global security matters. Yet, ignoring the risk that China will destabilize East Asia, in hopes of avoiding confrontation there and facilitating coopera- tion elsewhere, could reward and invite Chinese pressure in the region. Managing the tension between U.S. regional and global interests vis- à-vis China—between countering it on one plane and engaging it on another—is the defining challenge in the design and execution of U.S. China strategy. Of late, the U.S. response to China’s growing regional power has been de facto military containment. While U.S. declaratory policy stresses desire for cooperation, countering China has become the prin- cipal rationale for the forward American military presence in the West- ern Pacific. But military presence must conform to a larger strategy. The United States is still feeling its way for the right approach, having had no modern experience with a phenomenon quite like the rise of China. Of other great powers since the United States became one, Great Brit- ain soon became a partner, whereas Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, the Third Reich, and the Soviet Union were, conveniently, unambigu- ous enemies. The last of these is especially unhelpful as analog. Unlike the Soviet Union, China’s integration into the global economy, which accounts for its success and strength, makes it impossible to contain economi- cally. The United States and, even more so, its Asian allies depend criti- cally on Chinese trade, investment, and financing. By the same token, China’s lack of an expansionist design or ideological mission makes it awkward and perhaps impossible to contain politically: Most states in 84 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific the region would prefer constructive relations with China. East Asia has no multinational alliance like NATO to make explicit and effective a region-wide alignment against China—though again, China’s recent intimidating behavior has caused several of its neighbors to appeal to the United States for security.9 Although the United States has very capable military allies in the Western Pacific, the two largest—Japan and South Korea—have historically concentrated on national self- defense, leaving the United States to shoulder nearly all responsibility to keep the region stable in the face of China’s rise. Although it does not seek an anti-China alliance, the United States is trying to improve its regional defense posture vis-à-vis China: updat- ing its defense relationships with traditional allies, deepening security cooperation with India and Vietnam, and concentrating more forces on Guam, which is becoming a hub—temporarily less vulnerable—for U.S. power projection to and throughout the region. Most recently, the U.S. government has declared that it will “pivot” its geo-strategic emphasis from countering Islamist extremism in the Middle East and South Asia to ensuring East Asian stability in the face of China’s rise. Of course, the Chinese read these measures as directed against their rightful interests, their quest for regional preeminence, and their ter- ritorial security. U.S. efforts to shore up allied confidence and respond to improve- ments in Chinese military power and reach could have a dual effect: dissuading the Chinese from threatening or using force, owing to fear of conflict with the United States; yet persuading the Chinese that the United States is intent on keeping down, dictating to, and possibly threatening China. This duality of effects is the result of China’s mirror image of the U.S. dilemma: being careful to avoid conflict with the United States, lest China make an enemy of the world’s leading power and jeopardize all its economic gains; yet being assertive in claiming the status and deference commensurate with those same gains. (More 9 This uncoordinated but conspicuous regional reaction has resulted from concerns about Chinese actions in the East and South China Seas and its support of North Korea follow- ing its sinking of a South Korean naval vessel; the reaction is evident in South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian states, and of course Australia. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 85 on Chinese perspectives later in this chapter.) If upgrading of its force posture in East Asia can help the United States restrain the use of Chi- nese military power there, it can also harden the resolve of the Chinese to improve their military power in order to counter U.S. moves, gain more freedom of action, and lessen the threat to China itself.10 As we will see, China has no higher military priority than increas- ing its ability to neutralize U.S. power, including sea power, in the Western Pacific. Already, the U.S. military is concerned that its opera- tional effectiveness could be reduced and the costs and risks of military intervention increased by Chinese A2AD capabilities. In addition, as PLA ground forces become better equipped and trained, the prospect of fighting a land war with China, near China, looks more forbidding than ever for the United States.11 As a consequence, the sort of “for- ward defense” on which the United States has relied in the Western Pacific for 60 years may not be sustainable for long. Such forward defense—the Seventh Fleet, Air Force bases, Marine Corps and Army forces—has been the hallmark of U.S. commitment to its allies and the region’s stability. Yet, continued reliance on that familiar presence, comforting as it may feel to allies, will place U.S. forces at greater risk. This leaves the United States with a vexing choice: reduce its military presence or accept greater risk to U.S. forces that allies find reassuring. This raises an obvious question: How long will allies be reassured by the presence of increasingly vulnerable forces? Unless the United States reworks its military strategy and posture in East Asia, it could end up leaving both its forces and its allies more exposed, and perhaps more tempting targets should China turn aggres- 10 The notion that increasing U.S. military strength could dissuade China from increasing its military strength—in fashion a decade or so ago in some American circles—has proved flat wrong (not to say naïve), in that China has instead increased military spending and focused mainly on countering U.S. power. 11 In addition to the advantages of geographic proximity, the land forces China could mobi- lize are vastly greater than those the United States could mobilize. Each year, roughly 10 mil- lion Chinese come of military age. Although this number will decline as a consequence of China’s one-child policies, it will still dwarf the corresponding pool of potential American soldiers. 86 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific sive. We will return to the idea of an alternative posture for U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. Facing unfavorable trends in the regional military balance, the United States might be constrained to rely increasingly on its ability to deter China from using force by confronting it with expected costs that exceed expected gains. However, this path is also risky for the United States. In classical deterrence theory, even if the expected costs of esca- lation exceed the adversary’s expected gains from aggression, the cred- ibility of the threat to escalate, on which deterrence depends, can be undermined if the adversary suspects that escalation can also impose unacceptable costs on the side making the threat. In that case, deter- rence can fail, leaving the side making the threat with a hard choice between escalating and having its bluff called, which can have its own severe costs. In the case of conflict with China, the option of vertical escala- tion is increasingly risky for the United States because it entails moving to levels of hostilities—e.g., cyber-war, ASAT war, economic war, or, most extreme, nuclear war—at which China is becoming more capable and the United States is thus becoming more vulnerable to Chinese retaliation.12 Another U.S. option is horizontal escalation—expanding the geo- graphic scope of a conflict, and by threatening to do so deterring the conflict in the first place. A version of this that gets attention among U.S. strategists from time to time is to cut off China’s oil supply by intercepting tankers en route to Chinese ports, thus strangling China’s economy. Other versions would have U.S. forces targeting a range of Chinese military, naval, or economic assets beyond the theater of mili- tary operations, and by threatening to do so give China pause before committing aggression. Such options as these could be credible in that China, lacking worldwide military capabilities, is far more vulnerable than the United States. However, China could choose to retaliate in other ways, e.g., cyber-war against the American economy or missile 12 See David C. Gompert and Phillip Saunders, The Paradox of Power: Sino-American Stra- tegic Restraint in an Age of Vulnerability, Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 2011. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 87 attacks on Japan. Moreover, cutting off China’s oil supply or attack- ing Chinese economic targets could damage the East Asian and world economies, set bad precedents, and even raise questions about respect for the laws of war. Horizontal escalation is a path the United States would take only in the case of large and unambiguous Chinese aggres- sion against a U.S. ally or vital U.S. interests, e.g., an attack on Japan or invasion of South Korea, which are very remote contingencies. Because the United States should not threaten any action that it is not pre- pared to take, it should be judicious in warning of horizontal escala- tion. Moreover, by bandying notions of such escalation as cutting off China’s oil, the United States would confirm precisely what the Chi- nese fear and suspect: that American sea power is inherently threaten- ing and so must be challenged. Generally speaking, while the United States should not rule out vertical or horizontal escalation options, neither should it count on them. As defense against Chinese aggression in East Asia becomes more problematic, deterrence has to be strengthened. In general, it should disabuse the Chinese of the assumption that war with the United States would be easy or even possible to contain. But threats of escala- tion carry high costs: They could feed Chinese paranoia, cause China to enhance its own capabilities to escalate, and have consequences on the United States, if forced to escalate, that might outweigh its interests in a conflict. In sum, U.S. strategy faces multiple quandaries in East Asia: It must restrain the use of Chinese military power without stimulat- ing the growth of Chinese military power; reassure regional friends despite increasing risks to its force; and strengthen deterrence without counting on threats of escalation that it would not want to carry out, may not be credible, and would confirm Chinese suspicions of U.S. ill intentions. On top of these quandaries, there is one more: countering China in the region while calling on China to partner with the United States in meeting global challenges. True, the Chinese have their own interests in stemming nuclear proliferation, defeating violent extremism, reduc- ing dependence on Middle Eastern oil, and slowing climate change; so they might be willing to cooperate on these matters regardless of 88 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific muscular U.S. forces in China’s vicinity. Indeed, there is now modest but growing Sino-U.S. collaboration on such systemic problems even as competition in East Asia has intensified. At the same time, the Chi- nese have repeatedly shown a predilection to let the United States bear the costs and risks of meeting global challenges while they pursue their parochial national interests—that is, “free-ridership.”13 The impor- tance of future China’s cooperation in global security should not be underestimated. With its massive consumption of resources, including oil from Iran and ores from North Korea, skepticism about interna- tional pressure on despotic regimes, rising influence in the developing world, and permanent seat on the UN Security Council, China can frustrate or facilitate important U.S. security policies. Given that Chinese and American interests tend to diverge region- ally and converge globally, U.S. strategy must provide for both regional security and global collaboration. It can do this, in theory, by com- bining the deterrence of China with the engagement of China. This approach is fundamentally different, more complex, and more difficult than U.S. anti-Soviet strategy, which combined static containment and gradual wearing-down of a patently hostile, expansionist, and isolated opponent saddled with a doomed economic system and a bloated state. With China, the United States depends increasingly on the coopera- tion of a power that may at the same time endanger the stability and security of a vital region. Moreover, although the United States learned to live with a divided Europe, at great pain, it hardly wants an Asia divided between a U.S. bloc and China, much less all under China’s influence. Whether a U.S. strategy of countering China regionally and part- nering with it globally is feasible remains unclear. Both governments will be driven by the need for domestic consensus toward a relationship more simply adversarial or else cooperative in nature. Yet, its interests require the United States to straddle the two components, which is more or less what it is now trying to do. If and as the strategy works, the United States could shift its weight toward cooperation, Sino- 13 For example, with sanctions on Iran and in keeping petroleum sources and transport routes secure. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 89 American relations should improve, and East Asia should be secure. If not, U.S. weight should shift toward deterrence. U.S. military strategy in East Asia could be the most challeng- ing aspect of this straddling-act. It will affect Chinese perceptions of U.S. intentions and thus affect Chinese behavior, whether by chan- neling Chinese policy toward moderation or by provoking the Chi- nese toward confrontation. Increased reliance on fixed forward forces for direct defense would ignore their declining survivability, stimulate a further Chinese military build-up, and spoil chances for Sino-U.S. global cooperation. Yet U.S. failure to deter China, support allies, and maintain freedom of access in the region would imperil stability and U.S. interests regionally and, given Asia’s importance, globally. The worsening vulnerability problem dictates changes in U.S. military posture in East Asia, stressing mobile joint forces that can be deployed virtually anywhere quickly, disperse without sacrificing the ability to concentrate force, and elude and flummox Chinese C4ISR (more on this later). Given the pitfalls of forward deployment of large- scale U.S. forces, let alone warfare with China on the Asian continent, improving the local defense capabilities should be an integral part of U.S. strategy. While the United States should not try to encircle China, the strengthening of allied defenses could reduce Chinese confidence in using force. The United States also must strive to retain its advantage in exploiting technology in order to stay a move ahead of Chinese force improvements, e.g., by shifting to less visible strike platforms while China is shoveling resources into targeting the old ones. Such a posture could make it easier—though never easy—for an American president to order U.S. forces to be sent and used in regional contingencies, thus enhancing deterrence and the ability to manage crises involving China. (More on an alternative U.S. force posture later.) Even a posture that avoids the pitfalls of large-scale forward defense must work with and not at cross-purposes to the desire for Chinese cooperation. With both U.S. and increasingly capable Chi- nese forces operating in the same geographic space, there may be more danger of conflict due to miscalculation or mistake than due to intention. This suggests a need for open, timely communications and military-to-military contact between the two—better yet, military-to- 90 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific military cooperation. Chinese suspicions of U.S. intentions and doubt- ful civilian control of the PLA will make military-to-military progress difficult, yet also more important. The United States will want to avoid provocative actions unless critical for U.S. security—e.g., avoid bla- tantly threatening exercises and non-essential probes near recognized Chinese territory. Doing this while maintaining allied confidence and deterring China will take wise military leadership and close coordina- tion with U.S. policymaking. American Sea Power in the Western Pacific In geo-economic terms, East Asia is a sprawling archipelago that extends from Japan to Malaysia to New Zealand and includes Eastern China. Trade with and throughout the archipelago is all sea-borne. In addition, the waters of the archipelago are abundant with food and fuel, and control of them is increasingly contested. Because the region lives around, on, and from the sea, the ability of the United States to maintain economic access, stability, and influence there depends on its sea power. If it lacked sea power, the United States could not assure freedom of passage in East Asian international waters, nor prevent China from controlling at least the South China Sea if not also the East China Sea and Yellow Sea. Sea power enables the United States to back up friendly regional states in resisting whatever pressure China might exert. In the event of hostilities, sea power would enable the United States to con- duct effective strike, expeditionary, and reinforcement operations in most parts of the region. As forward U.S. air bases and fixed concentra- tions of forces near China become more vulnerable, the mobility inher- ent in sea power becomes more essential. Geo-politically, because sea power has symbolized the commitment of the United States to regional stability for nearly a century, its weakening would be interpreted by allies and China alike as the precursor of a Chinese sphere of influence, which the United States cannot tolerate. At present, American sea power has two core missions in the Western Pacific—one operational and one political. The operational U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 91 mission is to strike. The political mission is to influence friends and foes in peacetime or crisis. The main instrument of both operational strike and political influence has been the large carrier.14 Sure enough, the large carrier has become the bull’s-eye for China’s defense investments and targeting. Because current technology does not hold out a realistic promise of being able to defend a few large U.S. carriers from Chinese target- ing, the United States must rethink the main instruments of its sea power in the Western Pacific. Its naval strategists must ask whether it remains wise, or even necessary, to heed Mahan’s 19th-century maxim to consolidate offensive forces. If they do not ask this, U.S. sea power will not be able to meet the 21st-century Western Pacific demands of its core operational mission (to strike); as a consequence, its political mis- sion (to influence) will also be in jeopardy. Although the United States has a decade or more before the current form of its sea power in the Western Pacific is obsolete, it will take at least as long to re-form that sea power, assuming the Navy has the ambition to do so. Overall, the U.S. Navy has steadily declined in size over the past 20 years: from 590 ships in 1990 to 318 in 2000 to 288 in 2010.15 With current U.S. defense budget projections, the Navy will be able to maintain no more than about 240 ships. This reduction in fleet size is the result of climbing costs of individual ships and, more recently, tight constraints on funding for ship-building because of the higher prior- ity the United States has placed for the past decade on ground forces for large-scale ground occupations and operations.16 In parallel, the absence of a major blue-water rival has weakened the case for maintain- ing a large U.S. fleet. In addition to aircraft carriers, every other main category of U.S. sea power is active in the Western Pacific: surface combatants, auxiliary 14 If in doubt about the centrality of the large aircraft carrier in the identity of the U.S. Navy, observe any recruiting advertisement: In essence, the carrier has become the symbol of the “Global Force for Good.” 15 Naval History and Heritage Command, 2011. 16 The Navy has in effect helped to “pay the bill” for the expansion and continuous employ- ment of U.S. ground forces under U.S. post-9/11 defense strategy. 92 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ships, amphibious ships, attack submarines, strategic-deterrent subma- rines, and naval bases. A large fraction of the rest of the fleet—surface combatants, auxiliaries, attack submarines—exists and operates to provide anti-ship, anti-submarine, and anti-missile defense so that the carriers can carry out their strike mission. If the carriers’ ability to carry out that mission is put in doubt, so is the principal rationale for much of the surface fleet. To be sure, other naval missions are also important. As the United States reduces its strategic offensive nuclear forces, the submarine-based missile force, though also reduced, becomes more important because of its superior survivability, given the difficulty of finding and sinking submarines. In addition, the United States is improving the conven- tional strike capability of surface combatants and submarines, includ- ing converted strategic boats, with extended-range cruise and ballis- tic missiles. Meant to complement the strike power of large aircraft carriers, such capabilities will become more important as the carriers become more vulnerable. Make no mistake: As this is written, the United States enjoys naval preponderance globally and in the Western Pacific. It is utterly unrivaled on the high seas, it can operate well in coastal waters, and it can control whatever maritime choke-points it is tasked to secure. This current supremacy is a consequence of not only the extraordinary capabilities of the ships of the fleet, but also the Navy’s progress in networking them for better offense and defense. It reflects as well the fact that few other countries can afford capital-intensive, fuel-guzzling blue-water navies; most of those that can are U.S. partners—Japan, European allies, India. In the Western Pacific and elsewhere, American sea power is both unrivaled and supplemented in sheer numbers and operational strength by the sea power of others. Still, the vulnerability of concentrated American sea power in the Western Pacific presents a specific problem of great geo-political, geo- economic, and potentially war-fighting significance. We have estab- lished that East Asia is too important for the United States to accept a Chinese sphere of influence there, which the weakening of U.S. sea power would do. But history shows that the weakening of one form of sea power does not necessarily amount to the weakening of sea power U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 93 itself; rather, it leads to new forms by exploiting new technology: wood to iron, sail to steam, battleships to aircraft carriers, surface ships to sub- marines, bombs to missiles, manned aircraft to drones, signal flags and smoke signals to radio to worldwide space-based data communications. In addition to rethinking the form of American sea power in the Western Pacific, it is time also to reflect on its meaning. Because the United States believes it needs assured maritime freedom in the region, it must be able to maintain sea control and prevent Chinese sea denial. But this does not necessarily mean that the United States must main- tain the ability to deny China access to the seas on which its economy depends. If denying China access were the ultimate U.S. goal, it is vir- tually certain that China, being vitally dependent on the seas, would do whatever it took to challenge it. Recall that when it became clear to the Japanese that the United States intended to exercise sea denial, they were willing not only to commit vast resources but also to start a war to prevent it. The Sino-American case is further complicated by China’s need for access to resources in and under the seas. Short of outright Chinese aggression in East Asia, akin to Japa- nese aggression in the 1930s, the United States is unlikely to declare sea denial as its purpose. At the same time, there is enough unofficial U.S. chatter about the option of blockading or severing China’s sea life- lines in a crisis, that the Chinese could be worried already about U.S. sea-denial aims. If they conclude that this is what the United States intends, the result will be intensified naval competition, improved and expanded Chinese anti-naval capabilities, a worsening of Sino- American relations, an increased potential for confrontation, and a rising risk of miscalculations, mistakes, and inadvertent war. Mahan’s formula was that global power requires sea power, sea power excites rivalry, rivalry demands the ability to deny the other’s use of the sea, rivalry can lead to war, and victory depends on con- centrated offensive force. But that formula contains assumptions that are not necessarily valid in these waters, in this century, between these two powers—and, because of China’s potential and its own need for oceanic access, may impose prohibitive costs and risks on the United States. Of course, whether it is possible for the United States to retain and fulfill the main purposes of sea power in the Western Pacific with- 94 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific out intensifying rivalry with China depends as much on China as it does on the United States. Chinese Interests17 Starting with Deng Xiaoping (1904–1997), China’s political lead- ers have worked to transform it from a poor, unstable, weak, vulner- able, and pitied country into a prosperous, stable, strong, secure, and influential one. Whether the prime motivation has been to take better care of a billion Chinese, to make China more cohesive, to end for- eign domination once and for all, or to reclaim China’s greatness is unclear—and may not really matter, because these aims are correlated. The path to achieving them all is economic development. Develop- ment relieves the grinding poverty of the masses and increases Chinese power, security, and clout. It also assures domestic political calm, thus the survival of the regime. The course Deng set reflects and reinforces a way of thinking about China’s needs and purposes that was fundamentally new. Com- munist ideology, which obviously was not helping China, gave way to an ideology of state-sponsored economic growth. This necessitated the granting of considerable economic freedom. But economic freedom was not to be accompanied by political freedom: Chinese communism has shed its Marxist economics but not its Maoist resolve to rule unchal- lenged. Authoritarianism is claimed by those who practice it as a pre- requisite of growth. While this is a questionable theory—contradicted by the parallel development and democratization of numerous other peoples in recent decades—there is no doubt that growth, thus satisfy- ing the needs of the people, is a prerequisite of preserving the political status quo. Instead of demanding reform, much less brewing revolu- tion, China’s middle class is more or less content with the political status quo. Moreover, those who have gained the most are especially proud of China’s achievements and of the mind that China should 17 This analysis of Chinese interests makes use of unpublished RAND research by Eric Heginbotham, cited with the author’s consent. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 95 assert its expanding interests and influence in the region and the world. Economically and politically, China’s success makes it both able and inclined to be and act the great power. The model for Chinese development is not unlike that followed by a number of other East Asian states: acquire the capital and know-how to employ low-cost labor in manufacturing; attain superior produc- tivity by training and organizing that labor; work up the value-chain from commodity to more profitable production; export strategically (with state support) into global markets so that domestic production is not held back by domestic consumption; keep currency exchange rates low, run surpluses, and amass foreign exchange; with that foreign exchange, buy the raw materials, equipment, and technology needed to sustain growth; allow yet control foreign investment in the growing domestic market in order to acquire the means to compete in foreign markets; expand free enterprise, but keep the state’s hand in businesses that matter most.18 But China’s version of the model has differed from other East Asian states in two respects. First, its huge rural popula- tion, engaged largely in subsistence farming, has enabled it to add hun- dreds of millions of low-wage production workers and thus to become a market-share leader in manufacturing for the world economy. Second, while development spurred political reform in most other East Asian states, it has not thus far in China.19 China’s development has both required and deepened integration into the world economy and dependence on overseas markets and raw materials. While the Chinese will not be able to keep GDP growth at the 10 percent per annum of the past two decades, they may be able to keep it at 6–8 percent (which is still extraordinary for such a large economy). Conversely, it is widely thought that substantially slower growth could endanger the regime’s ability to meet rising expectations and thus maintain unchallenged one-party rule. It follows that China’s access to markets and materials, nearly all by sea, is a matter of con- siderable political interest to the regime. “Leaders in Beijing see social 18 For example, defense, energy, finance. 19 Samantha Ravitch, Marketization and Democracy: East Asian Experiences, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999. 96 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific instability as the greatest threat to themselves and balanced economic development and growth as central social stability. Indeed, they often discuss a critical benchmark, believing that 7 percent growth is neces- sary to support a growing pool of urban workers.”20 The security of sea-borne trade is also crucial to China’s increasingly powerful business community and well-connected, well-heeled tycoons. China’s development strategy necessitated a fundamental change in its foreign policy that prevails to this day. Knowing that trade would be crucial to provide jobs, Deng jettisoned Mao’s interest in stirring up revolution abroad in favor of doing business with established regimes in the region and beyond.21 If pre-growth China rejected the interna- tional system on grounds of socialist ideology, the ideology of growth has required China to accept and join the system. By the same token, the Chinese understand that growth based on international trade argues for international peace and against subverting or threatening other states, especially key trading partners (including its neighbors). It argues as well for keeping the medium of trade—the oceans—tranquil and secure. China’s need for stability implies a convergence of its global interests with those of the United States and its partners. In addition to the need for overseas trade, China’s development strategy depends on the acquisition of technology, which is to be found in the United States, Japan, and the rest of the capitalist West. Thus, the combination of American consumers’ bottomless appetite for low- cost goods and Chinese producers’ requirement for manufacturing technology has made Sino-U.S. economic cooperation highly benefi- cial, as detailed earlier. China and the United States have benefited enormously not only from their bilateral cooperation but also from the general expansion of trade and investment that characterize global eco- 20 Heginbotham, unpublished RAND research. 21 According to Heginbotham (unpublished RAND research): “Emblematic of Deng Xiaoping’s pragmatism and his focus on increasing Chinese trade, Deng’s most important statement on foreign policy (and the one most frequently quoted in China) ended with the admonition to ‘keep a low profile and achieve something.’ In the jostling over Chinese for- eign policy today, Deng’s comment continues to be advanced by those who believe that China remains underdeveloped and that trade and economic growth should remain the paramount focus of its foreign policy.” U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 97 nomic integration. Both depend on the health of the world economy, on international stability in general, and on the multilateral institu- tions and rules of this order. But before jumping to the conclusion that this convergence of interests precludes rivalry between the rising power and the established power of today, remember that Great Britain and Imperial Germany also had common economic interests yet went to war. Indeed, now that China’s success enables it to pursue its other national interests— defense, sovereign integrity, unification, and influence—there is a grow- ing potential for friction and conflict between China and its neighbors, who are supported by the United States. Having been weak and vulner- able for so long, the Chinese definition of national defense begins with the protection of China proper. While the threat of re-armed Japan is dormant, or done, it is still not dismissed by the Chinese because of their brutal treatment by the Japanese in the 1930s and 1940s.22 One might think that the Chinese would be careful not to stimulate Japan’s military expansion by appearing threatening. Instead, the Chi- nese have used their new capabilities and confidence to challenge Japan in the East China Sea and have reacted harshly, and nationalistically, to Japan’s increasingly tough defense policy. Of greater and more immediate concern, of course, is the danger the Chinese perceive of U.S. military power, including sea-based strike power, in the Western Pacific. With the Soviet Union gone and Japa- nese expansionism long gone, the Chinese now want U.S. power to recede. While Americans are concerned by China’s development of A2AD capabilities, the Chinese can claim that not developing these capabilities, now that they can, would be irresponsible. They can also 22 Heginbotham (unpublished RAND research) observes that when tensions with Japan boiled over in 2005, Chinese activists pressured the government to take a tougher line against Tokyo on historical and UN-related issues. Following a relatively standard script, the government allowed some protests to occur, while mobilizing its community of Japan specialists to tour campuses, trade groups, and other organizations to dampen tensions and encourage an end to activism, largely on the grounds that stable trade and investment rela- tions with Japan are critical to China’s interests, whereas addressing other political disputes will take more time. 98 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ask why the United States is committed to keep its military power in the region unless to threaten China. The Chinese view of national security does not end with defense of the mainland against attack. China’s definition of national sover- eignty and territorial integrity is being applied more widely to include the control of Taiwan. The growth of Chinese power has made more realistic the goal of Taiwan’s reunification, as well as the imperative of preventing Taiwan’s independence. Since the earliest days of the People’s Republic, the Chinese have seen the United States and its sea power as the principal barrier to forcible reunification. In 1996, when U.S. aircraft carriers entered the Strait to prevent China’s intimidation of Taiwan, the Chinese were reminded of their impotence to overcome this barrier. While the Chinese have serious misgivings about actu- ally taking Taiwan by force, their inability to do so denies them the upper hand in cross-Strait negotiations. Although, as noted, China- Taiwan relations are progressing, the Chinese still regard U.S. willing- ness to intervene in Taiwan’s defense as a contradiction of one of its core interests. Apart from its assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan, China has numerous other territorial claims. It has settled or deferred most of its land-border disputes, which may signify its interest in a stable neigh- borhood as it re-orients strategically toward the Pacific and its most formidable potential adversary, the United States.23 While deferring its land-territorial claims, China has become more adamant, impatient, and rowdy over its maritime-territorial claims. Of the latter, the most consequential economically and for regional security are those in the South China Sea. While China’s political leaders have not asserted that these interests are of the same order as its control over Taiwan and Tibet, military officers have intimated that Chinese sovereignty is at stake, implying that these are not just Chinese claims but sover- eign rights with which others in the area are interfering.24 In any case, China’s interests in controlling the South China Sea is at odds with 23 Taylor Fravel, Strong Borders, Secure Nation: Cooperation and Conflict in China’s Territo- rial Disputes, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008. 24 Heginbotham, unpublished RAND research. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 99 its interests in maintaining friendly and influential relations with its Southeast Asian neighbors.25 Chinese policy statements continue to recognize international stability as a precondition for economic growth based on trade. As China’s neighbors have become wary of its power, Beijing has adopted such formulations as “peaceful rise” and “peace and development.” On the whole, China has used its growing clout judiciously and been a stal- wart supporter of the sanctity of existing sovereigns, regardless of their legitimacy (or regarding them as legitimate by definition). It has gener- ally opposed economic sanctions and international intervention. It is often at loggerheads with the United States and its allies over regime change (e.g., in the Middle East) and the “responsibility to protect” (e.g., in Africa), partly because of its attachment to the principle of non- interference and partly to protect its access to established regimes and their energy and other resources. Compared with Imperial Germany, Imperial Japan, and Teddy Roosevelt’s acquisitive America, China has been the model of restraint. Whereas they colonialized in order to get resources (and for other reasons), China relies instead on development aid, trading leverage, investment, and preferential long-term supply contracts, without attaching strings to such issues as the way a regime treats its people. China’s record of military action during its economic expansion since the 1980s pales in comparison with that of the United States, which has used significant force in Panama, Kuwait, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya during that same period. Far from being bel- ligerent, revisionist, or revolutionary, China has actually been conser- vative and reserved internationally.26 25 Deng’s admonition to avoid international trouble, for the sake of development, has been employed in explicit opposition to Beijing’s assertiveness on the South China Sea. Heginbo- tham, unpublished RAND research. 26 China has been an active participant in the six-party talks on North Korea and has participated in anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden, creating joint patrols with South Korean and Japanese contingents. On some economic trade and investment issues, its posi- tion is often closer to that of the United States than, for example, India. In other cases, Chi- nese positions conflict with those of the United States. On issues that relate to sovereignty norms—for example, sanctions against Egypt, Syria, or Iran—China has sided with Russia, 100 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Will China’s caution decline as its ability to act militarily grows? This is unclear, for China’s interests pull it in two different directions: multilateral-cooperative and unilateral-assertive. Its need for access to materials and markets—to sustain economic development and political stability—creates contradictory impulses. Again, it has benefited from and has a continuing interest in a healthy and well-managed world economy, a quiet and peaceful international environment, good stand- ing with states near and far, open and secure international waters, and avoiding conflict and costly arms competition with the United States. Yet, the magnitude and urgency of China’s economic demands lead it to seek unilateral advantage (e.g., in preferential long-term energy supply relationships), to stay on good terms with bad regimes sitting on resources (Iranian oil, Sudanese oil, North Korean ores), and even to threaten force to back its positions in disputes with large economic stakes (e.g., in the South China Sea). China favors and complies with rules, unless it can do better by skirting them while others comply. The Chinese impulse to act unilaterally and forcefully appears to be stronger the closer to China one gets. Generally, China favors “soft power” globally and “hard power” regionally. It is unclear whether this is because China has growing regional yet scant global military capabilities, because its interests are stronger—worth fighting for— the nearer they are, or because it seeks some degree of regional domi- nance. For our purposes, what matters is that China appears willing and is increasingly able to threaten force to advance and defend its interests in a region that is too important for the United States to grant China the prerogative to do so. While Great Britain was ready to grant such a prerogative to the United States in the Western Hemisphere in the late 19th century, the United States appears willing to give China no such space today. The two questions this leaves, then, are: Which Brazil, India, and others in opposing U.S. and European efforts (or supporting significantly watered-down versions). And while China is a member of most of the organizations that define the world system today, it is also an active and important participant in at least two organizations—the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) group—that have tried to push the international system in directions more amenable to developing or non-Western states. Heginbotham, unpublished RAND research. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 101 great power will be more capable militarily in the Western Pacific? (see Chapter Four) and Will the interaction of U.S. and Chinese interests and capabilities in the Western Pacific necessarily be confrontational? (see Chapter Five). Having identified the seeds of Sino-U.S. rivalry and potential confrontation in the Western Pacific, it is important to note that the compatibility of Chinese and U.S. interests globally could have a mod- erating effect, on both countries, in the region. As noted in the preced- ing discussion of U.S. interests, Chinese and U.S. interests are more conducive to cooperation beyond than in East Asia. Notwithstanding their criticism of U.S. unilateralism and preference for multi-polarity, the Chinese are generally comfortable with the current global order, which has served them well. China shares U.S. interests in the free flow of goods, capital, and technology; containment of extremism; security of energy sources and routes; reduction of poverty; peaceful resolution of disputes; and control of nuclear weapons. While China often disagrees with the United States outside of East Asia—notably, on the issue of intervention—this has not prevented cooperation on other global issues nor brought them anywhere close to hostilities (for which, as noted, the United States has overwhelming advantages). Fun- damentally, China’s congeniality on global issues is not a favor or con- cession to the United States but instead a pursuit of Chinese interests that happen to coincide with U.S. interests. It follows that China could remain cooperative elsewhere while competing regionally. At the same time, like the United States’, China’s interest and involvement in global cooperation may curb its regional antagonism. Yet, as noted earlier, there is some possibility of Sino-American confrontation in all of East Asia’s potential trouble hot spots: Korea, Taiwan, the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and China’s land dispute with Vietnam. Arching over these particular dangers is China’s intent to reduce the U.S. threat to itself and to the pursuit of its regional interests. Moreover, whether or not it means to achieve some sort of regional hegemony, China’s interest in access to the world’s resources, its markets, and thus its oceans, place it at odds with the U.S. presence off its shores. Because the Chinese regard U.S. military and naval capa- bilities in the region as a potential danger to their interests, they feel the 102 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific need to challenge the dominant sea power in the Western Pacific, and they are working energetically to meet that need with their anti-naval capabilities. Chinese Strategy The tensions that define U.S. strategy toward China likewise define Chinese strategy toward the United States in particular and the outside world in general: To gain economic access and earn influence within the existing order and or to use its mounting power unilaterally. To keep the external environment calm or to press Chinese rights and claims. To befriend neighbors or to encourage deference to Chinese might, at the risk of isolation. To pursue good relations with the United States or to undermine U.S. power and influence where it could harm Chinese interests. To avoid a costly arms race or to seek operational- military advantages to deter or defeat threats to China and its interests. To rely on the United States and on cooperation with it to keep trade routes secure or to build and deploy capabilities to do so independently. Like the United States, the Chinese will try to have it both ways on these choices. As noted, the impulses, constraints, and choices of Chinese strat- egy will differ from East Asia to the world at large. Cooperation is more appealing globally; competition more compelling regionally. The farther from China, the less capability and latitude for risk-taking the Chinese have.27 When the security of China and its sovereign inter- ests, e.g., reunification and territorial rights, is at stake, the Chinese are less willing to leave outcomes to others. When they are constrained to negotiate and seek agreed solutions bearing on those sovereign interests, the Chinese will exploit the shadow of their growing military power if 27 Heginbotham (unpublished RAND research) notes that, on the global stage, China would like to be seen as an important and constructive member of international society, though there is much ambivalence about exactly what that means. It has a great stake in much of the current architecture of global governance and values its position within the United Nations and UN Security Council, World Trade Organization, G-20, NPT Nuclear Suppliers’ Group, and a host of other international organizations. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 103 not the threat of force. As Chinese interests and defensive concerns become less acute at greater distance—in the Middle East and Africa, for example—the shadow vanishes and cooperation is more likely. In the Western Indian Ocean, for example, the Chinese navy works with those of the Americans, Japanese, South Koreans, and others to protect international shipping from Somali pirates. Yet in the Western Pacific, Chinese ships harass some of those same navies. Is the contrast between Chinese regional and global behavior the result of a contrast between its near and far military capabilities or instead a matter of strategy reflecting a difference in importance between its near and far interests? The answer is probably both: China is more advanced in developing and deploying regional military capa- bilities than global ones because the former are easier, cheaper, quicker, and in some ways a logical step toward the latter. But regional military capabilities are also a much higher priority, driven largely by consid- erations of the defense of China itself. Generally, as states extend their definitions of security from their territory to their interests abroad, their military capabilities are also extended, unless of course they lack the resources or are content to count on the strength, or good behav- ior, of others. Though amply resourced, it is not clear that the Chinese want to invest heavily in the ability to station or project forces around the world if they can count on others, mainly the United States, to look after Chinese interests. The role of military forces generally in China’s strategy bears examination. Having treated defense spending as a low priority when the country was struggling to escape mass poverty and build national infrastructure, the Chinese have in the past decade made military capa- bilities a high priority. Past growth in spending on defense has matched GDP growth at roughly 10 percent. But in the past few years, Chinese defense spending has grown faster than GDP—as high as 18 percent per annum. As a result, China now spends as much on defense as the rest of East Asia combined (excluding North Korea). China’s estimated 2011 defense spending was $130 billion; the next six totaled $128 bil- 104 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific lion.28 Assuming present growth rates and that Japan stays near its tra- ditional 1 percent of GDP for defense, Chinese military spending will be twice that of the region in as little as five years. Chinese defense spending today is dwarfed by that of the United States. However, if current trends continue, this gap will shrink in both absolute and relative terms, as Figure 1 shows. Of significance is that the preponderance of Chinese military investments and activi- ties will be concentrated in East Asia, whereas the United States must meet global demands. During the post-9/11 decade, at least 40 percent of U.S. defense spending could be attributed to meeting the needs of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), compared with roughly 20 percent for the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM), the second-big- gest claimant.29 Even if and as the United States shifts its defense priori- 28 Japan, $55 billion; South Korea, $28 billion; Australia, $23 billion; Singapore, $9 billion; Taiwan, $8 billion; Indonesia, $5 billion. 29 David C.

To illustrate crudely, based on these aggregate projections, and assuming that 33 percent of U.S. defense spending is to support PACOM and 66 percent of Chinese spending is directed to PACOM’s area, China will outspend the United States and Japan together on military capabilities and activities in East Asia over the next 20 years. The growth in China’s defense outlays has gone overwhelmingly toward building up its Pacific-oriented capabilities. There are several reasons for this: the priority placed on self-defense; preoccupation with neutralizing U.S. strike capabilities in the region; the need to back up Chinese territorial claims; and the simple fact that air, naval, and force- projection capabilities increase in cost as a function of range (making regional ones affordable and extra-regional ones not). However, the fact that China has placed its emphasis almost exclusively on regional capa- bilities confirms the predisposition toward hard power in the region and soft power beyond that one can observe. Just as the United States defines security in terms of interests, including but going well beyond its territory, China may move in this direction. Like the United States, it has the economic wherewithal and worldwide interests to do so. The difference between the two is not only a matter of being at different stages of development but also one of geography: The United States has not been concerned with the mili- tary presence in its region of any other power since the Cold War (and before then, in the 19th century), whereas China is very concerned with the presence of another power, the United States, in its region. Just as the United States sought to banish Spanish, British, and the Soviet power from its region, Chinese strategy is to pressure American power in its region. At the same time, China is neither blatantly aggressive nor cat- egorically hostile to U.S. interests in East Asia. The goal of securing what it regards as sovereign territory is in tension with the need to maintain good relations with its neighbors and the United States. In the face of confrontational Chinese behavior in the South China Sea in the 1990s, regional states sought closer military ties with the United States. China responded by launching a “charm offensive” to prevent 106 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific U.S. alliances from being strengthened and itself from being isolated. In recent years, China has again become pushy, especially with regard to maritime-boundary disputes with its Southeast Asia neighbors. Sim- ilar swings can be seen in China’s relations with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Because of this experience and China’s steady military build-up, the important states of the Western Pacific are less susceptible to Chinese charm. Despite such political backlash in the region, and because of the perceived U.S. threat, the Chinese are unlikely to gravitate toward an accommodating, soft-power strategy in the region, as they are doing beyond the region. Whether the United States has been sufficiently consistent and creative in drawing China into cooperative solutions to East Asian problems is a policy matter to which we will return in Chapter Five. Under current conditions, the United States cannot assume that China will cease to strengthen its A2AD capabilities, forgo threats to get its way in territorial disputes, or accept strong U.S. military presence. The apparent commitment of China to strengthen its regional military capabilities raises the question of the purposes to which these capabilities might be put. Again, there is no indication that China wants to conquer neighboring nation-states. Nor is there logic to such Chi- nese designs, given the integration of East Asian economies. The ideol- ogy of growth—as opposed to that of messianic revolution—requires and has succeeded in providing access to foreign resources through trade, investment, and correct state-to-state relations. Although China has several contested borders, as well as 100 million or more ethnic Chinese living in the region outside of China, it is hard to see how the benefits of wholesale territorial conquest would be worth the staggering costs and the risks of a conflagration. More plausible is that the Chi- nese would use force against neighbors to settle prejudicially territorial disputes that involve important Chinese interests, such as achieving national unification or securing access to essential sea-based resources. Also plausible is China’s use of force in the event it feels threatened, such as in the event of a violent collapse of the North Korean state, the loss of control over North Korean nuclear weapons, or South Korean incursion into North Korea. The form this might take is at this point U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 107 unclear, and whether Chinese military intervention in North Korea would be harmful or helpful depends on circumstances and on Chi- nese aims. If Chinese strategy includes options of using force for such pur- poses, the PLA must plan for contingencies involving hostilities with intervening U.S. forces. As already discussed, important U.S. interests and commitments would be at stake in the event of Chinese use of force against Taiwan, in the South China Sea, against Japan in the East China Sea, or against South Korea. Therefore, the PLA’s ability to deter or degrade U.S. military intervention in the Western Pacific is a necessary component of Chinese strategy—again, even in the absence of Chinese designs to conquer any neighboring nation-states. This is something to which the Chinese military, with the blessing of the political leadership, has given a great deal of attention; indeed, it is central to Chinese military strategy and priorities. Moreover, even if China opts not to use its growing power to get its way in regional quar- rels, the presence of U.S. strike forces hardens its resolve to neutralize this threat-in-being. Before Deng, China quarreled mainly with its land neighbors: India, Vietnam, and the Soviet Union. Since Deng, China’s access to the Pacific and the world beyond has become far more important than its exact boundaries in remote and non-useful hinterlands of Asia. In addition, China’s rise has increased the feasibility of Taiwan’s re-unification; while the Chinese do not want to use force for this pur- pose, their ability to do so could be essential to gaining enough lever- age to produce a favorable outcome politically. Whether in anticipat- ing a conflict over Taiwan or in assuring Chinese access to the Pacific, U.S. military power, especially U.S. sea power, could be a major obstacle. Add to these concerns the potential threat to China of U.S. strike power in the Western Pacific, and one sees why Chinese strategy requires plans and preparations for military conflict with the United States—hardly what the Chinese want, but something that circum- stance might force on them. Chinese military strategy to thwart U.S. intervention has been extensively documented, even advertised by the Chinese, and exhaus- 108 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific tively analyzed by the Americans.30 In a nutshell, Chinese military strat- egists believe the PLA’s best chance of deterring, degrading, or defeating U.S. intervention is to strike U.S. intervention forces swiftly, perhaps preemptively, and to limit as much as possible the ensuing conflict’s scope—duration, geography, weapons, targets, damage. This strategy explains the priority the PLA places on A2AD capabilities. In its sights are the most likely instruments of U.S. intervention: large aircraft car- riers. To target the carriers, the Chinese are developing extended-range and space-based sensors, space-based guidance systems, anti-ship bal- listic missiles, cruise missiles, attack submarines, and digital communi- cations networks to tie everything together. Chinese doctrine calls for swift, intense, coordinated attacks to impede and degrade U.S. forces. While not seeking armed conflict with the United States, obviously, Chinese military strategy depends on attacking U.S. strike forces early, first, or even preemptively if conflict appears probable. Even with such capabilities and doctrine, the PLA cannot expect to prevent successful U.S. military intervention unless (a) U.S. political leaders decide that the costs and risks outweigh the value of interven- tion; (b) hostilities remain confined in scope and end before the United States can bring its global strike power to bear; or (c) the command, control, and communications systems on which U.S. forces vitally depend are crippled. Because the Chinese cannot be confident of the first or second factor, both being mainly under U.S. control, they have begun to concentrate on the third. The PLA’s interest in both cyber- warfare and anti-satellite warfare is driven by the belief that its best and perhaps only chance of prevailing against U.S. forces is to attack U.S. space-based and other command, control, and communications networks, which are relatively vulnerable. (We will return to military- technological competition and its effect on possible Sino-U.S. conflict in the next chapter.) Just as U.S. military strategy serves both operational and politi- cal needs, so does China’s. The more capable the PLA is of conducting successful operations against its regional and U.S. forces, the longer and darker will be the shadow cast on relationships and actions short 30 Among the latest and best examples is Saunders et al., 2011. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 109 of war by all actors in the region. At the same time, the Chinese may feel pressure to “pull their punches”—at least in the use of force even in the forces they deploy—for fear of adverse political reactions. Again, if recent years are a guide to the future, the expansion and use of Chinese military capabilities has been attended not by greater regional defer- ence but by the opposite: greater interest by U.S. allies and potential partners in a strong U.S. posture. There are sure to be some influential Chinese concerned that unreserved support for the PLA to satisfy its operational requirements would hurt, not help, China’s political ambi- tions in the region. Aside from its military aspects, Chinese strategy is more or less a mirror image of U.S. strategy: preparing for confrontation in East Asia in hopes of avoiding it, while cooperating where interests con- verge globally. Like the United States, China would suffer grievous economic damage in the event of regional conflict; and like the Ameri- cans, the Chinese no doubt think that this consideration will dictate caution on the part of its potential adversary. China’s integration into the world economy is thus crucial not only for development but also in giving the United States a strong disincentive to use force against China, especially if it has no vital interests involved. In addition, China will partner with the United States on global challenges—nuclear non- proliferation, counterterrorism, counter-piracy, energy security—when it serves Chinese security interests and as long as the costs are not too high. It will also seek a greater voice and accept more responsibility in international institutions. Given its regional interests, China will need to balance cooperative global policies with assertive regional ones, just like the United States will. Taking a belligerent posture in East Asia could ruin prospects for global cooperation; yet taking a humble pos- ture in East Asia in order to expand global cooperation would leave the United States in a position to threaten, intervene, and align the region against China. While it would be a mistake to interpret Chinese strategy and predict Chinese behavior as a product of “hawks and doves” vying for or slicing up control, there is a pattern worth noting. Whereas the PLA is preoccupied with the security of China and preparations for conflict, the state’s civilian leaders and institutions (e.g., the Ministry 110 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific of Foreign Affairs) are also interested in improving China’s standing in the world and relations with countries that can help it achieve its goals. With respect to the United States, the PLA has responsibility to plan for military contingencies, which are all in China’s vicinity; the civilians are expected to maintain a stable international environ- ment and to manage the complex mix of cooperative and competitive Sino-U.S. relations. On top of this, China’s new business elites have a strong interest and some influence in creating favorable conditions for Chinese trade, investment, and acquisition of technology, in which the United States figures significantly. Finally, China’s expanding num- bers of informed citizens are showing increased pride, patriotism, and nationalism about China’s success, its role in the world, and its rela- tions with the United States. Ironically, the middle-class Chinese who have so much to gain from economic cooperation favor a hard line when China is disrespected by the Americans (or Japanese). Reflecting the perspectives of its hawkish officers, cautious states- men, internationalist businessmen, and nationalistic bourgeoisie, as well as tensions among its global and regional interests, China’s strat- egy contains a mix of moderation and belligerence, making it all the more perplexing for the United States, just as U.S. strategy is obviously perplexing for the Chinese (and many Americans). Notwithstanding one-party rule, finding a genuine and stable synthesis among these competing interests and perspectives will be as difficult for China as it is for the United States. In quoting Deng Xiaoping’s famous apho- rism, high Chinese officials have modified the original: China should “uphold keeping a low profile and actively achieve something” (modi- fications in italics).31 This implies that China can be more assertive abroad, as its power now permits, and still preserve a tranquil environ- ment, as its development still demands. Because of the internal tensions and lack of consensus in China’s strategy, its conduct will be largely in reaction to challenges and opportunities presented by the United States. Steady pursuit by the United States of Sino-U.S. global economic and security partnership could embolden those in China who favor a moderate and multilateral 31 M. Taylor Fravel, “Revising Deng’s Foreign Policy,” taylorfravel.com, January 17, 2012. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 111 approach to the region. But by the same token, it would be a mistake for the United States to bank on Chinese politicians, much less gener- als and admirals, to embrace cooperation outside their region with a power seen as threatening to China and its interests in their region. Yet, for the United States to relinquish its role in East Asian security in the belief that Chinese strategy will become more cooperative might have the opposite effect. We will return to the question of the interaction of Chinese and U.S. strategy in the Western Pacific after analyzing what sea power means to the Chinese. Chinese Sea Power Mahan viewed China as an object of sea power. As an avid reader of world history, Mahan knew that China had not been a sea power since the early 15th century. As the 19th century ended, Great Brit- ain, Japan, the United States, and others competed over the spoils of China’s lack of internal cohesion. Presciently, Mahan also described China as “being swept irresistibly into the general movement of the world, from which it so long stood apart . . . [and with] a momentous future.”32 Rightly or wrongly, he called China “obstructive by tempera- ment . . . [with] an impulse to overbear its political action by display of force.”33 For another century, being weak, poor, vulnerable, unsta- ble, and introverted, China had none of the prerequisites of being a genuine sea power. Mao called for China to build a powerful navy “to oppose imperialist aggression” and got Soviet help to that end. In real- ity, sea power was out of the question: If China’s economic backward- ness made naval strength unrealistic, its economic isolation made naval strength non-essential. In the 1970s, China’s surface fleet grew from 20 to 200 missile- carrying ships, its submarine force grew from 35 to 100 boats, and it developed nuclear-powered submarines. Yet, until 1988, about the time when Deng’s strategy went into high gear, China’s navy was so 32 Mahan on Naval Strategy, Hattendorf, 1991, p. 331. 33 Mahan on Naval Strategy, Hattendorf, 1991, p. 286. 112 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific subordinate to its army that it was led by a PLA general, not an admi- ral. Though one of the world’s largest, its mission was coastal defense, its training was a low priority, and it lacked critical capabilities: naval aviation, anti-submarine warfare, quiet (survivable) open-ocean sub- marines, and electronic warfare. A long shift toward sea power began in the mid-1980s and took until the mid-2000s before China embraced sea power as a national, not just naval, priority.34 This two-decade growth in national aware- ness, commitment, and capabilities is loosely comparable to the United States from roughly 1880 to 1900, Germany from 1890 to 1914, and Japan from 1920 to 1941. It came about because of the coincidence of the end of the Soviet land threat to China and the commitment of China to trade-based growth. Also, once the Cold War ended, the U.S. naval presence in the Western Pacific, once valued, looked increasingly aimed at China. As China grew and industrialized, it acquired the wherewithal and need to build modern naval and anti-naval capabili- ties. Again, when a U.S. show of carrier strength foiled their designs in the 1996 Taiwan crisis, Chinese political and military leaders under- stood that both re-unification and China’s overall security interests required the means to prevent the United States from threatening or dictating to China in the region. This new “major strategic direction” was documented in top-level planning guidance.35 China’s 2004 Defense White Paper “swept aside assumptions regarding land-force preeminence when it stated that the PLA Navy, the PLA Air Force, and the Second Artillery (ballistic mis- sile forces) were to receive priority in funding.” China’s military priori- ties were to be “command of the sea, command of the air, and strategic counter-strikes [i.e., nuclear deterrence].”36 Now, with China becoming more prosperous, strong, confident, outward-looking, and dependent on oceanic trade, would Mahan rec- ognize it as a sea power? The answer, most likely: not yet. The settle- ment, or suspension, of China’s land-border disputes have permitted 34 McDevitt, 2011. 35 McDevitt, 2011, pp. 197–204. 36 People’s Republic of China, China’s National Defense in 2004, white paper, 2004. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 113 significant transfer of resources from ground to naval and anti-naval forces. The PLA Navy (PLAN) has graduated in capabilities and oper- ating range from narrow coastal defense to green and increasingly blue waters.37 It is now being used to assert Chinese territorial claims and resource rights in the South China and East China Seas, as well as to participate in multinational counter-piracy operations off Somalia’s coast. It now regularly practices underway replenishment—a precondi- tion of extending sea power—and has begun to address its deficiencies in naval aviation, quiet submarines, and exploitation of information technology. This last (to be examined at depth in the next chapter) is critical for C4ISR and thus for integrated A2AD operations. Yet, the Chinese navy’s main purpose is still to protect China from U.S. sea-based strike power and potentially a resurgent Japan. Moreover, according a recent study by the Congressional Research Service, it “continues to exhibit limitations or weaknesses in several areas, including capabilities for sustained operations by large forma- tions in distant waters, joint operations with other parts of China’s mil- itary, C4ISR systems, anti-air warfare, anti-submarine warfare, [and] a dependence on foreign suppliers for certain key ship components.”38 For all the attention China’s first aircraft carrier has gotten, it is a refur- bished, unimpressive Soviet one. For all the attention its deployment of ships to the Gulf of Aden has gotten, this is the first deployment of Chinese warships outside the Asia-Pacific region since the 15th century and consists of three ships. Despite the limits of their missions and their reach, China’s naval forces appear to be evolving loosely according to the pattern of Ger- many, the United States, and Japan in the late 19th century: coastal defense of the homeland, then security of territorial waters and ship- ping approaches, then protection of sea-lanes and commercial interests, then distant power projection. In China’s case, holding at risk U.S. 37 Although the name has been changed by the Chinese to “Chinese Navy,” the term PLAN is still widely used and will be used interchangeably with Chinese Navy here. 38 Ronald O’Rourke, China Naval Modernization: Implications for U.S. Navy Capabilities— Background and Issues for Congress, Washington, D.C.: Congressional Research Service, RL33153, October 17, 2012. 114 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific carriers within strike range of the mainland was the first priority; now, added emphasis is being placed on backing China’s territorial claims and resource interests in the seas around it; Chinese rhetoric and naval investment suggest that China intends not to leave the security of its trade routes, including oil tanker lanes, to others—namely, the U.S. Navy.39 While the Chinese have not committed to global sea power, their needs and aspirations extend to “far seas,” including the entire Pacific and the Indian Ocean.40 The debate in China about sea power reveals sophisticated under- standing of the issues and challenges involved and, on the whole, is more reassuring than alarming: The hegemonic pattern of 19th- and 20th-century sea powers, per Mahan, is not widely embraced; law- based freedom and rights are stressed; and peaceful use and exploita- tion of the seas is preferred. Moreover, the Chinese appear to be real- istic about both sea control and sea denial. While they seek secure access for trade and resource exploitation, they cannot ignore U.S. sea power, and thus they entertain rules, co-existence, and cooperation. Insofar as they mean to deny others such access, it is to defend China against attack from the sea and to extend security over waters they claim as Chinese. In effect, this outlook fits the regional-global pattern of Chinese interests and strategy identified above: reliance on national strength and, if need be, force, in waters adjacent to China, and will- ingness to cooperate with the established power beyond those waters. Even though the Chinese generally buy the economic reasoning that underpinned Mahan’s argument for sea power, Chinese thinking about sea power itself is not really Mahanian. He argued that becom- ing a global power required becoming a global sea power, that commit- ment to sea power must occupy the entire state and the consciousness of the nation, and that the core capability of a navy is offensive force. Mahan was also clear that a sea power must be able to deny other states, including competing sea powers, secure trade lanes and naval links. To him, sea power was not an extension of territorial defense, regional 39 Ronald O’Rourke, “PLAN Force Structure: Submarines, Ships, and Aircraft,” in Saunders et al., eds., 2011, p. 143. 40 O’Rourke, 2011. U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 115 hegemony, or cooperation: rather, it was about rivalry and conflict on and for the world’s oceans. Of course, the United States itself was far from a sea power when Mahan wrote The Influence of Sea Power upon History. Yet, within 20 years it was strong enough to destroy a Spanish fleet in Manila harbor, convince Great Britain to redirect its sea power elsewhere, and impress the world while circumnavigating it. Production-based economic growth, industrialization, and achievement of continental control enabled the United States to become a sea power; its grow- ing trade, commitment to hemispheric dominance, and determina- tion to be a global power impelled it to do so. China in the early 21st century is similar in some ways: rapidly growing and industrializing; consolidating continental control; heavily dependent on sea trade (much more dependent, in fact, than the United States was in 1890); opposed to foreign naval dominance in its region; and aspiring to be a global power. Yet, even if China evolves in concept and capabili- ties toward Mahanian sea power, it cannot expect to mount a chal- lenge to American superiority beyond the Western Pacific. The prob- lem for the United States is not Chinese global sea control, which is beyond China’s grasp, but instead Chinese regional sea denial, which is within its grasp. In the region, Chinese military and political leaders are discover- ing how useful naval forces are—more so than ground forces—both in protecting the country from the offshore U.S. threats and in press- ing Chinese claims in the South China and East China Seas. Includ- ing anti-naval capabilities, regional sea power is China’s top military priority. Challenging American sea power in the Western Pacific does not require China to develop a large blue-water fleet. As its anti-naval capabilities are increased and improved, making use of advanced infor- mation technologies, it is acquiring the means to neutralize U.S. strike power in the region. In time, it could even deny U.S. naval and trade access in a region of great importance to the American economy and, in effect, claim a sphere of influence, similar to what the United States did once it became a hemispheric sea power. Beyond regional waters, Chinese sea power is but a gleam in the eye: contributing modestly to protection of shipping against Somali 116 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific pirates, incapable of challenging the United States on the high seas, and effectively relying on the United States to secure trade routes vital for energy supplies and access to world resources and markets. As already noted, the farther from China the Chinese must address security chal- lenges, the more inclined they are to do so cooperatively. As noted, one can see a pattern of Sino-American maritime collaboration in distant regions (e.g., Gulf of Aden) at the same time China threatens U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. Based on historical cases of rising powers—the United States, Germany, and Japan—it will be at least two decades before China can apply the skills, doctrine, technology, and logistics to become a global sea power, assuming it decides to do so. However, the crux of the problem for the United States is that China does not need global sea power—i.e., a high-seas fleet—to wield sea power in the Western Pacific with its anti-naval capabilities. China is practicing a form of sea power whereby control, or at least denial, of the seas does not neces- sitate power upon the seas. While Mahan did not imagine them, he would be the first to recognize Chinese anti-ship missiles as a feature of sea power no less than the battleships he knew. The challenge to Amer- ican sea power, and thus American interests, in the Western Pacific is not decades away but looming now. Indeed, China is growing its sea power at a faster pace than the United States is adapting its sea power. Conclusion: The Interaction of U.S. and Chinese Sea Power If China means to establish sea denial in East Asian waters, even while enjoying the benefits of U.S. sea power beyond the region, it will be opposed. The United States will not and cannot allow China to deny access to East Asian waters, nor accept a Chinese sphere of influence detrimental to U.S. interests that such sea denial would imply. Yet the Chinese will not—for in their way of thinking they cannot—allow the U.S. Navy to control the Western Pacific without risk or rival. Thus, the analog of Anglo-American accommodation described in the previous chapter breaks down, and that of Anglo-German confronta- U.S. and Chinese Interests and Sea Power in the Western Pacific 117 tion seems more applicable. While the United States has not explicitly threatened to sever China’s vital trade routes, as it did Japan’s in the run-up to Pearl Harbor, opportunities exist for Sino-U.S. sea-power rivalry to become heated and even violent. The United States has the clear ability, possible motivation, and regional encouragement to foil Chinese attempts to use sea power against its neighbors in the South China and East China Seas. It could, if need be, again flaunt its strike power in the event of another Chinese attempt to intimidate Taiwan. Moreover, U.S. planners and pundits could contemplate a blockade of China, e.g., intercepting Chinese shipping in the Malaccan Strait, as a way of bolstering deterrence of Chinese aggression. For these reasons, it seems highly likely that the Chinese will attempt to neutralize, though not necessarily copy, U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. Elsewhere, the Chinese will be receptive to coop- erative maritime security—their way of reconciling the need for mari- time security with the infeasibility of meeting that need unilaterally. They may be satisfied, even pleased, that the United States will con- tinue to secure oil-transport and other shipping routes in the Middle East, across the Indian Ocean, and even through Southeast Asian nar- rows; for that relieves China of a burden and allows it to concentrate its resources and sea power on challenging its American benefactor-rival in the Western Pacific. What the United States can and should do, technologically and politically, about the strategic bind it is in is taken up in the next two chapters. 119 Chapter Four Technological Change “Communications dominate war . . . they are the most important single element in strategy, political or military.” —A. T. Mahan1 The Networking and Targeting Revolutions Mahan thought and wrote at a time when naval capabilities were lim- ited and operational concepts were defined by the distances of gunnery and visual communications. While he clearly understood the implica- tions of industrialization—from sail to steam and wood to steel—he can be pardoned for believing that the offensive power of the concen- trated battle fleet, with the line of dreadnoughts as its spine, was the key to naval victory and world sea power. He died (in December 1914) before the dreadnought proved to be something of a flop—hardly engaged by either side at Jutland (1916).2 Ironically, the great conflict that Mahan’s ideas are blamed for helping to cause began the obsoles- cence of the very capability that was at the core of those ideas. Whether the ideas themselves transcend technological changes that Mahan and his contemporaries did not contemplate is an important question bear- ing of the future of sea power and American interests in the Western Pacific. The technologies for air and undersea warfare that redefined sea power after World War I both were at first resisted by the U.S. Navy. The submarine was described by a young Chester Nimitz as a “Jules 1 Alfred T. Mahan, The Problem of Asia and Its Effect upon International Policies, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1900, p. 125, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991. 2 Irving, 1966. 120 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Verne fantasy” (though Nimitz deserves much of the credit for subse- quently developing submarine technology and forces).3 Although the French and Germans were early leaders in building and using subma- rines, the Americans—with the Japanese close behind—pioneered the aircraft carrier as the new core of the fleet. By the Battle of Midway, carrier superiority—still concentrated, but at tactical-aircraft range— prevailed, and since then the carrier has been the emblem of sea power. In parallel, electromagnetic-wave technology—radio and radar— extended the ranges of coordinated action and attack. Nuclear power has extended greatly the cruising endurance—not to mention the destructive power—of carriers and submarines. Just as 19th-century technologies produced and 20th-century technologies soon superseded the sea power observed by Mahan, the information technology is revolutionizing at least the content and per- haps also the concepts of sea power at the beginning of the 21st cen- tury. Although the U.S. Navy has pioneered and now stands supreme in exploiting this latest revolution in its capabilities and operating con- cepts, the effect of these technologies on sea power has only begun. Nowhere is change more evident than in the Western Pacific. And nowhere, because of the interests and capabilities of the established power and the rising power, will change be more consequential. The information revolution has taken two branches in military affairs in general and naval affairs in particular. Although related in their core technologies, their implications are different enough—in tension, even—that they can be, and here will be, thought of as dual revolutions. The duel of these dual revolutions will affect the course and consequences of sea-power competition for years and probably decades to come. Whether and how the United States will be able to maintain sea power in the Western Pacific despite China’s challenge to it depend largely on U.S. technological strategy. Thanks to digital communications and satellites, computer net- working permits forces to be integrated yet also distributed geographi- cally, making them both more effective and less vulnerable. Greater effectiveness comes because any node in the network—any unit, sensor, 3 Borneman, 2012, p. 79. Technological Change 121 platform, weapon, or person—located virtually anywhere will be able to work in conjunction with any and every other node.4 Vulnerability is reduced as enemy forces face greater complexity and expanse in tar- geting distributed forces. The longer the communications and weapon ranges, the more distributed yet still integrated the whole force can be: Barriers to global communications are being demolished by the creation of information infrastructure, largely for commercial use, and information technology allows weapon ranges to be extended without sacrificing accuracy. In the naval domain, Mahan’s insistence on the need to concentrate the fleet to achieve concentrated offensive force has been overtaken by ranges that are theoretically global. Beyond the advantages of being able to connect forces over distance, network- ing allows those of all services and in all domains—naval, land, air, space, and cyber—to share data and operate jointly, multiplying their effectiveness. Meanwhile, the information revolution has led to improvements in finding and tracking targets (sensing, for short), in integrating data from diverse sensors (fusing), and in feeding the result to any weapon system (sensor-to-shooter). Also, by guiding weapons from “off-board” navigation systems (e.g., GPS), information technology has reduced the cost of accurate weapons; as a result, a strike force can better afford ample weapons to achieve its missions.5 When networked with advanced command and control systems, in which human deci- sionmaking is enhanced by data-crunching and imaging, the result is improved targeting. Technology is making the concentration of naval forces less important than ever even as it is making it more hazardous than ever. 4 This benefit is less pronounced in a hub-and-spoke network than in a node-to-node (any- to-any) network. The former conforms to traditional military command and control systems and largely describes today’s status quo. The latter offers unprecedented horizontal integra- tion and flexibility. But it requires sweeping in command and control, which is impeded by institutional resistance and inertia. But it is an aspiration that is permitted by existing tech- nology and will be driven by operational need. 5 With cheaper and more accurate munitions, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy have had more than enough munitions to carry out their missions in all major campaigns since the Gulf War (Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan). 122 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Because the purpose of advanced targeting is to weaken or destroy opposing forces, it competes with the networking of those forces, which is intended to make them more survivable. By the same token, the force with the upper hand in both networking and targeting can, all else being equal, have a decisive operational edge (assuming its computer networks are not disrupted by cyber-war attacks, an issue to which we will return in short order). At present, U.S. forces hold this dual advantage, especially for “high-intensity” warfare of the sort one might expect with Chinese forces in the Western Pacific. Although U.S. and Chinese military strategies, requirements, and operating concepts differ, as the preceding chapter explains, both are seeking to make their forces less vulnerable and more effective by advanced networking, while making opposing forces more vulnerable and less effective by advanced targeting. The effects of these technolo- gies on sea power are as pronounced as they are in any military realm. The race between the two countries and between the two revolutions is heating up, and the outcome is not obvious. U.S. Naval Strengths and Weaknesses Again, the U.S. military is far ahead of all comers in exploiting infor- mation technology. For operations in the Western Pacific, the naval, land, and air forces at the disposal of PACOM can be integrated, regardless of location, through joint C4ISR systems. Sensors available to these forces, whether operated by the U.S. military or by U.S. intelli- gence services, provide exceedingly fine resolution, wide coverage, and immediacy. Networked, the data from these sensors are fused, ana- lyzed, and shared with forces for targeting their weapons, which have pin-point accuracy. The combined effect is that U.S. strike and expe- ditionary forces have unmatched speed, reach, and lethality, and thus operational superiority. Because of the ability to call on the whole joint force, every U.S. service is superior in its domain. The difficulty of taking advantage of these capabilities in actual operations should not be underestimated. People and struc- tures have always been challenged to make the most of revolution- Technological Change 123 ary technologies—think of aviation, submarines, and precision-guided munitions. This takes highly trained personnel, agile command and control, fluid tactics, and seamless inter-service coordination. Ameri- can sailors, soldiers, and airmen have been learning, practicing, and waging war with these technologies for years now. While problems remain, including a new one in the form of cyber-war, it is fair to say that U.S. forces have as substantial a lead in using information-based capabilities as they do in the technologies embedded in them. The U.S. Navy has been as energetic as any service in exploit- ing the dual revolutions. Navies have longed relied on one or another form of networking, which permits specialization in such functions as blockade, sea-lane protection, surface warfare, land bombardment and, in modern times, anti-air warfare (AAW), ballistic-missile defense (BMD), and anti-submarine warfare (ASW). When navies could com- municate only at minimal distance and in minimal volume—signal flags, lights, short-range voice radio—coordination required proximity (thus Mahan’s principle of concentration). With digital technology and satellites, the range, volume, and speed of naval communications have increased exponentially, making possible a truly networked, and thus more effective and less vulnerable, force. In parallel, greater accuracy at lower cost improves the expected payoff of every weapon used, which multiplies the strike potential of every weapon platform.6 The current superiority of the U.S. Navy, in the Western Pacific and globally, is the result not only of its size—which is shrinking—but of the strike potential of each platform, the lethality of each weapon, the power of each sensor, and the integration of all these elements. If the Royal Navy of Mahan’s day was more than a match for the next two strongest navies combined, today’s networked U.S. Navy has more strike power than all other navies combined. The problem in the Western Pacific, once again, is not that China is replicating the U.S. Navy but that it is exploiting available technolo- gies to weaken U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific. Despite the U.S. Navy’s head start and current advantages, it is not complacent. But 6 This effect was especially striking in the case of aircraft carriers over the past decade or so, which have been able to multiply their effective strike potential without adding aircraft. 124 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific institutional change commonly lags technological change, especially when the institution holds a lead over its competitors. While it sees the problem, the Navy is torn between reinforcing the qualities of the existing fleet and developing a very different one. There is a tendency to cling to the familiar in the face of pressures to change. As Lawrence Cavaiola reminds us, Navy brass insisted on putting sails on the USS Monitor—just in case! The U.S. Navy is struggling to keep up with the global demands on it, as well as to retain the upper hand in exploiting information technology vis-à-vis the Chinese. With responsibilities in every region and the cost of ships rising, networking can help make up for limits on the size of the U.S. fleet.7 In the sea-trading archipelago that is East Asia, the U.S. Navy must secure the oceans, be ready for contingencies from Korea to Taiwan to the South China Sea, and be able to operate in the teeth of improved Chinese targeting. With each ship more capa- ble, all ships networked, and ship-based weapons with greater accuracy and range, American sea power will not be easy for China to dislodge from the region. At the same time, as previewed in the previous chapter, there is a growing vulnerability in the surface elements of American sea power in the Western Pacific, especially the large aircraft carrier. (Actually, there are two vulnerabilities, the other being the susceptibility of U.S. C4ISR systems to cyber-attack, which we will address later.) Notwith- standing the ability to link and spread forces, the carrier is the greatest concentration of conventional strike-power in naval history—the cul- mination of Mahanian theory. Even though the range of naval aviation is many times that of naval gunnery, the need to concentrate them in order to concentrate their destructive power persists. During World War II, Admiral “Bull” Halsey insisted, over the objections of Admiral Ernest King, that the carriers operate as a consolidated force against Japanese carriers.8 7 For a quantitative analysis of the potential to substitute information for mass, see Stuart Johnson and Arthur Cebrowski, Alternative Fleet Architecture Design, Defense and Technol- ogy Paper 319, Fort McNair, Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 2005. 8 Borneman, 2012, p. 210. Technological Change 125 If the networking revolution may make the aircraft carrier less essential, the targeting revolution may make it more vulnerable. Despite the superiority of the U.S. Navy, the core of its strike power in the Western Pacific is faced with an increasing risk of being disabled or even destroyed in a major war with China. Insofar as American sea power is equated with carrier power and is crucial for defending U.S. interests and extending U.S. influence, the ability of the United States to prevent Chinese aggression and forestall an East Asian sphere of influence could steadily deteriorate. Yet, because the networking and targeting revolutions are creating alternatives to the carrier, the threat to the carrier does not necessarily spell the erosion of American sea power in the Western Pacific. Whether and how these alternatives are pursued may be the most difficult, and uncomfortable, question facing American naval strategists and leaders. Chinese Priorities, Capabilities, and Potential Although the U.S. Navy and other U.S. armed services are well ahead of the PLA in exploiting information technology, this is not because of inherent U.S. advantages in science or engineering.9 Rather, it is because of the U.S. head start. Because of this technology’s rapid prog- ress and equally rapid diffusion through global markets, China can be expected to narrow the gap. Moreover, because these technologies are making it easier to deny and harder to control the seas, at least in the Western Pacific, China does not need to match the United States. Technological trends favor targeting over survivability, and thus China over the United States. Chinese theoretical writings on military exploitation of informa- tion technology, which for a while betrayed shallow understanding, are 9 In Right Makes Might: Freedom and Power in the Information Age (David C. Gompert, National Defense University Press, 1998), the author makes the case that a free-enterprise system is superior at creating and applying new technology to military purposes. While this tends to advantage democracies, notably the United States, China has managed—so far—to provide free-enterprise conditions without democracy. 126 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific now impressive in depth and sophistication.10 While copying largely accounts for this, copying is a proven path to success in the diffusion of this technology and does not suggest rote or superficiality. Chinese thinking in this realm is now taken very seriously by the U.S. military. For starters, Chinese planners appreciate that the military is a benefi- ciary of commercial information technology. China has an expanding market share and is increasingly competitive in segments that demand indigenous research and development. Following the East Asian economic-development model, the Chinese started with simple assem- bly, graduated to micro-components, then made sub-systems, and are now producing complex integrated systems, e.g., high-performance computing, communications, and space systems. For new military sys- tems, the Chinese are curtailing imports from Russia, which is fall- ing behind them in information technology, and instead making their own. Supported by global markets and ballooning revenues, China’s information industry is a rising sea that is lifting the PLA. As the Chi- nese progress in education in science and mathematics and invest their bountiful capital in high-tech, high-value industries, the U.S. commer- cial edge in information technology will decrease, and the PLA’s ability to utilize technology will rival that of the U.S. military. The Chinese are progressing in virtually all aspects of the net- working and targeting revolutions: • data processing • digital communications • full range of sensors (electromagnetic, optical and acoustic) • sensor fusion • weapon miniaturization, precision, and range • space systems for sensing, navigation, and communications • jamming and counter-jamming • C4ISR networks • computer-network attack and exploitation (cyber-war).11 10 Andrew S. Erickson and Michael S. Chase, “Information and the Chinese People’s Lib- eration Army Navy,” in Saunders et al., eds., 2011, pp. 247–286. 11 Erickson and Chase, 2011, p. 273. Technological Change 127 At the same time, the Chinese know that technologies will not lead to operational improvements, hence not real capabilities, unless matched by investments in the people who use them.12 Like their American counterparts, they are now emphasizing personnel quality, recruitment, retention, education, and training, not only in techni- cal skills but also in the abilities to use these technologies effectively. China’s 2010 Defense White Paper calls for personnel improvements in complex systems, strategic planning, management, standards, policies, maintenance, and joint operations; and it prescribes education best practices, e.g., specialized training commands and distance learning, developed in the West.13 With China’s increasing share in global infor- mation technology markets, the PLA has a vast pool of talent from which to draw, though recruitment is a problem (as it has been for the U.S. military). Where the Chinese are deficient, as in high-caliber non- commissioned officers, they know it and mean to redress it.14 Like the U.S. Navy, though well behind it, the PLA is developing a “networked fleet,” which it intends to integrate into a networked joint force (with PLA air and rocket forces).15 Their highest priority is to link naval and anti-naval capabilities, including land-based missiles and air power. The missions and reach of this force reflect the evolving Chinese military strategy described in the preceding chapter: from homeland defense to the littoral security to the ability to press Chinese territorial claims to breaking U.S. control of the Western Pacific. China’s secu- rity perimeter is thus being extended from its coast to the First Island Chain to the Second Island Chain, at least. Initially in this evolution, sensors were of tactical range, communications links were fiber-optical (utilizing inherently more secure land and littoral sea-bed cables), and separate services operated separately. However, as the Chinese extend the range of their targeting into the Pacific, they are stressing space- based sensors, navigation and communications, and jointness. 12 Erickson and Chase, 2011, pp. 259–263. 13 People’s Republic of China, China’s National Defense in 2010, white paper, 2010. 14 Erickson and Chase, 2011, p. 262. 15 Erickson and Chase, 2011, p. 262. 128 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Although the Chinese are applying information technology to solve a host of military-operational challenges, the most critical one is to erect a “kill chain” for the purpose of targeting U.S. forces increas- ingly far from China: • Space-based and other extended-range sensors scan larger and larger swaths of the Pacific for U.S. strike platforms, especially carriers. • Sensor data are fused, processed, analyzed, and disseminated. • Once found, targets are tracked. • Command and control systems assign weapons to targets. • Weapon guidance is enhanced, and costs reduced, by off-board space-based global positioning and navigation systems. • Weapon lethality is enhanced with terminal homing, including maneuvering warheads. While it remains to be seen how far into the Pacific the Chi- nese intend to extend this kill-chain, their immediate goal is to exceed the range of carrier-based strike aircraft, which would also bring for- ward U.S. air bases in the region into Chinese range. Already, Chi- nese medium-range ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise mis- siles can reach aircraft carriers (and land bases) within 2,000 km of China.16 The addition of new long-range theater strike systems—a new 4,000 km–range conventional ballistic missile,17 improved medium- range bombers with long-range cruise missiles,18 and a growing fleet of quiet attack submarines—will significantly increase the PLA’s lethal radius. 16 Andrew F. Krepinevich, Why AirSea Battle?

Technological Change 129 The PLA’s concentration of information technology for anti-naval missions is being complemented by four other priorities: • ballistic and cruise missile programs that the U.S. Department of Defense describes as “the most active . . . in the world” in num- bers and quality19 • a modern submarine fleet (see below) • cyber-war capabilities to degrade U.S. C4ISR networks • ASAT to destroy satellites on which U.S. C4ISR depend. Viewed together, the thrust of China’s military investment and war- fighting strategy is clearly to raise U.S. costs of intervening against China in the event that a regional dispute turns violent. While the original focus was on a Taiwan contingency, the Chinese have general- ized their objective. It is one thing for the PLA to erect a kill-chain and quite another to get it to work as intended. Otherwise, military commanders and political leaders may not have sufficient confidence to act in the face of high costs of failure. Technical and operating skills are essential ingre- dients, not easily or quickly acquired. PLA enthusiasm over cyber-war and ASAT can be explained in large part by the belief that degrading U.S. C4ISR could compensate for the uncertainties the Chinese face in targeting U.S. strike forces. Even then, the Chinese would have to be confident that two-way cyber and ASAT warfare would be more deleterious to U.S. operations than to their own, given that the United States presumably would respond in kind. In sum, the Chinese are riding the targeting revolution to disable U.S. strike platforms, U.S. C4ISR that enables these platforms, and U.S. satellites that enable C4ISR. These three U.S. capabilities are at once crucial to U.S. operations and difficult to defend. As Chinese naval and other forces operate throughout the region, the need to distrib- ute and integrate them through networking will also grow. A general pattern in the military-information revolution is that investment and reform, being costly and disruptive, tend to focus on strong operational 19 U.S. Department of Defense, 2010. 130 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific demands. For the United States, at present, the priority is to make its forces less vulnerable. For China, it is to make U.S. forces more vulnerable. Whether in networking or targeting, the Chinese and Ameri- cans are both searching for the right approach to command and con- trol: centralized or decentralized. Traditionally, the PLA has stressed centralized-vertical control even more than the U.S. military has. The instantaneous sharing, aggregation, and display of information (“common operating picture” in U.S. defense jargon) can give com- manders at the center a more complete, accurate, and timely view than they have ever had of what is happening at the fighting edge. This can invite excessive meddling and contradict the potency of horizontal col- laboration that networking offers. An alternative school argues that networking permits and targeting requires decentralized command and control: sensor-to-shooter integration, initiative at the edge, and the ability to respond to fluid and complex conditions based on latitude to operate within broad guidance. If the Chinese have not resolved the contest between the promise of decentralization and the urge of cen- tralization, they at least understand it.20 Junior officers tend to better appreciate the pitfalls of centralization than do seniors who are habitu- ated and motivated to take control during hostilities. So the Chinese are likely to gravitate toward decentralization, which will enable them to effectively use new technology to target U.S. forces. While hard to network because of limits on communications, submarines can also exploit China’s improvements in targeting U.S. surface-strike forces at increasing distances from China. The PLAN is replacing an oversized fleet of old, loud, vulnerable coastal-defense submarines with one that, though smaller, is more survivable and capable of operating far from China. Although China can be expected to put more of its strategic-nuclear deterrent force on submarines and also improve anti-submarine submarines, its main mission is anti- carrier warfare. China will deploy nuclear attack submarines as well as advanced, quiet, and relatively cheap diesel submarines. A leading U.S. analyst of both China and sea power describes China’s submarines 20 Erickson and Chase, 2011. Technological Change 131 as “the most troublesome problem today” for the U.S. surface fleet in the Western Pacific.21 Given why the Chinese are developing them, it is expected that these submarines will bristle with anti-surface mis- siles. Their targets and those of China’s anti-ship missiles are the same, which compounds the U.S. vulnerability challenge. This force comple- ments China’s commitment to long-range surveillance, sensor fusing, improved tracking, precision navigation and guidance, and integrated C4ISR.22 In parallel with deploying submarines and anti-ship missiles, China is building a modern surface fleet. But it is not clear that this will be the workhorse of Chinese sea power in the Western Pacific. Even with a large modern surface fleet, China cannot hope to achieve true sea control in the region, given its vulnerability to multiple U.S. strike capabilities. Nor does China require such a fleet for sea denial— submarines and land-based missiles being more effective, and obvi- ously less vulnerable, for that purpose. Moreover, it would take China decades of investment and experience, as well as creation of an interna- tional ring of bases, for the Chinese Navy to rival the U.S. Navy in the blue waters of the Pacific, let alone globally. One must assume that the Chinese will figure out, based on their own progress in targeting over distance, that in the time it would take to build a traditional surface fleet, the survivability of traditional surface fleets will be in doubt. Rather than trying to replace U.S. sea power with Chinese sea power in the Western Pacific, the Chinese appear to have other pur- poses in building a surface navy. The first is to complement A2AD capabilities, such as with vessels carrying anti-surface missiles; though vulnerable and thus easier to defeat than submarines and land-based missiles, such vessels add complexity to the threat faced by U.S. naval forces. The second purpose is to enforce Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea and East China Sea. Provided the United States does not intervene with its naval forces, the Chinese can realistically hope to match Japanese naval power and exceed that of its Southeast Asian neighbors. The third purpose is to join in providing security— 21 McDevitt, 2011. 22 O’Rourke, 2011, pp. 141–149. 132 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific from pirates, for instance—for its more distant sea-lifelines and choke- points, such as across the Indian Ocean and in the Strait of Malacca. It can do this unilaterally, multilaterally, or in a tacit division of labor with others (e.g., India and the United States). Fourth, the Chinese understand the value of showing the flag—routinely in peacetime, in response to natural disasters, and in crises—as a way of raising their profile and extending their influence throughout and beyond East Asia. China’s progress in buying or building and deploying aircraft car- riers has received much attention in the region and the world. It would take China several decades to build a force of several modern carrier battle groups.23 Moreover, Chinese aircraft carriers are a poor option for attacking U.S. aircraft carriers, given their limited strike range and their vulnerability. The United States should be thankful if the Chinese were to shift resources from anti-naval capabilities to carriers, which is ironic, given the U.S. attachment to carriers. The Chinese aim to have at most three carriers.24 Their purposes appear to be like those of the surface fleet as a whole: to influence maritime disputes involving Chi- nese interests, to contribute to maritime security, and to impress other countries. Because so few countries have them, carriers have a certain great-power aura, though this may fade as their vulnerability becomes acute and apparent. On the whole, the Chinese have not shown the same commit- ment to aircraft carriers and other surface naval capabilities as they have to targeting the U.S. fleet. They have several new classes of ships for anti-air and anti-surface missions, but so far they have built only a few ships per class.25 In addition, China’s navy will have a large force of smaller and advanced fast-attack craft armed with missiles; in large numbers, these could present a more serious sea-denial threat than tra- ditional surface combatants.26 The improvement of amphibious ships has been a high priority: While the obvious mission is in a Taiwan 23 O’Rourke, 2011, pp. 141–149. 24 O’Rourke, 2011, p. 150. 25 O’Rourke, 2011, p. 154. 26 O’Rourke, 2011, p. 157. Technological Change 133 conflict, Chinese writings suggest that landings on other islands may be a desirable option to have. It could take China decades to build a navy resembling the U.S. Navy—an undertaking the Chinese might well decide is not worth the coin. But China’s ambivalence about a traditional high-seas fleet should not gratify the United States, for such a fleet would not be the main challenge to American sea power in the Western Pacific. What matters much more is how well and how soon Chinese forces can carry out the missions assigned to them: anti-access, sea-denial, and bullying China’s maritime neighbors. For these purposes, China is progressing rapidly, using targeting technology in which the current sizable U.S. lead will be hard to maintain. Even with Chinese deployment of new types of missile systems, submarines, and surface vessels, it is their development of an increas- ingly robust C4ISR network—the central nervous system of A2AD— that represents a qualitatively new and serious challenge to American sea power in the Western Pacific. China is following the U.S. lead in developing and using advanced C4ISR to improve its forces’ opera- tional effectiveness. China’s 2010 Defense White Paper includes a sophisticated assessment of the PLA’s progress in exploiting informa- tion technology: Significant progress has been made in building information sys- tems for [C4ISR]. Information systems have [also] been widely applied in logistics and equipment support. A preliminary level has been achieved in interoperability among command and con- trol systems, combat forces, and support systems, making trans- mission of orders, intelligence distribution, command, and guid- ance more efficient and rapid. (emphasis added) Taking everything into account, the United States should not assume that it has insurmountable advantages in applying informa- tion technology to improve the effectiveness and vulnerability of naval or other forces and operations. Technology gaps exist, but they are shrinking as China becomes competitive in today’s open and dynamic global IT markets. Gaps in personnel quality, education, and train- ing exist, but the Chinese are making this a high priority. The U.S. 134 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific military has a head start in overcoming old-fashioned command and control doctrines and in creating joint C4ISR systems, but the Chi- nese know what needs to be done. U.S. military “transformation” to networked operations began a decade before China launched its mili- tary “informationization” (basically the same thing). But U.S. atten- tion and resources were then diverted to counterterrorism, counterin- surgency, and lengthy military occupations for much of that time. All the while, China’s focus has been fixed on neutralizing U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. Moreover, the United States is currently depen- dent on the concentration of strike power in a few large aircraft carri- ers, whereas China is stressing capabilities that exploit the networking and targeting revolutions. Implications of Current Trends U.S. attempts to defend carriers, regional bases, and other strike plat- forms against Chinese ballistic missiles face a daunting numbers prob- lem: For the same amount of resources, China can add more deliver- able missiles to its arsenal than the United States can expand its ability to intercept them.27 In addition, China’s cyber-war and ASAT capabili- ties are, according to PLA writings, intended to disrupt U.S. C4ISR and thus deter, delay, degrade, or defeat U.S. intervention in the West- ern Pacific.28 If current trends continue, U.S. naval and other forces will be at risk from Northeast to Southeast Asia—e.g., in a confrontation with China over North Korea’s collapse or a crisis in the South China Sea. Such deterioration of the survivability of the U.S. surface fleet has implications at several levels. The PLA is more able to degrade, delay, defeat, or deter U.S. intervention and to prevent U.S. strikes on China. 27 The advantage of missile delivery over missile intercept is the function of several factors among them: the higher cost of interceptors, when taking targeting systems into account; the feasibility of penetration aids (e.g., decoys); the introduction of multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs); and the cost of expanding sea-based or land-based interceptor launch installations. 28 See Gompert and Saunders, 2011. Technological Change 135 With U.S. intervention less likely to succeed or even to occur, China improves its odds of prevailing in conflicts with local states over terri- tory or resources, and thus is in a stronger position to prevail through coercion. If the United States responds by pulling forces out of the PLA’s growing range, those forces would be more survivable but less able to intervene or to influence events in the region. The option of keeping surface forces forward in peacetime and steaming them out of harm’s way in the event of a heightened Chinese threat would obvi- ously undermine U.S. leverage in a crisis. Whether U.S. naval forces in the Western Pacific are withdrawn beyond China’s anti-naval radius or instead remain and become more vulnerable, China’s neighbors, including long-standing U.S. allies, will be more exposed, less confident, and perhaps more likely to yield Chi- nese pressure to the disadvantage of U.S. interests. Such developments could in time amount to Chinese sea denial and hegemonic sphere of influence, as defined earlier, in the Western Pacific. Alternatively, it could lead to a breakdown of the order and peace that this vital region has enjoyed for half a century. These are the very outcomes that U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific is meant to prevent. Even if the Chinese do not harbor hegemonic ambitions, their interests, as explained above, will almost certainly lead them to con- tinue efforts that could have these effects. At a minimum, China’s ter- ritorial defense—an imperative on which there is not disagreement in China—compels it to push U.S. carriers beyond the strike range of China. It is unrealistic to think that China will tolerate the near- ness of forces that are able and, in the event of war, meant, to attack China, now that China can challenge that presence. Beyond home- land defense, the Chinese wish to have the upper hand in resolution of regional disputes involving Chinese territorial claims (Taiwan and the South China Sea) or national security (Korea), and to dislodge the United States as the preeminent security provider in the region. The United States can only assume that the challenge to its sea power in the Western Pacific will grow as China gets stronger. The problem of gaining and keeping access to a distant region is inherently harder than that of denying such access by a highly capable state of the region. Investments in long-range sensors, missiles, and sub- 136 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific marines and in the people to operate them will yield increasing returns for China, whereas remaining invested in traditional strike forces will yield diminishing returns for U.S. interests. Pressure is mounting on the United States to switch to another investment strategy. U.S. Responses American strategists may believe that some native technological supe- riority will enable the United States to prevail in its sea-power contest with China in the Western Pacific. This is a delusion, given China’s increasing competitiveness and the efficiency with which these tech- nologies spread throughout their global market. Rather, a new U.S. advantage will have to come from being smarter in using information technology—smarter than it has been, and smarter than the PLA. Both geographic and technological asymmetries tend to favor China over the United States. The United States needs to be able to project power to a region 10,000 miles away, whereas China needs to be able to thwart U.S. power projection to its own region. In addi- tion, the reach and quality of Chinese targeting can improve by degree, whereas the United States must shift in kind because of the vulnerabil- ity of its existing strike platforms. The sorts of capabilities the Chinese need to target U.S. sea power and impede U.S. power projection exist and are improving linearly, and rapidly. In contrast, the surface vessels on which the United States currently relies predate the information revolution. While their effectiveness is being enhanced with informa- tion technology, their vulnerability is a consequence of being slow, few, visible, and of restricted strike range—physical traits that technology cannot remove. Thus, if both China and the United States proceed with incremental advances at current levels of investment, China’s tar- geting will outpace U.S. efforts to maintain survivable strike power. This is not to say that the U.S. Navy is not seized with the prob- lem. In league with the U.S. Air Force, its Air-Sea Battle strategy, mentioned earlier, is a serious effort to counter the A2AD problem— Technological Change 137 globally, but with China and the Western Pacific foremost in mind.29 As an integrated approach, Air-Sea Battle is analogous to the Air-Land Battle approach organized by the Army and Air Force in the 1980s to counter the Soviet armored threat to NATO. The United States and its European allies had concluded that neither static forward defense nor nuclear escalation was an acceptable solution to that threat. As an alter- native, Air-Land Battle called for better communications and closer collaboration between the Army and Air Force, not only in operations but also in modernization. But there was more to it than that—namely, deep attack. Air-Land Battle exploited U.S. advances in surveillance and advantages in precision weapons, cruise missiles, and stealth to strike beyond the Soviet front line of assault. Instead of beefing up static forward defense or resorting to nuclear weapons, NATO could attack deeper echelons of Soviet combat forces and support, thus weak- ening the entire assault. Against new forms of U.S. air power, the Sovi- ets had no good defense and thus no real answer. Air-Sea Battle is fundamentally like Air-Land Battle in that it responds to the declining viability of forward defense in combina- tion with growing aversion to strategic escalation. But it is far more advanced because it exploits the network and targeting revolutions. Thanks to digital communications, the possibility for integrated opera- tions is much greater now, as is the ability to strike with greater preci- sion at greater range. But there is more to Air-Sea Battle than integra- tion: Like its ancestor, it is essentially designed for deep attack against enemy forces and support systems. Moreover, such attacks can be car- ried out by both kinetic and cyber weapons on everything from physi- cal forces and sensors to the computer networks that enable them. Operationally, Air-Sea Battle will present the Chinese with seri- ous problems. However, the question lingers: Does it solve the vulnera- bility problem, and thus the deterioration of American sea power in the Western Pacific? The answer is unclear. Insofar as it depends on few, forward, slow, or stationary concentrations of strike power—carriers 29 Norton A. Schwartz (Gen., USAF) and Jonathan W. Greenert (Adm., USN), “AirSea Battle: Promoting Stability in an Era of Uncertainty,” The American Interest, February 20, 2012. 138 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific and bases in the region—Air-Sea Battle is a modest improvement in the face of a challenge that requires an immodest one. In the fuller technological and geo-strategic context, Air-Sea Battle may be neces- sary, but it is not sufficient. The other strategic issue raised by Air-Sea Battle is whether it makes the United States more dependent on military preemption or escalation than it ought to be. The time to strike Chinese target and strike capabilities is before they are used to disable U.S. forces. This creates a strong urge for the United States to attack earlier than it would otherwise choose. Moreover, Air-Sea Battle is potentially desta- bilizing in that the Chinese would have an incentive to attack before their capabilities to do so are reduced by U.S. preemption. In addi- tion, because many elements of the Chinese kill-chain are located in China, attacking them would be escalatory. To be clear, the United States should not rule out attacking Chinese mainland capabilities that can be used against it, and the threat to do so can strengthen deter- rence. But having escalatory options is very different, strategically and politically, than becoming dependent on them—or on preemption— for lack of alternatives. Even with Navy–Air Force integration and options to strike early and deep against Chinese A2AD capabilities, the United States must rely increasingly on more distant and/or less observable platforms as the survivability of its forward forces declines. How radically this shift occurs is one of the most important questions facing the U.S. military, especially the U.S. Navy.30 Unless the vulnerability problem is solved, pressures will mount to place more emphasis in U.S. military strategy toward China on deterrence based on the threat of escalation. Yet, as noted earlier, the United States will not want to rely on the threat to resort to nuclear weapons at a time when it is trying to de-emphasize the role of these weapons in warfare. Moreover, China will certainly have a second-strike nuclear deterrent force capable of riding out a U.S. first strike and overwhelming U.S. missile defense. U.S. options 30 The Air Force already has long-range, including global, strike options and is pursuing others. Technological Change 139 to escalate to strategic cyber-attacks or use of ASAT will also become more risky and less credible as China develops such capabilities.31 Some forward basing and operations in the Western Pacific, though vulnerable, will remain necessary in order to support the capa- bilities of local allies, raise the bar against the use of force, and increase the credibility of security guarantees. Moreover, the traditional role of forward presence in reassuring friends, demonstrating commitment, and influencing peacetime developments will not vanish. But with both forward defense and escalation getting riskier, the United States will need to use technology more inventively. A New Posture in the Pacific: Toward Phantom Sea Power There are four ways to counter advanced targeting: • Defend the target. • Disable the capabilities that can strike the target. • Hide the target. • Complicate the target. The first of these is a natural military reflex and heretofore the default option. However, given foreseeable technology, it may be the least fruitful. Both submarine warfare and missile warfare, two of China’s highest priorities, are offense-dominant in that returns on additional investment in offensive capabilities exceed returns on equivalent invest- ment in defenses against those capabilities. In both realms, defense is technologically difficult, operationally undependable, and economi- cally dear. For all the investment in ballistic missile defense (BMD) in the last quarter-century, it is still—and likely to remain—inadequate or prohibitively expensive against large and sophisticated attacks by large and sophisticated states.32 Current (“hit-to-kill”) BMD may work and be worth the cost against the likes of Iran and North Korea, but 31 See Gompert and Saunders, 2011. 32 See Gompert and Saunders, 2011. 140 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific not China, which can multiply and improve the penetrability of its missiles more readily than the United States can increase its missile- intercept capacity. Perhaps directed-energy or other exotic technolo- gies will be able to achieve meaningful levels of success against large attacks/attackers, but do not count on it. Despite having been vigorously pursued much longer than BMD has, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) remains frustrating: Submarines are simply very hard to find. Deep waters with distinct thermal layers are sanctuaries to quiet, hiding vessels. Because acoustic listening (pas- sive sonar) can usually be defeated by silencing submarine machinery, non-acoustic technology received a lot of attention during the Cold War and since; but the results have disappointed. Moreover, sinking or disabling hard-to-locate submarines with conventional (non-nuclear) weapons is problematic. The lesson China has taken from the discour- aging history of ASW is that it makes sense to invest in a new sub- marine force, even against the world’s best (U.S.) ASW. Presumably, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Strategic Command believe that submarines are not about to become detectable and vulnerable, or they would not place the increasing reliance they do on that leg of the strategic nuclear triad. As noted, given the difficulty and cost of defending U.S. strike platforms in the Western Pacific, American military strategists are turning to the idea of counter-targeting Chinese sensors, land- and sea-based missile-launchers, command and control centers, weapon stocks, air bases, and submarine bases. The technological possibilities and strategic risks associated with Air-Sea Battle have already been cov- ered and need not be repeated. What deserves more discussion is the option of attacking the Chinese kill-chain with cyber weapons. While the United States and its armed forces have yet to develop a doctrine for cyber-war, including whether or not to initiate it, they are trend- ing toward making it an element of their war-fighting capabilities and plans. The Chinese have identified C4ISR networks as PACOM’s Achilles’ Heel and fair game for cyber-attack; so it is not as if the United States would be triggering cyber-war that would not occur if it abstained from attacking Chinese C4ISR. As the Chinese have identi- Technological Change 141 fied U.S. C4ISR as the greatest vulnerability of U.S. capabilities and plans, so will China’s C4ISR vulnerability grow as it extends the reach of its sensors, weapons, and communications far beyond China’s coast. Conversely, if the Chinese do not increase the geographic reach of their C4ISR capability, they cede the vastness of the Pacific to U.S. strike forces. The Chinese have to balance the increased risks associated with extended anti-naval capability against the increased risks of not extend- ing that capability. So far, it appears that the Chinese are determined to extend their reach, which in turn presents the United States with an opportunity to counter it. Cyber-war is generally regarded as an off-shoot of the military information revolution. However, because its targets are enemy target- ing and networking, cyber-war is better thought of as a military infor- mation counter-revolution. If a force becomes operationally and techni- cally dependent on advanced networking and targeting, cyber-war has the potential to place it at a severe disadvantage. The U.S. and Chi- nese militaries are both increasingly dependent yet are also two of the world’s most capable cyber-war states. Both forces have much to lose as well as to gain from cyber-war, given that it is also offense-dominant. Obviously, the side that is better at cyber-war and also at operating despite degradation from cyber-war would have the advantage. But it is not easy to figure which side that would be. One could imagine the United States being superior to China at cyber-war yet inherently more vulnerable to degradation in the event of cyber-war, given the geographic distance it must cover and its reliance on advanced C4ISR. As a way of enhancing survivability of U.S. forces in the West- ern Pacific, offensive cyber-war against the central nervous system of China’s anti-access capability would, in effect, be defensive. Firewalls, patching, and other network-security measures can provide essential, if imperfect, protection against lesser state and non-state cyber threats. But against projected offensive cyber-war capabilities and complex attacks on the United States—and on China—defense will prove inad- equate.33 Because much IT infrastructure is dual-use, civil-military cyber-attacks against enemy C4ISR systems run a serious danger of 33 See Gompert and Saunders, 2011. 142 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific escalation to general cyber-war, including against dual-purpose net- works, critical cyber infrastructure, commercial, and civilian systems. Given their network vulnerabilities, the difficulty of defense, and the other side’s offensive strength, both the United States and China will have strong aversions to such escalation. This presents a major dilemma—the likelihood of cyber-war against C4ISR in the event of Sino-U.S. conflict versus the severe consequences of general cyber- war—that can only be resolved by the exercise of tight political control by both states to avert escalation.34 In the final analysis, the United States will be torn between con- ducting cyber-war to help protect its military forces in the Western Pacific and avoiding cyber-war because of the growing reliance of those same forces on networking. Moreover, given the possibility and conse- quences of cyber-war escalating and spreading once begun—crashing networks of national importance along the way—the United States will have a strong interest in mutual restraint. Yet it is quite possible that the Chinese would not show restraint even if the United States did, which argues for the United States at least being prepared tech- nically and doctrinally to wage cyber-war in the event of armed con- flict.35 U.S. military and civilian planners have not yet sorted out what role cyber-war could play in a major armed conflict. Meanwhile, the U.S. military cannot be expected to refrain from acquiring capabilities and making plans to degrade Chinese forces that are meant to attack U.S. forces. As the latest U.S. national defense strategy and Air-Sea Battle both suggest, cyber-war is increasingly viewed as an integral part of U.S. assumptions and plans.36 Similar dynamics and dilemmas are at work in regard to military use of space and ASAT. U.S. C4ISR relies vitally on communications, surveillance, and positioning satellites for operations in the expansive 34 See Gompert and Saunders, 2011. 35 Gompert and Saunders (2011) report on Chinese military writings that stress the advan- tages of initiating cyber-war as a way of blinding U.S. C4ISR—i.e., not for deterring U.S. cyber attacks. Some of this writing indicates advantages for China to initiate early and even preemptively. 36 See Schwartz and Greenert, 2012. Technological Change 143 Western Pacific. Chinese reliance on satellites for the same purposes will grow as its C4ISR reaches outward. Both are likely to have both hard- and soft-kill ASAT. But in space, more than in cyber-space, there is a possibility of mutual deterrence and restraint. At present, the United States has essentially recognized that it has more to lose than to gain in ASAT war.37 U.S. misgivings about crossing the ASAT and cyber-war thresh- olds in a conflict with China should be tempered by the likelihood that the Chinese themselves would not hesitate to cross these thresholds early in, or even as a precursor to, hostilities. Still, the vital reliance of U.S. forces, not to mention the nation as a whole, on the use of space and cyber-space suggests that the United States, as a matter of strategy and policy, would not want to become dependent on these new forms of warfare to prevail in a conflict with China and to preserve American power in the Western Pacific. The option of hiding U.S. platforms from Chinese targeting may be more feasible and affordable than defending them and more prudent than relying on preemptive or escalatory strikes (à la Air-Sea Battle, cyber-war, and ASAT). Platforms can be hidden simply by keeping them beyond the reach of enemy sensors. Yet, their own weapons must still be able to reach their targets. This excludes the solution of keeping large U.S. aircraft carriers beyond Chinese targeting distance, which will exceed that of the strike range of carrier-based manned aircraft. While there is probably a role for U.S. surface-based long-range mis- siles in response to Chinese A2AD capabilities, it is a matter of time and money—the Chinese have both—before China is able to deploy constellations of space-based sensors that can scan beyond the Western Pacific. If the U.S. Navy aspires to achieve what it has coined “global maritime awareness” (relying on contributions from other U.S. military and intelligence satellites), China has the wherewithal to deploy such capabilities within the time-frame of this analysis. China is a growing space power, with plans to launch 10 satellites on average per year, com- 37 U.S. space policy refers to access to space as “vital” and implies that ASAT is mainly for deterrence. See for example Gregory Schulte, DoD, testimony to Congress, May 2010. 144 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific pared with 17 for the United States.38 As for missiles, the Chinese are already able to achieve long range (albeit for nuclear, not conventional missions), the accuracy of which can be enhanced by space-based geo- positioning technology. A corollary of U.S. faith in ballistic missile submarines is that sub- marines make very survivable conventional-strike platforms because Chinese ASW, even as it improves, has little chance of finding them. The U.S. Navy is already increasing the role of submarines for preci- sion strike with conventional ballistic and cruise missiles. How many and what kind of submarines should be made available for this pur- pose remain important open questions. The way the United States designs and builds submarines—especially nuclear-powered ones—is very expensive. The U.S. commitment to nuclear submarines reflects the need for distant and lengthy patrolling. Yet, large numbers of much cheaper and quiet non-nuclear submarines—even with shorter “legs”—must be a serious U.S. conventional-strike option for the U.S. Navy as China improves and extends its anti-surface capabilities. Hand in hand with hiding U.S. targets is befuddling Chinese tar- geting systems and the people who use them by presenting increased complexity. For the U.S. Navy, more numerous, diverse, small, fast, and stealthy strike platforms (and decoys) would be a major challenge for a Chinese targeting system that is designed against a few, big, slow, 38 One expert described the military impact of Chinese space capabilities in these terms: Increasingly sophisticated space-based systems expand PLA battle-space awareness and support extended range conventional precision strike systems. Space assets enable the monitoring of naval activities in surrounding waters and the tracking of air force deploy- ments into the region. The PLA is investing in a diverse set of increasingly sophisticated electro-optical (EO), synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and electronic reconnaissance assets. Space-based remote sensing systems also provide the imagery necessary for mis- sion planning functions, including automated target recognition technology that cor- relates preloaded optical, radar, or infrared images on a missile system’s computer with real time images acquired in flight. A constellation of small electronic reconnaissance satellites, operating in tandem with SAR satellites, could provide commanders with pre- cise and timely geo-location data on mobile targets. Satellite communications also offer a survivable means of linking sensors to strike systems, and will become particularly relevant as PLA interests expand further from PRC borders. (Mark A. Stokes, Prepared Statement for U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission hearing on the Implications of China’s Military and Civil Space Programs, May 11, 2011) Technological Change 145 and unmistakable high-value ones. Drones—surface and sub-surface vessels and ship-launched aircraft—are less costly and more expend- able, obviously, than manned systems. In larger numbers, and in com- bination with diverse strike platforms, they can complicate Chinese targeting and C4ISR, not to mention air defense. Because a diverse alternative force could be widely distributed, instead of concentrated like large carriers, the surveillance and tracking problem alone would be much more difficult. Aircraft carriers could have a place in a posture aimed at com- plicating Chinese targeting—but not necessarily huge ones carry- ing manned aircraft and affordable in very small numbers. With the performance of drones climbing, their cost dropping, and eventually their size shrinking, aircraft carriers can be smaller, cheaper, diverse, and numerous. To invoke a tenet of sea power, numbers matter—even against large missile forces. To illustrate simply, imagine two alternative naval strike forces of equal strike power: one made up of a few large strike platforms (e.g., today’s aircraft carriers) and the other of many small ones (e.g., tomorrow’s drone carriers). Then say it is no harder for enemy sensors to target a given large strike platform than a given small one and, further, that it takes twice as many enemy missiles to destroy a large platform as it does a small one. If the number of strike plat- forms in the large-platform force is less than half the number of strike platforms in the small-platform force, more strike power will survive a missile attack of a given size on the latter than the former.39 The advantages of proliferating naval strike platforms can be found in an analysis by researchers at the U.S. National Defense Uni- versity in 2005.40 That work evaluated quantitatively the expected operational performance against a large adversary of four options: the U.S. Navy’s programmed strike force and three alternative strike forces of equal cost with larger numbers of smaller platforms. All three 39 While this illustration is merely arithmetic, its assumptions are, if anything, conserva- tive given current technological possibilities. For example, small, diverse, scattered strike platforms—not to mention submerged ones—could each be harder to find and hit than large conspicuous ones. 40 Johnson and Cebrowski, 2005. 146 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific alternatives relied heavily on vertical and short take-off-and-landing (VSTOL) aircraft; and one was especially ambitious in making use of drones. All three relied more on submarines and on unmanned plat- forms of all sorts. The total number of strike platforms ranged from about 200 in the programmed fleet to about 800 in the most radical alternative. The analysis of expected results showed that all three alter- natives were capable of 25–50 percent greater strike effectiveness than the programmed fleet, when taking into account losses from enemy attacks. The most effective force was the one that differs most from the current fleet. True, this alternative was a revolutionary departure from the traditional naval force. But that’s the whole point: The networking and targeting branches of the information revolution are already well underway.41 A revolution in structures and platforms should follow. At the same time, the requisite technologies for the alternative fleet archi- tectures already exist. The National Defense University study recommends four design principles for future naval forces: • complexity—large numbers of diverse, fast, agile, low-signature, ambiguous, diverse platforms • smaller ships—taking advantage of improvements in strike- payload thanks to better weapons accuracy • networking—across large areas for the enemy to search, track, and target • modularity—permitting diverse platforms based on a few simple hull types. In addition to significant operational advantages, the alternative fleet architectures, being of equal cost, would largely solve the problem of the Navy having too few ships to cover too much ocean and too many missions. (Why the U.S. Navy has not embraced these and other inno- vative ideas will be taken up shortly.) Overall, without discarding concepts to degrade Chinese A2AD capabilities, the most feasible, affordable, and prudent U.S. ways to counter China’s targeting advances are to hide, fractionate, diversify, 41 Johnson and Cebrowski, 2005. Technological Change 147 and otherwise complicate the target set—U.S. strike platforms. These approaches, taken together, would present the Chinese with a vexatious and qualitatively different problem than the one they are now working so hard to solve. They would present the Chinese with the opposite of the concentration of offensive forces that was the heart of Mahanian sea power. Chinese sensors would reveal not a few large and unmistak- able “blips” but rather hazy, cluttered, ambiguous, and unstable screens (if not darkened ones). By more fully exploiting networking technology than it does now, the United States could distribute forces while still being able to concentrate force. This, after all, was what Mahan was driving at—the ability to gain dominance in war, and preponderance in peace, by superior concentration of force—only the technology of the time suggested no way other than to concentrate the surface battle fleet. After his initial shock, Mahan would approve. After all, he was the one to explain that sea power was power of the sea; he just assumed that this required power on the sea. We might call this combination confounding enemy targeting “phantom sea power”: far less vulnerable yet no less capable of coor- dinated and concentrated strikes; a new way to exercise sea denial and to mitigate enemy sea denial; using the networking revolution to trump—at least for now—the targeting revolution. A more survivable U.S. strike posture along these lines would be neither escalatory nor destabilizing; rather, it would discourage Chinese preemptive attack, obviate the need for U.S. preemptive attack, and allow time for a crisis to be defused. The practical elements of phantom sea power would include: • submarines • sea-based missiles of various ranges • drone vessels and aircraft, in large numbers • larger numbers of small vessels with drones and missiles • state-of-the-art and continuously improving C4ISR networks • cyber-war 42 • ASAT.43 42 While recognizing the strategic risks of actual use. 43 Again, while recognizing the strategic risks of actual use. 148 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific This is not to say that legacy platforms, including large air- craft carriers, have no future in the Western Pacific. The traditional blue-water fleet will remain potent, relevant, and survivable in most regions, and thus will be available for East Asia. Carriers and other surface combatants may have important roles to play in conditions short of high-intensity Sino-U.S. warfare, which is among the least likely contingencies. Moreover, as we will see, surface combatants will remain important in expressing U.S. commitment and advancing U.S. interests—roles for which more ethereal war-fighting capabilities, as prescribed here, are not suitable. At issue is the balance between con- centrated, conspicuous sea power and spread-out, ghost-like sea power. The analysis here suggests that the balance should tilt increasingly and as soon as practical toward the latter. Even if a survivable posture such as the one described here can restore and maintain U.S. operational advantages and sea power in the Western Pacific, important questions remain: • Can this survivable posture be sustained against further Chinese research, development, and investment in advanced capabilities? • How vulnerable will it be to cyber-war? • Will the U.S. Navy take this direction? Again, the Chinese have chosen to concentrate on denying U.S. sea control in the Western Pacific instead of achieving sea control for themselves. Will the Chinese approach succeed if the United States shifts toward phantom sea power? On the surface (no pun intended), it would be much harder for the Chinese to neutralize a force of U.S. submarines, drones, and numerous, distant, and diverse strike plat- forms because they will not be able to find and target enough of them. Eventually, breakthroughs in sensor technology may make any plat- form, anywhere, observable and vulnerable. Until then, the fragmenta- tion, distribution, diversification, and hiding of strike forces will cause diminishing returns on investment in targeting. As great a risk to distributed U.S. sea power as Chinese target- ing is Chinese cyber-warfare. In theory, cyber-warfare has the poten- tial to disrupt all kinds of military operations that exploit information Technological Change 149 technology. How great the potential and what can be done about it over the long term is unclear. It may be that progress in defending computer networks from low-end threats (e.g., hackers) will extend to high-end ones (e.g., China). In the meantime, the United States will have to grapple with the dilemma of how dependent to become on networking—but so too will China. Implementation: Need Versus Inertia The U.S. Navy is not poised to embark on a radical shift away from con- centrated surface power. Large carriers have the backing of naval and joint commanders, diplomats, politicians, and ship-builders. Moreover, but for their vulnerability to Chinese targeting, they remain critical to U.S. global military and political power. If the number of U.S. car- riers declines, it will be gradually, carefully, and by attrition through retirement from old age. Within the likely constraints of U.S. defense spending, the retention of aircraft carriers—at about $10 billion per vessel—will limit the building of distributed sea power to investments at the margin. Hence, it will take the United States decades to effect wholesale change in the character and composition of its fleet. In addition to huge industrial and structural impediments, navies—especially those of established sea powers—resist rapid change. For instance, the Royal Navy was very slow to change from sail to steam and wood to steel until compelled to do so by emergent German sea power. An even more arresting example is the case of the battleship following World War I. The advent of submarines and war- planes and the marginal role played by the dreadnought in the war, despite expectations that it would be critical, raised questions—outside the U.S. Navy’s mainstream—about both the survivability and impor- tance of battleships. In 1920, Brigadier General Billy Mitchell of the Army Air Service challenged the Navy to see whether its battleships could withstand bombing. The Navy insisted on “the improbability of a modern battleship being either destroyed or completely put out 150 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific of action by aerial bombs.”44 It further asserted that “no development would justify any conclusion that battleships were practically rendered useless by aircraft.”45 Mitchell’s bombers proceeded to sink the Navy’s captured German battleship Ostfriesland with six bombs in 20 min- utes.46 From then on, the vulnerability of the battle ship was indisput- able, its demise was inevitable, and the supremacy of the aircraft carrier was assured. While it took the Navy another 20 years to accept the battleship’s obsolescence, it finally stopped building them in 1944, a year in which it built six aircraft carriers. Now imagine a new rendition of old Navy assurances of the invincibility of the battleship, substituting aircraft carrier for battleship and long-range anti-ship ballistic missile for aerial bomb. It is hard to think of a persuasive reason why aircraft carriers can defy technological progress when battleships could not. Yet the Navy’s defense of aircraft carriers echoes its defense of battleships when they had become vulner- able. Moreover, because the aircraft carrier will continue for years to play an essential role in U.S. strategy and operations globally, it is not easy to shift toward a different posture for one region, however impor- tant, because of a particular problem there, however acute. Global sea powers tend to have global navies. The U.S. Navy, like all big navies, needs a long time to change, given how long it takes to design and build new ships and the aversion to mothballing serviceable and hugely expensive existing platforms. But this is all the more reason to start changing now. The danger is that sur- face fleets will obsolesce gradually, as the targeting revolution spreads, with nothing fundamental being done about it. Whether because of institutional caution or long lifetimes of ships, the U.S. Navy’s struc- ture is very slow to change. This can be illustrated by the percentages of total fleet composed of submarines, aircraft carriers, and other surface combatants over the past half-century (putting aside what the optimal percentages should be), shown in Table 2. 44 William Leahy, quoted in Borneman, 2012, p. 105. 45 Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, quoted in Borneman, 2012, p. 105. 46 So confident was Mitchell that he declined to conduct the test against the old USS Iowa, as the (equally confident) Navy had offered. Technological Change 151 Since 1960, there has been a lot of modernization but practically no change in the structure of the U.S. fleet. Requirements have changed radically from early in the Cold War until now; but fleet composition has not budged, even with the disappearance of the rival superpower. Moreover, despite the growing threat to surface warships, their share of the total fleet has actually increased. As another illustration, the United States commissioned 10 bat- tleships from 1941 to 1944, 20 years after their vulnerability to aerial bombing was demonstrated. Of these, some were scrapped a few years later, some were turned into memorials, and some were retired and returned to brief service years later. “By the time the Iowa-class giants [battleships] slid down the ways, the aircraft carrier had established its dominance as the navy’s principal capital ship.”47 While there are many factors that explain such rigid ratios and anomalies, the fact remains that the U.S. Navy changes its structure at a nearly imperceptible pace, despite changes, often dramatic, in the world around it. The signifi- cance of these observations is that improvements in anti-naval capabili- ties require an ability to change that is uncharacteristic of established sea powers and their navies. 47 Borneman, 2012, p. 486.

While it would take much longer for China to become a traditional high-seas power— as it took the United States, Japan, and Germany roughly 20 years— the pace at which the Chinese are applying the technology, skills, and operating concepts to threaten U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific is faster. As a result, even if the U.S. Navy were now to move with uncharacteristic speed in the direction proposed here, American sea power in the Western Pacific will come under pressure at a critical time in Sino-U.S., East Asian, and world affairs. Conclusions In sum, current technological trends affecting sea power in the West- ern Pacific are unfavorable to the United States. Chinese targeting capabilities are progressing more rapidly than U.S. responses. While the United States remains generally superior in its mastery of informa- tion technology for both commercial and military uses, the Sino-U.S. gap has been shrinking and will keep shrinking. In applying this tech- nology, the Chinese have an easier problem to solve in targeting U.S. forces than the United States has in trying to stem the growing vul- nerability of its surface fleet. Moreover, the core of U.S. sea power, the large carrier, does not exploit the networking revolution and may be a casualty of the targeting revolution. While China can further its targeting advantages through steady enhancements, the United States must make a big move to render Chinese targeting ineffective: toward distributed, diverse, and elusive strike forces of submarines, drones, and small surface platforms. Air- Sea Battle can help by providing counter-targeting; but it could be destabilizing, and it does not fundamentally solve the problem of the vulnerability of surface ships, on which U.S. strike power depends. Even then, if the U.S. Navy decided soon on its next big move, implementation would take decades, especially since surface forces are still useful and survivable in the rest of the world. At best, being real- istic, the Navy will gradually shift from a vulnerable to a survivable Technological Change 153 strike posture in the Pacific—much slower than Chinese anti-surface improvements. Meanwhile, cyber-war—at which both the United States and China are gaining proficiency—will work more to the operational disadvantage of the United States than of China, though this will become more balanced as the Chinese come to rely more on C4ISR for long-range targeting and coordination of more distributed forces. Moreover, targeting capabilities may eventually progress to the point that even more distributed, diverse, and numerous U.S. strike platforms will become vulnerable. Thus, technology does not offer the United States a permanent way out of its Western Pacific predicament. Whatever the long term holds, the near-to-medium term could be especially critical for the United States. As Sino-American relations and East Asian affairs enter a period of heightened uncertainty, Chi- nese operational-military advantages could unsettle Japan and other important regional states, encourage Chinese risk-taking, and create the appearance, at least, that the expansion of Chinese power comes at the expense of the United States. Once again, East Asia is too important for U.S. interests to allow it to become a Chinese sphere of influence by withdrawing U.S. power or leaving it vulnerable. This raises the question of whether there are “political” solutions to the problem of the entanglement of U.S. and Chinese sea power in a region vital to both. For that, we need to revisit our historical cases and also analyze the effects, challenges, and oppor- tunities presented by the convergence of Chinese and U.S. interests in maritime security as a consequence of globalization. A final note about the impact of technology: It may be that the information revolution, especially the targeting revolution as it plays out at sea, will make sea denial easier and sea control harder. Perhaps all surface vessels—for war as well as for trade—will become (are becom- ing?) vulnerable. This consideration also points toward the possibil- ity of, and need for, cooperative maritime security, even between the established and rising sea power, which the next chapter will explore. 155 Chapter Five Regional Maritime Security “Aim to be statesmen as well as seamen.” —A. T. Mahan1 Mahan Versus Mullen If concentrated surface power was Mahan’s prescription, competitive great-power politics was his premise. The preceding chapter indicates that concentrated surface power has been overtaken by the information revolution. This chapter explores whether the premise of great-power competition necessarily remains valid. Recall that Mahan was a son of the century of Darwin and Bismarck, of ambitious nation-states pitted against one another, strength on strength. The race for possessions and resources— imperialism—globalized their competition. Industrialization both expanded sea-borne trade and furnished the resources to build strong modern navies to protect or disrupt that trade. Common interests in trade were subordinate to mercantilist impulses, whereby one state’s success was thought to come at the expense of the success of others. In such a climate, the only assurance of maritime security was inde- pendent national sea power (sea control), which could also be used to degrade the maritime security of others (sea denial). Because the fittest power, Britain, could dominate weaker ones—Holland, Spain, Russia, and France—superiority at sea meant dominance at sea. Therefore, emerging powers that depended on trade and aspired to be imperial powers—America, Germany, and Japan—had not only to become sea powers but also to challenge if not confront the established sea power. 1 Alfred T. Mahan, Naval Strategy, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991, p. 21. 156 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Mahan’s ideas were informed by what he observed of British sea power and, in turn, applied by Americans, Germans, and Japanese to moti- vate and guide dramatic naval expansion. A century-plus later, another American naval officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, while serving as Chief of Naval Operations, offered a fundamentally different idea in the fundamentally different world he observed. The integration of the world economy in the late 20th cen- tury caused another burst of international trade, 90 percent of which is by sea. As global markets and global industries formed, economic inter- dependence has deepened. In these conditions, the health of national economies depends more than ever on the health of the world economy in which they are a part. So the success of one power correlates with the success of other powers, not their failure. More and more nations are joining the mainstream of economic development, trade, and inter- dependence. There is a greater awareness of common interests in the efficient and safe trade of materials, food, fuels, and goods. While contemporary sea powers—the United States, above all— have the means to disrupt the trade of others, economic integration has made it self-defeating to do so. More plausible threats now come from those few states and many non-state actors who would threaten or abuse the expansion of trade: pirates, terrorists, and traffickers in drugs, weapons of mass destruction, and human beings. In addition, resources located in and under the oceans are in growing demand to maintain economic health in the advanced North and nourish rapid growth in the developing South. Finally, with coastal populations expanding rapidly and under growing danger of disasters and rising sea levels, natural maritime threats have grown along with human threats. For these reasons, there is growing support for the idea that the seas are “commons” in need of joint stewardship and security by the states and enterprises that use them for good purposes. The main steward of the commons, naturally, would be the United States, sole superpower and dominant sea power. But unlike Britain’s unilateral command of the seas in the 19th century, the United States will lead a multilateral approach. With the Cold War behind it, the United States has steadily reduced its fleet. As more of the world’s seas need more security, as a result of globalization and expanded trade, Regional Maritime Security 157 the United States cannot afford to perform in the 21st century the role Great Britain played in the 19th. Whereas sea power is an impor- tant aspect of American power now, it was the foundation of British power then. (Even at that, recall that, by the beginning of the 20th century, domestic economic demands were threatening the affordabil- ity of Britain continuing to “rule the waves.”) The number of ships in the U.S. Navy of 2000 was one-third that of the Royal Navy of 1900. With climbing capital costs and operating expenses (e.g., fuel), odds are against the U.S. Navy expanding. In these circumstances, Mullen’s idea was a simple one: All like- minded nations with a requirement for maritime security should become members of a global coalition.2 The United States should orga- nize and lead a “Thousand-Ship Navy”—officially, the “Global Mari- time Partnership Initiative”—consisting of warships, coast guards, tankers, freighters, and all other flagged vessels that could assist in monitoring and policing the world’s waters. Advanced information technology would network participating fleets and vessels in what some have referred to as a “global” or “post-modern” navy.3 In Mullen’s words: Imagine [a] fleet operating with the navies . . . of a host of other nations, fully netted and interoperable. They could be anywhere the national and international political leadership wanted them to be . . . ready to go at a moment’s notice. Not just a force to wage war, but a force to wage peace as well.4 While the rhetoric of the Thousand-Ship Navy has cooled off and the terminology has changed—new leaders like new slogans—the basic 2 The Mullen initiative was criticized in conservative and traditional naval circles as naïve at best and a smokescreen to cover the poor stewardship that allowed the U.S. Navy to shrink. 3 Richard A. Bitzinger, “Recent Developments in Naval and Maritime Modernization in the Asia-Pacific: Implications for Regional Security,” in Saunders et al., eds., 2011, p. 38. 4 Mullen, 2005. 158 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific idea continues to affect not only the U.S. Navy but many others, including in the Western Pacific.5 Regional partnerships are forming in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, mostly at U.S. encouragement. Their purposes range from protection of littoral waters (off West Africa) to counter-drug patrolling (in the Caribbean) to WMD interdiction and choke-point security (the Strait of Malacca). Even as the U.S. Navy maintains its blue-water supremacy, despite declining fleet size, it is developing its green-water capabilities with the Littoral Combat Ship and new high- speed vessels to facilitate working with partners. Although the U.S. Global Maritime Partnership Initiative was motivated by the general problem of maritime security, the cause of cooperation got a big boost with the spread of terrorism, the rise of piracy, and several huge coastal natural disasters in the first decade of the 21st century. Even the recruiting slogan of today’s U.S. Navy—“A Global Force for Good”—implies a preference for engagement and cooperation over naval warfare (albeit with a reminder of U.S. power and reach). Cynics might say that the U.S. Navy fashioned the idea of American-led coop- erative maritime security to justify maintaining and modernizing the fleet as it became clear that it has no serious opponent. But the under- lying premise—too much ocean, too many choke-points, too many threats, too few navy ships—is incontestable when considering the vital importance of oceanic trade to the world and U.S. economies. Lately, the prospect of warfare from and on the sea has returned, especially in Middle East and East Asian waters of strategic impor- tance. U.S. defense strategy concentrates increasingly on major mili- tary contingencies that could place heavy demands on naval forces for traditional missions: sea control, sea denial, and strike. In particular, the growing anti-naval and naval capabilities of China in the West- ern Pacific and Iran in the Persian Gulf command the top attention of the U.S. government, not just the Navy. Because the United States does not anticipate large-scale land-warfare with Iran, much less with China, maritime war-fighting capabilities, such as for sea-based strike, 5 See, for example, Chris Rahman, The Global Maritime Partnership Initiative: Implications for the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Department of Defence, 2008. Regional Maritime Security 159 are considered key. Hence, Mullen’s maritime partnership now com- petes with Mahan-like (or Mahan-lite?) sea power as the basis for naval planning, fleet architecture, and politics. While the U.S. Navy is extraordinarily versatile and resourceful, there is no denying that the forces and competencies best suited for maritime cooperation (green-water engagement) are not the same as those most needed for maritime warfare against capable states (blue- water control, denial, and strike). U.S. sea power is thus being pulled in two directions: collaborative and competitive. This naval tug-of-war is putting operational strains on existing forces, intensifying competition over investment, and creating tension between openly sharing informa- tion with many partners and restricting information to only the closest allies. Aggravating the U.S. Navy’s resource dilemma is the fact that it, along with the U.S. Air Force, has been the post-9/11 “bill-payer” of U.S. requirements to expand and operate the Army and Marine Corps for occupation and counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. defense spending has grown enormously since 2001, but funding for naval modernization has been more or less flat. So the need to partner with other navies remains strong. While the Navy tries to reconcile the two, it is best to acknowl- edge that Mullen’s imperative of cooperation largely contradicts Mahan’s inevitability of competition—which helps explain why a fleet optimized for the latter is not optimal for the former.6 Therefore, the validity of the underlying theories needs to be examined. Has mutual responsibility for the commons replaced the drive for advantage? Is there more to the idea of partnership than a situational need to make up for the post–Cold War contraction of the U.S. Navy in the absence of a rival sea power? And, for this study, is there some way the United States and China can snatch the promise of maritime partnership from the jaws of sea-power confrontation? 6 To be fair to Mullen and other uniformed advocates of cooperative maritime security, they have not argued that the United States could or should relinquish its position as the world’s dominant sea power in order to pursue multilateral solutions, or that multilateral solutions were necessitated by U.S. inability to remain the dominant sea power. Rather, the idea is that being the dominant sea power allows the United States to lead multilateral solutions. 160 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific If we are indeed in for a change in the basic premise of sea power, the main reason would be that globalization is making cooperative maritime security more attractive and even compelling. But why would globalization favor cooperation over confrontation at sea? This is a legitimate question: After all, economic interdependence did not pre- vent naval rivalry or, for that matter, world war a century ago. More to the point at hand, why would the common economic interests of China and the United States, including secure trade, foster maritime cooperation when such an approach was not pursued by Great Britain and Germany, also major trading partners when they became rival sea powers? The answer is complex but worth examining. First, it can be argued that although economic interdependence did not prevent the great-power politics and antagonism that led to World War I, it should have. World War I was a tragic triumph of jeal- ousy, hubris, and maneuvering over the modernizing and presumed moderating effects of increasingly interconnected economies. Sover- eigns made win-or-lose calculations that had lose-lose consequences for their societies. While some powers paid a higher price than others for World War I, losses suffered by “winners” were also staggering (enough to nurture British and French appeasement of Hitler). Moreover, the automaticity built into pre-war alliances and interlocking pledges of support in the event of war—later seen as regrettable—left decision- makers with little space or time to manage a cascade of crises that led to war despite their inhibitions. Had European statesmen under- stood how long and devastating the War would be, even for winners, they just might have exercised better control over their mechanistic alignments, military planning triggers, and optimistic generals. That German leaders, for example, did not foresee how war would turn ben- eficial economic cooperation into ruinous economic punishment is not a reason to expect leaders today to be as myopic. Likewise, that British leaders saw no alternative but to deny Germany’s maritime-security interests does not mean that no alternative to sea-power rivalry exists today—or, for that matter, existed then. In this regard, and second, it is evident that today’s Chinese and American leaders do appreciate that conflict could inflict great eco- nomic harm, all the more so because of Sino-U.S. interdependence. Regional Maritime Security 161 When crises have occurred (e.g., over Taiwan or U.S. surveillance patrols near China), one or both capitals have acted judiciously. Such care by each power toward the other, despite divergent interests in the region, is not only because of doubts about the course and outcome of military conflict but also because both economies could suffer tremen- dously regardless. Thus, the fact that the Chinese and American econo- mies are coupled and largely share the same fate, in war as in peace, is a major inhibition on great-power behavior.7 Conversely, if Sino-U.S. war were to occur, it could be because of the same sort of miscalcula- tion or conceit that befell European leaders a century ago. Third, the nature and workings of economic integration under conditions of Europe prior to World War I are different in kind than those of globalization.8 The former involved choices at the margin to acquire raw materials and goods from nations where a comparative advantage in producing them existed. Although there was significant international investment, trade was largely replaceable and reversible, albeit at considerable cost. Under today’s conditions of an integrated world economy, interdependence is becoming organic: Markets for goods, services, capital, finance, technology, management, distribu- tion, production operations, infrastructure, and equity are increasingly global and unified. Movements through these markets are continuous, swift, and resistant to national control. Market-driven value chains— research, development, componentry, sub-systems, systems, services— do not respect sovereign jurisdictions or preferences. This is structur- ally different than interacting national economies. If the breakdown of international trade and investment due to war and protectionism harmed all national economies during World War I and the Depres- sion, the damage from the collapse of today’s global economy would be incalculable. 7 Arguably, the prospect of “mutual assured economic destruction” (a term coined by Jim Dobbins) is playing in the Sino-American case the role mutual assured nuclear destruction played in the Soviet-American case. (See Dobbins et al., 2011.) 8 See Raymond Vernon’s Sovereignty at Bay: The Multinational Spread of U.S. Enterprises for a powerful analysis of why and how economic interdependence under conditions of “global- ization” is more constraining on nations than the interdependence among European nations prior to World War I. 162 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Globalization does not merely connect such economies as those of the United States and China, it mixes and melds them. It not only leaves sovereigns with diminished control but also vests in them a shared vital interest in sustaining and protecting their common economy. One aspect of this interest is the security of the seas on which the bulk of the commerce of the increasingly common world economy takes place. This does not guarantee that powers will not compete at sea. Indeed, growing maritime rivalry and tension in East Asia is proof that they will. Although certain aspects of Mahan’s teachings now seem quaint, his premise that relative sea power matters still stands. Yet, globaliza- tion means that cooperative maritime security stands a better chance of overcoming rivalry today than it did, say, in the Anglo-German case of 1890–1914. Maritime Security and East Asia What does this trade-off between competitive and cooperative sea power imply for the Western Pacific today and in the future? In a nut- shell, Sino-U.S. maritime cooperation could, under certain conditions, serve U.S. security interests, sustain U.S. influence, bolster confidence and stability, reduce risks of conflict, and foster wider Sino-U.S. coop- eration in this critical and uncertain region. Moreover, it could serve Chinese interests better than competition or confrontation at sea with the United States (though, as we will see, the Chinese might disagree). To review: The United States can and should capitalize on its cur- rent military-technological advantages; however, it cannot count on those advantages to maintain sea control and thus protect its interests in the Western Pacific. Air-Sea Battle could be destabilizing and will not preserve the survivability of U.S. surface naval-strike forces, e.g., carriers, unless China’s anti-naval kill-chain is preemptively attacked and largely destroyed. The United States can and should begin to shift from reliance on a traditional surface fleet to a more distributed, elu- sive, diverse, and survivable version of sea power. Yet, such revolution- ary change, though technologically feasible, is unrealistic politically and institutionally. Moreover, while it could take China decades to Regional Maritime Security 163 build a first-tier blue-water navy, it can achieve a measure of sea denial with anti-naval capabilities much sooner. In the face of this challenge to U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific, the option of strengthening deterrence by relying increasingly on the threat of escalation involves growing risks for the United States. Thus, the United States is in a strategic predicament: It cannot let China create a prejudicial sphere of influence in this important region; yet, the sea power on which its access, influence, and security depend will become increasingly vulner- able and tenuous. More generally, technological trends are making sea control (assuring access) harder and sea denial (interrupting access) easier. Capabilities to target and strike surface vessels from above (missiles) or below (submarines) will steadily undermine maritime security for both the United States and China, along with other nations that depend on sea-borne trade and free navigation. The growing vulnerability of surface fleets and shipping in general could undercut Mahan’s premise that powerful states that depend on trade are preordained to compete. In time, all states, including the United States and China, should have an interest in preventing attacks on increasingly vulnerable surface ves- sels. For now, the Chinese are placing their bets on anti-naval and other A2AD capabilities to neutralize the U.S. strike threat they perceive. Yet, the targeting technologies that “go around, come around.” By the time China can build and operate a genuine blue-water navy, the result will be at risk. Given the costs and the prospective vulnerability of sur- face fleets, China’s civilian leaders, if not necessarily its military leaders, should be at least as concerned as their American counterparts about the prospect of sea denial. At some point, because of growing vulner- abilities, common interest in maritime security could outweigh com- petitive instincts. A contest between Mahan’s theory of competition and Mullen’s appeal for cooperation is already evident in East Asia. With the growth of Chinese anti-naval and naval capabilities, as already detailed, U.S. sea power is being contested. At the same time, non-state threats, illicit trafficking, resource disputes, and risky incidents-at-sea call for cooper- ative security among all states with a stake and capabilities in the West- ern Pacific. In fact, the idea of cooperative maritime security in the 164 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Western Pacific is starting to gather interest, especially among China’s Southeast Asian neighbors and the United States.9 If and as such coop- eration develops in the region, the key question will be whether it includes or is instead aligned against China. The United States should leave that choice to China, though it should try to encourage the Chi- nese to participate. The possibility of Sino-American maritime partnership depends heavily on other states of the region, for they will have a voice and role. As China has expanded and extended its military capabilities, its Asian neighbors have responded by improving theirs.10 While navies else- where are barely being maintained, East Asian nations, especially allies and partners of the United States, are building some of the world’s most advanced:11 • Australia has undergone a transformation in defense concepts and capabilities, from static continental defense to power-projection missions stressing expeditionary forces, mobility, precision strike, jointness, and networking. The Royal Australian Navy’s mod- ernization is now a national priority, with more and better sur- face combatants, submarines, missile-defense ships, amphibious- assault ships, and, tying them together, advanced C4ISR. The Australian and U.S. navies are working closely together opera- tionally and in sharing sophisticated technology. • Japan is in a period of naval expansion, coinciding with a general toughening of security policy owing to concerns about Chinese power in the region and American commitment to the region. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force “has greatly increased its expeditionary capabilities, firepower, and C4ISR [and] is now larger than the British Royal Navy.”12 In addition to acquiring 9 Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia are pursuing partnering. 10 East Asian concerns about growing Chinese power and assertiveness have been com- pounded by creeping doubts about American steadfastness, especially during its post-9/11 decade-long preoccupation with violent Islamism in other regions. 11 See Bitzinger, 2011. 12 Bitzinger, 2011. Regional Maritime Security 165 new surface combatants, it is emphasizing advanced submarines, high-speed logistics ships, missile-defense ships, and amphibious ships. Though still mainly defensive in mission, Japanese naval forces will increasingly provide a critical “shield” while the U.S. Navy provides the “spear” in combined operations. Reacting to China’s expanding sea-power strategy, the latest Japanese Defense White Paper warns that Japan will not be passive.13 (The Japanese also express doubts about whether the PLA and PLAN are under firm political control.) • While maintaining ground and air forces capable of defeating North Korea’s decaying conventional forces, South Korea has begun to expand and improve its naval forces for missions beyond the Peninsula. The Republic of Korea Navy is graduating from coastal defense to an all-purpose oceangoing fleet, with advanced submarines, surface combatants (with anti-ship and land-attack cruise missiles), and amphibious ships. While seeking to reduce its naval dependence on the United States, South Korea has in fact moved even closer as a result of North Korean maritime prov- ocations. • Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam are all improving their navies, though at different rates and with different priorities. Singapore’s navy, though small, is becoming one of the world’s most advanced and benefits from a comparatively large ($9 bil- lion) defense budget. The requirement to protect sea approaches and regional check-points is being met by increasingly advanced and networked platforms. Indonesia is improving its green-water capabilities (for reasons the map would suggest). As the PLAN becomes more threatening in the South China Sea, naval coop- eration between these states and the United States has grown. • India is in the midst of modernizing its large navy. It has a full assortment of surface combatants, including aircraft carriers, and is expanding and upgrading its submarine force. Though becom- ing more powerful, the Indian navy is concerned mainly with a 13 “Tokyo Seeks to Expand Defense Against China,” Wall Street Journal, July 12, 2012, p. 14. 166 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific “constabulary role” in the Indian Ocean (on which 90 percent of its trade moves). At the same time, China and India clearly keep an eye on one another’s growing sea power as each develops its own. The United States has good relations with all these countries. Even with those that are not formal allies or historical friends—India and Vietnam, for instance—U.S. security cooperation is expanding, mainly because of overlapping concerns about China. Bilateral coop- eration encompasses and in some cases prominently features naval collaboration, ranging from the sharing of sensitive technology and operational information (in the cases of Japan, South Korea, and Aus- tralia) to support for improvement of indigenous capabilities. Among the ways the United States could bolster the contribution of the secu- rity partners to deterrence and defense in the region is to enhance their anti-naval capabilities, e.g., land- or ship-based missiles, in order to raise the costs of Chinese force projection in the same way China is raising the costs of U.S. force projection in the region. Although naval/anti-naval technology trends are unfavorable to U.S. sea power in East Asia, the improved capabilities of key states that look to the United States for leadership can be a major geo-strategic asset vis-à-vis China’s growing power. This assumes, of course, that the United States retains their trust by maintaining its power and back- ing its friends in the region when China attempts to coerce them. It also assumes that the American statesmen and military leaders will be skillful enough to strengthen and expand U.S. security relationships in a way that incentivizes Chinese moderation rather than Chinese hos- tility. At the same time, the United States cannot fail to support and receive support from its allies and partners out of fear that China will disapprove. Although there is a regional preference for U.S. power and tenta- tive multilateral cooperation, the United States has no Western Pacific alliance like NATO—and no prospect for one—on which to organize a maritime alliance. China exhibits neither the revolutionary zealotry nor the expansionist drive that the Soviet Union had (in its prime) and that made NATO a requirement in Europe. Moreover, while the Soviet Regional Maritime Security 167 Union was economically and politically completely isolated from West- ern Europe, China is an inseparable part of East Asia—economically, culturally, and demographically. Barring a burst of Chinese aggressive- ness, a U.S.-led NATO-like structure for East Asia is neither advisable nor feasible. Nevertheless, with growing regional naval capabilities and concern about China, it might be possible for the United States to institutionalize multilateral maritime security—an East Asian mari- time partnership—involving the countries mentioned above and most others. Generally, the United States has found that its Global Mari- time Partnership Initiative has branched into regional endeavors. This comes as no surprise, given that most nations’ maritime interests are more local or regional than global. Because, again, East Asia is a vir- tual archipelago—with some of the world’s most important and inter- dependent economies spanning some of the world’s most important seas—it could be argued that no region has a greater need for a mul- tilateral approach to maritime security. Moreover, because the region’s main seafaring nations are prosperous and have competent navies, it is only reasonable that they should do their fair share in collectively securing waters that are at least as important to them as to the United States. Of course, the idea of creating an East Asia maritime security partnership raises the question of its relation to China. The argument for excluding China is that its own naval and anti-naval capabilities and activities are the principal threats that would prompt its neigh- bors to join the United States in multilateral maritime security. By this reasoning, such a maritime security grouping would be a naval alli- ance against China. However, aligning the region against China could result in economic protectionism, accelerated Chinese anti-access efforts, increased risk of conflict, and diminished maritime security. Moreover, while China’s neighbors are anxious about China’s capabili- ties and conduct, especially at sea, it is doubtful that they would want to organize against it, with or without the United States. The argument for including China is twofold. First, it would allay Chinese suspicion that the true goals of the United States in the region are China’s encirclement and containment. Second, with China 168 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific being such an important trading partner of all the prospective par- ticipants in such a regional grouping, its exclusion from an attempt to secure regional trade would be anomalous and unproductive. Unlike the Soviet Union’s isolation to Europe, China is an integral part of the region and its economy. Security of regional sea-borne trade and secu- rity of sea-borne trade with China are completely entangled. Under the right conditions, including China in a multilateral East Asian maritime partnership could have a salutary effect on security at sea, on regional security in general, and on U.S. interests. Better to bring inside than leave outside the rising power with capacities to either improve or degrade maritime security. More generally, better to increase China’s stake in regional arrangements than to cement its iso- lation and cause it to become revisionist. Assuming that China would be invited to join it, the question then arises as to what threat, if not China, would motivate the forma- tion of the grouping. As already noted, the Mullen idea addressed both non-state threats to maritime security and dangerous or harmful sea trafficking by states and non-states. Apart from such external threats, an East Asian maritime partnership including China would constitute a sort of collective security arrangement—one with a circumscribed purpose and scope: to provide maritime security. Generally speaking, collective security is different in kind than a security alliance in that it includes all states in a given geographic domain, whether friendly or not. It is undergirded by an understanding that all participating states will refrain from force and other aggressive conduct. Further, it is dis- ciplined by a corresponding understanding—at least an implication— that the participants will organize and may act against any state that violates the collective security, even if that state had acceded to the grouping. In effect, a collective security arrangement can be trans- formed into an alliance against any wayward participant.14 14 The idea of collective security is an old one. Cardinal Richelieu proposed one for Europe in 1629, elements of which were included in the Treaty of Westphalia, in which all European nation-states joined in pledging to respect each other’s sovereignty and security. The League of Nations and the United Nations had elements of collective security, though the former had no teeth and the latter permits a veto. Regional Maritime Security 169 In the case of East Asia, a comprehensive collective security arrangement would be practically impossible to form under current conditions. For one thing, China would oppose absolutely any implica- tion that the Taiwan problem is a matter of international security and any attempt to limit its options, including the use of force. Yet this does not preclude an agreement focused on the avoidance of force in inter- national waters and, importantly, in disputed waters. While states with claims would resist any arrangement that would weaken those claims, they would be expected to affirm the widely accepted norm that dis- putes should not be settled by force. Along this line, the United States could propose—others in the region would of course need to agree—that China be invited and urged to join a maritime security partnership provided certain criteria are met, not only by China but by all participants. The matter of crite- ria thus becomes dispositive.15 While the United States and its partners would want to facilitate China’s involvement, they would also want to ensure that the goals of regional maritime security are served. To this end, all states wishing to join an East Asian maritime partnership, including the two great powers, might be expected to agree • to settle maritime territorial and resource disputes peacefully, consensually, and through international legal norms and means • not to use force against commercial and other civilian shipping engaged in peacetime trade and other peaceful activities • that the United States and other countries not located in the region have as much right of access to East Asian waters as any country of the region • to institute information-sharing, crisis consultations, confidence- building measures, joint exercises, and joint operations • to take appropriate joint action against non-state actors or states that violate these norms. 15 In the trade field, the U.S.-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership has made Chinese participa- tion possible but set such a high bar for eligibility that the Chinese regard it as a U.S. scheme to exclude China from arrangements that will increase U.S. benefits from East Asia’s eco- nomic dynamism. This is not the way the United States would want the Chinese to interpret a regional maritime security proposal. 170 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Such undertakings are consistent with established international norms, including peaceful dispute settlement, protection from attack of non-combatants, and freedom of navigation in international waters. Nevertheless, there is benefit in reiterating them in this particular regional setting. Moreover, it could be beneficial to reinforce these norms with practical cooperative measures and with agreement to cooperate against those that flout them. The Chinese would be especially wary of any provision prejudi- cial to their claims—indeed, their insistence—that certain islands (in some cases, little more than rocks) in the South China and East China Seas are theirs, based on historical possession. The positions of China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, and Indonesia regarding the South China Sea are exceedingly complex and seemingly irreconcil- able; and those of China, Taiwan, and Japan in the East China Sea are nearly so. Resolution of these disputes should not be a precondition of forming or joining an East Asian maritime partnership. Indeed, so complicated and unclear are the merits of the welter of claims, espe- cially in the South China Sea, that making their resolution a precondi- tion of regional maritime partnership would mount to deferring this idea indefinitely. If any state—whether a U.S. ally or China—sought American endorsement of its legal position in return for its support for an East Asian maritime partnership, the United States should decline (as it now declines to take sides). It would be essential to show China both that such a partnership will not be used against it and that it cannot be used by them against other claimants. Even such circumscribed purposes could be difficult to fulfill, because one party’s failure to contest another’s military or economic activities may be prejudicial to its legal case. Nonetheless, precisely because the scramble for islands, waters, and resources in East Asian waters is already harmful to both economic development and security, a general pledge to act peacefully and cooperatively ought to be a crite- rion of a regional collective maritime security regime.16 16 The idea of a code of conduct for the South China Sea has garnered interest from time to time. This is not to be confused with a definitive settlement of the disputes themselves. One of the main impediments to progress even toward a general code of conduct is Chinese insis- Regional Maritime Security 171 The Chinese could be attracted to an assurance that participating states would not attack its commercial shipping, since this would give it some confidence that its access to the oceans of the region and the world would not be cut off, especially by the United States. Of course, they would be unlikely to rely absolutely on such an assurance and so would presumably continue to expand China’s naval power. For its part, the United States would have to consider whether a pledge not to attack commercial shipping would forfeit an important option. How- ever, as the study of international law and the history of warfare show, what nations do when at war is constrained by a different set of norms than the standards they observe in peacetime. The United States does not currently claim the right to attack commercial shipping engaged in peacetime, peaceful activity. A sincere invitation to join on such terms would leave China with the choice of whether to enhance maritime security cooperatively or else risk the partnership becoming an anti-China naval alliance. There are at least three possible results: China could decline and reject the grouping as anti-Chinese; it could join but then fail to adhere to the criteria; or it could accept the criteria, join, and become a valued part- ner. The United States should aim for the third possibility. Of course, gaining Chinese acceptance would be a tall order. Knowing as they do regional and U.S. attitudes about the growth of China’s power, the Chinese will be instinctively suspicious that the strategic motivation behind the initiative is to constrain China’s use of that power. More- over, in surveying the prospective membership, the Chinese will surely notice that the most important members are either U.S. allies or draw- ing closer to the United States, which would imply that China could be as regularly opposed inside the collectivity as it would by remain- ing outside. Finally, even if Chinese political and business leaders saw advantages in joining, the PLA would see more cons than pros, and it is not clear that the civilian government is prepared to overrule the mili- tary. The history of Sino-U.S. military-to-military engagement is not tence that arrangements be worked out bilaterally, which would of course work to China’s advantage and exclude the United States and other external actors and organizations. 172 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific encouraging, but neither does it suggest that the pursuit of maritime cooperation is bound to be fruitless. Sino-American Security Cooperation: Rocky Path or Barren Soil Four decades of U.S. efforts to engage China in military and security cooperation can best be described as disappointing, except when the Chinese saw important concrete gains to be had. Sino-U.S. rapproche- ment, starting with Nixon’s visit to China, led to significant military contacts, arms sales, intelligence sharing, and other forms of coopera- tion. When the object of that cooperation, the Soviet bloc, collapsed in 1989, the enthusiasm on both sides was dampened. That same year, the attack by Chinese security forces on peaceful pro-democracy dem- onstrators in Tiananmen Square caused the United States to break off such activities. Since then, the United States has tried repeatedly and earnestly to create channels of communication on security matters in hopes of reducing mistrust, avoiding miscalculation, and preventing mistakes (e.g., incidents at sea). While naval topics and navy-to-navy contacts are only a part of the wider U.S. approach, they are obviously important because of the growing overlap of Chinese and American sea power in the same East Asian waters. The main modalities have been visits and meetings of leaders, defense officials, and officers. But the United States has also promoted warship port-calls and operational cooperation. The only notable instance of maritime cooperation has occurred far from the region, countering Somali pirates. Generally speaking, the Chinese attitude toward security coop- eration has been hesitant, ambivalent, and conditional. After agreeing to contacts, the Chinese then suspend them when faced with what they deem American effrontery, e.g., by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and sup- port for Chinese dissidents or alleged separatists (e.g., the Dalai Lama). American officials and observers now wonder whether the main effect of U.S. efforts to engage Chinese counterparts has been to hand the Regional Maritime Security 173 Chinese leverage on other issues in the relationship.17 On the whole, senior U.S. officers have reason to feel that they have gone the extra mile to engage China, only to be frustrated. The PLA Navy has been among the organizations least interested and involved in the on-again/off-again contacts that do occur. Remi- niscent of German and Japanese admirals of old, Chinese naval leaders have been especially outspoken about China’s maritime ambitions and prerogatives. When China has made provocative moves in the East China Sea and South China Sea, or has reacted strongly to what it per- ceives as provocations by others, the PLAN is the agent, if not the mas- termind. Thus, the Chinese military service that is most likely to cause a confrontation with American sea power in the Western Pacific, and arguably the most important to engage, has been the least forthcoming and most obstreperous. Because the Chinese Navy’s plans and pro- grams depend on regarding the U.S. Navy as an enemy of and threat to China, its interest is not in engaging in maritime cooperation but rather in foiling it. Like the German admirals in the late 19th century, Chinese admirals rest their case on the intention of the established sea power to deny their country its rightful access. This suggests that mari- time security could be among the least conducive areas for cooperation. What, then, would make one think that collaboration in mari- time security has any chance of success? Clearly, it will not happen without innovative U.S. leadership. In particular, the United States should shape conditions by pursuing an East Asian maritime part- nership with or without China. This would provide the United States with leverage it now lacks. The goal, once again, is Chinese involve- ment, which would address maritime security and help sustain U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. If the Chinese elected to remain apart, despite a sincere offer to participate, this would give the United States and its other partners all the more reason to view China as a potentially unhelpful or threatening actor in regional maritime security. Herein lies the main reason why the Chinese could be hesitant to reject categorically participating in a maritime collective-security regime: fear of regional isolation. Even as China’s military capabili- 17 O’Rourke, 2011. 174 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ties have grown—and before the United States signaled in 2012 the renewal of its commitment to East Asia—key states of the region have become wary of the former and edged closer to the latter. This has led to the paradoxical possibility of China becoming both more powerful and more isolated. It is hard to believe that China’s political leaders and economic elites regard this as optimal. The mixed reaction of the Chinese to the 2012 U.S. strategic pivot to East Asia could be indicative of how they see the tension between their objectives and pitfalls in the region. American China-watchers have diagnosed that reaction this way:18 • Official Chinese comments were low-key, low-level, and muted. Quasi-official, military, media, and think-tank opinions were generally more critical and more pointed. • Foreign Ministry spokespersons stressed U.S. assurances of friendly intentions and acceptance of China’s rise, as well as China’s hope that closer cooperation would result from a rein- vigoration of U.S. interests in the region. • Three factors that help explain the ambivalent and cautious Chinese official reaction are (a) an aversion to roiling relations with the United States on the eve of China’s leadership succession; (b) a belief that long-term trends are in China’s favor, so it should remain calm; and (c) fear of isolation in the region. This last observation is especially noteworthy here. The Chinese— at least some Chinese—believe that the country’s increased forcefulness in recent years has caused the region’s other important states to seek the shelter of U.S. security links. U.S. relations have strengthened with South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, and others—even Burma. Meanwhile, North Korea has become less an ally than a liability—a growing one, at that. Astute Chinese analysts, and probably the Foreign Ministry, realize that the U.S. pivot is largely 18 See Michael D. Swaine, “Chinese Leadership and Elite Responses to the U.S. Pacific Pivot,” China Leadership Monitor, No. 38, Summer 2012; Bonnie Glazer and Brittany Billingsley, “U.S. Pivot to Asia Leaves China Off Balance,” Comparative Connections: A Tri- annual E-Journal on East Asian Bilateral Relations, January 2012. Regional Maritime Security 175 a response to regional anxiety brought on by China itself, and thus embraced by virtually the entire region. For China to react with hos- tility to the pivot and toward the United States would validate and reinforce the regional concerns that led to the pivot in the first place. As one U.S. expert observes: “A number of Chinese analysts argue that China should bear some responsibility for the resurgence of U.S. influ- ence and power around its periphery.”19 This insight into the worries of the Chinese is confirmed by how emphatically they warn against U.S. attempts at dividing the region, which is Chinese code for isolating China. In fact, China’s own con- duct has had more to do with its isolation than American conduct has, given the U.S. post-9/11 preoccupations in the Middle East and South Asia. It follows that China’s opposition to U.S. policies that respond to regional security concerns could increase, not reduce, its isolation. This consideration is unlikely to weigh enough to offset Chinese hos- tility toward U.S. moves, especially military enhancements, potentially threatening to China. Seen in this light, if all important states in the region welcomed a U.S. multilateral maritime-security plan, if such an initiative was not militarily threatening, if the United States expressed a sincere and strong interest in China’s involvement, and if the Chinese knew they had no veto, then they might be hesitant to reject it lest doing so add to their isolation. As David Shlapak of RAND has reminded the author, the Chi- nese already expect most important East Asian states to seek close ties with the United States, if they do not already have them. Regional con- cerns about China are an inevitable result of China’s growing power— a price that must be paid in order to protect and advance China’s legiti- mate interests now that China, at long last, has the means. By this reasoning, the Chinese already discount the possibility of further isola- tion, thus mooting the political disadvantage of refusing to participate in collective maritime security. Maybe so; however, there are hints that not all Chinese see it this way, as noted above. Moreover, why give the Americans and their allies another opportunity to align the region against China when an opportunity to reduce China’s isolation pres- 19 Glazer and Billingsley, 2012, p. 4. 176 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ents itself? Of course, this assumes that the Chinese see an invitation to participate as honest and non-prejudicial. Even if the Chinese see risks in refusing regional maritime secu- rity cooperation, they would suspect a Trojan Horse (or Sea Horse?) aimed at shoring up the political foundation for U.S. military presence and alliances surrounding China. While professing to want good rela- tions with the United States and to accept the United States as a Pacific power, they feel threatened both by U.S. military capabilities and by U.S. alliances, old and new.20 But as long as the U.S. initiative was cast as a way of involving China in regional security, not embarrassing China, those Chinese most concerned about isolation (e.g., diplomats) might prevail over those who reflexively oppose U.S. forces, relation- ships, and policies in the region (e.g., PLA brass). More likely, the Chinese would be divided over the propositions advanced here. In a classic damned-if-you-do/damned-if-you-don’t bind, they would not want to give legitimacy to U.S. leadership and sea power in East Asia, yet they would not want to give the Americans an opening to organize most of East Asia against them at sea. The Chinese might lobby their neighbors to rebuff the American plan; but in view of regional attitudes about Chinese maritime ambitions, they would not likely succeed. The approach would only work if U.S. civilian leaders appealed to their Chinese counterparts—both political and economic elites—in the interest of common maritime security. U.S. naval and other mili- tary leaders should of course present the idea in the most forthcoming way they can to their Chinese counterparts. But American diplomacy on this should avoid handing the PLA a veto (if it does not already have one on such a matter). British statesmen did not reach out whole- heartedly to their German counterparts to head off a naval rivalry, leav- ing it to intermediaries to test the waters, so to speak. In that case, not only did the British admiralty enjoy great political influence, but the commitment to sea-power dominance was engrained 20 For the latest and an excellent version of the view that China is essentially defensive and feels threatened, see Andrew Nathan and Andrew Scobell, “How China Sees America,” For- eign Affairs, September/October 2012. Regional Maritime Security 177 in national consciousness and policy. British politicians and industri- alists saw the world and the need to block Germany more or less the same as the Royal Navy did. Their German counterparts, especially Kaiser Wilhelm, were no less deferential to their own admirals. Com- paratively, U.S. political leaders are not beholden to “naval interests.” Moreover, U.S. naval leaders such as Mullen are on record favoring collective maritime security, including with China. Because regional maritime cooperation, with or without China, would not diminish or replace U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific but rather help to sus- tain it, the U.S. Navy should support this initiative. Whether China’s leaders are as taken with the logic of adversarial sea power as Imperial Germany’s were is less clear—but worth testing. The United States has recently raised its sights and sought to broaden the scope for Sino-American security dialogue to encompass increasingly difficult regional, nuclear, space, cyber, and maritime mat- ters. In this context, the United States could introduce at the highest political levels the idea of Sino-American maritime partnership. This alone will not bring the Chinese along. What could do so is confront- ing Chinese leaders with the prospects of self-exclusion from regional partnership. Whether they could bring along the PLA and PLAN is unclear. In this regard, one possible straw in the wind is a reported recent agreement between PACOM and the PLAN to discuss logistics coop- eration in cases of cooperative missions to combat piracy and provide humanitarian relief in the event of natural disasters.21 Obviously, the Chinese have more to gain than their American counterparts in practi- cal terms. Moreover, this is a far cry from general agreement on coop- erative maritime security. Still, it suggests that navy-to-navy collabora- tion is not taboo for the Chinese. In no case can the United States mortgage its ability to defend its interests, its allies, its forces, freedom of the seas, and commercial ship- ping throughout the region. Cooperation with the region’s capable sea- faring states would be advantageous for the United States in any case— 21 See Donna Miles, “U.S., China to Consider Sharing Resources During Joint Missions,” Armed Forces Press Service, October 12, 2012. 178 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific whether one adheres to the view of Mahan, Mullen, or both. Indeed, East Asian maritime partnership would become the new framework in which U.S. sea power would remain in the region. Moreover, whether China participated or not, the United States should retain and mod- ernize its naval capabilities for war-fighting, along the lines recom- mended in the preceding chapter. Of course, China would be no more likely than the United States to treat cooperative maritime security as an alternative to hard sea power. Indeed, any suggestion from the United States, or from Chinese proponents, that cooperation would obviate the need for investment in Chinese anti-naval and naval capabilities would likely backfire. By the same token, the United States should not expect East Asian mari- time partnership to eliminate the vulnerability problem and should, as already noted, proceed with measures to update its naval capabili- ties. Indeed, Chinese leaders might be more receptive to a coopera- tive approach if the United States was seen to be reinvigorating its sea power in the Western Pacific. Moreover, regional maritime coopera- tion, as envisioned here, would not limit U.S. options in the event of war. All the same, if multilateral maritime security is pursued, and China elects to join, the risks of confrontation, miscalculation, inci- dents, and escalation should be more manageable than otherwise. The practicalities of cooperation at sea should make clashes at sea less likely, even if the parties’ capabilities are unaffected. As long as the United States does not treat cooperation as an alternative to hard sea power, this is a chance to advance its regional interests, protect its security interests, and add another dimension to the sort of Sino-American partnership it generally wants. Conclusion Sea power has long defined the U.S. commitment to East Asia, in war and peace. But it is not the only instrument of U.S. influence. Equally important are U.S. security relationships with old allies and new part- ners. The United States can build on these relationships to counter Regional Maritime Security 179 Chinese aggression, should it occur, or, better yet, to persuade China to participate in cooperative maritime security. China’s increased military power and assertiveness are having two strategic effects in the region. As explained in previous chapters, Chi- nese A2AD capabilities, especially anti-naval targeting and strike sys- tems, are making exposed U.S. forces, e.g., aircraft carriers, vulnerable. The other effect of China’s growing military power, thus far, is the clamoring of its neighbors for U.S. re-commitment and steady engage- ment. These two effects are related in that awareness of the vulner- ability of U.S. forces compounds unease in the region about China’s advantages. The United States can insist all it wants that it will main- tain its strong force presence in the region, but if the survivability of those forces in the event of war is in doubt, U.S. influence will wane as China’s power waxes. The preceding chapter proposed a way for the United States to escape its strategic predicament in East Asia by shifting toward a more distributed, more diverse, more elusive, less observable, and less kinetic sea-based posture. But it also acknowledged that the U.S. Navy would take many years if not decades to transform its concentrated surface fleet. As a consequence, the vulnerability problem will get worse before it gets better. Though this does mean a spike in the probability of war with China, it also means that the region could become unstable, that maritime security could suffer, that regional states could lose confi- dence in the United States, and that a Chinese sphere of influence could develop. Even if its technological options could take decades to imple- ment, the United States has political options that it could take without delay. It can organize cooperative regional maritime security. Its intent should not be to isolate China, which would be difficult and could make the Chinese more antagonistic and determined to target U.S. forces. Rather, the United States, with the support of its regional part- ners, should endeavor to include China in collective maritime security. As the “price of admission,” China would have to accept restraints on threats to maritime security, obligations to settle disputes peacefully and consensually, and de facto acceptance of the legitimacy of U.S. sea power in the Western Pacific. 180 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Success would depend heavily on convincing the Chinese that (a) regional maritime cooperation will proceed in any case and (b) their participation in it is honestly sought. Enticing the Chinese to join such an initiative may be a long shot, at least at first. Yet, the benefits of success would be great enough to justify trying despite the odds. The United States and the region would be better off organizing naval cooperation even without China than they otherwise would be. While U.S. diplomats would likely warn of the danger of alienating the Chi- nese, they are skilled enough to package and present this approach in a way that welcomes China. After all, while the criteria described above are not ideal from the Chinese standpoint—indeed, would be objectionable—they are totally consistent with accepted norms regard- ing the seas. The United States has repeatedly urged China to become a “responsible stakeholder” in the international system. Inviting China to be a founding and key member of a new East Asian maritime secu- rity system would further that American goal. Recalling the Anglo-German case, it may be that strategic consid- erations would dissuade the United States from proposing cooperative maritime security or China from accepting it. Like Great Britain before World War I, America today might reject any constraint on the use of its sea dominance. Like Imperial Germany, China might conclude that only the end of its rival’s dominance would satisfy its strategic need for world access. Perhaps Mahan’s belief that sea powers were destined to compete is as true in the 21st century as it was in the 19th. If so, the United States and China will intensify a costly and potentially danger- ous struggle for advantage at the other’s expense. Although East Asian maritime partnership would not put limits on capabilities or foreclose options in the event of war, it could build confidence and show that there is room for two sea powers in the Western Pacific. 181 Chapter Six Conclusions and Recommendations “Naval strategy is as necessary in peace as in war.” —A. T. Mahan1 The Need for American Initiative It is worth considering the Sino-American case in the framework used in Chapter Two to assess historical cases. This facilitates both a com- parison with those cases and a “net assessment” of the risks and oppor- tunities for American sea power in the Western Pacific. Table 3 thus presents the three historical comparisons shown in Table 1, along with a summary of the current Sino-U.S. case. What does this reveal? First, China and the United States are as reliant on oceanic trade as the great sea-power rivals of old. Like 19th- century Germany, Japan, and the United States itself, 21st-century China will be impelled to oppose a sea-denial strategy of the established power. Though currently well behind the United States in the capacity to achieve sea power, China has the economic, industrial, and techno- logical potential to mount a strong challenge in the Western Pacific. Developing in phases like that of earlier challengers, Chinese sea power began with coastal defense, is being extended to drive threats beyond striking distance of its territory, and will soon encompass Chinese terri- torial claims in resource-rich adjacent seas. Chinese sea power takes the form of anti-naval capabilities—power of the seas if not upon the seas. Whether or not China will become a full-fledged global sea power is unclear and, for now, less important than its intentions in the Western 1 Alfred T. Mahan, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, p. 89, quoted in Hattendorf, 1991. 182 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific Table 3 Comparison of Sino-U.S. Sea-Power Rivalry with Historical Cases Great Britain (GB) and the United States (US) Great Britain and Imperial Germany (IG) The United States and Imperial Japan (IJ) The United States and China Reliance on sea- borne trade GB: High US: Medium (and growing) GB: High IG: Medium (and growing) US: Medium IJ: High US: High China: High Bilateral economic interdependence High Medium Low High Relative economic and industrial capacity and potential GB: High US: High (and growing) GB: High IG: High (and growing) US: High IJ: Medium US: High China: High (and growing) Naval technology, skill, and experience GB: High US: Medium (and growing) GB: High IG: Medium (and growing) US: High IJ: High US: High China: Medium (and growing) Conflicting national interests, including contested spheres of influence Low Medium High Mixed (medium regionally, low globally) Potential for cooperative maritime security High Medium (not pursued) Low Medium Political influence of naval interests GB: High US: High GB: High IG: High US: Medium IJ: High US: Medium China: Medium Outcome Accommodation, cooperation, alliance Contributed to antagonism and likelihood of war Primary cause and instruments of war Competition or cooperation? Conclusions and Recommendations 183 Pacific. Even if the Chinese do not choose to build a full-fledged blue- water fleet—which would be vulnerable to U.S. targeting—they will at least follow through on current efforts to hold U.S. sea power at risk in the Western Pacific. What does this analytic framework suggest about how an estab- lished sea power and rising sea power can achieve cooperation instead of competition and confrontation? For one thing, the absence of strong economic interdependence and convergence of other interests, as in the Japanese-U.S. case, is inauspicious. In addition, when the rising power lacks the potential to compete with or successfully confront the established one, the established one has less incentive to accommodate and cooperate with the rising one. Imperial Japan, for all its strengths, did not have the industrial scale or economic model to challenge the United States if the United States chose to oppose it, which it did. In sharp contrast, the British knew they could not prevail against a deter- mined American challenge. Moreover, because British and American interests were increasingly convergent and their economies strongly linked, British leaders determined that accommodating and eventu- ally cooperating with U.S. sea power was better than the alternative. In contrast, the British did not see Germany as too formidable to oppose, yet they did see German strategy in Europe and beyond as threatening to Britain’s core interests. So they opted to compete and confront, and they never offered cooperation. China’s scale and industrial-technological potential is such that the United States cannot afford to be cocky about sea-power rivalry in the Western Pacific. Moreover, Chinese and American economic and security interests are in general compatible globally, and this includes the security of oceanic trade. This means there is some potential for maritime security cooperation along the lines suggested here. It is in the interests of the established power to offer this and of the rising power to accept that offer—if rationality and statesmanship prevail. It could take decades for China to marshal the requisite skills, experience, and doctrine to become an authentic sea power, as it took Germany, Japan, and the United States, all of which were highly devel- oped countries. But the Chinese threat to U.S. sea power is coming much faster. Current technology, which China is readily acquiring and 184 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific applying, can improve Chinese targeting more than it can improve U.S. survivability. The United States and China are like Great Britain and the United States in the late 19th century, but also like Great Britain and Germany in the same age. Great Britain’s interests in the Western Hemisphere did not warrant rivalry with rising U.S. sea power. Though it ended peacefully and in mutual benefit, the Anglo-American case is not the model for today because the United States cannot allow China an East Asian equivalent of the Monroe Doctrine. Assuming American inter- ests dictate remaining a power in the Western Pacific, as this entire study does, the Anglo-German case is more pertinent because British interests in Europe demanded that Germany’s challenge be met—thus the challenge to American and Chinese statesmanship. As in the Anglo-German case, Chinese and American interests are more compatible globally than regionally—that is, near China. Likewise, China and the United States have a high degree of economic interdependence and a common interest in secure trade, as did Great Britain and Germany. Yet these factors did not prevent sea-power rivalry between Great Britain and Germany—and so far are not pre- venting sea-power rivalry between China and the United States. Naval politics in the Sino-American case are not what they were in the Anglo-German case, when political leaders in both capitals were sold not just on the need for sea power but on the imperative of compe- tition. This led to a failure to pursue, or even to consider, a cooperative approach to maritime security. Today’s U.S. and Chinese navies lack the political clout that the British and German navies had at the height of their rivalry. Moreover, the U.S. Navy has expressed an interest in cooperative maritime security in general and with the Chinese Navy in particular. The voice of the Chinese admirals could be critical in determin- ing the interaction of Chinese and American sea power in the Western Pacific. They are framing the case for Chinese sea power not as a naval requirement but as a national requirement (just as Mahan proposed), and they are gung-ho to establish Chinese sea denial in the region. With challenging U.S. sea power and controlling maritime resources in the region among China’s highest national priorities, the Chinese Navy Conclusions and Recommendations 185 could become very influential, like the Imperial German and Imperial Japanese navies were at a similar juncture. Also like the German and Japanese cases, Chinese civilian control of the military, including the navy, appears to be weaker now than at any time during communist rule.2 Even at the political level, the Sino-American case likely will not be resolved as harmoniously as the Anglo-American one was. Again, the United States cannot accept a Chinese sphere of influence as Great Britain accepted an American one. However, China and the United States need not follow the course of Britain and Germany—to arms race, confrontation, and conflict. It depends on whether American statesmen, including those in naval uniforms, react to China in a more creative and less rigid way than British leaders reacted to Germany— by pursuing collective maritime security. The United States cannot count on Chinese acceptance of an East Asia maritime partnership. Indeed, it seems like a long shot, especially with the PLAN’s probable opposition. Yet, if the United States pro- ceeds with such a partnership, it will find itself at the very least with most states of the region organized multilaterally under its leadership to strengthen maritime security. Even without Chinese accession, such an outcome would provide a durable and flexible new political and operating framework for American sea power in the Western Pacific. This approach would capitalize on the most important political advan- tages the United States has: allies and others in the region that look to it for leadership. It is not clear how long this advantage will last if the United States does not seize the initiative. Regional maritime partnership would not, however, spare U.S. sea power from China’s growing anti-naval capabilities, which will undoubtedly grow regardless of how the United States and its part- 2 Evidence of a loosening of Chinese political control of the military includes weak over- sight over cyber-war and ASAT plans, the conduct of operations leading to international incidents, perfunctory civilian direction of the state’s Military Commission, and the surprise test-flight of a new Chinese stealth aircraft during a visit to China by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. The underlying reasons include the lack of military service on the part of China’s more recent civilian leaders and their willingness, since the mid-1990s, to allow the PLA more autonomy in return for removing itself from the commercial businesses. 186 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific ners organize. Therefore, the United States should capitalize on its other important advantage, while it too lasts: technological superior- ity. The United States clings to its traditional surface posture at its own operational risk and ultimate political risk. The aircraft carrier will remain the core of U.S. naval capabilities globally for decades to come, given its benefits and the absence of advanced anti-naval threats in other regions. But in the Western Pacific, less vulnerable, diverse, elusive, networked strike platforms need to be developed and intro- duced expeditiously. The Future of Sea Power Sea power has come to be synonymous with the theory—and the person—of Alfred Thayer Mahan. However, history will show that it entered a post-Mahan stage at the start of the 21st century, owing to a related pair of developments usually called the information revolution and globalization. For reasons explained in prior chapters, and summa- rized in Table 4, several—not all—tenets of sea power as conceived by Mahan (and as practiced by the sea powers of his era) are being upset. If these changes—or at least trends in these directions—are cor- rect, they have significant implications for American and Chinese sea power. It will be difficult for the United States to maintain sea control in the Western Pacific, defined as the ability to use the seas in defiance of the will of others. But neither will the Chinese be able to achieve sea control. If it is true that technology is making sea denial easier and sea control harder, and also true that economic integration is reinforc- ing mutual interest in maritime security, it follows that the United States and China—this century’s established power and rising power, respectively—should seek a way to cooperate instead of compete at sea. Like rising powers of the late 19th century—Germany, Japan, and the United States—China may feel its position is too weak to cooperate with the stronger power. The United States does indeed have current advantages: allies and technology. But they may not last. The Conclusions and Recommendations 187 time is right for American initiatives to secure the seas for itself and others—including China, if it is willing to join. One implication of current technological trends is that sea control will become more difficult and sea denial easier in the Western Pacific, for now, and ultimately elsewhere. Another is that sea power can be achieved, and threatened, in a growing number of ways, owing to tech- nological change. Future sea powers are unlikely to favor old-fashioned surface fleets, when submarines, drones, missiles, land-based air-strike forces, and cyber-war capabilities offer more effective and less vulner- able ways of exerting power at sea. In closing, this book’s conclusion is different than its hypoth- esis. As China challenges American sea power in the Western Pacific— a rising power refusing to defer to an established one—it was worth considering how theory and history illuminated the case at hand. As it turns out, technology has made naval rivalry—fleet for fleet—a thing of the past. Global sensing and pin-point long-range targeting Table 4 The Future of Mahan’s Ideas Mahan The Future Because of the importance of trade, becoming a sea power is necessary to becoming and remaining a world power. Still generally true. Because world politics are inherently competitive, rising sea powers must confront established sea powers. Cooperative maritime security can offer an alternative to sea-power competition and confrontation. Sea denial requires sea control. Sea denial can be achieved without having sea control. Offense is paramount; defense is important only to enable offense. Technology will favor anti-naval capabilities. Sea power is power upon the sea. Power upon the sea does not assure sea power. The essential core of sea power is the offensive strength of the surface fleet. Sea power will have many components: surface-based missiles, manned and unmanned naval aviation, submarines, land-based aviation, land-based missiles, ASAT, and cyber-war. 188 Sea Power and American Interests in the Western Pacific are making the surface of the seas potentially less safe for navies and shipping alike. Fortuitously, globalization increases the incentives for nations, even world powers, to seek security for their ships, their trade, and their economies in partnership instead of as adversaries. How the United States responds to the growing Chinese threat to its sea power in the Western Pacific could determine whether the dan- gers of technology or the promise of cooperation will prevail. It could also determine whether the United States can find a modus vivendi in this vital and contested region, clearing the way to the sort of global partnership that would serve U.S. interests. 189 References Bitzinger, Richard A., “Recent Developments in Naval and Maritime Modernization in the Asia-Pacific: Implications for Regional Security,” in Phillip Saunders, Christopher Yung, Michael Swaine, and Andrew Nien-Dzu Yang, eds., The Chinese Navy: Expanding Capabilities, Evolving Roles, Washington, D.C.: National Defense University Press, 2011, pp. 23–40.

NATIONAL DEFENSE RESEARCH INSTITUTE www.rand.org RR-151-OSD $23.95 China sees American sea power in East Asian waters as threatening to itself, its regional aspirations, and possibly its global access. So it is mounting a challenge with anti-ship missiles, submarines, and a growing ﬂeet of its own. However, the United States will not relinquish its sea power, which it sees as needed to maintain its inﬂuence and stability, despite China’s growing might, in this vital region. History shows that rivalries between established and rising sea powers tend to end badly, to wit: Britain versus Germany before World War I and the United States versus Japan before World War II. In this case, technology that enables the targeting of surface ships, especially aircraft carriers, favors the challenger, China. The United States can exploit technology more boldly than it has previously to make its sea power less vulnerable by relying more on submarines, drones, and smaller, elusive, widely distributed strike platforms. Yet, such a U.S. strategy could take decades and even then be vulnerable to Chinese cyber-war. Therefore, in parallel with making its sea power more survivable, the United States should propose an alternative to confrontation at sea: East Asian multilateral maritime-security cooperation, with China invited to join. While China might be wary that such a regional arrangement would be designed to contain and constrain it, the alternative of exclusion and isolation could induce China to join. David C.
